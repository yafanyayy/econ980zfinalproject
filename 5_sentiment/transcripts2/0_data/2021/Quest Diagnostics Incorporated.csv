So in a year dominated by the pandemic, Quest brought critical COVID-19 testing to our country and delivered record revenues, earnings and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and the full year 2020. 
The pandemic has tested our nearly 50,000 employees, and they have responded as heroes by developing COVID-19 tests, building test capacity, innovating new testing models with our retail partners, fan sporting, specimens, delivering results and, of course, supporting our customers. 
We finished the year as one of the country's leading providers of COVID-19 testing. I'm very proud of what we have achieved and optimistic about what we can accomplish in 2021. 
So this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Our ongoing role in the COVID-19 pandemic and update you on our noncoded base business. 
And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and our financial outlook for the first half of 2021. 
Well before we get into the details of the quarter and the full year of 2020, we wanted to share our perspective on the new strategy for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic proposed by the new administration. 
We are pleased by the efforts to expand access to testing across the country, especially in the underserved communities where there are known disparities in health care. We support the new administration's approach to controlling the pandemic by expanding the availability of testing supplies, enhancing laboratory testing capacity and ensuring a clarity of messaging about the use of test and insurance coverage. 
We also support the efforts of COVID-19 pandemic testing board and we look forward to addition to details and days of weeks ahead. Now turning to our results. 
Continued high demand for COVID-19 testing, drove our performance throughout the quarter, in the second half of the year. For the fourth quarter, total revenues grew by more than 55% to $3 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 126% on a reported basis to $4.21 and nearly 168% and on an adjusted basis to $4.48. 
For the full year 2020, total revenues grew by more than 22% to $9.44 billion. 
Earnings per share increased by nearly 71% on a reported basis to $10.47 and more than 70% on an adjusted basis to $11.18. 
Cash provided by operations increased by more than 61% to $2 billion. We announced today that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 10.7% to $0.62 per quarter, and this is our tenth increase since 2011. 
Additionally, our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. 
The increased authority is on top of approximately $900 million that was available as of December 31, 2020. 
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong COVID-19 testing volumes. Demand clearly spiked as the virus surged and people got tested in advance of the Holiday gallies we performed an average of 135,000 COVID-19 molecular tests today in the fourth quarter, well below our current capacity. 
We continue to innovate to further expand capacity, reduce turnaround times and gain efficiencies. 
And finally, we are focused on addressing health disparities in the underserved communities through our Quest for health equity initiative. We recently held our first COVID-19 testing event, a obesity in Baptist Church in Holland in conjunction with leading Black Clergy and the United way of New York City. 
Testing is more important than ever as the vaccines roll out over the coming months to get at risk patients into care when their we can still be effective. And to isolate infected individuals. 
We expect 2021 to be another very strong year for Coven testing. Although demand for COVID testing is likely to decline throughout 2021 as more people become accidented and fewer new cases are reported. 
We believe that COVID-19 testing will continue into 2022. Now turning to our base business. Organic volumes recovered rapidly throughout the sum and fall. 
However, the recovery stalled at the end of November and into December due to the surge in COVID-19 infections across the country. 
And Mark will provide and share some more details regarding the trends in our base business later. With that, we continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth to drive operational excellence. 
Let me share some of the highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Our M&A pipeline remains strong, and we achieved our goal to exceed a 2% growth CAGR from acquisitions in our base business over the last 3 years. 
We continue to see increasing interest from our hospital partners about how we can help them with their lab strategy, which includes discussions around both their outreach acquisitions, and professional lab service arrangements. The deals we closed in 2020, particularly the Memorial Herman outreach and macro acquisitions. Position us well to achieve our M&A growth target this year. And we remain confident that this year, we will execute a more similar type of outreach for tuck-in deals in our pipeline. Last year was also a record year for a professional lab services strategy, or PLS. And this is the business to partner with hospitals to help them run their inpatient labs more efficiently. In the fourth quarter, we announced 2 small PLS partnerships with hospital systems in New York and Indiana. And then in December, we announced our largest PLS relationship to date with Hackensack Meridian Health, the largest integrated health network in New Jersey. 
Quest will manage laboratory operations and perform reference testing for 11 aconsortium health hospitals. We also continue to execute our health plan strategy by shifting the dialogue to value-based contracting efforts from the recent past when discussions focused primarily on price. 
We continue to make progress with our new strategic relationship with Aston to improve quality inefficiency and the delivery of laboratory services. 
We're advancing our position with Unitedhealthcare within its preferred lab network and also our building momentum with many of our other national and regional health plan partners. 
Finally, we continue to grow our direct-to-consumer services in the quarter. 
In December, we announced our 0 out-of-pocket QuestDirect COVID-19 testing option. Their servers authors important scheduling a specimen collect you at more than 500 participating Walmart drive through locations. 
And also in the quarter, we saw a number -- saw the deceleration in the number of consumers signing up for MyQuest patient portal. 
Today, roughly 15 million patients have a MyQuest account, an increase of nearly 2 million since October. And recent market research indicates that our brand is strong and has strengthened over the past year with industry-leading Net Promoter Scores. 
We have a strong foundation to accelerate growth in our consumer offerings. The second part of our 2-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We continue to pursue our goal to reduce our cost base by 3% per year. We also see opportunities ahead to drive further productivity gains, and at the same time, enhancing the customer experience. 
Now once again, our Invigorate program delivered approximately $200 million of cost savings in 2020. And we continue to see more opportunities to deliver future efficiency in our cost base. 
Our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey with live on January 4. This is the most highly automated laboratory in our network, and over the course of 2021, we expect to consolidate volumes from Teterboro, Mark, Baltimore and Philadelphia labs to this state of the art facility. Now before turning it over to Mark, I'd like to announce that we plan to update you on our strategy and market overview at our upcoming virtual Investor Day, and it will be held on Thursday, March 11. So stay tuned for more details. Mark?"

In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $3 billion, up nearly 56% versus the prior year.

In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $3 billion, up nearly 56% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 58% and compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services, offset by a modest decline in our base testing revenue. 
Volume mentioned by the number of requisitions, increased 26.8% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 4.5%. The as we highlighted in our 2020 outlook update in mid-December, organic testing volumes ordered in our base business were down mid- to high single digits versus the prior year in October and November. 
The recovery stalled in late November with organic testing volume trends down high single digits versus the prior year in December due to the surge in new infections across the country. 
Additionally, many state and local governments imposed new orders designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. 
Compared to December, organic base volume trends remained relatively steady in January versus our pre pandemic 2019 baseline. 
For the entire fourth quarter, total testing volumes declined roughly 2% versus the prior year and benefited from M&A and UPLS partnerships that began in 2020. 
Excluding M&A and new POS wins, ACE testing volumes declined approximately 8% in Q4 versus the prior year. COVID-19 testing continued to be a meaningful contributor to volumes during the fourth quarter. 
We resulted approximately 12.5 million molecular tests and 1 million serology tests contributing approximately 29% to volume growth in Q4. We exited the fourth quarter averaging approximately 130,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 10,000 serology tests per day. 
Revenue per acquisition increased 25.2% versus the prior year, driven largely by COVID-19 testing. This was partially offset by enterprise headwinds of approximately 1.6% and in the fourth quarter, which includes the impact of PAMA and was in line with our prior expectations. 
Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $795 million or 26.5% of revenues. Compared to $363 million or 18% of revenues last year. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q4 was $860 million or 28.6% of revenues. Compared to $329 million or 17% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by the strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Due to continued high demand for COVID-19 testing. 
Reported EPS was $4.21 in the quarter compared to $1.86 a year ago. 
Adjusted EPS was $4.48 and compared to $1.67 last year. Cash provided by operations was approximately $2 billion for the full year versus $1.24 billion in 2019. 
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we returned approximately $138 million of provider release funds we had received under the Cares Act. 
Our financial position remains very strong. As we announced this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend approximately 10.7% to $0.62 per share, and the Board expanded our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. 
So we now have nearly $2 billion available for future share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases in Q4 and bought back $250 million of company stock during the quarter. 
Turning to guidance. There continues to be a lot of uncertainty around the trajectory of the pandemic and its impact on COVID-19 testing trends as well as further recovery in our base business. Therefore, we are currently providing an outlook for only the first half of 2021 and expect to provide updates as the year progresses. 
Our outlook for the first half of 2021 is as follows: revenue is expected to be between $4.85 billion and $5.15 billion, an increase of approximately 33% to 41% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $5.07 and $6.07 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $5.90 and $6.90. 
The cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $800 million, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million. The demand for and duration of COVID-19 testing as well as the continued recovery in the base business are significant swing factors that remain challenging to forecast. 
With that high degree of uncertainty in mind, please consider the following. Our first half outlook generally assumes a gradual improvement in base testing volumes, but we expect the base business to remain below our pre pandemic 2019 baseline throughout the first half of the year. 
COVID-19 molecular testing volumes averaging roughly 100,000 tests per day in the first half of the year. However, we expect average daily volumes to decline throughout the first half of 2021 and as more people become vaccinated. Therefore, we assume COVID-19 molecular volumes will be lower in the second quarter compared to Q1. COVID-19 serology testing volumes averaging 15,000 tests per day for the first half of 2021, with demand expected to increase modestly throughout the first 2 quarters of the year. 
Given the strength of our financial position and high cash balances, we expect to complete a larger amount of share repurchases in 2021 than we have done historically, while maintaining significant flexibility to execute on our M&A pipeline. 
However, at this point, our EPS ranges only assume enough share repurchases to maintain a stable share count. We expect to share more details about our capital deployment priorities at our upcoming Investor Day in March. 
While we aren't providing a detailed outlook for the full year at this time, I'd like to offer some additional considerations for 2021. 
As a reminder, there will be no Medicare reimbursement cut under PAMA this year given the 1-year delay included in the Cares Act. We expect organic base testing trends to slowly recover throughout the year, with volumes likely approaching a full recovery compared to our 2019 baseline by the end of the year. If the country vaccinates a significant portion of the population by the summer, we would expect a continued decline in COVID-19 molecular testing volumes in the second half of 2021 compared to our expectations for the first half. 
Similarly, demand for COVID-19 serology testing is likely to wane in the back half of the year. Finally, COVID-19 molecular reimbursement is likely to trend lower in 2021 compared to last year. As many of you know, beginning January 1, CMS moved to a new reimbursement model with a rate of $100 for all tests reported within 2 days and $75 for all other results. Several commercial payers have now moved to this new reimbursement model as well. 
Also, while we are encouraged that HHS now plans to extend the public health emergencies throughout 2021. And prospective changes to coven molecular reimbursement are still possible. Furthermore, direct client bill reimbursement for coven testing services remains competitive. I will now turn it back to Steve."

So we are expecting to still do quite well in terms of reimbursement in the near term. We believe we can meet the turnaround times, certainly the threshold that's required to be eligible for the higher rates and then we get paid, obviously, based on the individual tests. 
So we're still thinking in the near-term that our average weighted reimbursement is going to be pretty strong. But we also recognize the reality of the pressure on the industry from all the various payers, especially the commercial payers. 
And so therefore, as we mentioned, throughout the first half of the year, we would expect some reduction in that reimbursement. Not something that would be momentous, but certainly some downward pressure. 
And as we said, the client area is very, very competitive. So there's quite a few labs at this point given the demand that have significant capacity. 
And so therefore, in the coin area that's very, very competitive. In terms of your question, I'm sure you can appreciate, Ralph. But first off, we don't feel we're getting paid excessively for COOPC, we feel like we're being paid appropriately. But even if you could exactly forecast the volume of our COVID testing and forecast the base business over a period of time, which obviously would be nearly impossible. 
I'm not sure that we need to trade-off anything. We're very happy with the relationships that we've built, as Steve mentioned, with the payers. We've moved away from the focus on price and move toward more of a partnership and an alignment around value creation, where they're looking for us to save the money and create value, and a big piece of that is moving more work to us because we're already a very high-value compared to the rest of the industry and possible choices for patients. 
So good question, Ralph. Certainly appreciate it. But for practical and for strategic reasons, because of where we think we are with the payers already with some of these new contracts, is certainly not something that we're looking to pursue right now."

And the reason for that is we want to continue to be prepared in the event that we do have another surge. 
And then secondly, is we want to make sure we really have a capability to meet turnaround times that are expected in the market. And over the last 10 months, obviously, a lot of our testing has been for the clinical purpose and what we believe as we enter the second half and we're having many discussions in this regard, there's going to be a lot more demand for return to work programs with employers, which have been pushed out, as you all know, return to leisure activities, there's a number of of cities that have large tourism bases that are thinking, well, what they need to do to get people back into those venues. And there will be a lot of activity around just return to life. 
And I know that we are still trying to figure that out, and that's going to offer us a lot of opportunity in the future. 
And with that, there's always a covet test, but there's also a number of services we provide, and those are yet to be defined. So we're still trying to understand what that second half opportunity would be.

So there's several ways you could come to the high and low end. So what I would say is they're all based on the 3 major drivers, with most of the change on the base volume recovery and the level of PCR volumes to a lesser extent, serology. So if we don't see a significant falloff from where we stand today in PCR or if it surges up again because of these variants or some other unknown factor. 
Certainly, that would take us to the higher end, combined with -- if the base business also were to continue to recover and not go the opposite direction as coded surged again. 
So there is some negative correlation, obviously, between the two. But if they both move in the same direction that it moves to the higher end. And then for some reason, Co would fell off, markedly, even more than we're planning. And as we talked about, we are planning for a decline over time in this first 6 months at that midpoint. 
And the base business did not show recovery or even potentially took a little bit of a step back for economic or other reasons, and that would take you to the low end. 
But I can't, at this point, provide exact changes in the base and COVID because, obviously, there's multiple ways to get to you the wood. But directionally, that's what [indiscernible] services is our guidance with the midpoint being, as I said, not as recovery, even not full to the first 6 months of the base business and then some step off, but still significant coded testing for the first 6 months with the second quarter being markedly lower in the first quarter."

We seem to see some early indications that there's interest in understanding whether you have the antibodies or not, which might inform patients and physicians around their urgency of getting vaccinated. 
And at the same time, we're bringing out a new capability called quant serology testing. And this will allow physicians and patients to see if, in fact, they do get the spike protein from the vaccines, and we'll be bringing that out of 2 platforms in the next few weeks. 
And this can't help us determine if the vaccine is being effective. So we do believe that there will be some increased demands for serology. And this is on top of what we already do.

So I think the new administration is leveraging what we've done in the past as a country and as an industry, and taking it to the next level. I mean you see the capacity that's out there on the country back a few weeks ago, we were doing about 2 million COVID-19 molecular tests. 
So obviously, up considerably from where we all started last March. But going forward, Jack, I do see that there will be a change beyond the PCR test, as I mentioned earlier, there's going to be greater demand for programs that get to portions of the population that help us get back to work, back to lease our activities get back to life. 
And so we're having a number of dialogues around that. And that will include the role of antigen testing and more rapid testing workflows that allow us to to see if the fact a person that wants to engage and whatever the activity is, is negative and safe for a reasonable period of time to participate. 
So when we get into that world, we'll obviously provide in testing. But as I said earlier, there's a number of services and also it solutions that you need to provide. And like so much in health care, you see one, but we're currently engaged with a number of organizations, a number of municipalities and the number of corporations, what they will be doing in this regard, particularly in the second half. I think the first quarter is outlined in our guidance. 
We're going to start to see improvement as we get into the second quarter. I think the second quarter will be a telling quarter for us all. And we do see a lot of people getting prepared for better manufacturing rates, better position for populations to get back to work-life and leisure activities, and we're going to start to see more of that, and Quest has a significant role in helping in that regard."

As you've seen over the last number of years, we've increased our presence. We have the best access to lives now that we've had in over a decade. And so we are in a very strong footing. And also during the pandemic share that we we're deeply engaged with many of the plans of what they needed to take care of their membership and also their employees. So the relationship has continued to strengthen. 
And as I said in my introductory remarks, and Mark said as well, we're shifting the dialogue away from exclusively price to the value we deliver. And when you go back to what we've talked about in the past around what we bring to the table in terms of our value proposition and loan quality, our service performance, our innovation, all at a very affordable price. We believe our value proposition is really second to none. 
And as I said, in the course of the last year, we've done service, look at our replication in the industry and Net Promoter Scores, and those are quite strong. So when you bring those facts to the table, Jack, our position in terms of working out the forward-looking relationships has provided a much stronger foundation and a better understanding on the other side that we really do deliver a lot more value. So so we're in a good position with our plans. We're in good position with our contracts. We obviously don't provide specific details, but we feel very good about that. 
And also I shared that, we continue to make progress with our United relationship with a fired lab network in the building relationship with Anthem, we're quite encouraged about as well. 
So we feel good about our relationship and the progress we've made, but also the opportunities in front of us to continue to build on what we've been talking about. So Mark, anything you'd like to add there?"

I could tell y",372,"Sure. So Jack, I understand the question and several years ago, I think there was an expectation or people holding their breath every time we extended a contract with a major payer because it would imply some sort of major price concession. I could tell you, this has become largely invisible to you all, unless we talk about it like Anthem, which was really a new contract and brought together a number of states under a single contract as opposed to having different periods of time in which we were negotiating across the Anthem network. 
We just extended with a major commercial payer. You didn't hear about it because there was no price concession. 
And in fact, we made huge headway with this payer I'll tell you, getting them to acknowledge that in the world of PAMA, the whole notion of a discount to the CMS NLA rates no longer will apply going forward. And that, in fact, CMS will be setting the market and that they should feel confident is a market rate that they can feel comfortable and represent to their perspective recurrence members. So really, that's what it's been about as they all want to make sure that they can say, they've got good prices. 
And now you've got an external benchmark you can look to. So we just extended with a very large national. We do have 1 coming up this year. But I can assure you that it's not going to be -- we're not in with major price concessions. We're going to continue to work on the value-based contracting. And with that actually comes good. 
Pricing that we feel represents the market and then these come with upside, whereas we perform, we both share in the benefit of that upside. That's the way we're really contracting over the last couple of years and how we would expect the contract going forward. 
[Audio Gap] 
To avoid having to build patients where historically, we've shared that we get about $0.70 on the dollar and actually get 100% of that payment from the third-party is also a large enhancement to our revenue. In our profitability as well. So that's a factor. I don't want people to forget about. Steve?"

And to Mark's comments, we have seen a few payers here is to look at this model as well. But we're encouraged by the public health and emergency extension through '21. And also just to share, our timeliness of our results are quite good. 
We have met that threshold of 50% of COVID molecular test resulted in less than 2 days. We did that in the last few months. And I'll share that the majority of our testers are resulted in 2 days or less. 
So in my other comments, I did mention that we continue to build capacity because it just gives us a lot more operational flexibility to to meet better turnaround times based upon where the demand is coming from. 
So I think we're progressing well. We're a very good provider of the test. Time is one element and quality and reliability and also the type of testing we have done, our methodology for PCR tests, both on the LDT side, and obviously, the kits are -- some are consistent throughout the industry are really quite strong. 
So if you look at the accuracy and the quality of our testing, people have come to consider us the gold standard. I think that will bode us well going forward as well."

We do get some denials. But certainly, north of 90 was AWR previously. Now we did talk about the fact that we expect that to have some pressure and to reduce over time through the first half. That doesn't mean that it absolutely will. But in our guidance, in the midpoint of that guidance. We do -- we did make an assumption that given the new model with the $75, not just with TMS with commercial payers, we're not going to get paid for 100% of our test at that 100, where we have been done previously, still a large majority, as Steve said, meet that 2-day turnaround time. 
So that will create a little bit of erosion. And then also, I mentioned that there's a lot of capacity and therefore, a very competitive environment in that cost side from the third party."

We felt, even though the pandemic didn't start largely for our business until March. Easiest compare and how to talk about it is 2019 volumes. 
We did have a large growth for the first 2 months of 2020, as we shared at our first nearing call. So that compounds things a little bit on the year-to-year comparison. But yes, we're going to continue to talk about our volume performance relative to 2019 because it's the cleanest compare for the whole year. 
And when we speak to that, I heard it in your question, we are looking at organic growth. And so we spoke of a couple of acquisitions that we closed last year. And in our organic discussions, we're excluding those and any other deals we might do prospectively. 
So it's organic base business we're talking to. And we think the best representation of utilization. So that's why we think it's important.

So the first part is really about acquisition opportunities around hospitals, and you see that we announced a couple of deals last year that were happy we did, and that's going to help us. And we continue to see a nice funnel for for '21 as well. 
And as you all know, hospital volumes have been down through '20, they have recovered for us. However, what we do see is a lot of renewed interest of looking at their lab strategies, which includes acquiring their outreach business and includes professional lab service agreements like we just announced in the fourth quarter. 
That relationship we announced in the fourth quarter with ACAC Meridian Health system is the largest we've ever done. And I could tell you, it took a long time to get there. 
And I believe the prospective reality of what's happening in the health care market this year helped bring that to a conclusion. And I believe that, that will will happen with a number of dialogues we have going on with hospitals right now. So that's 1 piece. 
The second is on other commercial laboratories, yes, you're right. A number of what commercial laboratories have jumped into the COVID testing arena. You see it with all the capacity we've added in the country. However, as that starts to be pulled back and they start to see what the prospects are, given what we're driving as an industry with consolidation with tighter contracts and networks around health plans, we believe that there still will be a catalyst in the marketplace for us to continue to consolidate. 
So yes, there's been a short-term opportunity for a number of labs to take advantage, if you will, the opportunity to provide COVID-19 testing. But as that starts to change as we get through '21, we believe the reality is of what the new world will be with tighter networks, more consolidation will play nicely into our strategy and allow us to acquire more going forward. And obviously, given our cash position and a strong balance sheet, we're in a very nice position to continue to do that. 
And also, Lisa, there's been a lot of discussion around all this additional capacity out there. People have added new systems and potentially does this put then a risk for us that these people are going to get into other businesses outside of Cobia like women's health, we are watching it. And obviously, some hospitals have moved their elective capacity to co bid and we help them with some of the other work. But for other commercial laboratories and hospitals to use that capacity to get into competing with us, by way of example, wound. So that's a long stretch. 
I mean there's a lot to -- a lot more to getting a client to flip over then the lab capacity. You have to have a sales force, have logistics capabilities, you have to do electronic interfaces, you have to work with the physicians. You have to be in contract with the health plans. 
So we are watching it, but at the same time, we're a little a little little cautious in the belief that some of this will have a significant effect at the same time, we're watching it carefully to make sure it doesn't. And we're staying on top of our clients to make sure we serve them well."

At any given point in time, we've got multiple opportunities that we're discussing. I can tell you that none of the potential sellers that we're speaking to right now is getting and expecting to get paid for that PCR bubble. 
So fortunately, I could see a mentality that, hey, my value has gone up dramatically because of COVID testing. But the people we're talking to right now recognize that, that's short term, and that should not be a part of the valuation discussion. And then the -- while PAMA gets a pause this year, there's still some risk. 
But more importantly, as we've mentioned, and I'm sure you've seen, it's not just CMS, but the commercial payers are starting to put pressure on these high hospital outreach rates, recontracting that work that's outside the patients who are in the hospital, either admitted or outpatients. At independent laboratory rates. So it's not -- this pressure is not just coming from Washington. It's coming from the commercial payers as well and from, quite frankly, patients who don't like those high prices when they have a high deductible plan. 
So there's a number of things that are getting the C-suites of large hospital systems with outreach to think about do they really want to be in this business and will just be a good time to monetize. 
And so therefore, I really don't think the pipeline of interest haven't been impacted over the last 12 months negatively."

And our brand is really second to none in our industry. And we coupled that with our service performance. And so we have this strong foundation, coupled with the change in the marketplace. And we do believe there's going to be a continuation of the number of consumers [indiscernible] -- that will engage differently with health care delivery systems and how they engage with the physician, with telehealth. We have a very strong presence with telehealth providers, and we integrated delivery systems that offer the total health option. 
But at the same time, a lot of patients as well and consumers will want to receive the basic health checks and testing online as they buy so much else in their lives.

We worked with Hackensack have demonstrated to them that we can perform the same work they do in their lab at a better cost, better value. And for a system that size, there's significant lab spend. So this is going to be quite impactful and beneficial to them. And we see that as a opportunity, obviously, to also get other clients to get their attention to see, hey, Hackensack, things this will work well. In addition to some of the other hospital systems that we've won over the last couple of years. 
So we're very, very excited about it. It is a large deal. It's the largest deal we've ever done. It will be material to our growth. And we talked a couple of years ago at our Investor Day, and we'll likely give an update on this. 
But we thought we could get more than 100 basis points and somewhere between 100 to 200 basis points growth every year from our POS business. And certainly, this one is a large contributor to that and might even give us an opportunity to exceed that. 
So a very large deal, but we're not going to -- we haven't had historical precedent of calling out the exact revenue, but it will be -- it noticeable and material as we go into 2021 and beyond."

But if we step away from the timing and just think about the margin trajectory, how should we think about core margin trajectory from where they were, let's say, in the fourth quarter? To where they can expand to as utilization comes back to a more normalized level? So again, the question is more about the margin trajectory as it relates to utilization, not about the timing. 
And then my second question is more about sort of market demand. So how do you think about changes in physician behavior patterns, and we're seeing telehealth becoming or integrated into the workflow. So do you think that there's going to be any impact on longer-term lab testing demand curve because of that? I know if the experience is early in the year, could you shed some light on that?"

So Ricky, obviously, the size of the revenue we've generated from coded, which more than offset the base business has materially impacted our margins and expanded them greatly relative to our historical margins. 
So as we progress, and we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but we progress into a future where COO testing is still around for a while. 
As Steve said, we don't expect it to go away completely, certainly by 2022. It's going to be less material to our top line into our margin. 
So where will our base business be? Once we get back to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, I would expect our base business to be slightly higher-margin than it was pre-pandemic because if you look at our Invigorate program, which we continue to drive, even during the pandemic, and you look at the offsets, so the pay for is that we usually talk about, including wage inflation and price erosion, given the pause on PAMA this year and given the fact that we've done really well in other price concessions despite significant increases in our SWD that was warranted during the pandemic as we wanted to reward our employees for their incredible contributions in getting us in up and running, operating well through it and obviously, driving strong company results, when I net all those together, that level of business should be more profitable. 
And then going forward from that, when we get back to the growth that you saw in 2019, and you saw in the first 2 months of 2020 and our ability to leverage that growth, I would expect to see margin expansion on the base business. 
But of course, that will be partially offset for a period of time, as the COVID revenues and margins fall down. 
So longer term, the good news is we were on a good path on growth and margin expansion pre-pandemic, and we'll get back there. 
But for a while, it will be somewhat masked by the COVID decline that's inevitable over the next certainly 18 months or so."

Yes. And a question about physicians, Ricky, we're watching this carefully because we do believe, going back to an earlier question about the consumer activity, that there will be a transition here now going forward with with physicians serving the market in a different way. 
As we said before, about half the physicians have either sold their practices to integrate delivery systems are a strong affiliations with integrated delivery systems, and that will be consistent going forward. 
But the other half of the market, we believe there will be a growing percentage of that portion of positions that are served by telehealth. 
And we have a very strong position with those telehealth providers and that was before the pandemic. And those telehealth providers are not going to work with handfuls of laboratories, will work with a few. And then we'll have a real tight for lab network, as you would expect. And as you would expect, Quest would be one of those options. 
So we feel good about that. Second is you see more consolidation going on in positions, and you see what's happening, particularly with one of the health insurance companies, Optum, acquiring physicians and a number of those physician practices or our customers. You think about that consolidation and think about their role, think about where they add value of bringing all those physicians together, we believe there will be an opportunity for us to work with a consolidator like Optum to provide lab services more broadly and really reduce the variation they have with all their physicians. 
And just one last point to show that this world is moving to a tighter network of lab providers. In the fourth quarter of last year, UnitedHealthcare actually announced the removal of a lot of network benefit for some of their fully insured members. 
And so it's just another example of the major health plan tightening up the network. So we think the physician side will change, and there will be a different way of providing physician services to patients going forward. And that trend, we believe, is a good trend, and we'll provide tailwind for us to consolidate the market."

So it sounds like you don't expect there to be any sort of meaningful impact on your opportunity around consolidation, just even given the dramatically expanded installed basis PCR instruments across the U.S. over the last year. I mean, I would assume that customers do want to monetize those investments to some extent. And just curious what you're seeing in terms of market share shifting outside of maybe over testing that you're seeing already, if that's happening at all? I mean it sounds like everything still remains an opportunity from an M&A perspective and consolidation standpoint. 
And then my second question is just on how should we be thinking about the long-term dynamics as it relates to Co bid testing? It will obviously diminish with this vaccine rollout. But could it evolve into something more similar to like flu testing in future years? And can you remind us of the food testing exposure you do have?"

So as I said earlier, we believe that hospitals we'll be now increasingly looking at their options to become more efficient, given the pressure that pandemics put on many of them. And we're encouraged by the level of discussions we had and the deals we have closed as an example of if this is happening. So we think that's good. 
On the commercial laboratory side, we believe that some have gotten into the COVID testing opportunity. It's provided somewhat of a an opportunity for them to get through this year. 
But as the dust levels and testing volumes go down, the reality of what we talk about pandemic, it doesn't change. And we think there would be many of those that would be looking at their options, and we do believe that cover testing will continue into '22. 
We believe that this will be the virus that we'll have to manage. So it will be more flu-like and something that will be behind us in the end of '21. And it's hard for us to scale at this time what that will be. 
But you should not think that this is going to be a testing opportunity that will go away at the end of this year, but we do believe there will be with us in '22 as well. 
And as far as the flu, we talked about in a prior earnings call that we have offered a combination panel, when a patient presents itself with symptoms, the physician wants to rule out the flu and also COVID. 
And so we have seen that be accepted. But as you all know, the instruments of flu this year is down considerably because of all our behaviors in the United States. So that has changed somewhat. 
Shawn or Mark, you want to add something to food testing in general and exposure to answer the piment point of the question."

And what our expectations for Q2 look like at that point. Because every day, every couple of weeks, every one certainly gives us a better line of sight into expectations. But by -- announced by us seeking and getting approval and announcing $1 billion increase in our authorization. 
Certainly, you correctly are taking that as a signal. And as I said specifically in my prepared remarks, that we're going to do more share buybacks than we have done historically. 
And I'll remind you that our capital allocation strategy, which we have not changed to this point is to give a majority of our free cash flow back to our shareholders through our dividend and our share repurchases, we suspended them for 2020 for a period of time.

So in a year dominated by the pandemic, Quest brought critical COVID-19 testing to our country and delivered record revenues, earnings and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and the full year 2020. 
The pandemic has tested our nearly 50,000 employees, and they have responded as heroes by developing COVID-19 tests, building test capacity, innovating new testing models with our retail partners, transporting specimens, delivering results and, of course, supporting our customers. 
We finished the year as one of the country's leading providers of COVID-19 testing. I'm very proud of what we have achieved and optimistic about what we can accomplish in 2021.
So this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Our ongoing role in the COVID-19 pandemic and update you on our nonCOVID-based business. 
And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and our financial outlook for the first half of 2021. 
Well, before we get into the details of the quarter and the full year of 2020, we wanted to share our perspective on the new strategy for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic proposed by the new administration. 
We are pleased by the efforts to expand access to testing across the country, especially in the underserved communities where there are known disparities in health care. We support the new administration's approach to controlling the pandemic by expanding the availability of testing supplies, enhancing laboratory testing capacity and ensuring a clarity of messaging about the use of test and insurance coverage.
We also support the efforts of COVID-19 pandemic testing board, and we look forward to additional details and days of weeks ahead. Now turning to our results. 
Continued high demand for COVID-19 testing, drove our performance throughout the quarter and the second half of the year. For the fourth quarter, total revenues grew by more than 55% to $3 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 126% on a reported basis to $4.21 and nearly 168% on an adjusted basis to $4.48. 
For the full year 2020, total revenues grew by more than 22% to $9.44 billion. 
Earnings per share increased by nearly 71% on a reported basis to $10.47 and more than 70% on an adjusted basis to $11.18. 
Cash provided by operations increased by more than 61% to $2 billion. We announced today that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 10.7% to $0.62 per quarter, and this is our tenth increase since 2011. 
Additionally, our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. 
The increased authority is on top of the approximately $900 million that was available as of December 31, 2020. 
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong COVID-19 testing volumes. Demand clearly spiked as the virus surged and people got tested in advance of the Holiday calendar. We performed an average of 135,000 COVID-19 molecular tests today in the fourth quarter, well below our current capacity. 
We continue to innovate to further expand capacity, reduce turnaround times and gaining efficiencies. 
And finally, we are focused on addressing health disparities in the underserved communities through our Quest for Health equity initiative. We recently held our first COVID-19 testing event, at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Holland in conjunction with leading Black Clergy and the United way of New York City. 
Testing is more important than ever as the vaccines roll out over the coming months to get at-risk patients into care when they're weak and still be effective, and to isolate infected individuals. 
We expect 2021 to be another very strong year for COVID testing. Although demand for COVID testing is likely to decline throughout 2021 as more people become vaccinated and fewer new cases are reported. 
We believe that COVID-19 testing will continue into 2022. Now turning to our base business. Organic volumes recovered rapidly throughout the summer fall. 
However, the recovery stalled at the end of November and into December due to the surge in COVID-19 infections across the country. 
And Mark will provide and share some more details regarding the trends in our base business later. With that, we continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth and to drive operational excellence. 
Let me share some of the highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Our M&A pipeline remains strong, and we achieved our goal to exceed a 2% growth CAGR from acquisitions in our base business over the last 3 years. 
We continue to see increasing interest from our hospital partners about how we can help them with their lab strategy, which includes discussions around both their outreach acquisitions and professional lab service arrangements. The deals we closed in 2020, particularly the Memorial Herman outreach and MACL acquisitions position us well to achieve our M&A growth target this year. And we remain confident that this year, we will execute a more similar type of outreach for tuck-in deals in our pipeline. Last year was also a record year for our professional lab services strategy or PLS. And this is the business to partner with hospitals to help them run their inpatient labs more efficiently. In the fourth quarter, we announced 2 small PLS partnerships with hospital systems in New York and Indiana. And then in December, we announced our largest PLS relationship to date with Hackensack Meridian Health, the largest integrated health network in New Jersey.
Quest will manage laboratory operations and perform reference testing for 11 Hackensack Meridian Health hospitals. We also continue to execute our health plan strategy by shifting the dialogue to value-based contracting efforts from the recent past when discussions focused primarily on price.
We continue to make progress with our new strategic relationship with Anthem to improve quality inefficiency and the delivery of laboratory services.
We're advancing our position with UnitedHealthcare within its preferred lab network and also are building momentum with many of our other national and regional health plan partners.
Finally, we continue to grow our direct-to-consumer services in the quarter. 
In December, we announced our 0 out-of-pocket QuestDirect COVID-19 testing option. Their servers offers appointment scheduling and specimen collection at more than 500 participating Walmart drive-through locations. 
And also in the quarter, we saw a number -- saw a deceleration in the number of consumers signing up for MyQuest patient portal. 
Today, roughly 15 million patients have a MyQuest account, an increase of nearly 2 million since October. And recent market research indicates that our brand is strong and has strengthened over the past year with industry-leading Net Promoter Scores.
We have a strong foundation to accelerate growth in our consumer offerings. The second part of our 2-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We continue to pursue our goal to reduce our cost base by 3% per year. We also see opportunities ahead to drive further productivity gains, and at the same time, enhancing the customer experience. 
Now once again, our Invigorate program delivered approximately $200 million of cost savings in 2020. And we continue to see more opportunities to deliver future efficiency in our cost base.
Our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey went live on January 4. This is the most highly automated laboratory in our network, and over the course of 2021, we expect to consolidate volumes from Teterboro, Marl, Baltimore and Philadelphia labs to this state of the art facility. Now before turning it over to Mark, I'd like to announce that we plan to update you on our strategy and market overview at our upcoming virtual Investor Day, and it will be held on Thursday, March 11. So stay tuned for more details. Mark?"

In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $3 billion, up nearly 56% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 58% compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services, offset by a modest decline in our base testing revenue.
Volume measured by the number of requisitions, increased 26.8% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 4.5%. As we highlighted in our 2020 outlook update in mid-December, organic testing volumes ordered in our base business were down mid- to high single digits versus the prior year in October and November.
The recovery stalled in late November with organic testing volume trends down high single digits versus the prior year in December due to the surge in new infections across the country.
Additionally, many state and local governments imposed new orders designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
Compared to December, organic base volume trends remained relatively steady in January versus our prepandemic 2019 baseline.
For the entire fourth quarter, total testing volumes declined roughly 2% versus the prior year and benefited from M&A and new PLS partnerships that began in 2020.
Excluding M&A and new PLS wins, base testing volumes declined approximately 8% in Q4 versus the prior year. COVID-19 testing continued to be a meaningful contributor to volumes during the fourth quarter.
We resulted approximately 12.5 million molecular tests and 1 million serology tests contributing approximately 29% to volume growth in Q4. We exited the fourth quarter averaging approximately 130,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 10,000 serology tests per day.
Revenue per acquisition increased 25.2% versus the prior year, driven largely by COVID-19 testing. This was partially offset by enterprise headwinds of approximately 1.6% and in the fourth quarter, which includes the impact of PAMA and was in line with our prior expectations. 
Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $795 million or 26.5% of revenues compared to $363 million or 18% of revenues last year. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q4 was $860 million or 28.6% of revenues compared to $329 million or 17% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by the strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, due to continued high demand for COVID-19 testing. 
Reported EPS was $4.21 in the quarter compared to $1.86 a year ago. 
Adjusted EPS was $4.48 and compared to $1.67 last year. Cash provided by operations was approximately $2 billion for the full year versus $1.24 billion in 2019.
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we returned approximately $138 million of Provider Release Funds we had received under the CARES Act. 
Our financial position remains very strong. As we announced this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend approximately 10.7% to $0.62 per share, and the Board expanded our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. 
So we now have nearly $2 billion available for future share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases in Q4 and bought back $250 million of company stock during the quarter. 
Turning to guidance. There continues to be a lot of uncertainty around the trajectory of the pandemic and its impact on COVID-19 testing trends as well as further recovery in our base business. Therefore, we are currently providing an outlook for only the first half of 2021 and expect to provide updates as the year progresses.
Our outlook for the first half of 2021 is as follows: revenue is expected to be between $4.85 billion and $5.15 billion, an increase of approximately 33% to 41% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $5.07 and $6.07 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $5.90 and $6.90.
Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $800 million, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million. The demand for and duration of COVID-19 testing as well as the continued recovery in the base business are significant swing factors that remain challenging to forecast.
With that high degree of uncertainty in mind, please consider the following. Our first half outlook generally assumes a gradual improvement in base testing volumes, but we expect the base business to remain below our prepandemic 2019 baseline throughout the first half of the year.
COVID-19 molecular testing volumes averaging roughly 100,000 tests per day in the first half of the year. However, we expect average daily volumes to decline throughout the first half of 2021 as more people become vaccinated. Therefore, we assume COVID-19 molecular volumes will be lower in the second quarter compared to Q1. COVID-19 serology testing volumes averaging 15,000 tests per day for the first half of 2021, with demand expected to increase modestly throughout the first 2 quarters of the year.
Given the strength of our financial position and high cash balances, we expect to complete a larger amount of share repurchases in 2021 than we have done historically, while maintaining significant flexibility to execute on our M&A pipeline. 
However, at this point, our EPS ranges only assume enough share repurchases to maintain a stable share count. We expect to share more details about our capital deployment priorities at our upcoming Investor Day in March.
While we aren't providing a detailed outlook for the full year at this time, I'd like to offer some additional considerations for 2021.
As a reminder, there will be no Medicare reimbursement cut under PAMA this year given the 1-year delay included in the CARES Act. We expect organic base testing trends to slowly recover throughout the year, with volumes likely approaching a full recovery compared to our 2019 baseline by the end of the year. If the country vaccinates a significant portion of the population by the summer, we would expect a continued decline in COVID-19 molecular testing volumes in the second half of 2021 compared to our expectations for the first half.
Similarly, demand for COVID-19 serology testing is likely to wane in the back half of the year. Finally, COVID-19 molecular reimbursement is likely to trend lower in 2021 compared to last year. As many of you know, beginning January 1, CMS moved to a new reimbursement model with a rate of $100 for all tests reported within 2 days and $75 for all other results. Several commercial payers have now moved to this new reimbursement model as well. 
Also, while we are encouraged that HHS now plans to extend the public health emergencies throughout 2021, prospective changes to COVID molecular reimbursement are still possible. Furthermore, direct client bill reimbursement for COVID testing services remains competitive. I will now turn it back to Steve."

So we are expecting to still do quite well in terms of reimbursement in the near term. We believe we can meet the turnaround times, certainly the threshold that's required to be eligible for the higher rates and then we get paid, obviously, based on the individual tests.
So we're still thinking in the near term that our average weighted reimbursement is going to be pretty strong. But we also recognize the reality of the pressure on the industry from all the various payers, especially the commercial payers.
And so therefore, as we mentioned, throughout the first half of the year, we would expect some reduction in that reimbursements. Not something that would be momentous, but certainly some downward pressure.
And as we said, the client area is very, very competitive. So there's quite a few labs at this point given the demand that have significant capacity.
And so therefore, in the coronary, that's very, very competitive. In terms of your question, I'm sure you can appreciate, Ralph. But first off, we don't feel we're getting paid excessively for COVID PCR. We feel like we're being paid appropriately. But even if you could exactly forecast the volume of our COVID testing and forecast the base business over a period of time, which obviously would be nearly impossible.
I'm not sure that we need to trade-off anything. We're very happy with the relationships that we've built, as Steve mentioned, with the payers. We've moved away from a focus on price and move toward more of a partnership and an alignment around value creation, where they're looking for us to save the money and create value, and a big piece of that is moving more work to us because we're already a very, a high value compared to the rest of the industry and possible choices for patients. 
So good question, Ralph. Certainly appreciate it. But for practical and for strategic reasons, because of where we think we are with the payers already with some of these new contracts, is certainly not something that we're looking to pursue right now."

And then secondly, is we want to make sure we really have a capability to meet turnaround times that are expected in the market. And over the last 10 months, obviously, a lot of our testing has been for the clinical purpose and what we believe as we enter the second half and we're having many discussions in this regard, there's going to be a lot more demand for return to work programs with employers, which have been pushed out, as you all know, return to leisure activities, there's a number of cities that have large tourism bases that are thinking, well, what they need to do to get people back into those venues. And there will be a lot of activity around just return to life.
And I know that we are still trying to figure that out, and that's going to offer us a lot of opportunity in the future.
And with that, there's always a COVID test, but there's also a number of services we provide, and those are yet to be defined. So we're still trying to understand what that second half opportunity would be. But what we see so far, we will continue to have strong demand, but it may take a different form as we get into the second half and as we go into '22."

So there's several ways you could come to the high end, low end. So what I would say is they're all based on the 3 major drivers, with most of it being on the base volume recovery and the level of PCR volumes to a lesser extent, serology. So if we don't see a significant falloff from where we stand today in PCR, or if it surges up again because of these variants or some other unknown factor, certainly, that would take us to the higher end, combined with -- if the base business also were to continue to recover and not go the opposite direction as COVID surged again. 
So there is some negative correlation, obviously, between the two. But if they both move in the same direction that it moves to the higher end. And then for some reason, COVID fell off, markedly, even more than we're planning. And as we talked about, we are planning for a decline over time in this first 6 months at that midpoint. 
And the base business did not show recovery or even potentially took a little bit of a step back for economic or other reasons, and that would take you to the low end.
But I can't, at this point, provide exact changes in the base and COVID because, obviously, there's multiple ways to get to either one. But directionally, that's what references our guidance with the midpoint being, as I said, a modest recovery, but not full for the first 6 months of the base business and then some step off, but still significant COVID testing for the first 6 months with the second quarter being markedly lower than the first quarter."

So we are -- as I said in my introduction comments, we are one of the leading providers of COVID-19 testing. Second is, it does not include serology and you did ask a question about serology because we do believe there'll be increasing role of serology throughout '21.
We seem to see some early indications that there's interest in understanding whether you have the antibodies or not, which might inform patients and physicians around their urgency of getting vaccinated.
And at the same time, we're bringing out a new capability called quant serology testing. And this will allow physicians and patients to see if, in fact, they do get the spike protein from the vaccines, and we'll be bringing that out of 2 platforms in the next few weeks.
And this can't help us determine if the vaccine is being effective. So we do believe that there will be some increased demands for serology. And this is on top of what we already do. And serology is providing a really important role for our management of the disease, overall surveillance, epidemiology and in measuring the response of what's happening pre and post the vaccinations in broad population. So we believe there's an opportunity in front of us in '21 in that regard."

I mean you see the capacity that's out there on the country back a few weeks ago, we were doing about 2 million COVID-19 molecular tests.
So obviously, up considerably from where we all started last March. But going forward, Jack, I do see that there will be a change beyond the PCR test, as I mentioned earlier. Now there's going to be greater demand for programs that get to portions of the population that help us get back to work, get back to leisure activities, get back to life. 
And so we're having a number of dialogues around that. And that will include the role of antigen testing and more rapid testing workflows that allow us to see if in fact a person that wants to engage and whatever the activity is, is negative and safe for a reasonable period of time to participate. 
So when we get into that world, we'll obviously provide testing. But as I said earlier, there's a number of services and also IT solutions that you need to provide. And like so much in health care, you see one, but we're currently engaged with a number of organizations, a number of municipalities and the number of corporations, and what they will be doing in this regard, particularly in the second half. I think the first quarter is outlined in our guidance.
We're going to start to see improvement as we get into the second quarter. I think the second quarter will be a telling quarter for us all. And we do see a lot of people getting prepared for better manufacturing rates, better position for populations to get back to work-life and leisure activities, and we're going to start to see more of that, and Quest has a significant role in helping in that regard."

And also during the pandemic share that we're deeply engaged with many of the plans of what they needed to take care of their membership and also their employees. So the relationship has continued to strengthen. 
And as I said in my introductory remarks, and Mark said as well, we're shifting the dialogue away from exclusively price to the value we deliver. And when you go back to what we've talked about in the past around what we bring to the table in terms of our value proposition and loan quality, our service performance, our innovation, all at a very affordable price. We believe our value proposition is really second to none.
And as I said, in the course of the last year, we've done service, look at our reputation in the industry and Net Promoter Scores, and those are quite strong.

So Jack, I understand the question and several years ago, I think there was an expectation or people holding their breath every time we extended a contract with a major payer because it would imply some sort of major price concession. I could tell you, this has become largely invisible to you all, unless we talk about it like Anthem, which was really a new contract and brought together a number of states under a single contract as opposed to having different periods of time in which we were negotiating across the Anthem network. 
We just extended with a major commercial payer. You didn't hear about it because there was no price concession. 
And in fact, we made huge headway with this payer, I'll tell you, getting them to acknowledge that in the world of PAMA, the whole notion of a discount to the CMS NLA rates no longer will apply going forward. And that, in fact, CMS will be setting the market and that they should feel confident is a market rate that they can feel comfortable and represent to their perspective or current members. So really, that's what it's been about as they all want to make sure that they can say, they've got good prices. 
And now you've got an external benchmark you can look to. So we just extended with a very large national. We do have one coming up this year. But I can assure you that it's not going to be -- will not come with the major price concessions. We're going to continue to work on the value-based contracting. And with that actually comes good. 
Pricing that we feel represents the market and then these come with upside, whereas we perform, we both share in the benefit of that upside. That's the way we're really contracting over the last couple of years and how we would expect the contract going forward."

There's no guarantee that, that will continue. So -- and not only could they decouple the reimbursement with the PHE, but they could also, like they did January 1st, change the approach. However, at this point, yes, we're assuming the most -- the highest probability is that as long as the PHE continues, CMS will continue to pay us under this new method. 
On commercial, obviously, we're not the only player. And so while we defend and feel like we do a good job of explaining why reimbursement makes sense as we've negotiated some new payment methodologies, including some who wanted to move to the Medicare methodology. We think we've done a good job. But obviously, there are other labs as well. And to the extent that other labs don't do as good a job as we do, there could be additional pressure on us. So that's why it's hard for us to predict exactly where this is going. But certainly, in our mind, we would expect to continue to defend our commercial contracts as well through the PHEs in the same basis for CMS paying us at that rate should apply to the commercial payers as well. I also want to remind everybody that as long as the 0 patient out-of-pocket applies, that is also a huge tailwind for us because to avoid having to bill patients where historically, we've shared that we get about $0.70 on the dollar and actually get 100% of that payment from the third party is also a large enhancement to our revenue and our profitability as well.

So in my other comments, I did mention that we continue to build capacity because it just gives us a lot more operational flexibility to meet better turnaround times based upon where the demand is coming from. 
So I think we're progressing well. We're a very good provider of the test. Time is one element and quality and reliability and also the type of testing we have done, our methodology for PCR tests, both on the LDT side, and obviously, the kits are somewhat consistent throughout the industry are really quite strong.

We do have some client bill customers that are less than $100, and we don't get paid for 100% of the testing, sometimes due to missing data and so on and so forth.
We do get some denials. But certainly, north of $90 was AWR previously. Now we did talk about the fact that we expect that to have some pressure and to reduce over time in the first half. That doesn't mean that it absolutely will. But in our guidance, in the midpoint of that guidance. We do -- we did make an assumption that given the new model with the $75, not just with TMS, with some commercial payers, we're not going to get paid for 100% of our test at that $100, where we have been done previously, still a large majority, as Steve said, meet that 2-day turnaround time.
So that will create a little bit of erosion. And then also, I mentioned that there's a lot of capacity and therefore, a very competitive environment in that client bill arena asides from the third party."

So it depends when you say is it a headwind, it depends on to what you're comparing it. So as we expect the base business to improve. That's a significant margin tailwind versus the prior period because we are -- in any given window of time, a highly fixed cost operation on our base business. And while we took some significant cost actions in the second quarter of last year in response to the significant downturn in our volume, and we've continued to manage our costs very, very tightly to the back half recovery to not get out in front of ourselves. We're not planning on any significant restructuring in the near term with volumes that are down single digits at this point. So our cost structure in the base business is, to some extent, what it is, and we'll add small pieces that are necessary as it recovers. But that growth and recovery in that base business sequentially is a nice tailwind. 
On the other side, as we talked about, expect erosion in our COVID volumes. That creates a headwinds and how those 2 pieces offset each other is hard to predict slightly, if you understood me specifically. But I would, at this point, expect that the COVID reduction more than offsets the base, but at least they do partially offset each other as we move forward. 
And then the other dynamic is obviously reimbursement on the PCR test, and we shared that we expected some pressure on that as we go from the first quarter into the second quarter sequentially and then likely even more so in the back half of the year. So without getting into specifics, those are kind of the things you should -- specific numbers, those are kind of the things you should think about as you think about where our margins certainly go to the first half and then into the second half of 2021."

And we continue to see",574,"Yes. So thanks, Lisa, for the question. So the first part is really about acquisition opportunities around hospitals, and you see that we announced a couple of deals last year that we were happy we did, and that's going to help us. And we continue to see a nice funnel for '21 as well.
And as you all know, hospital volumes have been down through '20. They have recovered for us. However, what we do see is a lot of renewed interest of looking at their lab strategies, which includes acquiring their outreach business and includes professional lab service agreements like we just announced in the fourth quarter. 
That relationship we announced in the fourth quarter with Hackensack Meridian Health system is the largest we've ever done. And I could tell you, it took a long time to get there.
And I believe the prospective reality of what's happening in the health care market this year helped bring that to a conclusion. And I believe that, that will happen with a number of dialogues we have going on with hospitals right now. So that's one piece. 
The second is on other commercial laboratories, yes, you're right. A number of what commercial laboratories that have jumped into the COVID testing arena. You see it with all the capacity we've added in the country. However, as that starts to be pulled back and they start to see what the prospects are, given what we're driving as an industry with consolidation with tighter contracts and networks around health plans, we believe that there still will be a catalyst in the marketplace for us to continue to consolidate. 
So yes, there's been a short-term opportunity for a number of labs to take advantage, if you will, the opportunity to provide COVID-19 testing. But as that starts to change as we get through '21, we believe the reality is of what the new world will be with tighter networks, more consolidation will play nicely into our strategy and allow us to acquire more going forward. And obviously, given our cash position and a strong balance sheet, we're in a very nice position to continue to do that. 
And also, Lisa, there's been a lot of discussion around all this additional capacity out there. We think people have added new systems and potentially does this put then a risk for us that these people are going to get into other businesses outside of COVID like women's health, we are watching it. And obviously, some hospitals have moved their molecular capacity to COVID, and we help them with some of the other work. But for other commercial laboratories and hospitals to use that capacity to get into competing with us, by way of example, wound. So that's a long stretch. 
I mean there's a lot to -- a lot more to getting a client to flip over then the lab capacity. You have to have a sales force, you have to have logistics capabilities, you have to do electronic interfaces, you have to work with the physicians, you have to be in contract with the health plans. 
So we are watching it, but at the same time, we're a little cautious in the belief that some of this will have a significant effect. At the same time, we're watching it carefully to make sure it doesn't. And we're staying on top of our clients to make sure we serve them well."

At any given point in time, we've got multiple opportunities that we're discussing. I can tell you that none of the potential sellers that we're speaking to right now is getting and expecting to get paid for that PCR bubble.
So fortunately, I could see a mentality that, ""Hey, my value has gone up dramatically because of COVID testing."" But the people we're talking to right now recognize that, that's short term, and that should not be a part of the valuation discussion. And then the -- while PAMA gets a pause this year, there's still some risk. 
But more importantly, as we've mentioned, and I'm sure you've seen, it's not just CMS, but the commercial payers are starting to put pressure on these high hospital outreach rates, recontracting that work that's outside the patients who are in the hospital, either admitted or outpatients at independent laboratory rates. So it's not -- this pressure is not just coming from Washington. It's coming from the commercial payers as well and from, quite frankly, patients who don't like those high prices when they have a high deductible plan. 
So there's a number of things that are getting the C-suites of large hospital systems with outreach to think about do they really want to be in this business and will this be a good time to monetize. 
And so therefore, I really don't think the pipeline of interest haven't been impacted over the last 12 months negatively."

We're providing COVID-19 testing through that platform. We're going to look at using it for consumer genetics. And as I said in my introductory comments, the interesting part of the pandemic is brought to the forefront, the strong role of testing in overall health care and the Quest has been out there more than ever, and our brand has been built.
And our brand is really second to none in our industry. And we coupled that with our service performance. And so we have this strong foundation, coupled with the change in the marketplace. And we do believe there's going to be a continuation of the number of consumers that are engaged -- that will engage differently with health care delivery systems and how they engage with the physician, with telehealth. We have a very strong presence with telehealth providers and with integrated delivery systems that offer the telehealth option. 
But at the same time, a lot of patients as well and consumers will want to receive their basic health checks and testing online as they buy so much else in their lives.

And then my second question is more about sort of market demand.

So Ricky, obviously, the size of the revenue we've generated from COVID, which more than offset the base business has materially impacted our margins and expanded them greatly relative to our historical margins. 
So as we progress, and we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but we progress into a future where COVID testing is still around for a while. 
As Steve said, we don't expect it to go away completely, certainly by 2022. It's going to be less material to our top line and to our margin. 
So where will our base business be? Once we get back to the prepandemic levels of 2019, I would expect our base business to be slightly higher margin than it was prepandemic because if you look at our Invigorate program, which we continue to drive, even during the pandemic, and you look at the offsets, so the pay fors that we usually talk about, including wage inflation and price erosion, given the pause on PAMA this year and given the fact that we've done really well in other price concessions despite significant increases in our SWB that was warranted during the pandemic as we wanted to reward our employees for their incredible contributions in getting us up and running, operating well through it and obviously, driving strong company results. And when I net all those together, that level of business should be more profitable. 
And then going forward from that, when we get back to the growth that you saw in 2019, and you saw in the first 2 months of 2020 and our ability to leverage that growth, I would expect to see margin expansion on the base business.
But of course, that will be partially offset for a period of time, as the COVID revenues and margins fall down. 
So longer term, the good news is we were on a good path on growth and margin expansion prepandemic, and we'll get back there. 
But for a while, it will be somewhat masked by the COVID decline that's inevitable over the next certainly 18 months or so."

And a question about physicians, Ricky, we're watching this carefully because we do believe, going back to an earlier question about the consumer activity, that there will be a transition here now going forward with physicians serving the market in a different way. 
As we said before, about half the physicians have either sold their practices to integrate delivery systems or have strong affiliations with integrated delivery systems, and that will be consistent going forward. 
But the other half of the market, we believe there will be a growing percentage of that portion of physicians that are served by telehealth.
And we have a very strong position with those telehealth providers and that was before the pandemic. And those telehealth providers are not going to work with handfuls of laboratories, will work with a few. And then we'll have a real tight for lab network, as you would expect. And as you would expect, Quest would be one of those options.
So we feel good about that. Second as you see more consolidation going on in positions, and you see what's happening, particularly with one of the health insurance companies, Optum, acquiring physicians and a number of those physician practices or our customers. You think about that consolidation and think about their role, think about where they add value of bringing all those physicians together, we believe there will be an opportunity for us to work with a consolidator like Optum to provide lab services more broadly and really reduce the variation they have with all their physicians. 
And just one last point to show that this world is moving to a tighter network of lab providers. In the fourth quarter of last year, UnitedHealthcare actually announced the removal of a lot of network benefit for some of their fully insured members. 
And so it's just another example of the major health plan tightening up the network. So we think the physician side will change, and there will be a different way of providing physician services to patients going forward. And that trend, we believe, is a good trend, and will provide tailwind for us to consolidate the market."

So it sounds like you don't expect there to be any sort of meaningful impact on your opportunity around consolidation, just even given the dramatically expanded installed basis PCR instruments across the U.S. over the past year. I mean, I would assume that customers do want to monetize those investments to some extent. I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of market share shifting outside of maybe COVID testing that you're seeing already, if that's happening at all? I mean it sounds like everything still remains an opportunity from an M&A perspective and consolidation standpoint.
And then my second question is just on how should we be thinking about the long-term dynamics as it relates to COVID testing? It will obviously diminish with this vaccine rollout. But could it evolve into something more similar to like flu testing in future years? And can you remind us of the flu testing exposure you do have?"
361335,700244213,2192137,"Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Quest Diagnostics Incorporated","Executives","Sure. So as I said earlier, we believe that hospitals will be now increasingly looking at their options to become more efficient, given the pressure that pandemics put on many of them. And we're encouraged by the level of discussions we had and the deals",317,"Sure. So as I said earlier, we believe that hospitals will be now increasingly looking at their options to become more efficient, given the pressure that pandemics put on many of them. And we're encouraged by the level of discussions we had and the deals we have closed as an example of this is happening. So we think that's good. 
On the commercial laboratory side, we believe that some have gotten into the COVID testing opportunity. It's provided somewhat of an opportunity for them to get through this year. 
But as the dust settles and testing volumes go down, the reality of what we talk about dynamically, it doesn't change. And we think there would be many of those that would be looking at their options, and we do believe that COVID testing will continue into '22.
We believe that this will be the virus that we'll have to manage. So it will be more flu-like and something that will be behind us in the end of '21. And it's hard for us to scale at this time what that will be.
But you should not think that this is going to be a testing opportunity that will go away at the end of this year, but we do believe that will be with us in '22 as well. 
And as far as the flu, we talked about in a prior earnings call that we have offered a combination panel, when a patient presents itself with symptoms, the physician wants to rule out the flu and also COVID.
And so we have seen that be accepted. But as you all know, the incidence of flu this year is down considerably because of all our behaviors in the United States. So that has changed somewhat.
Shawn or Mark, you want to add something to food testing in general and exposure to answer the final point of the question."

As you may have seen or you'll see in our capital spend for 2020, we ended up $418 million, which was above the initial range. A lot of that was related directly to the COVID capital that was necessary. But we certainly have not stepped back on investing internally because we think it's the best way to drive returns. A lot of that obviously is related to our Invigorate program. We are moving all of our new assay test to a single platform. We continue to move forward on that. And then a big piece of the 2020 -- and the first half of 2021 was really the Quest in our new facility. Although we started operating in early January, we still have some final fit-out and equipment to put in, and that will drive some of the spending in the first half. So we absolutely have a high priority on internal capital, and we'll continue to do so. You can see we guided to $200 million in the first half, which is about 50% of what we spent in 2020. As we step back a little bit from COVID capital, but we have some continued spending on cost and then also there's normal priorities on which we spend. 
And share buybacks, as I mentioned, I will give a lot more color on the Investor Day. The reason for that is we do have some things that we're monitoring around potential cash deployments. 
We'll have greater clarity on as we move over the next couple of weeks. We also wanted to get a little more of 2021 Q1 behind us to see how that performance continues. And what our expectations for Q2 look like at that point. Because every day, every couple of weeks, every month certainly gives us a better line of sight into expectations. But by announced -- by us seeking and getting approval and announcing $1 billion increase in our authorization, certainly, you correctly are taking that as a signal. And as I said specifically in my prepared remarks, that we're going to do more share buybacks than we have done historically.
And I'll remind you that our capital allocation strategy, which we have not changed to this point is to give a majority of our free cash flow back to our shareholders through our dividend and our share repurchases, we suspended them for 2020 for a period of time. But even with the $250 million, we spent in Q4 and the increase in dividend over time, we're behind that 50%. So we have some catch-up to do."

So in a year dominated by the pandemic, Quest brought critical COVID-19 testing to our country and delivered record revenues, earnings and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and the full year 2020. 
The pandemic has tested our nearly 50,000 employees, and they have responded as heroes by developing COVID-19 tests, building test capacity, innovating new testing models with our retail partners, transporting specimens, delivering results and, of course, supporting our customers. 
We finished the year as one of the country's leading providers of COVID-19 testing. I'm very proud of what we have achieved and optimistic about what we can accomplish in 2021.
So this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Our ongoing role in the COVID-19 pandemic and update you on our non-COVID-based business. 
And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and our financial outlook for the first half of 2021. 
Well, before we get into the details of the quarter and the full year of 2020, we wanted to share our perspective on the new strategy for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic proposed by the new administration. 
We are pleased by the efforts to expand access to testing across the country, especially in the underserved communities where there are known disparities in health care. We support the new administration's approach to controlling the pandemic by expanding the availability of testing supplies, enhancing laboratory testing capacity and ensuring a clarity of messaging about the use of test and insurance coverage.
We also support the efforts of COVID-19 pandemic testing board, and we look forward to additional details and days of weeks ahead. Now turning to our results. 
Continued high demand for COVID-19 testing, drove our performance throughout the quarter and the second half of the year. For the fourth quarter, total revenues grew by more than 55% to $3 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 126% on a reported basis to $4.21 and nearly 168% on an adjusted basis to $4.48. 
For the full year 2020, total revenues grew by more than 22% to $9.44 billion. 
Earnings per share increased by nearly 71% on a reported basis to $10.47 and more than 70% on an adjusted basis to $11.18. 
Cash provided by operations increased by more than 61% to $2 billion. We announced today that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 10.7% to $0.62 per quarter, and this is our tenth increase since 2011. 
Additionally, our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. 
The increased authority is on top of the approximately $900 million that was available as of December 31, 2020. 
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong COVID-19 testing volumes. Demand clearly spiked as the virus surged and people got tested in advance of the Holiday calendar. We performed an average of 135,000 COVID-19 molecular tests today in the fourth quarter, well below our current capacity. 
We continue to innovate to further expand capacity, reduce turnaround times and gaining efficiencies. 
And finally, we are focused on addressing health disparities in the underserved communities through our Quest for Health equity initiative. We recently held our first COVID-19 testing event, at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Holland in conjunction with leading Black Clergy and the United way of New York City. 
Testing is more important than ever as the vaccines roll out over the coming months to get at-risk patients into care when they're weak and still be effective, and to isolate infected individuals. 
We expect 2021 to be another very strong year for COVID testing. Although demand for COVID testing is likely to decline throughout 2021 as more people become vaccinated and fewer new cases are reported. 
We believe that COVID-19 testing will continue into 2022. Now turning to our base business. Organic volumes recovered rapidly throughout the summer fall. 
However, the recovery stalled at the end of November and into December due to the surge in COVID-19 infections across the country. 
And Mark will provide and share some more details regarding the trends in our base business later. With that, we continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth and to drive operational excellence. 
Let me share some of the highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Our M&A pipeline remains strong, and we achieved our goal to exceed a 2% growth CAGR from acquisitions in our base business over the last 3 years. 
We continue to see increasing interest from our hospital partners about how we can help them with their lab strategy, which includes discussions around both their outreach acquisitions and professional lab service arrangements. The deals we closed in 2020, particularly the Memorial Herman outreach and MACL acquisitions position us well to achieve our M&A growth target this year. And we remain confident that this year, we will execute a more similar type of outreach for tuck-in deals in our pipeline. Last year was also a record year for our professional lab services strategy or PLS. And this is the business to partner with hospitals to help them run their inpatient labs more efficiently. In the fourth quarter, we announced 2 small PLS partnerships with hospital systems in New York and Indiana. And then in December, we announced our largest PLS relationship to date with Hackensack Meridian Health, the largest integrated health network in New Jersey.
Quest will manage laboratory operations and perform reference testing for 11 Hackensack Meridian Health hospitals. We also continue to execute our health plan strategy by shifting the dialogue to value-based contracting efforts from the recent past when discussions focused primarily on price.
We continue to make progress with our new strategic relationship with Anthem to improve quality inefficiency and the delivery of laboratory services.
We're advancing our position with UnitedHealthcare within its preferred lab network and also are building momentum with many of our other national and regional health plan partners.
Finally, we continue to grow our direct-to-consumer services in the quarter. 
In December, we announced our 0 out-of-pocket QuestDirect COVID-19 testing option. Their servers offers appointment scheduling and specimen collection at more than 500 participating Walmart drive-through locations. 
And also in the quarter, we saw a number -- saw a deceleration in the number of consumers signing up for MyQuest patient portal. 
Today, roughly 15 million patients have a MyQuest account, an increase of nearly 2 million since October. And recent market research indicates that our brand is strong and has strengthened over the past year with industry-leading Net Promoter Scores.
We have a strong foundation to accelerate growth in our consumer offerings. The second part of our 2-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We continue to pursue our goal to reduce our cost base by 3% per year. We also see opportunities ahead to drive further productivity gains, and at the same time, enhancing the customer experience. 
Now once again, our Invigorate program delivered approximately $200 million of cost savings in 2020. And we continue to see more opportunities to deliver future efficiency in our cost base.
Our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey went live on January 4. This is the most highly automated laboratory in our network, and over the course of 2021, we expect to consolidate volumes from Teterboro, Marl, Baltimore and Philadelphia labs to this state of the art facility. Now before turning it over to Mark, I'd like to announce that we plan to update you on our strategy and market overview at our upcoming virtual Investor Day, and it will be held on Thursday, March 11. So stay tuned for more details. Mark?"

In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $3 billion, up nearly 56% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 58% compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services, offset by a modest decline in our base testing revenue.
Volume measured by the number of requisitions, increased 26.8% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 4.5%. As we highlighted in our 2020 outlook update in mid-December, organic testing volumes ordered in our base business were down mid- to high single digits versus the prior year in October and November.
The recovery stalled in late November with organic testing volume trends down high single digits versus the prior year in December due to the surge in new infections across the country.
Additionally, many state and local governments imposed new orders designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
Compared to December, organic base volume trends remained relatively steady in January versus our pre-pandemic 2019 baseline.
For the entire fourth quarter, total testing volumes declined roughly 2% versus the prior year and benefited from M&A and new PLS partnerships that began in 2020.
Excluding M&A and new PLS wins, base testing volumes declined approximately 8% in Q4 versus the prior year. COVID-19 testing continued to be a meaningful contributor to volumes during the fourth quarter.
We resulted approximately 12.5 million molecular tests and 1 million serology tests contributing approximately 29% to volume growth in Q4. We exited the fourth quarter averaging approximately 130,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 10,000 serology tests per day.
Revenue per acquisition increased 25.2% versus the prior year, driven largely by COVID-19 testing. This was partially offset by enterprise headwinds of approximately 1.6% and in the fourth quarter, which includes the impact of PAMA and was in line with our prior expectations. 
Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $795 million or 26.5% of revenues compared to $363 million or 18% of revenues last year. 
On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q4 was $860 million or 28.6% of revenues compared to $329 million or 17% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by the strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, due to continued high demand for COVID-19 testing. 
Reported EPS was $4.21 in the quarter compared to $1.86 a year ago. 
Adjusted EPS was $4.48 and compared to $1.67 last year. Cash provided by operations was approximately $2 billion for the full year versus $1.24 billion in 2019.
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we returned approximately $138 million of Provider Release Funds we had received under the CARES Act. 
Our financial position remains very strong. As we announced this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend approximately 10.7% to $0.62 per share, and the Board expanded our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. 
So we now have nearly $2 billion available for future share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases in Q4 and bought back $250 million of company stock during the quarter. 
Turning to guidance. There continues to be a lot of uncertainty around the trajectory of the pandemic and its impact on COVID-19 testing trends as well as further recovery in our base business. Therefore, we are currently providing an outlook for only the first half of 2021 and expect to provide updates as the year progresses.
Our outlook for the first half of 2021 is as follows: revenue is expected to be between $4.85 billion and $5.15 billion, an increase of approximately 33% to 41% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $5.07 and $6.07 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $5.90 and $6.90.
Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $800 million, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million. The demand for and duration of COVID-19 testing as well as the continued recovery in the base business are significant swing factors that remain challenging to forecast.
With that high degree of uncertainty in mind, please consider the following. Our first half outlook generally assumes a gradual improvement in base testing volumes, but we expect the base business to remain below our prepandemic 2019 baseline throughout the first half of the year.
COVID-19 molecular testing volumes averaging roughly 100,000 tests per day in the first half of the year. However, we expect average daily volumes to decline throughout the first half of 2021 as more people become vaccinated. Therefore, we assume COVID-19 molecular volumes will be lower in the second quarter compared to Q1. COVID-19 serology testing volumes averaging 15,000 tests per day for the first half of 2021, with demand expected to increase modestly throughout the first 2 quarters of the year.
Given the strength of our financial position and high cash balances, we expect to complete a larger amount of share repurchases in 2021 than we have done historically, while maintaining significant flexibility to execute on our M&A pipeline. 
However, at this point, our EPS ranges only assume enough share repurchases to maintain a stable share count. We expect to share more details about our capital deployment priorities at our upcoming Investor Day in March.
While we aren't providing a detailed outlook for the full year at this time, I'd like to offer some additional considerations for 2021.
As a reminder, there will be no Medicare reimbursement cut under PAMA this year given the 1-year delay included in the CARES Act. We expect organic base testing trends to slowly recover throughout the year, with volumes likely approaching a full recovery compared to our 2019 baseline by the end of the year. If the country vaccinates a significant portion of the population by the summer, we would expect a continued decline in COVID-19 molecular testing volumes in the second half of 2021 compared to our expectations for the first half.
Similarly, demand for COVID-19 serology testing is likely to wane in the back half of the year. Finally, COVID-19 molecular reimbursement is likely to trend lower in 2021 compared to last year. As many of you know, beginning January 1, CMS moved to a new reimbursement model with a rate of $100 for all tests reported within 2 days and $75 for all other results. Several commercial payers have now moved to this new reimbursement model as well. 
Also, while we are encouraged that HHS now plans to extend the public health emergencies throughout 2021, prospective changes to COVID molecular reimbursement are still possible. Furthermore, direct client bill reimbursement for COVID testing services remains competitive. I will now turn it back to Steve."

So we are expecting to still do quite well in terms of reimbursement in the near term. We believe we can meet the turnaround times, certainly the threshold that's required to be eligible for the higher rates and then we get paid, obviously, based on the individual tests.
So we're still thinking in the near term that our average weighted reimbursement is going to be pretty strong. But we also recognize the reality of the pressure on the industry from all the various payers, especially the commercial payers.
And so therefore, as we mentioned, throughout the first half of the year, we would expect some reduction in that reimbursements. Not something that would be momentous, but certainly some downward pressure.
And as we said, the client area is very, very competitive. So there's quite a few labs at this point given the demand that have significant capacity.
And so therefore, in the coronary, that's very, very competitive. In terms of your question, I'm sure you can appreciate, Ralph. But first off, we don't feel we're getting paid excessively for COVID PCR. We feel like we're being paid appropriately. But even if you could exactly forecast the volume of our COVID testing and forecast the base business over a period of time, which obviously would be nearly impossible.
I'm not sure that we need to trade-off anything. We're very happy with the relationships that we've built, as Steve mentioned, with the payers. We've moved away from a focus on price and move toward more of a partnership and an alignment around value creation, where they're looking for us to save the money and create value, and a big piece of that is moving more work to us because we're already a very, a high value compared to the rest of the industry and possible choices for patients. 
So good question, Ralph. Certainly appreciate it. But for practical and for strategic reasons, because of where we think we are with the payers already with some of these new contracts, is certainly not something that we're looking to pursue right now."

And the reason for that is we want to continue to be prepared in the event that we do have another surge.
And then secondly, is we want to make sure we really have a capability to meet turnaround times that are expected in the market. And over the last 10 months, obviously, a lot of our testing has been for the clinical purpose and what we believe as we enter the second half and we're having many discussions in this regard, there's going to be a lot more demand for return to work programs with employers, which have been pushed out, as you all know, return to leisure activities, there's a number of cities that have large tourism bases that are thinking, well, what they need to do to get people back into those venues. And there will be a lot of activity around just return to life.
And I know that we are still trying to figure that out, and that's going to offer us a lot of opportunity in the future.
And with that, there's always a COVID test, but there's also a number of services we provide, and those are yet to be defined. So we're still trying to understand what that second half opportunity would be. But what we see so far, we will continue to have strong demand, but it may take a different form as we get into the second half and as we go into '22."

So there's several ways you could come to the high end, low end. So what I would say is they're all based on the 3 major drivers, with most of it being on the base volume recovery and the level of PCR volumes to a lesser extent, serology. So if we don't see a significant falloff from where we stand today in PCR, or if it surges up again because of these variants or some other unknown factor, certainly, that would take us to the higher end, combined with -- if the base business also were to continue to recover and not go the opposite direction as COVID surged again. 
So there is some negative correlation, obviously, between the two. But if they both move in the same direction that it moves to the higher end. And then for some reason, COVID fell off, markedly, even more than we're planning. And as we talked about, we are planning for a decline over time in this first 6 months at that midpoint. 
And the base business did not show recovery or even potentially took a little bit of a step back for economic or other reasons, and that would take you to the low end.
But I can't, at this point, provide exact changes in the base and COVID because, obviously, there's multiple ways to get to either one. But directionally, that's what references our guidance with the midpoint being, as I said, a modest recovery, but not full for the first 6 months of the base business and then some step off, but still significant COVID testing for the first 6 months with the second quarter being markedly lower than the first quarter."

We seem to see some early indications that there's interest in understanding whether you have the antibodies or not, which might inform patients and physicians around their urgency of getting vaccinated.
And at the same time, we're bringing out a new capability called quant serology testing. And this will allow physicians and patients to see if, in fact, they do get the spike protein from the vaccines, and we'll be bringing that out of 2 platforms in the next few weeks.
And this can't help us determine if the vaccine is being effective. So we do believe that there will be some increased demands for serology. And this is on top of what we already do. And serology is providing a really important role for our management of the disease, overall surveillance, epidemiology and in measuring the response of what's happening pre and post the vaccinations in broad population. So we believe there's an opportunity in front of us in '21 in that regard."

I mean you see the capacity that's out there on the country back a few weeks ago, we were doing about 2 million COVID-19 molecular tests.
So obviously, up considerably from where we all started last March. But going forward, Jack, I do see that there will be a change beyond the PCR test, as I mentioned earlier. Now there's going to be greater demand for programs that get to portions of the population that help us get back to work, get back to leisure activities, get back to life. 
And so we're having a number of dialogues around that. And that will include the role of antigen testing and more rapid testing workflows that allow us to see if in fact a person that wants to engage and whatever the activity is, is negative and safe for a reasonable period of time to participate. 
So when we get into that world, we'll obviously provide testing. But as I said earlier, there's a number of services and also IT solutions that you need to provide. And like so much in health care, you see one, but we're currently engaged with a number of organizations, a number of municipalities and the number of corporations, and what they will be doing in this regard, particularly in the second half. I think the first quarter is outlined in our guidance.
We're going to start to see improvement as we get into the second quarter. I think the second quarter will be a telling quarter for us all. And we do see a lot of people getting prepared for better manufacturing rates, better position for populations to get back to work-life and leisure activities, and we're going to start to see more of that, and Quest has a significant role in helping in that regard."

And also during the pandemic share that we're deeply engaged with many of the plans of what they needed to take care of their membership and also their employees. So the relationship has continued to strengthen. 
And as I said in my introductory remarks, and Mark said as well, we're shifting the dialogue away from exclusively price to the value we deliver. And when you go back to what we've talked about in the past around what we bring to the table in terms of our value proposition and loan quality, our service performance, our innovation, all at a very affordable price. We believe our value proposition is really second to none.
And as I said, in the course of the last year, we've done service, look at our reputation in the industry and Net Promoter Scores, and those are quite strong. So when you bring those facts to the table, Jack, our position in terms of working out the forward-looking relationships has provided a much stronger foundation and a better understanding on the other side that we really do deliver a lot more value. So we're in a good position with our plans. We're in good position with our contracts. We obviously don't provide specific details, but we feel very good about that.

So Jack, I understand the question and several years ago, I think there was an expectation or people holding their breath every time we extended a contract with a major payer because it would imply some sort of major price concession. I could tell you, this has become largely invisible to you all, unless we talk about it like Anthem, which was really a new contract and brought together a number of states under a single contract as opposed to having different periods of time in which we were negotiating across the Anthem network. 
We just extended with a major commercial payer. You didn't hear about it because there was no price concession. 
And in fact, we made huge headway with this payer, I'll tell you, getting them to acknowledge that in the world of PAMA, the whole notion of a discount to the CMS NLA rates no longer will apply going forward. And that, in fact, CMS will be setting the market and that they should feel confident is a market rate that they can feel comfortable and represent to their perspective or current members. So really, that's what it's been about as they all want to make sure that they can say, they've got good prices. 
And now you've got an external benchmark you can look to. So we just extended with a very large national. We do have one coming up this year. But I can assure you that it's not going to be -- will not come with the major price concessions. We're going to continue to work on the value-based contracting. And with that actually comes good. 
Pricing that we feel represents the market and then these come with upside, whereas we perform, we both share in the benefit of that upside. That's the way we're really contracting over the last couple of years and how we would expect the contract going forward."

There's no guarantee that, that will continue. So -- and not only could they decouple the reimbursement with the PHE, but they could also, like they did January 1st, change the approach. However, at this point, yes, we're assuming the most -- the highest probability is that as long as the PHE continues, CMS will continue to pay us under this new method. 
On commercial, obviously, we're not the only player. And so while we defend and feel like we do a good job of explaining why reimbursement makes sense as we've negotiated some new payment methodologies, including some who wanted to move to the Medicare methodology. We think we've done a good job. But obviously, there are other labs as well. And to the extent that other labs don't do as good a job as we do, there could be additional pressure on us. So that's why it's hard for us to predict exactly where this is going. 
But certainly, in our mind, we would expect to continue to defend our commercial contracts as well through the PHEs in the same basis for CMS paying us at that rate should apply to the commercial payers as well. I also want to remind everybody that as long as the 0 patient out-of-pocket applies, that is also a huge tailwind for us because to avoid having to bill patients where historically, we've shared that we get about $0.70 on the dollar and actually get 100% of that payment from the third party is also a large enhancement to our revenue and our profitability as well.

We have met that threshold of 50% of COVID molecular test resulted in less than 2 days. We did that in the last few months. And I'll share that the majority of our testers are resulted in 2 days or less.
So in my other comments, I did mention that we continue to build capacity because it just gives us a lot more operational flexibility to meet better turnaround times based upon where the demand is coming from. 
So I think we're progressing well. We're a very good provider of the test. Time is one element and quality and reliability and also the type of testing we have done, our methodology for PCR tests, both on the LDT side, and obviously, the kits are somewhat consistent throughout the industry are really quite strong.

So it depends when you say is it a headwind, it depends on to what you're comparing it. So as we expect the base business to improve. That's a significant margin tailwind versus the prior period because we are -- in any given window of time, a highly fixed cost operation on our base business. And while we took some significant cost actions in the second quarter of last year in response to the significant downturn in our volume, and we've continued to manage our costs very, very tightly to the back half recovery to not get out in front of ourselves. We're not planning on any significant restructuring in the near term with volumes that are down single digits at this point. So our cost structure in the base business is, to some extent, what it is, and we'll add small pieces that are necessary as it recovers. But that growth and recovery in that base business sequentially is a nice tailwind. 
On the other side, as we talked about, expect erosion in our COVID volumes. That creates a headwinds and how those 2 pieces offset each other is hard to predict slightly, if you understood me specifically. But I would, at this point, expect that the COVID reduction more than offsets the base, but at least they do partially offset each other as we move forward. 
And then the other dynamic is obviously reimbursement on the PCR test, and we shared that we expected some pressure on that as we go from the first quarter into the second quarter sequentially and then likely even more so in the back half of the year. So without getting into specifics, those are kind of the things you should -- specific numbers, those are kind of the things you should think about as you think about where our margins certainly go to the first half and then into the second half of 2021."

And number two, when we think about reimbursement as we've been talking about for molecular tests, et cetera. I would think a lot of these labs have done well during this period of time.

So thanks, Lisa, for the question. So the first part is really about acquisition opportunities around hospitals, and you see that we announced a couple of deals last year that we were happy we did, and that's going to help us. And we continue to see",574,"Yes. So thanks, Lisa, for the question. So the first part is really about acquisition opportunities around hospitals, and you see that we announced a couple of deals last year that we were happy we did, and that's going to help us. And we continue to see a nice funnel for '21 as well.
And as you all know, hospital volumes have been down through '20. They have recovered for us. However, what we do see is a lot of renewed interest of looking at their lab strategies, which includes acquiring their outreach business and includes professional lab service agreements like we just announced in the fourth quarter. 
That relationship we announced in the fourth quarter with Hackensack Meridian Health system is the largest we've ever done. And I could tell you, it took a long time to get there.
And I believe the prospective reality of what's happening in the health care market this year helped bring that to a conclusion. And I believe that, that will happen with a number of dialogues we have going on with hospitals right now. So that's one piece. 
The second is on other commercial laboratories, yes, you're right. A number of what commercial laboratories that have jumped into the COVID testing arena. You see it with all the capacity we've added in the country. However, as that starts to be pulled back and they start to see what the prospects are, given what we're driving as an industry with consolidation with tighter contracts and networks around health plans, we believe that there still will be a catalyst in the marketplace for us to continue to consolidate. 
So yes, there's been a short-term opportunity for a number of labs to take advantage, if you will, the opportunity to provide COVID-19 testing. But as that starts to change as we get through '21, we believe the reality is of what the new world will be with tighter networks, more consolidation will play nicely into our strategy and allow us to acquire more going forward. And obviously, given our cash position and a strong balance sheet, we're in a very nice position to continue to do that. 
And also, Lisa, there's been a lot of discussion around all this additional capacity out there. We think people have added new systems and potentially does this put then a risk for us that these people are going to get into other businesses outside of COVID like women's health, we are watching it. And obviously, some hospitals have moved their molecular capacity to COVID, and we help them with some of the other work. But for other commercial laboratories and hospitals to use that capacity to get into competing with us, by way of example, wound. So that's a long stretch. 
I mean there's a lot to -- a lot more to getting a client to flip over then the lab capacity. You have to have a sales force, you have to have logistics capabilities, you have to do electronic interfaces, you have to work with the physicians, you have to be in contract with the health plans. 
So we are watching it, but at the same time, we're a little cautious in the belief that some of this will have a significant effect. At the same time, we're watching it carefully to make sure it doesn't. And we're staying on top of our clients to make sure we serve them well."

At any given point in time, we've got multiple opportunities that we're discussing. I can tell you that none of the potential sellers that we're speaking to right now is getting and expecting to get paid for that PCR bubble.
So fortunately, I could see a mentality that, ""Hey, my value has gone up dramatically because of COVID testing."" But the people we're talking to right now recognize that, that's short term, and that should not be a part of the valuation discussion. And then the -- while PAMA gets a pause this year, there's still some risk. 
But more importantly, as we've mentioned, and I'm sure you've seen, it's not just CMS, but the commercial payers are starting to put pressure on these high hospital outreach rates, recontracting that work that's outside the patients who are in the hospital, either admitted or outpatients at independent laboratory rates. So it's not -- this pressure is not just coming from Washington. It's coming from the commercial payers as well and from, quite frankly, patients who don't like those high prices when they have a high deductible plan. 
So there's a number of things that are getting the C-suites of large hospital systems with outreach to think about do they really want to be in this business and will this be a good time to monetize. 
And so therefore, I really don't think the pipeline of interest haven't been impacted over the last 12 months negatively."

And we do believe that the pandemic has now been an accelerator for that. 
We're providing COVID-19 testing through that platform. We're going to look at using it for consumer genetics. And as I said in my introductory comments, the interesting part of the pandemic is brought to the forefront, the strong role of testing in overall health care and the Quest has been out there more than ever, and our brand has been built.
And our brand is really second to none in our industry. And we coupled that with our service performance. And so we have this strong foundation, coupled with the change in the marketplace. And we do believe there's going to be a continuation of the number of consumers that are engaged -- that will engage differently with health care delivery systems and how they engage with the physician, with telehealth. We have a very strong presence with telehealth providers and with integrated delivery systems that offer the telehealth option. 
But at the same time, a lot of patients as well and consumers will want to receive their basic health checks and testing online as they buy so much else in their lives. And so we're very well positioned with reputation, with capabilities. And so we are investing in that in a significant way, more so than we would have if we did not have the pandemic.

So we're very, very excited about it. It is a large deal. It's the largest deal we've ever done. It will be material to our growth. And we talked a couple of years ago at our Investor Day, and we'll likely give an update on this.
We thought we could get more than 100 basis points and somewhere between 100 to 200 basis points growth every year from our POS business. And certainly, this one is a large contributor to that and might even give us an opportunity to exceed that.

To where they can expand to as utilization comes back to a more normalized level? So again, the question is more about the margin trajectory as it relates to utilization, not about the timing.
And then my second question is more about sort of market demand. So how do you think about changes in physician behavior patterns, and we're seeing telehealth becoming more integrated into the workflow. So do you think that there's going to be any impact on longer-term lab testing demand curve because of that? I don't know if the experiences early in the year could shed some light on that?"

So Ricky, obviously, the size of the revenue we've generated from COVID, which more than offset the base business has materially impacted our margins and expanded them greatly relative to our historical margins. 
So as we progress, and we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but we progress into a future where COVID testing is still around for a while. 
As Steve said, we don't expect it to go away completely, certainly by 2022. It's going to be less material to our top line and to our margin. 
So where will our base business be? Once we get back to the prepandemic levels of 2019, I would expect our base business to be slightly higher margin than it was prepandemic because if you look at our Invigorate program, which we continue to drive, even during the pandemic, and you look at the offsets, so the pay fors that we usually talk about, including wage inflation and price erosion, given the pause on PAMA this year and given the fact that we've done really well in other price concessions despite significant increases in our SWB that was warranted during the pandemic as we wanted to reward our employees for their incredible contributions in getting us up and running, operating well through it and obviously, driving strong company results. And when I net all those together, that level of business should be more profitable. 
And then going forward from that, when we get back to the growth that you saw in 2019, and you saw in the first 2 months of 2020 and our ability to leverage that growth, I would expect to see margin expansion on the base business.
But of course, that will be partially offset for a period of time, as the COVID revenues and margins fall down. 
So longer term, the good news is we were on a good path on growth and margin expansion prepandemic, and we'll get back there. 
But for a while, it will be somewhat masked by the COVID decline that's inevitable over the next certainly 18 months or so."

And a question about physicians, Ricky, we're watching this carefully because we do believe, going back to an earlier question about the consumer activity, that there will be a transition here now going forward with physicians serving the market in a different way. 
As we said before, about half the physicians have either sold their practices to integrate delivery systems or have strong affiliations with integrated delivery systems, and that will be consistent going forward. 
But the other half of the market, we believe there will be a growing percentage of that portion of physicians that are served by telehealth.
And we have a very strong position with those telehealth providers and that was before the pandemic. And those telehealth providers are not going to work with handfuls of laboratories, will work with a few. And then we'll have a real tight for lab network, as you would expect. And as you would expect, Quest would be one of those options.
So we feel good about that. Second as you see more consolidation going on in positions, and you see what's happening, particularly with one of the health insurance companies, Optum, acquiring physicians and a number of those physician practices or our customers. You think about that consolidation and think about their role, think about where they add value of bringing all those physicians together, we believe there will be an opportunity for us to work with a consolidator like Optum to provide lab services more broadly and really reduce the variation they have with all their physicians. 
And just one last point to show that this world is moving to a tighter network of lab providers. In the fourth quarter of last year, UnitedHealthcare actually announced the removal of a lot of network benefit for some of their fully insured members. 
And so it's just another example of the major health plan tightening up the network. So we think the physician side will change, and there will be a different way of providing physician services to patients going forward. And that trend, we believe, is a good trend, and will provide tailwind for us to consolidate the market."

I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of market share shifting outside of maybe COVID testing that you're seeing already, if that's happening at all? I mean it sounds like everything still remains an opportunity from an M&A perspective and consolidation standpoint.
And then my second question is just on how should we be thinking about the long-term dynamics as it relates to COVID testing? It will obviously diminish with this vaccine rollout. But could it evolve into something more similar to like flu testing in future years? And can you remind us of the flu testing exposure you do have?"

So as I said earlier, we believe that hospitals will be now increasingly looking at their options to become more efficient, given the pressure that pandemics put on many of them. And we're encouraged by the level of discussions we had and the deals we have closed as an example of this is happening. So we think that's good. 
On the commercial laboratory side, we believe that some have gotten into the COVID testing opportunity. It's provided somewhat of an opportunity for them to get through this year. 
But as the dust settles and testing volumes go down, the reality of what we talk about dynamically, it doesn't change. And we think there would be many of those that would be looking at their options, and we do believe that COVID testing will continue into '22.
We believe that this will be the virus that we'll have to manage. So it will be more flu-like and something that will be behind us in the end of '21. And it's hard for us to scale at this time what that will be.
But you should not think that this is going to be a testing opportunity that will go away at the end of this year, but we do believe that will be with us in '22 as well. 
And as far as the flu, we talked about in a prior earnings call that we have offered a combination panel, when a patient presents itself with symptoms, the physician wants to rule out the flu and also COVID.
And so we have seen that be accepted. But as you all know, the incidence of flu this year is down considerably because of all our behaviors in the United States. So that has changed somewhat.

A lot of that was related directly to the COVID capital that was necessary. But we certainly have not stepped back on investing internally because we think it's the best way to drive returns. A lot of that obviously is related to our Invigorate program. We are moving all of our new assay test to a single platform. We continue to move forward on that. 
And then a big piece of the 2020 -- and the first half of 2021 was really the Quest in our new facility. Although we started operating in early January, we still have some final fit-out and equipment to put in, and that will drive some of the spending in the first half. So we absolutely have a high priority on internal capital, and we'll continue to do so. You can see we guided to $200 million in the first half, which is about 50% of what we spent in 2020. As we step back a little bit from COVID capital, but we have some continued spending on cost and then also there's normal priorities on which we spend. 
And share buybacks, as I mentioned, I will give a lot more color on the Investor Day. The reason for that is we do have some things that we're monitoring around potential cash deployments. 
We'll have greater clarity on as we move over the next couple of weeks. We also wanted to get a little more of 2021 Q1 behind us to see how that performance continues. And what our expectations for Q2 look like at that point. Because every day, every couple of weeks, every month certainly gives us a better line of sight into expectations. But by announced -- by us seeking and getting approval and announcing $1 billion increase in our authorization, certainly, you correctly are taking that as a signal. And as I said specifically in my prepared remarks, that we're going to do more share buybacks than we have done historically.
And I'll remind you that our capital allocation strategy, which we have not changed to this point is to give a majority of our free cash flow back to our shareholders through our dividend and our share repurchases, we suspended them for 2020 for a period of time. But even with the $250 million, we spent in Q4 and the increase in dividend over time, we're behind that 50%. So we have some catch-up to do."

Quest had a strong first quarter with our base business continuing to recover to near pre pandemic levels. Contributions from acquisitions and PLS relationships accelerated growth in the base business have helped offset the reduction in demand for COVID-19 testing, which was in line with industry trends. In March, for the first time since the pandemic began, monthly organic revenue in the base business grew versus our 2019 baseline. 
As we noted at our recent Investor Day, Quest is well positioned to grow as the U.S. exits the pandemic if people return to normal activities and address the routine care that have been deflected over the past year. Also, as you saw in our press release this morning, our Board of Directors increased the company's share repurchase authorization by $1 billion for the second time this year, and we expect to launch an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, in the amount of $1.5 billion in the coming days. 
This morning, I'll discuss our performance for the first quarter of 2021, provide perspective on industry dynamics and an update you on our base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results. 
But before we get into the details of the quarter, we wanted to share our perspective on the ongoing role of COVID-19 testing more than a year into the pandemic as well as provide our thoughts on recent news regarding PAMA. COVID-19 testing remains critical as supplies of vaccine continue to be available to all Americans. Testing will help control the spread of the virus in addition to reducing hospitalization and saving lives, continued testing will be key to helping segments of the economy reopen as more Americans become vaccinated. Vaccination is front and center in the minds of most people now and testing remains a critical element of safely returning to life. 
I'd also like to share our perspective on some of the most recent developments regarding PAMA. So we're encouraged that MedPAC recently submitted under PAMA that are less versatile for laboratories. One of the alternatives mentioned is surveying a representative sample of independent hospitals and physician office laboratories instead of reported all laboratories to submit data. We've been saying for years that CMS got the data collection process long and did it follow the intent of Congress. MedPAC has found that hospital outreach and physician office labs reported higher payer rates that independent by us. And that independent payers were overrepresented in the first round of PAMA data reported. We agree on both towns. The independent analysis by MedPAC also provides evidence that the Medicare clinical fee schedule would have been 10% to 15% higher, if CMS had used a more representative sample that included more data from hospitals and physician office labs. 
The filings refused to client that CMS collecting more hospital outpatient and physician office lab data would not have impacted the rate calculated by CMS. We believe that access to accurate and reliable testing remains critical, not just as part of our nation's ongoing response to the pandemic, but also for the millions of seniors who have lived routine screening and care over the past year. We need to fix PAMA to avoid the Medtronic coster horizon in 2022. And to help ensure seniors have continued access to critical lab services they need and rely on. 
Additionally, we were disappointed by the recent dismissal by a U.S. district Court of ACLA challenged PAMA. We are working with ACLA to the determine the next steps with respect to this litigation, we continue to work with policy makers to establish a clinical laboratory site schedule that is truly representative of the full market and supports continued innovation and access in vital laboratory services as Congress originally intended. 
Now turning to our results for the first quarter. Total revenues grew by more than 49% to $2.7 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 375% on a reported basis to $3.46 and nearly 300% on an adjusted basis to $3.76. Cash provided by operations nearly tripled to $731 million. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, our base business performed at its highest level since the start of the pandemic and continue to recover throughout the quarter. Demand for COVID-19 testing slowed in the quarter, reflecting an industry wide trend. We performed an average of 101,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the first quarter, which is well below our current capacity of approximately 300,000 tests per day. We are engaged on several fronts to bring needed testing to schools, businesses and industries by travel and entertainment, which rely on bringing people back together safely and enlarged numbers. 
With the current focus on schools, Quest is well positioned to help with our extensive logistics network as well as our ability to offer high quality, cost-effective classroom PCR testing using pooling. We want to help in the kid back in school, and we're working with a ranger partners to get it to equipment and efficiently. We continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We discussed our strategy in detail a few weeks ago at our Investor Day. So we talked today with a true a few highlights of the quarter. We are excited about our agreement to acquire the Oxford Laboratory Services business, so firstly, 1 of the nation's most reiterated multi-state health care systems, and as we indicated at Investor Day, we're having a board discussion with leaders of larger health systems like Mercy. 
The Mercy Outreach Laboratory Services business currently operates from 31 hospitals and clinical laboratory serving providers and patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. And we're on track to complete this acquisition by midyear. Our professional laboratory services relationship with Hackensack Meridian Health began in January and is off to a good start contributing revenue for the quarter. We originally announced the sale of our 40% minority share in Q² Solutions to IQVIA for $750 million. IQVIA had a strategic vision and ability to lead spread solutions from the next phase of the journey as a global leader in central lab services. And Quest will support it as a strategic lab partner. We've made good progress, taking advantage of health plan access in the first quarter. UnitedHealthcare implemented an initiative removing Avis network benefits for insured groups in selected states. We also brought on [indiscernible] in 8 more states during the quarter. And we're seeing benefits from these initiatives. 
And then finally, we've renewed our long-standing strategic relationship with EmblemHealth provide comprehensive clinical laboratory services for more than 3 million members of EmblemHealth and it's affiliated [indiscernible]. 
Turning to our strategy to drive operational excellence. We are on track to once again deliver 3% savings across the business. In the process, we're also improving the customer experience and quality and in the quarter, we achieved year-over-year improvement in 14 of 19 top tier quality metrics, which we track to gauge our operational performance. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark to provide more details on our financial performance. Mark?"

In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.72 billion, up 49% versus the prior year.

In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.72 billion, up 49% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 52%, compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand versus the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions increased 25.6% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 4%. The impact of severe winter weather during the quarter negatively impacted volumes by approximately 2.5%. Compared to our first quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 1.5% and benefited from M&A and new PLS partnerships that began in 2020. Excluding the net impact of weather in the first quarter as well as M&A and new PLS wins over the last year, base testing volumes declined approximately 7% in the first quarter versus the 2019 baseline and down 5% in March. This represents more of a same-store view of the recovery in our base business since the pandemic began. While COVID-19 testing volumes declined faster than expected throughout Q1, the decline coincided with reduced demand across the industry. Importantly, these volumes have stabilized over the last several weeks. We resulted approximately 9.1 million molecular tests and nearly 900,000 serology tests, contributing nearly 21% to volume growth in Q1 versus the prior year. 
We exited the first quarter averaging approximately 73,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 8,000 serology tests per day. Revenue per acquisition increased 20.5% versus the prior year, driven largely by COVID-19 testing. Modest unit price headwinds were in line with our expectations. Reported operating income in the first quarter was $660 million, or 24.3% of revenues compared to $175 million or 9.6% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q1 was $708 million, or 26% of revenues compared to $225 million or 12.3% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by the strong revenue growth in the first quarter due to continued demand for COVID-19 testing and the ongoing recovery in our base business. Reported EPS was $3.46 in the quarter compared to $0.73 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.76 compared to $0.94 last year. Cash provided by operations was $731 million in the first quarter versus $247 million in 2020. We completed $410 million in share repurchases in Q1, and we ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Included in net proceeds from the Q Square divestiture in April, we currently have more than $1.8 billion in cash available for deployment. 
Following the $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authority that we announced today, we now have the ability to execute approximately $2.5 billion in additional buybacks this year. We expect to launch an accelerated share repurchase transaction of approximately $1.5 billion in the coming days. 
Turning to guidance. We've updated our outlook for the first half of 2021 as follows: revenues expected to be between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, an increase of approximately 37% to 43% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.51 and $8.01 and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $6.30 and $6.80. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million. 
Before concluding, I'll briefly review some assumptions embedded in our updated first half outlook and considerations to think about for the remainder of 2021. We expect continued steady improvement in our base business throughout 2021. On a same-store view, excluding M&A and new PLS wins, we see the base business remaining slightly below our 2019 baseline in the second quarter. We continue to anticipate a full recovery in our base business compared to our 2019 baseline in the second half of 2021. We are assuming COVID-19 molecular testing volumes will average roughly 50,000 tests per day in Q2 and no meaningful change in COVID-19 serology testing volumes compared to Q1. Given the significant progress of vaccination in the U.S., we continue to expect the decline in clinical demand for COVID-19 molecular testing in the second half of 2021 versus our expectations for the first half. Return to life testing such as the K-12 school testing program should partially offset declining clinical demand later in the year. And while we continue to believe strongly in the value of COVID-19 serology testing, we are not assuming a material increase in demand for serology testing going forward. 
Finally, COVID-19 molecular reimbursement held relatively steady in the first quarter, and we currently expect this trend to continue through Q2, with the public health emergency being extended through mid-July. This is likely to trend lower in the second half of the year as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes shift from clinical diagnostic testing to return to life surveillance testing. 
I will now turn it back to Steve."

And so the answer to your question, we do see a continuation of interest in the building funnel with more prospects to come. What we shared at Investor Day is we reaffirmed our outlook that we would grow through acquisition around 2% per year. What we shared is that we historically have delivered on that at the 3 years prior to '21. And we believe that's still a good guidance number for us for this year and going forward, it's implied in our outlook for growth. 
So finally, as we do see the trends in general, just like all health care out consolidation. We do see systems interested in thinking about what's most important to them. And what's your strategy and Quest help them with their lab strategy. And likewise, you see, if you will, fewer and fewer in network providers with the health clients. And if you want to think about that, that is a consolidation play as well. And when those 2 forces is happening, there will be more share in the hands of fewer, and our plan is to gain share. So all the megatrends and changes that are happening in the industry, we believe have actually improved to support what we've said for some time, and that our view is both for what's happening with hospitals and also what's happening with health plans."

We're actually seeing, really in the last several weeks, starting a much better recovery in California in the West Coast, which is good news. We see the South East starting to recover and bring us back to the 2019 levels that we spoke to earlier. So I would say those are moving in the right direction. Now the offset to that is long as you've seen the spikes and the hotspots in the Midwest and when that happens in the lockdowns and people are concerned about going into health through delivery, that's going to affect our business. So we've seen some of assets, say, in the Midwest. And then finally the Northeast and the Northeast including New York and Pennsylvania and going into New England. It's still behind, and it's recovering slowly, but we're the most off, if you will, in the Northeast. So that's the geographic swing. 
As far as transition business versus hospital business, the hospital business is actually very close to where we were. We're encouraged by that. We see permissions, getting back to '19 levels. We see all patient procedures getting back to '19 levels. So that business is tracking nicely compared to where we were. And then the physician side, it all depends on what position. Primary care is starting to turn on oncology, particularly those that have postponed diagnosis and treatment for oncology starting to turn on. And at the same time, we still see our prescription drug monitoring business or mental health and behavioral health and drugs and abuse still down versus where we were in '19. And that's an issue that varies by state award in that. So I'll get you a feel for what's going geographically. What's going on in position, but also by what we described as our clinical franchises. Mark, any, if you like to add to that?"

The higher revenue is absolutely driven by stronger-than-expected recovery in the base business. So as you point out, we've acknowledged and we record every couple of weeks, COVID testing has ramped down faster than we had anticipated throughout the first quarter. We continue to expect to have that ramp down, but the base business has recovered stronger is certainly more than an offset on the revenue side. 
In terms of the ASR, it is in the guidance. I just want to remind everyone that we have had a guidance for the first half. We did $410 million in Q1. And then part of the ASR is related to the proceeds from the sale of our 40% ownership in our JV with IQVIA, and that is slightly accretive when you consider the loss of the equity earnings. So you need to look at over $600 million of the ASR as really offsetting the foregoing those equity earnings. We had already committed to $900 million in the previous guide the verse gap. So almost $500 million there. So when you combine that, the share repurchases are really just up by several hundred million. So I want to make sure everyone is clear."

For increase in the calculation of revenue per rec have to do with the COVID test, the straight calculation. But we have historically seen a, let's say, modest expansion of the newer test for variety of reasons. Second, there is a higher level of acuity and chronic disease and aging of the population. So we have generally seen a general increase in that. But nothing that was really notable that's standing out within March."

So if you go back to where we started off the year with COVID, PCR throughout the year and you could see that in Q1, and we see it happening in the country. So as Mark said earlier, we do expect that continuing trend into the second half. Now with a little bit offset, we do see clinical uses of the PCR testing, roll in and roll out over hospitals enroll patients seeing their physicians and moving it to return to life activities, and there's a lot of activity around that, Jack. A lot of activity, I mentioned in the remarks, what's going on around schools. There's 2 fundy mechanisms for that from the U.S. government. We've actively engaged with a number of, let's call it, systems integrators that will be coordinating the efforts beyond the laboratory testing. We're well positioned there. 
Secondly, is corporations are now thinking about how they get people back physically into their places of work, maybe albeit not as full-time as they want for. But despite the vaccination progress, they're still going to be testing requirements with the return to work activities. And then let me just say the entity piece of this is big, too. We see the sports teams, want to put pants back in the SAM. We see New York City, interested in getting people back. The tourism as they get into the fall and turning back on the city, we mentioned in our prior remarks and other calls and meetings that we participated in this pilot study with New York to provide a check, if you will provide access for an individual over the course of the day. So that type of activity will be a larger portion of what we do for COVID testing in the back half. Now with all that said, we're not providing guidance for the back half, but we do see continued PCR testing in the back half, but it's going to change in this nature. And also we do believe COVID-19 testing and PCR testing will continue on '22. This is not going away fast."

So first of all, as you know, not all tests are created equal. And PCR still is the gold standard. And we do provide a solution with antigen testing, okay, as part of appropriate utilization of that testing, particularly for surveillance. But as we know, the antigen testing, sensitivity and specificity has been for let's say, day 2 through day 5 of a potentially infected person. But the PCR test is really the gold standard to rollout if someone has been exposed in the early days, there were rule out the pick are exposed in the late days. And so the sensitivity and specificity we have with our PCR testing is quite good. And so physician sell that and therefore, that's why we're so confident that it will continue to be an important part to fight this pandemic. As far as the consumer, the consumers try to figure out to get easy access to testing. And they will get that access in a variety of forms. And by the way, our turnaround time is now for PCR testing are much better on average than the 2 assays that we often thought about several months ago. We're now delivering results in less than the day for many tests that come in. And the reason for that is, remember the remarks we're testing about 101,000 tests per day, and we have approximately 300,000 per day for capacity. So that allows us to have much better turnaround times, which we believe, as that becomes more and more visible and people want to get good access to the gold standard, they're going to rely on those places they can get access. So we continue our relationships with retailers. We're expanding our relationship with CBS has gone quite well. CBS is active on promoting good access to PCR testing around the drive ends and Walmart as well. 
And then also with our direct to the Quest capability that we talked about at our Investor Day, we have put on that platform, both PCR testing as well as serology testing. And we are seeing high levels of interest from a consumer perspective of what they could do simply by getting treatment and FedEx eneop to ship the back and a good turnaround times is to start out with MyQuest. So that will continue to build. And the consumers, as we start to return to it's like for the safe way, I want to be assured that even if they are vaccinated or we have natural immune, we are not locking into a situation that they might have been exposed in some ways because it felt through the cracks without caveats we have with the effectiveness of the vaccines, the questions about natural immunity. And then also with the new variance as well. So because of that, we keep on working on better and more efficient and easier ways for Americans to get access to PCR testing. And we've got now, I think, a lot of the chance to do that, and that will continue to be an opportunity for us in the back half."

And Steve, I'd like to add -- I want to make sure that Matt and others understand how the surveillance works. And in this case, when you pool you get the economics to where it's affordable to do more broadly and more regularly because we're going to be putting up to 10 individual samples in a single well. And so hence, the cost will be 10% or less per individual. And what you sacrifice is it's not a diagnostic because we're not going to have the individuals identified in that well. The school or the entity that provides us the sample will have pool that they will know in test 2x, who the 10 people are. And if we come back to them with a positive result, they will apply a real diagnostic to those 10 individuals. So with that, we also don't have the obligation or the ability to re tap whereas today, when we do pooling for clinical purposes, if we get a positive, we have to go back and retest the individual samples. So it actually is an inefficiency in our process in order to get this to work, we don't do retesting of a sample. We don't have the capability of doing that. We notify the submitting entities that we had a positive in 1 of the pools collection specimen tubes, and then they go forward and test those individuals."

So there's not upside per se relative to before we announced the ASR, as I tried to walk through the math, about a little less than $400 million of the repurchases are truly incremental in terms of an EPS lift. Because we had already committed to the full $900 million, and we had about $500 million remaining in Q2 that was already in the guidance. So that $1.5 billion goes down to $1 billion incremental. A little over $600 million of that is the proceeds from our divestiture of our stake in Q Square, that's slightly accretive. But not materially relative to the for mature of the equity earnings there. So it's really less than $400 million of share repurchases that were incremental to what we guided to previously. And that is built into the updated guidance. 
In terms of implied operating margin, obviously, we have a range. So we can't answer that with precision. But if you take the midpoint, you can all do the math. As we get a lower mix of COVID testing at our assumption of the $100 reimbursement, obviously, realization in AWR that's less than that, that $100 price point. And that mix is toward the base business that will erode the margin slightly. But kind of the offset to that is the base business recovers, we're very leveraged. So the variable drop-through on that base business recovery. Certainly much higher than our enterprise and historical fully loaded operating margin, but it's not quite as high as the COVID PCR."

And then second, more is kind of like long-term strategically. We're hearing the payers talk a lot about digital-first strategies and being sort of kind of like the front door to health care you guys talked about expanding relationship with payers like Anthem. So are you having any conversations with payers on how you can be part of that digital-first strategy in those kind of like digital networks?

So again, just to reiterate, the first half, we delivered over 100,000 PCR COVID tests per day. We're assuming half that in Q2. So that's certainly contributing to the margin decline, as you talked about, implied in the guidance for the first half, implicitly in Q2. When you think about the base business, we're still uncertain how all those moving parts will play out in the second half, which is why we've not provided second half guidance that we want to wait until we can confidently give guidance that we're highly confident will be delivered. So what I would point to is that's the transition period, really look at an Investor Day and how we talked about 2022. And talking about getting our base business fully recovered by the end of this year, back to growth through the growth pillars and back to a margin level, pre pandemic and then obviously improving beyond that, as we talked about a CAGR where our bottom line grows significantly faster than our top line by 700 basis points. 
So we feel very confidence in the earnings power of the base business. Certainly, we're going to have a step down from the pandemic bubble where we did several billion dollars of COVID testing last year and significant COVID testing this year. But the base business should be very healthy coming out of the pandemic once COVID testing drops to a minimal level, we'll be right back to the operating rhythm. Our expectation is that you saw early in 2019 when we were growing a business January, February, more than 5% on a volume basis, and you saw strong improvements in our operating margin. Steve?"

So as you recall in our Investor Day, we went to a walk, if you will, to bridge you from the pandemic years of '20 and '21 into '22. Mark went through chartis some math, which gave you kind of our indication for '22. And also, as I said earlier, is we do believe there would be some COVID testing, but the base business will be recovering and we'll get growing -- going forward in '22 based upon our outlook. So the last question you add, Rick, you have to deal with the digital front end and digital-first and we're excited about this because we're very well positioned. This isn't something that we have just started working on. We've been working on it for a while. 
First of all, if you go back to a large provider like Quest, we're very much embedded in the ecosystem of connectivity already. We have over 500 interfaces of all the different electronic medical records, obviously, that's the big players like option Cerner, but there's hundreds of others. And so therefore, we have a real strong interoperability capability. And that's helpful because when you're in the workflow, because from a disposition perspective, that allows you to more streamline the different service offerings like laboratory to fewer players. 
And then secondly, is this past year, we've seen the acceptance, if you will, telehealth it has been growing nicely but out explosively, and we did see explosive growth in 2020 and we believe that overall, that acceptance, if you will, of that front end, be an accepted way to first engage with the health care this system will continue. And the payers are working on that and providers are working on that, and they're working with other partners, and we're very well positioned with those other partners, who are those partners. Those partners are some of the telehealth companies that you know. And those telehealth companies as they become much more indebted in health care delivery, let's call the digital Bradman. We'll rely on a fewer number of laboratory service providers, and therefore, we're very well positioned as more of a small handful of what just described as the deferred lab network that we are already with United, but for this new world that we see. 
And with all that, we do believe that our direct-to-consumer initiative will have an opportunity as well because consumers equally are wanting to engage with upgrade delivery. They not always need to engage with this physician. And therefore, with the prospects we see of growing that business is the opportunity for consumers to serve themselves to us to be a big opportunity for us. As far as investment, we are investing. We were fortunate enough to have the capabilities in 2020 and '21 if you again go back to what we shared at Investor Day, we said we're investing about $75 million over a period over the last 2 years, 2021. Some portion of that is related to what we're discussing here. And so we're not rate limited by investments. We're rate limited by logistics time to get some traction, and we're very well positioned with the telehealth companies, very well positioned with the plans. And yes, we do see a change. And yes, this will allow us, again, to gain share as we go forward because they can't do this with tens of laboratories, they could all do with a select group like us. So we have another question?

Is some of the volume you're seeing coming down just because there are more of these point-of-care platforms out there and just as they ramp capacity, you're seeing volume shifting out of the central lab? That's the first question. 
And then I think the second question is, when you look at your -- you're at 100,000-ish test, you've got 300,000 capacity. How are you using -- how do you utilizing that capacity? Is it more -- are you ramping down your IVD platforms versus your LDT platforms? Just to assume that it's more of the IVD because the LDT are more profitable.

We believe in those tracking mechanisms, it's predominantly PCR. However, we think there could be some point-of-care antigen testing in there, but we believe it does not include all the testing metalogy. So if you look at it, look, happy for PCR testing throughout the United States and if you look at the excellence that are coming from least point-of-care and antigen providers, you see that the actual level of testing is almost at the same level that we were in the summer, but in different forms. So the answer to your question is, yes, there is a transition from PCR is exclusively what we have to more of the capabilities around [indiscernible] advantage to cover going back to what I said, all tests are not created equal. And so we're also working with clients to make sure they realize where interested to test it could be helpful for a period of time. And also what you need to reflex into PCR and where you can use floor care and costs are not all free equal. So it has come down because of what we described, but there continues to be a strong role for PCR through the remainder of '21 and also into '22."

When we gave the $7.48, as we said, we're expecting the base business to be fully recovered this year to be back to 2019 baseline and starting to grow. But depending on the pace of some of these initiatives that are being rolled out by several payers, not just United by Anthem and some of the other major players. Depending on the economy, depending on, obviously, potential expansion of covered lives. There's a lot of variables that we'll know a lot more about by the end of the year before we give guidance for 2022. So stronger recovery of the base business, good fact. I wouldn't say at this point that the faster decline in COVID testing yet necessarily implies anything for 2022 around our comments. Because we assumed it would still be around, and you heard from others as well. Nobody thinks is going away.

Quest had a strong first quarter with our base business continuing to recover to near pre-pandemic levels. Contributions from acquisitions and PLS relationships accelerated growth in the base business have helped offset the reduction in demand for COVID-19 testing, which was in line with industry trends. 
In March, for the first time since the pandemic began, monthly organic revenue in the base business grew versus our 2019 baseline. As we noted at our recent Investor Day, Quest is well positioned to grow as the U.S. exits the pandemic and people return to normal activities and address the routine care issues that have been neglected over the past year. 
Also, as you saw in our press release this morning, our Board of Directors increased the company's share repurchase authorization by $1 billion for the second time this year, and we expect to launch an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, in the amount of $1.5 billion in the coming days. 
This morning, I'll discuss our performance for the first quarter of 2021, provide perspective on industry dynamics and update you on our base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results. 
But before we get into the details of the quarter, we wanted to share our perspective on the ongoing role of COVID-19 testing more than a year into the pandemic as well as provide our thoughts on recent news regarding PAMA. 
COVID-19 testing remains critical as supplies of vaccine continue to be available to all Americans. Testing will help control the spread of the virus in addition to reducing hospitalization and saving lives. Continued testing will be key to helping segments of the economy reopen as more Americans become vaccinated. Vaccination is front and center in the minds of most people now and testing remains a critical element of safely returning to life. 
I'd also like to share our perspective on some of the most recent development regarding PAMA. So we're encouraged that MedPAC recently reported that it is exploring alternative data collection methods under PAMA that are less burdensome for laboratories. One of the alternatives mentioned is surveying a representative sample of independent hospitals and physician office laboratories instead of reporting all laboratories to submit data. 
We've been saying for years that CMS got the data collection process wrong and didn't follow the intent of Congress. MedPAC found that hospital outreach and physician office labs reported higher payer rates than independent labs, and that independent labs were overrepresented in the first round of PAMA data reported. We agree on both counts. 
The independent analysis by MedPAC also provides evidence that the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule would have been 10% to 15% higher if CMS had used a more representative sample that included more data from hospitals and physician office labs. The findings refute the claims that CMS collecting more hospital outpatient and physician office lab data would not have impacted the rate calculated by CMS. 
We believe that access to accurate and reliable testing remains critical, not just as part of our nation's ongoing response to the pandemic, but also for the millions of seniors who have delayed routine screening and care over the past year. We need to fix PAMA to avoid the Medtronic cost [indiscernible] in 2022 and to help ensure seniors have continued access to critical lab services they need and rely on.  
Additionally, we were disappointed by the recent dismissal by a U.S. district court of ACLA's challenge to PAMA. We are working with ACLA to determine next steps with respect to this litigation. We continue to work with policy makers to establish a clinical laboratory fee schedule that is truly representative of the full market and supports continued innovation and access in vital laboratory services as Congress originally intended.  
Now turning to our results for the first quarter. Total revenues grew by more than 49% to $2.7 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 375% on reported basis to $3.46 and nearly 300% on an adjusted basis to $3.76. Cash provided by operations nearly tripled to $731 million. 
As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, our base business performed at its highest level since the start of the pandemic and continue to recover throughout the quarter. Demand for COVID-19 testing slowed in the quarter, reflecting an industry-wide trend. We performed an average of 101,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the first quarter, which is well below our current capacity of approximately 300,000 tests per day. We are engaged on several fronts to bring needed testing to schools, businesses and industries by travel and entertainment, which rely on bringing people back together safely and in large numbers.  
With the current focus on schools, Quest is well positioned to help with our extensive logistics network as well as our ability to offer high quality, cost-effective classroom PCR testing using pooling. We want to help get kids back to school, and we're working with a range of partners to get it done quickly and efficiently. 
We continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We discussed our strategy in detail a few weeks ago at our Investor Day. So we thought today, we'll take you through a few highlights of the quarter. We are excited about our agreement to acquire the outreach laboratory services business of Mercy, one of the nation's most highly integrated multi-state health care systems, and as we indicated at Investor Day, we're having a board discussion with leaders of larger health systems like Mercy. 
The Mercy outreach laboratory services business currently operates from 31 hospitals and clinical laboratories serving providers and patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. And we're on track to complete this acquisition by midyear. 
Our professional laboratory services relationship with Hackensack Meridian Health began in January and is off to a good start contributing revenue for the quarter. We recently announced the sale of our 40% minority share in Q2 Solutions to IQVIA for $760 million. IQVIA had a strategic vision and ability to lead Q2 Solutions on the next phase of its journey as a global leader in essential lab services. And Quest will support it as a strategic lab partner. 
We've made good progress taking advantage of health plan access within the first quarter. UnitedHealthcare implemented an initiative removing out-of-network benefits for insured groups in selected states. We also [indiscernible] in redirection efforts with Anthem in 8 more states during the quarter. And we're seeing benefits from these initiatives.  
And then finally, we've renewed our long-standing strategic relationship with EmblemHealth to provide comprehensive clinical laboratory services for more than 3 million members of EmblemHealth and it's affiliate, ConnectiCare.  
Turning to our strategy to drive operational excellence. We are on track to once again deliver 3% savings across the business. In the process, we're also improving the customer experience and quality and in the quarter, we achieved year-over-year improvement in 14 of 19 top tier quality metrics, which we track to gauge our operational performance.  
Now I'll turn it over to Mark to provide more details on our financial performance. Mark?"

In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.72 billion, up 49% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 52% compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services and to a lesser extent continued recovery in our base testing revenue which increased versus the prior year. 
Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 25.6% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 4%. The impact of severe winter weather during the quarter negatively impacted volumes by approximately 2.5%. Compared to our first quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 1.5% and benefited from M&A and new PLS partnerships that began in 2020. Excluding the net impact of weather in the first quarter as well as M&A and new PLS wins over the last year, base testing volumes declined approximately 7% in the first quarter versus the 2019 baseline and down 5% in March. This represents more of a same-store view of the recovery in our base business since the pandemic began. 
While COVID-19 testing volumes declined faster than expected throughout Q1, the decline coincided with reduced demand across the industry. Importantly, these volumes have stabilized over the last several weeks. We resulted approximately 9.1 million molecular tests and nearly 900,000 serology tests, contributing nearly 21% to volume growth in Q1 versus the prior year. We exited the first quarter averaging approximately 73,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 8,000 serology tests per day. 
Revenue per requisition increased 20.5% versus the prior year, driven largely by COVID-19 testing. Modest unit price headwinds were in line with our expectations. 
Reported operating income in the first quarter was $660 million, or 24.3% of revenues compared to $175 million or 9.6% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q1 was $708 million or 26% of revenues compared to $225 million or 12.3% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by the strong revenue growth in the first quarter due to continued demand for COVID-19 testing and the ongoing recovery in our base business. 
Reported EPS was $3.46 in the quarter compared to $0.73 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.76 compared to $0.94 last year. 
Cash provided by operations was $731 million in the first quarter versus $247 million in 2020. We completed $410 million in share repurchases in Q1, and we ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Included in net proceeds from the Q Squared divestiture in April, we currently have more than $1.8 billion in cash available for deployment.  
Following the $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authority that we announced today, we now have the ability to execute approximately $2.5 billion in additional buybacks this year. We expect to launch an accelerated share repurchase transaction of approximately $1.5 billion in the coming days.  
Turning to guidance. We've updated our outlook for the first half of 2021 as follows: revenues expected to be between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, an increase of approximately 37% to 43% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.51 and $8.01 and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $6.30 and $6.80. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million.  
Before concluding, I'll briefly review some assumptions embedded in our updated first half outlook and considerations to think about for the remainder of 2021. We expect continued steady improvement in our base business throughout 2021. On a same-store view, excluding M&A and new PLS wins, we see the base business remaining slightly below our 2019 baseline in the second quarter. We continue to anticipate a full recovery in our base business compared to our 2019 baseline in the second half of 2021. 
We are assuming COVID-19 molecular testing volumes will average roughly 50,000 tests per day in Q2 and no meaningful change in COVID-19 serology testing volumes compared to Q1. Given the significant progress of vaccination in the U.S., we continue to expect the decline in clinical demand for COVID-19 molecular testing in the second half of 2021 versus our expectations for the first half. Return-to-life testing such as the K-12 school testing program should partially offset declining clinical demand later in the year. And while we continue to believe strongly in the value of COVID-19 serology testing, we are not assuming a material increase in demand for serology testing going forward.  
Finally, COVID-19 molecular reimbursement held relatively steady in the first quarter, and we currently expect this trend to continue through Q2, with the public health emergency being extended through mid-July. This is likely to trend lower in the second half of the year as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes shift from clinical diagnostic testing to return-to-life surveillance testing.  
I will now turn it back to Steve."

So we feel good about the discussions and the funnel of prospects we have for what we have characterize as our hospital strategy. There continues to be a lot of pressure on this great delivery systems. They are considering their last strategy is one of the options to help them. And we have a number of examples over the past 6 months delivering on the strategies that we've talked about for years. And so the answer to your question, we do see continuation of interest in the building funnel with more prospects to come. 
What we shared at Investor Day is we reaffirmed our outlook that we would grow through acquisition around 2% per year. What we shared is that we historically have delivered on that 3 years prior to '21. And we believe that's still a good guidance number for us for this year and going forward, it is implied in our outlook for growth.  
So finally, as we do see the trends in general, just like all health care around consolidation. We do see systems interested in thinking about what's most important to them and what's their strategy and Quest help them with their lab strategy. And likewise, we see, if you will, fewer and fewer in-network providers with the health plans. And if you want to think about that, that is a consolidation play as well. And when those 2 forces happening, there will be more share in the hands of fewer, and our plan is to gain share. So all the megatrends and changes that are happening in the industry, we believe have actually improved to support what we've said for some time, and that our view is both for what's happening with hospitals and also what's happening with health plans."

So geographically, we have seen good recovery in Texas and the South West. We're actually seeing, really in the last several weeks, starting a much better recovery in California in the West Coast, which is good news. We see the South East starting to recover and get us back to almost 2019 levels that we spoke to earlier. So I would say those are moving in the right direction. 
Now the offset to that is, one is you've seen the spikes and the hotspots in the Midwest and when that happens, there's lockdowns and people are concerned about going into health care delivery, that's going to affect our business. So we've seen some of that, let's say, in the Midwest. And then finally, the Northeast, and the Northeast, including New York and Pennsylvania and going into New England. It's still behind, and it's recovering slowly, but we're the most off, if you will, in the Northeast. So that's the geographic swing.  
As far as physician business versus hospital business, the hospital business is actually very close to where we were. We're encouraged by that. We see admissions getting back to '19 levels. We see all patient procedures getting back to '19 levels. So that business is tracking nicely compared to where we were. And then the physician side, it all depends on what site is physician. Primary care is starting to turn on. Oncology, particularly those that have postponed diagnosis and treatment for oncology starting to turn on. And at the same time, we still see our prescription drug monitoring business or mental health and behavioral health and drugs and abuse still down versus where we were in '19. And that's an issue that varies by state and we're working on that. 
So I gave you a feel for what's going geographically, what's going on by physician, but also by what we describe as our clinical franchises. Mark, anything you like to add to that?"

We continue to expect to have that ramp down, but the base business has recovered stronger, certainly more than an offset on the revenue side.  
In terms of the ASR, it is in the guidance. I just want to remind everyone that we had committed to $900 million in share repurchases that was already a guidance for the first half. We did $410 million in Q1. And then part of the ASR is related to the proceeds from the sale of our 40% ownership in our JV with IQVIA, and that is slightly accretive when you consider the loss of the equity earnings. So you need to look at over $600 million of the ASR as really offsetting the foregoing those equity earnings. We had already committed to $900 million in the previous guide in the first half. So almost $500 million there. So when you combine that, the share repurchases are really just up by several hundred million. So I want to make sure everyone is clear on the math there. So it is reflected in the guidance."

So if you go back to where we started off the year, what we said is we do expect COVID PCR testing to decline throughout the year and we mentioned in our remarks, we did see that in Q1, and we see it happening in the country. So as Mark said earlier, we do expect that continuing trend in Q2 and that will continue into the second half. 
Now with that all said, we do see this transition from what we said is more clinical uses of the PCR testing, rule in and rule out COVID from hospitals, rule in and rule out patients seeing their physicians and moving it to return-to-life activities, and there's a lot of activity around that, Jack. A lot of activity. I mentioned in the remarks, what's going on around schools. There's 2 funding mechanisms for that from the U.S. government. We've actively engaged with a number of, let's call it, systems integrators that will be coordinating the efforts beyond the laboratory testing. We're well positioned there. 
Secondly, corporations are now thinking about how they get people back physically into their places of work, maybe albeit not as full-time as they want for. But despite the vaccination progress, they're still going to be testing requirements with the return-to-work activities. And then let me just say, the entertainment piece of this is big, too. We see now sports teams want to put pants back in the stands. We see New York City interested in getting people back. The tourism as they get into the fall and turning back on the city. We mentioned in our prior remarks and other calls and meetings that we participated in this pilot study with New York to provide a check if you're willing to provide access for an individual over the course of the day. So that type of activity will be a larger portion of what we do for COVID testing in the back half. 
Now with all that said, we're not providing guidance for the back half, but we do see continued PCR testing in the back half, but it's going to change in its nature. And also we do believe COVID-19 testing and PCR testing will continue in '22. This is not going away fast."

I just wanted to get your take on sort of the PWN-Everlywell combination and if that changes any of your approach or the competitive dynamics in that space?"

So first of all, as you know, not all tests are created equal. And PCR still is the gold standard. And we do provide a solution with antigen testing, okay, as part of appropriate utilization of that testing, particularly for surveillance. But as we know, the antigen testing sensitivity and specificity is good for, let's say, day 2 through day 5 of a potentially infected person. But the PCR test is really the gold standard to rule out if someone has been exposed in the early days or rule out if they think they are exposed in the late days. And so the sensitivity and specificity we have with our PCR testing is quite good. And so physicians know that and therefore, that's why we're so confident that it will continue to be an important part of how we fight this pandemic. 
As far as the consumer, the consumer is trying to figure out to get easy access to testing. And they will get that access in a variety of forms. And by the way, our turnaround times now for PCR testing are much better on average than the 2-ish days that we often talk about several months ago. We're now delivering results in less than a day for many tests that come in. And the reason for that is, remember the remarks I made, we're testing about 101,000 tests per day, and we have approximately 300,000 per day for capacity. So that allows us to have much better turnaround times, which we believe, as that becomes more and more visible and people want to get good access to the gold standard, they're going to rely on those places they can get access. 
So we continue our relationships with retailers. We're expanding our relationship with CDS that has gone quite well. CDS is active on promoting good access to PCR testing around the drive ends, and Walmart as well. And then also with our direct-to-Quest capability that we talked about at our Investor Day, we have put on that platform, both PCR testing as well as serology testing. And we are seeing high levels of interest from a consumer perspective of what they could do simply by getting a collection kit in the mail and FedEx envelope to ship it back and have good turnaround time to start out with MyQuest. 
So that will continue to build. And the consumers, as they start to return to life in a safe way, want to be assured that even if they are vaccinated or if they have natural immunity, they are not walking into a situation that they might have been exposed in some ways because they fell through the cracks with all the caveats we have with the effectiveness of the vaccines, the questions about natural immunity, and then also with the new variants as well. So because of that, we keep on working on better and more efficient and easier ways for Americans to get access to PCR testing. And we've got now, I think, a lot of the chance to do that, and that will continue to be an opportunity for us in the back half."

And Steve, I'd like to add, I want to make sure that Matt and others understand how the surveillance works. And in this case, when you pool, you get the economics to where it's affordable to do more broadly and more regularly because we are going to be putting up to 10 individual samples in a single well. And so hence, the cost will be 10% or less per individual. And what you sacrifice is it's not a diagnostic because we're not going to have the individuals identified in that well. The school or the entity that provides us the sample will have pool that they will know in test tube X who the 10 people are. And if we come back to them with a positive result, they will apply a real diagnostic to those 10 individuals. 
So with that, we also don't have the obligation or the ability to retest. Whereas today, when we do pooling for clinical purposes, if we get a positive, we have to go back and retest the individual samples. So it actually is an inefficiency in our process. In order to get this to work, we don't do retesting of a sample. We don't have the capability of doing that. We notify the submitting entity that we had a positive in 1 of the pooled collection specimen tubes, and then they go forward and test those individuals."

So that $1.5 billion goes down to $1 billion incremental. A little over $600 million of that is the proceeds from our divestiture of our stake in Q Squared, that's slightly accretive, but not materially relative to the force majeure of the equity earnings there. So it's really less than $400 million of share repurchases that were incremental to what we guided to previously. And that is built into the updated guidance. 
In terms of implied operating margin, obviously, we have a range. So we can't answer that with precision. But if you take the midpoint, you can all do the math. As we get a lower mix of COVID testing at our assumption of the $100 reimbursement, obviously, realization in AWR that's less than that, but $100 price point. And that mix is toward the base business that will erode the margin slightly. But kind of the offset to that is as the base business recovers, we're very leveraged. So the variable drop-through on that base business recovery is certainly much higher than our enterprise and historical fully loaded operating margin, but it's not quite as high as the COVID PCR."

And if so, do you see that kind of like as an opportunity to accelerate sort of more narrow networks that will drive volumes toward you? And lastly, would that require any additional investments or you think you have the infrastructure for that already?"

So again, just to reiterate, first half, we delivered over 100,000 PCR COVID tests per day. We're assuming half that in Q2. So that's certainly contributing to the margin decline, as you talked about, implied in the guidance for the first half, implicitly in Q2. When you think about the base business, we're still uncertain how all those moving parts will play out in the second half, which is why we've not provided second half guidance that we want to wait until we can confidently give guidance that we're highly confident will be delivered. 
So what I would point to is that's the transition period, really look at our Investor Day and how we talked about 2022. And talking about getting our base business fully recovered by the end of this year, back to growth through the growth pillars and back to a margin level pre pandemic and then obviously improving beyond that, as we talked about a CAGR where our bottom line grows significantly faster than our top line by several hundred basis points. 
So we feel very confident in the earnings power of the base business. Certainly, we're going to have a step down from the pandemic bubble where we did several billion dollars of COVID testing last year and significant COVID testing this year. But the base business should be very healthy coming out of the pandemic. Once COVID testing drops to a minimal level, we'll be right back to the operating rhythm. Our expectation is that you saw early in 2019 when we were growing a business January, February, more than 5% on a volume basis, and you saw strong improvements in our operating margin. Steve?"

So as you'll recall in our Investor Day, we went through a walk, if you will, to bridge you from the pandemic years of '20 and '21 into '22. Mark went through chart with some math, which gave you kind of our indication for '2",591,"Yes. Yes. Just to transition. So as you'll recall in our Investor Day, we went through a walk, if you will, to bridge you from the pandemic years of '20 and '21 into '22. Mark went through chart with some math, which gave you kind of our indication for '22. And also, as I said earlier, is we do believe there would be some COVID testing, but the base business will be recovering and we'll get growth going forward in '22 based upon our outlook. 
So the last question you had, Ricky, it had to deal with the digital front end and digital-first and we're excited about this because we're very well positioned. This isn't something that we have just started working on. We've been working on it for a while. First of all, if you go back to a large provider like Quest, we're very much embedded in the ecosystem of connectivity already. We have over 500 interfaces of all the different electronic medical records, obviously, that's the big players like Epic and Cerner, but there's hundreds of others. And so therefore, we have a real strong interoperability capability. And that's helpful because when you're in the workflow, because from a physician perspective, it allows you to more streamline the different service offerings like laboratory to a fewer players. 
And then secondly, this past year, we've seen the acceptance, if you will, of telehealth. It has been growing nicely but out explosively, and we did see explosive growth in 2020 and we believe that overall, that acceptance, if you will, of that front end being an accepted way to first engage with the health care system will continue. And the payers are working on that and providers are working on that, and they're working with other partners, and we're very well positioned with those other partners. Who are those partners? Those partners are some of the telehealth companies that you know. And those telehealth companies, as they become much more embedded in health care delivery, let's call the digital Bradman, will rely on a fewer number of laboratory service providers, and therefore, we're very well positioned as more of a small handful of what just described as the preferred lab network that we are already with United, but for this new world that we see. 
And with all that, we do believe that our direct-to-consumer initiative will have an opportunity as well because consumers equally are wanting to engage with health care delivery. They not always need to engage with their physician. And therefore, with the prospects we see of growing that business and the opportunity for consumers to serve themselves, if you will, seems to be a big opportunity for us. 
As far as investment, we are investing. We were fortunate enough to have the capabilities in 2020 and '21. If you again go back to what we shared at Investor Day, we said we're investing about $75 million over a period -- over the last 2 years, 2021. Some portion of that is related to what we're discussing here. And so we're not rate limited by investments. We're rate limited by logistics time to get some traction, and we're very well positioned with the telehealth companies, very well positioned with the plans. And yes, we do see a change. And yes, this will allow us, again, to gain share as we go forward because they can't do this with tens of laboratories, they could only do it with a select group like us. 
So we have another question?"

One is, I was on the Danaher call just before this, and they actually pretty sharply raised their COVID testing guidance for the year and also surprisingly gave a very bullish outlook for 2022 and sort of backing that number. So I think the first question goes to is some of the -- this is a question on the point-of-care shifting from decentralized testing, shifting to point-of-care. Is some of the volume you're seeing coming down just because there are more of these point-of-care platforms out there and just as they ramp capacity, you're seeing volume shifting out of the central lab? That's the first question. 
And I think the second question is, when you look at your -- you're at 100,000-ish tests, you've got 300,000 capacity. How are you using -- how are you utilizing that capacity? Is it more -- are you ramping down your IVD platforms versus your LDT platforms? Just to assume that it's more of the IVD because the LDT isn't more profitable. But just would love some idea as like how you're utilizing your installed base."

So the first part, yes, we did see an increase in the availability and use of the antigen testing and point-of-care testing throughout the last 12 months. Clearly, it has picked up in the back half of 2020. We see that continue in '21. So if you look at the industry trackers on how much testing we are doing in this country, clearly, it has dropped off, and therefore, volumes have dropped up as well. We believe in those tracking mechanisms. It's predominantly PCR. However, we think there could be some point-of-care antigen testing in there, but we believe it does not include all the testing that's happening. 
So if you look at it, well, it is happening for PCR testing throughout the United States and if you look at the estimates that are coming from these point-of-care and antigen providers, you see that the actual level of testing is almost at the same level that we were in the summer, but in different forms. So the answer to your question is, yes, there is a transition from PCR as exclusively what we have to more of the capabilities around point-of-care or antigen testing. However, going back to what I said, all tests are not created equal. And so we're also working with clients to make sure they realize where antigen testing can be helpful for a period of time. And also when you need to reflex into PCR and where you can use point-of-care and costs are not all going to be equal. So it has come down because of what we described, but there continues to be a strong role for PCR through the remainder of '21 and also into '22."

So what we shared is we actually picked up some share over that period of time, but we have more share to gain. 
And there's a list of activities we're working with United to support picking up share and getting it to at least that 25% level, one of which is what we're providing is limiting the out-of-network policy and benefit design for their fully insured book. And where that has happened because we have other examples of the top, it get -- does move share to us. We don't provide specifics on states and specifics on how much that this contribute to a share. But it did have a nice impact for us to allow us to pick up share. And so we continue that in March. 
But I'll also share that we didn't share everything we're doing. We have many other programs, and some of this is working with their client sponsors, their employers, some of this is working with their regions, specific opportunities with providers. When we do an outreach purchase in relationship within the geography, we lose work out of this expensive venue to a less expensive venue, which is Quest, and all of those are active relationships that we have to continue to build share with United and other payers. Thus equally, we continue to work programs with Anthem and others."

When we gave the $7.48, as we said, we're expecting the base business to be fully recovered this year, to be back to 2019 baseline and starting to grow. But depending on the pace of some of these initiatives that are being rolled out by several payers, not just United, by Anthem and some of the other major players. Depending on the economy, depending on, obviously, potential expansion of covered lives. There's a lot of variables that we'll know a lot more about by the end of the year before we give guidance for 2022. 
So stronger recovery of the base business, good fact. I wouldn't say at this point that the faster decline in COVID testing yet necessarily implies anything for 2022 around our comments. Because we assumed it would still be around, and you heard from others as well. Nobody thinks it's going away.

Organic-based testing revenues grew compared to 2019 levels in the quarter. This is the first quarter since 2019 that organic base testing revenues grew. The growth was driven by contributions from new hospital lab management contracts as well as people returning to health care systems. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months. which is reflected in the outlook we have provided for the remainder of 2021. 
This morning, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter of 2021, provide perspective on industry dynamics and update you on our base business. And Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our outlook and underlying assumptions. 
First, with regard to COVID-19 testing. We are closely watching the rapid spread of the delta variant where our testing continues to help control the spread of the virus. In recent weeks, we have seen PCR volumes stabilize and begin to increase modestly. Positivity rates have increased and all the RPP served by our performing laboratories over the last 2 weeks. 
COVID-19 testing also remains critical as employees return to the workplace, and students to the classroom in a few weeks. And whilst we experienced another milestone, we expect people to return to pre-pandemic health care and in some cases, catch up with health care they might have postponed during the pandemic. 
Now I'll turn to PMO, the recent MedPAC report mandated under the LAB Act. We were pleased that MedPAC found it feasible to change the CMS data collection process to a statistically valid sample of private payer rates for independent labs, hospital labs and physician office labs. This approach would be produce an accurate representative market view of laboratory rates while reducing the burden of reporting laboratories, which is consistent with the charge of the Lab Act in the original tempos PAMA. 
The MedCAP report estimates that Medicare spending for the top 100 tests on the clinical fee schedule could increase by 10% to 15% over current rates based on certain rate and volume assumptions. 
And separately, our trade association recently appealed is legally challenged to PAMA, which was dismissed by the U.S. District Court in late March. Basically, as a certain site to challenge the regulatory overreach by HHS in the implementation of PAMA. 
Along with our trade association, we will continue to work with policymakers to establish a clinical ad-fee schedule that is truly representative of the market and supports continued innovation, and access to vital laboratory services for Medicare beneficiaries as Congress originally intended. Now is the time to strengthen our laboratory infrastructure and support continued access to high-quality lab services that patients depend on. 
Turning to our results for the second quarter. Total revenues grew by nearly 40% to $2.6 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 264% on a reported basis to $4.96, and nearly 124% on an adjusted basis to $3.18. Cash provided by operations increased by more than 30% to $460 million. 
In the second quarter, we continue to see a better-than-expected recovery in our base business with organic-based testing revenues essentially returning to pre-pandemic levels in June. We're seeing strong recovery in most of the country and a slower recovery in the Northeast. Demand for our COVID-19 testing slowed in the quarter as expected, reflecting an industry-wide trend on the last few weeks of June, demand stabilized and has since increased modestly, which we believe is attributable to some extent to the emergence of the delta area. 
We performed an average of 57,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the second quarter, well below our current capacity of approximately 300,000 tests per day. We have engaged with businesses in the travel and educated sectors in the quarter and working with partners to support a safe return of students to the classroom. 
We're also collaborating with CIC Health, Gingo Bioworks, Betel Memorial Institute to make testing easy, fast and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country. We continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. And here are some highlights from the second quarter. 
We continue to execute on our M&A strategy. In June, we announced the completion of our acquisition of an outreach laboratory services business of Mercy Health, one of the nation's most highly integrated multi-state health care systems with providers and patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. 
With this acquisition, we are on our way to grow our base business revenues approximately 2% from accretive strategic acquisitions this year, and with additional M&A opportunities in the second half of the year. We continue to grow our health plan business made progress in the quarter with value-based programs with UnitedHealthcare and Anthem. Our volumes of these health plans are growing faster than the company average. We have also invested an additional employee headcount to better support these important relationships. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to renew our long study contractual relationship with one of our largest health plan customers Aetna. We remain a preferred laboratory provider and partner of Aetna's network. 
In addition, for the first time in over a decade, Quest is one of Primark Delaware's in-network nonhospital-affiliated preferred labs, serving more than 450,000 members. It's good to be back in the market, competing on the basis of quality, service and value. We're helping all of us be focused on health care's AAA, a proving population health, enhancing the patient experience and reducing costs. And towards the end, we are launching a new campaign designed to remind customers that the value that Quest brings to health care. Our power and affordable care campaign speaks about our leadership in clinical innovation, our ability to enable better clinical outcomes for quality, speed and accuracy of test results, our improved patient experience with accessible easy to use patient resources, and finally, our ability to reduce cost of care. Base consumer-initiated testing revenues continued to grow in the quarter. Today, more than 17 million patients have an account on the MyQuest app and patient portal, with nearly 100,000 patients enrolling each week. 
In the 5 million advanced diagnostics, we're pleased to see full recovery in the growth drivers we're investing in, which we discussed at our recent Investor Day and are tracking to accelerate growth. 
Now turning to our second strategy. We made progress driving operational excellence. We're on scheduled to complete the full transition to our new flagship laboratory clip in New Jersey next month. This highly automated facility has consolidated tested previously performed in Teterboro, Baltimore and Philadelphia. There continues to be intent effort and energy around our invigorate productivity initiatives, and we're on track to deliver our targeted 3% improvement across the business. 
We are focused on getting paid for what we do. We have made steady progress in reducing payer denials. Also patient concessions for our base revenues were down in the second quarter to 2019 levels driven by a focus on collection improvements. 
One positive outcome of the pandemic has been the patient and physician acceptance of the digitization of our experience. We are more customer focused and efficient today with more self-serve options for customers, and we have moved a greater percentage of volumes to digital paperless transactions. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to provide more details on our financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mark?"

We also continue to incur expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address supply chain challenges and maintain staffing levels to ensure high levels of service and quality as the base business recovers faster than expected. We forecast these expenses to be approximately $30 million in the back half of the year. 
Finally, the low end of our outlook assumes an average of at least 20,000 COVID-19 molecular tests per day and 3,000 serology tests per day. It also assumes low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in the second half of '21 versus 2019. 
The midpoint of our guidance assumes slightly stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and a modestly faster recovery of the base business. And the high end of our guidance assumes both a greater level of COVID-19 testing and this will continue recovery in the base business. 
I will now turn it back to Steve."

And then the high end of guidance would be significantly more COVID testing and then a stronger base business recovery more in the mid-single digits revenue. So that's how we try to dementalize the range for you. 
In terms of labor pressure, we certainly saw some of that and we responded to it. And that's built into the whole year. It's not accelerating at this point in our outlook in the back half. So we have a process where we make annual salary and wage adjustments that was implemented earlier in the year. We certainly make some market adjustments per actually, which we've done, and that's not unusual. So there's nothing extraordinary in the back half of the year in terms of labor inflation."

I mentioned in my remarks, our advanced diagnostics business, which includes a portion of cancer and genetic motor testing to recovery. We still see our prescription drug monitoring and toxicology business being somewhat a little hybrid, but they're actually starting to recover, not back to '19 levels, but it's coming along. And then on a geographic basis, we do see much of the country of the after 90 levels. And as I said before, the Northeast is stubborn -- We see -- we started to move in the right direction, Massachusetts and Connecticut and New York City being the slowest recoverer, if you will, -- And that's all boroughs, not just been happening.

It will be invisible to you because there was no significant change in pricing. And in that contract, we continue to build stronger elements of what we call value-based programs, and I'll touch on that in a minute, Ricky. So it's more focused on commercial, although obviously, Medicare Advantage as well. There are certain things you can do in the pure commercial that are hard to do in Medicare Advantage because some of the rules around that program. But the framing is not us sharing our upside with them, but really, they're sharing their upside with us. So we win together. So as we show greater value for their membership by getting more work to a better value lab like ourselves relative to out-of-network providers or in some cases, other high-cost providers in network. They -- obviously, their members or for their fully insured book, they themselves, they might, and then we earn upside to a base level contract. And that base level contract is not at a discount. It's really been kind of historical levels. So we didn't have to give up in order to gain. But it was really more about the case that we've been making for years that's getting more and more buy-in from the payers that we're part of the solution. and working with us and not focusing on our price, but focusing on what we can do to drive better quality, better service and better value for their members is good for everybody in that ecosystem. 
So that's really the elements we shared. Steerage when they give us list of accounts where a lot of efforts going to out of network or higher-cost providers. We go in with their support [indiscernible] educate for the people who have [indiscernible] plans, coinsurance, et cetera. So the patients are bearing some of that higher cost, which obviously has more influence benefit that's fully covered by the payer in terms of the doctor. 
And then we talked about M&A incentives where in the past when we would buy hospital outreach as soon as we start billing fall to our price, obviously, and the huge windfall to the payers but that it's good for them if we buy outreach and therefore, instead of taking that head immediately, maybe a step down in those rates and we share some of those savings over those first couple of years. And that's an element we've gotten into just about every one of the major payer contracts. So it's things like that, Ricky, where we've made the case and they're finally buying in that when we're successful and they're successful, together, we can do more of that, and therefore, there is upside than in the past We didn't see that now we have a chance to earn when we prove that we've actually saved them money and drive an improvement for their members."

On the M&A, obviously, that would be somewhat invisible to you. because when we do a deal, what it just means is that we get paid more than we would have historically a little some of a premium over what our negotiated rates would be for the volume that clearly has moved from that hospital system to us, the hospital outreach.

And yes, we felt because of everything we knew at that point that it should be in the upper end of that $7 48. 
PAMA was absolutely included in that. As I shared, that at this point, if nothing changes, should be the last year of the sizable reductions that we've had since PAMA was implemented. So based on the current fee schedule and recurring methodology, there can be a 15% cut on any CPT code next year. And we estimate our overall book of business is going to be somewhere between 10% to 15%, so higher than 10% but less than 15% based on what we can see. However, because that traditional Medicare book of business is much smaller than it was when we started, the dollar impact is actually going to be similar to what it was in the first couple of years of PAMA. So it was still a large number, somewhere around 1% of our overall revenues. And then once you get beyond that, even if PAMA isn't fixed, based on our understanding of commercial pricing, we don't know everything, but certainly, we know our prices, and we've shared that we really stabilized commercial pricing, combined with some competitive intelligence in the marketplace, we feel that while there might be some cuts with a recalculation, they're going to be relatively small compared to what we incurred for several years."

We wanted to make sure that people also understood that COVID average per day, we anticipate for the balance year significantly lower than we're getting right now. As you might imagine, we've been working on this outlook for a while. The recent news with obviously delta driving up the positivity rate cases obviously, our volume is increasing. One thing we've also learned is not to overact the short term. So we're very transparent. So we give you those volumes every 2 weeks. So we felt that we can build reasonably deliverable, highly deliverable outlook to make clear what those assumptions are and especially around the COVID volumes, you're going to see that every 2 weeks. So you're going to know where we're going in terms of net outlook aims that we laid out this morning."

We did assume that the clinical testing would come down and the return to life testing would go off and a portion of that return to life as it has to do back-to-school programs. And what we highlighted is we've been working with the different partners were 2 programs that are funded with the funding for testing. One is the $600 million program $600 million program for return to school programs where we have partners to help us with that and school systems throughout the United States could apply for that money and get money to reimburse whatever program come up. And then there's a larger program to about $10 billion. 
But as you can understand, I mean, every school system throughout the United States is going to have its own plan. And so they're going to start ramping up soon than into the month of August and in September. And I think there is going to be a fair amount of variance across the United States and who does what, when. And I do believe that given what we see now with the Delta variant, I'm sure that will have some bearing on the need for testing to make sure that we're safe when is return back to school. And also return to office programs, we do expect that there will be more returning to the workplace, those people that have been working remotely. I think clearly, there's a high level of safety with that happening. And as I said earlier remarks, testing is vital to that. So we've embedded that in our expectations as well. But we assume that clinical testing would come down. We believe that a lot of our capacity is not used for the hospital portion of COVID testing as in the early days of COVID testing. And some of the recent increase that we've seen has been related to some of the effects we see from the Delta variant so far in the last week or [indiscernible].

Well, we had another strong quarter and continued to build momentum, thanks to faster-than-expected recovery in our base business.

Well, we had another strong quarter and continued to build momentum, thanks to faster-than-expected recovery in our base business. 
Organic-based testing revenues grew compared to 2019 levels in the quarter. This is the first quarter since 2019 that organic base testing revenues grew. The growth was driven by contributions from new hospital lab management contracts as well as people returning to health care systems. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months, which is reflected in the outlook we have provided for the remainder of 2021.  
This morning, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter of 2021, provide perspective on industry dynamics and update you on our base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our outlook and underlying assumptions.  
First, with regard to COVID-19 testing. We are closely watching the rapid spread of the Delta variant, where our testing continues to help control the spread of the virus. In recent weeks, we have seen PCR volumes stabilize and begin to increase modestly. Positivity rates have increased in all the geographies serviced by our performing laboratories over the last 2 weeks. 
COVID-19 testing also remains critical as employees return to the workplace, and students return to the classroom in a few weeks. And whilst we experienced another milestone, we expect people to return to pre-pandemic health care and, in some cases, catch up with health care they might have postponed during the pandemic.  
Now turning to PAMA and the recent MedPAC report mandated under the LAB Act. We were pleased that MedPAC found it feasible to change the CMS data collection process to a statistically valid sample of private payer rates from independent labs, hospital labs and physician office labs. This approach would produce an accurate, representative market view of laboratory rates, while reducing the burden of reporting laboratories, which is consistent with the charge of the LAB Act in the original intent of PAMA.  
The MedPAC report estimates that Medicare spending for the top 100 tests on the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule could increase by 10% to 15% over current rates based on certain rate and volume assumptions. And separately, our trade association recently appealed  its legal challenge to PAMA, which was dismissed by the U.S. District Court in late March. ACLA has asserted its right to challenge the regulatory overreach by HHS in the implementation of PAMA.  
Along with our trade association, we will continue to work with policymakers to establish a Clinical Lab Fee Schedule that is truly representative of the market and supports continued innovation and access to vital laboratory services for Medicare beneficiaries, as Congress originally intended. Now is the time to strengthen our laboratory infrastructure and support continued access to high-quality lab services that patients depend on.  
Turning to our results for the second quarter. Total revenues grew by nearly 40% to $2.6 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 264% on a reported basis to $4.96 and nearly 124% on an adjusted basis to $3.18. Cash provided by operations increased by more than 30% to $460 million.  
In the second quarter, we continue to see a better-than-expected recovery in our base business, with organic-based testing revenues essentially returning to pre-pandemic levels in June. We're seeing strong recovery in most of the country and a slower recovery in the Northeast. Demand for our COVID-19 testing slowed in the quarter as expected, reflecting an industry-wide trend, though on the last few weeks of June, demand stabilized and has since increased modestly, which we believe is attributable to some extent to the emergence of the Delta variant.  
We performed an average of 57,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the second quarter, well below our current capacity of approximately 300,000 tests per day. We have engaged with businesses in the travel and entertainment sectors in the quarter, and working with partners to support a safe return of students to the classroom. We're also collaborating with CIC Health, Ginkgo Bioworks, Battelle Memorial Institute to make testing easy, fast and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country. 
We continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. And here are some highlights from the second quarter. 
We continue to execute on our M&A strategy. In June, we announced the completion of our acquisition of an outreach laboratory services business with Mercy Health, one of the nation's most highly integrated multi-state health care systems with providers and patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.  With this acquisition, we are on our way to grow our base business revenues approximately 2% from accretive strategic acquisitions this year, and with additional M&A opportunities in the second half of the year. 
We continue to grow our health plan business, and made progress in the quarter with value-based programs with UnitedHealthcare and Anthem. Our volumes of these health plans are growing faster than the company average. We have also invested an additional employee headcount to better support these important relationships. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to renew our long-standing contractual relationship with one of our largest health plan customers, Aetna. We remain a preferred laboratory provider and partner of Aetna's network. In addition, for the first time in over a decade, Quest is one of Highmark Delaware's in-network nonhospital-affiliated preferred labs, serving more than 450,000 members. 
It's good to be back in the market, competing on the basis of quality, service and value. We're helping all of us be focused on health care's Triple Aim of improving population health, enhancing the patient experience and reducing costs. And towards that aim, we are launching a new campaign designed to remind customers of the value that Quest brings to health care. 
Our Powering Affordable Care campaign speaks about our leadership in clinical innovation; our ability to enable better clinical outcomes for quality, speed and accuracy of test results; our improved patient experience with accessible, easy-to-use patient resources; and finally, our ability to reduce cost of care. 
Base consumer-initiated testing revenues continued to grow in the quarter. Today, more than 17 million patients have an account on the MyQuest app and patient portal, with nearly 100,000 patients enrolling each week. Finally, in Advanced Diagnostics, we're pleased to see full recovery in the growth drivers we're investing in, which we discussed at our recent Investor Day and are tracking to accelerate growth.  
Now turning to our second strategy. We made progress driving operational excellence. We're on schedule to complete the full transition to our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey next month. This highly automated facility has consolidated testing previously performed in Teterboro, Baltimore and Philadelphia. 
There continues to be intense effort and energy around our Invigorate productivity initiatives, and we're on track to deliver our targeted 3% improvement across the business. We are focused on getting paid for what we do, and have made steady progress in reducing payer denials. Also, patient concessions for our base revenues were down in the second quarter to 2019 levels, driven by a focus on collection improvements.  
One positive outcome of the pandemic has been the patient and physician acceptance of the digitization of our experience. We are more customer-focused and efficient today with more self-serve options for customers, and we have moved a greater percentage of volumes to digital paperless transactions.  
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to provide more details on our financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mark?"

In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base",853,"Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base testing revenue, slightly offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of last year.  
Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew nearly 5% in the second quarter, and it was up more than 1%, excluding acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of acquisitions, increased 45.2% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing approximately 5%. Compared to our second quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased nearly 7%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 2% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped up over the last year.  
Importantly, compared to our 2019 baseline, our base testing volumes were nearly fully recovered in June. However, as Steve noted earlier, the geographic recovery continues to be somewhat uneven, with positive growth across most of the U.S., except the minorities which remains below the 2019 baseline. With that said, we continue to see steady recovery in the Northeast. 
The COVID-19 testing volumes continue to decline, as expected, in Q2, in line with broader trends across the industry. We resolved an approximately 5.2 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the second quarter. COVID-19 testing volumes stabilized over the last several weeks, and we averaged approximately 43,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 7,000 serology tests per day in the last 2 weeks of June. 
Revenue per acquisition declined 3.6% versus the prior year, driven largely by recent PLS wins and acquisitions. Combined, these 2 factors amounted to a decline of nearly 5% in revenue per rec in the quarter. Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with expectations. 
Reported operating income in the second quarter was $533 million or 20.9% of revenues compared to $283 million or 15.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q2 was $584 million or 22.9% of revenues compared to $294 million or 16.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by the strong revenue growth in the second quarter due primarily to the ongoing recovery in our base business. 
Reported EPS was $4.96 in the quarter compared to $1.36 a year ago. The second quarter of 2021 benefited from the gain on the sale of our minority ownership interest in Q Squared Solutions in April. Adjusted EPS was $3.18 compared to $1.42 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.2 billion through June year-to-date versus $602 million in the same period last year, which included $65 million from the CARES Act funding that we eventually returned to the government later in 2020. 
Turning to guidance. We have established our full year 2021 outlook as follows: revenues expected to be between $9.54 billion and $9.79 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 4% versus the prior year; reported EPS expected to be in a range of $11.48 and $12.18, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $10.65 and $11.35; cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.9 billion; and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. 
Before concluding, I'll briefly review some assumptions embedded in our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Our outlook continues to assume a decline in clinical demand for COVID-19 molecular testing throughout the back half of the year. Return-to-life testing, such as the K-12 school testing program, could partially offset declining clinical demand later in the year. 
Reimbursement for clinical COVID-19 molecular testing continues to hold relatively steady. We currently expect this trend to continue, assuming the public health emergency is extended throughout 2021. However, average reimbursement is likely to trend lower in the second half as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes shift from clinical diagnostic testing to return-to-life surveillance testing. 
As you consider the EPS outlook we have shared today, keep in mind the following. At our Investor Day in March, we discussed making approximately $75 million in targeted investments to support our long-term strategies to accelerate growth. These investments are ramping, with $50 million expected to fall in the second half. 
We also continue to incur expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address supply chain challenges and maintain staffing levels to ensure high levels of service and quality as the base business recovers faster than expected. We forecast these expenses to be approximately $30 million in the back half of the year.  
Finally, the low end of our outlook assumes an average of at least 20,000 COVID-19 molecular tests per day and 3,000 serology tests per day. It also assumes low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in the second half of '21 versus 2019. The midpoint of our guidance assumes slightly stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and a modestly faster recovery of the base business. And the high end of our guidance assumes both a greater level of COVID-19 testing and the strong continued recovery in the base business.  
I will now turn it back to Steve."

Of course, there's moving pieces because it's also dependent on how the base business moves. And then the high end of guidance would be significantly more COVID testing. And then the stronger base business recovery, more in the mid-single digits revenue. So that's how we try to dimensionalize the range for you. 
In terms of labor pressure, we certainly saw some of that, and we responded to it. And that's built into the whole year. It's not accelerating at this point in our outlook in the back half. So we have a process where we make annual salary and wage adjustments that was implemented earlier in the year. 
We certainly make some market adjustments periodically, which we've done, and that's not unusual. So there's nothing extraordinary in the back half of the year in terms of labor inflation."

So we feel we're actually getting some traction with everything we've put in place. And I can tell you, the engagement between us and those organizations are quite good. 
And I've said before in my remarks, we see an opportunity to get a variation to move with a high-quality, low-cost, high-value laboratory like Quest Diagnostics and then tighten up the network to what we described as support lab network.

If you remember, we entered the half with our base business being down somewhat, around high single digits, and kind of improved throughout Q1 and that continued into Q2. And yes, there's different ways we look at it, one is the clinical cost. 
And we actually see good recovery in our general health business, in our cardiometabolic business. I mentioned in my remarks our Advanced Diagnostics business, which includes a portion of cancer and genetic molecular testing to recovery. We still see our prescription drug monitoring and toxicology business being somewhat a little hybrid, but they're actually starting to recover, not back to '19 levels, but it's coming along. 
And then on a geographic basis, we do see much of the country are back to '19 levels. And as I said before, the Northeast is stubborn. We see -- yes, we have started to move in the right direction. Massachusetts and Connecticut and New York City being the slowest recoverer, if you will, and that's all boroughs, not just Manhattan. 
And we're hopeful, as the opening continues, as people get back into life within Manhattan and New York that, that will recover as well. So to answer your question we started with, it has a more of a nice steady progression clinically and also geographically. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that?"

And then when we think about the value-based programs that you're now signing with payers, I think, Steve, you mentioned that it's actually growing faster than the rest of your book. Can you maybe give us some color on whether you're seeing these value-based relationships are mostly focused on commercial versus Medicare? 
And also, what's the framework? Are you sharing upside from the savings? Or are these more sort of fixed-price contracts with some downside protection?"

It will be invisible to you because there was no significant change in the pricing. And in that contract, we continue to build stronger elements of what we call value-based programs, and I'll touch on that in a minute, Ricky. 
So it's more focused on commercial, although, obviously, Medicare Advantage as well. There are certain things you can do in the purely commercial that are hard to do in Medicare Advantage because of some of the rules around that program. But the framing is not us sharing our upside with them, but really, they're sharing their upside with us. So we win together. 
So as we show greater value for their membership by getting more work to a better-value lab, like ourselves, relative to out-of-network providers or, in some cases, other high-cost providers in-network, they -- obviously, their members, or for their fully insured book, they, themselves, they might. And then we earn upside to a base level contract, and that base level contract is not at a discount. It's really been kind of the historical levels. 
So we didn't have to give up in order to gain. But it was really more about the case that we've been making for years that's getting more and more buy-in from the payers that were part of the solution. And working with us and not focusing on our price, but focusing on what we can do to drive better quality, better service and better value for their members is good for everybody in that ecosystem. 
So that's really the elements we've shared with steerage, where they give us list of accounts. Where a lot of our efforts is going to out-of-network or higher-cost providers, we go in with their support, to call them and speak for the people who have, again, I talked, plans, coinsurance, et cetera. So the patients are bearing some of that higher cost, which, obviously, has more influence benefit if they're fully covered by the payer in terms of the doctor. 
And then we talked about M&A incentives, where, in the past, when we would buy hospital outreach as soon as we start billing in, it falls to our product price, obviously, and a huge windfall to the payers. But that it's good for them if we buy outreach and, therefore, instead of taking that hit immediately, maybe a step down in those rates. And we share some of those savings over those first couple of years. And that's an element we've gotten into just about every one of the major payer contracts. 
So it's things like that, Ricky, where we've made the case and they're finally buying in that, when we're successful and they're successful, together, we can do more of that. And therefore, there is upside than in the past we didn't see, that now we have a chance to earn when we prove that we've actually saved them money and driven improvement for their members."

And so obviously, the pandemic has clouded issues with the base business. And at some point, we all hoped COVID is a much smaller piece of our revenues. And the base business CAGR that we laid out would have suggested $7.40 to $8. And what we were saying is, based on a base business being fully recovered by the end of the year and everything else, that we we're confident we should be in that range. And yes, we felt because of everything we knew at that point that it should be in the upper end of that $7.40 to $8. 
PAMA was absolutely included in that. As I shared that, at this point, if nothing changes, should be the last year of the sizable reductions that we've had since PAMA was implemented. So based on the current fee schedule and recurring methodology, there can be a 15% cut on any CPT code next year. And we estimate our overall book of business is going to be somewhere between 10% to 15%, so higher than 10% but less than 15% based on what we can see. 
However, because that traditional Medicare book of business is much smaller than it was when we started, the dollar impact is actually going to be similar to what it was in the first couple of years of PAMA. So it was still a large number, somewhere around 1% of our overall revenues. 
And then once you get beyond that, even if PAMA isn't fixed, based on our understanding of commercial pricing, we don't know everything, but certainly, we know our prices. And we've shared that we really stabilized commercial pricing, combined with some competitive intelligence in the marketplace. We feel that, while there might be some cuts with a recalculation, they're going to be relatively small compared to what we incurred for several years."

Yes, that's entirely consistent with what we teed up at Investor Day around our growth platforms. We're investing in those health plans, relationships with hospital, opportunities we see. We see opportunities to accelerate Advanced Diagnostics, and we feel good about the recovery we've seen there. And then also, the opportunity we see around the consumer and consumer-initiated testing. 
So our performance was allowing us to make these investments to accelerate growth, to get to that outlook that we provided to you for '22 and beyond, which is the 4% to 5% top line growth and high single-digit earnings growth. So we feel good about our ability to make those investments, and we're are making them. So we're hiring the people, we're spending the money, and it's included in the guidance in the back half."

So what I wanted to do was make clear the low end for a lot of reasons. You can imagine, we wanted to make people understand how we might get to that low end. And it's not a base business recovery that stalls or goes backwards. So it's really a much slower than what we've seen and that we would expect. 
And we don't think there's a high probability for that. But one thing we've learned in this pandemic is, all these things are somewhat volatile and hard to predict. If you saw a lot of retrenchments across the country because of the Delta variant or other things that might cause geographies to shut down, we want to make sure that we provide you guidance that 95%-plus deliverable or even more. 
So once you get beyond the floor, there's so many different moving parts that could go in opposite directions. It's kind of hard to give you a point estimate. We wanted to make sure that people also understood that the COVID average per day, we anticipate, for the balance year, is significantly lower than we're getting right now. 
As you might imagine, we've been working on this outlook for a while. The recent news with the, obviously, Delta driving up the positivity rate cases, obviously, our volume is increasing. One thing we've also learned is not to overreact to short term. So we're very transparent. So we give you those volumes every 2 weeks. 
So we felt that we can build reasonably deliverable, highly deliverable outlook. We make clear what those assumptions are. And especially around the COVID volumes, you're going to see that every 2 weeks. So you're going to know where we're going in terms of the net outlook or aims that we laid out this morning."

So [ in our guidance ], Mark just laid out the expectations around COVID testing. We did assume that the clinical testing would come down and the return-to-life testing would go up. And a portion of that return-to-life testing has to do back-to-schoo",359,"Yes. So [ in our guidance ], Mark just laid out the expectations around COVID testing. We did assume that the clinical testing would come down and the return-to-life testing would go up. And a portion of that return-to-life testing has to do back-to-school programs. And what we highlighted is we've been working with the different partners with 2 programs that are funded with the funding for testing. 
One is the $600 billion program -- $600 million program for return-to-school programs, where we have partners to help us with that. And school systems throughout the United States could apply for that money and get money to reimburse whatever program they come up. And then there's a larger program of about $10 billion. But as you can understand, and I mean, every school system throughout the United States is going to have its own plan. 
And so they're going to start ramping up soon, then into the month of August and then September. And I think there is going to be a fair amount of variance across the United States on who does what, when. And I do believe that, given what we see now with the Delta variant, I'm sure that will have some bearing on the need for testing to make sure that we're safe when kids return back to school. 
And also, return-to-office programs. We do expect that there will be more returning to the workplace, those people that have been working remotely. I think, clearly, there's a heightened level of safety with that happening. And as I said in my earlier remarks, testing is vital to that. So we've embedded that in our expectations as well. 
But we assume that clinical testing would come down. We believe that a lot of our capacity is not used for the hospital portion of COVID testing as in the early days of COVID testing. And some of the recent increase that we've seen has been related to some of the effects we see from the Delta variant, so far, in the last week of June. So hopefully, I provided some color on what's assumed in the guidance so far."

I just want to remind everybody how that surveillance testing works. It's very different than our clinical testing. So if you think about TPR tests today, where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we hav",362,"Yes. I just want to remind everybody how that surveillance testing works. It's very different than our clinical testing. So if you think about TPR tests today, where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we have come up with on the numbers side as well, our methodology is a heavily pooled approach. We pool a handful of samples today when we're testing in low positivity regions for economic reasons. 
But it's our responsibility if we have a positivity retest of those individual samples. So you don't want to pool too many because the math suggests that you're going to be retesting a lot of samples. And so when you go to surveillance, the assumption is that nobody has it. And so therefore, you're going to do a lot less retesting. 
But actually, in this case, we're not obligated to do it because they're not even identified. So what happens is, the collection is done. The entity, in this case, or school knows whose 10 samples, let's say, are in that specimen collection device. It's not shared with us. All we do is test it, and we say this group is negative, hopefully. And in the case where it's positive, then they, the administrators know which students need to be retested. And then that's a separate order, that's a separate payment, et cetera. 
And so the reason that's important is that in order to make this economic and because of the economies of scale we get with a huge pooling, we have to do approximately 10 specimens to equate to a single one for our core PCR business. So the volumes have to be tenfold to have the same dollar value to our top line. 
So yes, there's absolutely some contracts we won. We've got some of that volume. But to really move the needle, it has to be really broadly endorsed and embraced. And while the funding is there, to this point, we've seen some momentum, but not enough to be significant at this point and really move the needle to offset the decline in the clinical testing we've seen over the last several months."

And then another question that keeps coming up. In contrast to where you're guiding to, we just got off the Banner call, and they're talking about -- they did -- they went from 10 million COVID point-of-care tests in the first quarter to 14 million point-of-care tests in the second quarter. So one of the questions we continually get on the central labs is the impact, longer-term, on the business on point-of-care testing is, is this trend going to continue, particularly given the number of players that are sort of entering this market from the point-of-care and at-home space? So I'd love to get your general thoughts on sort of your spot on volume shifts to certain applications into the point-of-care market."

So yes, what we said is our general health and our cardiometabolic testing, which is sometimes referred to by us as our General Diagnostics, and I would say, the industry sometimes says routine. Routine has recovered nicely, and that's throughout the United States, a nice recovery there. 
Second, as you asked about oncology, we've seen good recovery in our AP business and pathology business. And as I said in my remarks, our Advanced Diagnostics business, which is our definition of sometimes called esoteric, that has actually recovered nicely. And we are making investments there, and we think we're tracking well against our investment and accelerated growth plans. So we feel good about that. 
And the second question, which has to do with point of care. And when I say point of care, this is the PCR point of care and then also the antigen test. We do believe there's some portion of the testing demand, if you will, that was -- that's taking place with these new approaches. We do believe there is a place that will return to workflow for PCR and antigen testing and some of the point-of-care applications. 
Well, equally, what you see with our volumes. that's somewhat stabilized, as you saw in the second quarter when we reported our numbers and the modest increase that we saw. Yes, PCR continues to be the gold standard. And so in many cases, they do retest back to the PCR testing when there is a positive for sure and a questionable negative matrix, not the false negative. So we do believe we have a good place in the marketplace, and we do believe there is a place for point-of-care devices, including antigen as well as PCR going forward."

And also there are more -- each of them have more concentration in certain geographies. So as we shared, the Northeast and, specifically, New York City is growing at a different rate. So you could assume that payer there, more membership there, we might have a different answer than the payers that are in Texas or Florida, let's say, or even California. 
So we've looked at -- because it's one of our key -- we have a process we call the [ quotients ], and we have these breakthrough objectives. One of them is growing our share in these health plans, and we look at it regularly. And we share our creation back and forth to understand kind of our share of wallet with those. And so we have a chance to see, as they themselves also are recovering, in terms of the volume that comes into membership, whether we seem to be growing at the same pace in that recovery. 
And that's the basis for, I'd say, that we're growing faster. So in this business, a couple hundred basis points is a big difference. It's not going to be 10% or double-digit kind of differential, but a couple hundred basis points means that share growth is meaningful. 
And it's clearly what we saw before the pandemic started, as we look back to our 2019 performance,  what we shared in the first 2 months of 2020. So once the business utilization becomes fully recovered, we're confident that we'll get back to that, not just historical growth of market, but finally getting to growth above that by share gains.

So take toxicology and prescription drug monitoring, the payers, as that was starting to grow, and there was some concern on the payers' part around the behavior of some of the providers. They put in some really onerous rules in place, such as pre-authorization and so on. Of course, that impacts everybody, including the people like ourselves, who are very responsible around our panels and how we conduct ourselves. 
And so we went to some of the payers, talked to them about that and said, ""Hey, not only is that not right for us, it's not right for the patients because it's going to be -- it will make it more difficult for them to get testing they need. But also, if you got rid of that, you would actually steer more work to the good labs."" And what I say, it's not just certainly our key competitors, there's some others are just like us, they're very responsible. We do good work in jobs calling prescription drug monitoring. 
So they put in rules in place where we're actually exempted from pre-auth. So that's another example where it's really not an investment. It's an investment of time to work with them, to get them to understand and get them to change some of these rules and behaviors. But again, as an example, where we're benefiting, but so are the patients and a lot of other people because in -- it's a more thoughtful approach to rules around lab testing."

And then in that facility, we have implemented a lot of the new systems that's been in place in our new immunoassay platform from Siemens. We talked about, it's a big investment for us. We are getting some pretty good -- the gains from -- so more to come. [ Facilities ], we've put in place new front-end automation and through-the-lab automation with our partner, Inpeco. And actually, Siemens has done the systemization with that as well. 
So we're -- we are pleased with the progress made so far, and we're looking forward to more productivity from that going forward as we continue to bring in systems and work out some of the early details. And that -- those improvements are already part of the 3% productivity gains that we have in our operational excellence program and are already included in our outlook that we provided at Investor Day. 
Okay. So thank you, everyone, for this call, and we appreciate your continued support. You all have a great day."

Well, we had another strong quarter and continue to build momentum, thanks to faster-than-expected recovery in our base business. 
Organic base testing revenues grew compared to 2019 levels in the quarter. This is the first quarter since 2019 that organic base testing revenues grew. The growth was driven by contributions from new hospital lab management contracts as well as people returning to health care systems. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months, which is reflected in the outlook we have provided for the remainder of 2021. 
This morning, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter of 2021, provide perspective on industry dynamics and update you on our base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our outlook and underlying assumptions. 
First, with regard to COVID-19 testing. We are closely watching the rapid spread of the Delta variant, where our testing continues to help control the spread of the virus. In recent weeks, we have seen PCR volumes stabilize and begin to increase modestly. Positivity rates have increased in all geographies served by our performing laboratories over the last 2 weeks. 
COVID-19 testing also remains critical as employees return to the workplace, and students return to the classroom in a few weeks. And whilst we experienced another milestone, we expect people to return to pre-pandemic health care and, in some cases, catch up with health care they might have postponed during the pandemic. 
Now turning to PAMA and the recent MedPAC report mandated under the LAB Act. We were pleased that MedPAC found it feasible to change the CMS data collection process to a statistically valid sample of private payer rates for independent labs, hospital labs and physician office labs. This approach would produce an accurate, representative market view of laboratory rates, while reducing the burden of reporting laboratories, which is consistent with the charge of the LAB Act in the original intent of PAMA. 
The MedPAC report estimates that Medicare spending for the top 100 tests on the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule could increase by 10% to 15% over current rates based on certain rate and volume assumptions. And separately, our trade association recently appealed its legal challenge to PAMA, which was dismissed by the U.S. District Court in late March. ACLA has asserted its right to challenge the regulatory overreach by HHS in the implementation of PAMA. 
Along with our trade association, we will continue to work with policymakers to establish a Clinical Lab Fee Schedule that is truly representative of the market and supports continued innovation and access to vital laboratory services for Medicare beneficiaries, as Congress originally intended. Now is the time to strengthen our laboratory infrastructure and support continued access to high-quality lab services that patients depend on. 
Turning to our results for the second quarter. Total revenues grew by nearly 40% to $2.6 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 264% on a reported basis to $4.96 and nearly 124% on an adjusted basis to $3.18. Cash provided by operations increased by more than 30% to $460 million. 
In the second quarter, we continue to see a better-than-expected recovery in our base business, with organic base testing revenues essentially returning to pre-pandemic levels in June. We're seeing strong recovery in most of the country and a slower recovery in the Northeast. Demand for our COVID-19 testing slowed in the quarter as expected, reflecting an industry-wide trend, though the last few weeks of June, demand stabilized and has since increased modestly, which we believe is attributable to some extent to the emergence of the Delta variant. 
We performed an average of 57,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the second quarter, well below our current capacity of approximately 300,000 tests per day. We have engaged with businesses in the travel and entertainment sectors in the quarter, and working with partners to support a safe return of students to the classroom. We're also collaborating with CIC Health, Ginkgo Bioworks, Battelle Memorial Institute to make testing easy, fast and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country. 
We continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. And here are some highlights from the second quarter. 
We continue to execute on our M&A strategy. In June, we announced the completion of our acquisition of an outreach laboratory services business with Mercy Health, one of the nation's most highly integrated multi-state health care systems with providers and patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. With this acquisition, we are on our way to grow our base business revenues approximately 2% from accretive strategic acquisitions this year, and with additional M&A opportunities in the second half of the year. 
We continue to grow our health plan business, and made progress in the quarter with value-based programs with UnitedHealthcare and Anthem. Our volumes of these health plans are growing faster than the company average. We have also invested an additional employee headcount to better support these important relationships. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to renew our long-standing contractual relationship with one of our largest health plan customers, Aetna. We remain a preferred laboratory provider and partner of Aetna's network. In addition, for the first time in over a decade, Quest is one of Highmark Delaware's in-network nonhospital-affiliated preferred labs, serving more than 450,000 members. 
It's good to be back in the market, competing on the basis of quality, service and value. We're helping all of us be focused on health care's Triple Aim of improving population health, enhancing the patient experience and reducing costs. And towards that aim, we are launching a new campaign designed to remind customers of the value that Quest brings to health care. 
Our Powering Affordable Care campaign speaks about our leadership in clinical innovation; our ability to enable better clinical outcomes for quality, speed and accuracy of test results; our improved patient experience with accessible, easy-to-use patient resources; and finally, our ability to reduce cost of care. 
Base consumer-initiated testing revenues continued to grow in the quarter. Today, more than 17 million patients have an account on the MyQuest app and patient portal, with nearly 100,000 patients enrolling each week. Finally, in Advanced Diagnostics, we're pleased to see full recovery in the growth drivers we're investing in, which we discussed at our recent Investor Day and are tracking to accelerate growth. 
Now turning to our second strategy. We made progress driving operational excellence. We're on schedule to complete the full transition to our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey next month. This highly automated facility has consolidated testing previously performed in Teterboro, Baltimore and Philadelphia. 
There continues to be intense effort and energy around our Invigorate productivity initiatives, and we're on track to deliver our targeted 3% improvement across the business. We are focused on getting paid for what we do, and have made steady progress in reducing payer denials. Also, patient concessions for our base revenues were down in the second quarter to 2019 levels, driven by a focus on collection improvements. 
One positive outcome of the pandemic has been the patient and physician acceptance of the digitization of our experience. We are more customer-focused and efficient today with more self-serve options for customers, and we have moved a greater percentage of volumes to digital paperless transactions. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to provide more details on our financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mark?"

In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base",852,"Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base testing revenue, slightly offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of last year. 
Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew nearly 5% in the second quarter, and it was up more than 1%, excluding acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of acquisitions, increased 45.2% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing approximately 5%. Compared to our second quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased nearly 7%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 2% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped up over the last year. 
Importantly, compared to our 2019 baseline, our base testing volumes were nearly fully recovered in June. However, as Steve noted earlier, the geographic recovery continues to be somewhat uneven, with positive growth across most of the U.S., except the minorities which remains below the 2019 baseline. With that said, we continue to see steady recovery in the Northeast. 
COVID-19 testing volumes continue to decline as expected in Q2, in line with broader trends across the industry. We resolved an approximately 5.2 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the second quarter. COVID-19 testing volumes stabilized over the last several weeks, and we averaged approximately 43,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 7,000 serology tests per day in the last 2 weeks of June. 
Revenue per acquisition declined 3.6% versus the prior year, driven largely by recent PLS wins and acquisitions. Combined, these 2 factors amounted to a decline of nearly 5% in revenue per req in the quarter. Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with expectations. 
Reported operating income in the second quarter was $533 million or 20.9% of revenues compared to $283 million or 15.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q2 was $584 million or 22.9% of revenues compared to $294 million or 16.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by the strong revenue growth in the second quarter due primarily to the ongoing recovery in our base business. 
Reported EPS was $4.96 in the quarter compared to $1.36 a year ago. The second quarter of 2021 benefited from the gain on the sale of our minority ownership interest in Q Squared Solutions in April. Adjusted EPS was $3.18 compared to $1.42 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.2 billion through June year-to-date versus $602 million in the same period last year, which included $65 million from the CARES Act funding that we eventually returned to the government later in 2020. 
Turning to guidance. We have established our full year 2021 outlook as follows: revenues expected to be between $9.54 billion and $9.79 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 4% versus the prior year; reported EPS expected to be in a range of $11.48 and $12.18, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $10.65 and $11.35; cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.9 billion; and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. 
Before concluding, I'll briefly review some assumptions embedded in our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Our outlook continues to assume a decline in clinical demand for COVID-19 molecular testing throughout the back half of the year. Return-to-life testing, such as the K-12 school testing program, could partially offset declining clinical demand later in the year. 
Reimbursement for clinical COVID-19 molecular testing continues to hold relatively steady. We currently expect this trend to continue, assuming the public health emergency is extended throughout 2021. However, average reimbursement is likely to trend lower in the second half as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes shift from clinical diagnostic testing to return-to-life surveillance testing. 
As you consider the EPS outlook we have shared today, keep in mind the following. At our Investor Day in March, we discussed making approximately $75 million in targeted investments to support our long-term strategies to accelerate growth. These investments are ramping, with $50 million expected to fall in the second half. 
We also continue to incur expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address supply chain challenges and maintain staffing levels to ensure high levels of service and quality as the base business recovers faster than expected. We forecast these expenses to be approximately $30 million in the back half of the year. 
Finally, the low end of our outlook assumes an average of at least 20,000 COVID-19 molecular tests per day and 3,000 serology tests per day. It also assumes low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in the second half of '21 versus 2019. The midpoint of our guidance assumes slightly stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and a modestly faster recovery of the base business. And the high end of our guidance assumes both a greater level of COVID-19 testing and the strong continued recovery in the base business. 
I will now turn it back to Steve."

So Ann, that 20,000 is not the exit rate. It is the average for the back half. The 20,000 was the baseline for the low end of guidance.

It is the average for the back half. The 20,000 was the baseline for the low end of guidance. To get to the middle part of this guidance, we would expect somewhat stronger than 20,000. Of course, there's moving pieces because it's also dependent on how the base business moves. And then the high end of guidance would be significantly more COVID testing. And then the stronger base business recovery, more in the mid-single digits revenue. So that's how we try to dimensionalize the range for you. 
In terms of labor pressure, we certainly saw some of that, and we responded to it. That's built into the whole year. It's not accelerating at this point in our outlook in the back half. So we have a process where we make annual salary and wage adjustments that was implemented earlier in the year. We certainly make some market adjustments periodically, which we've done, that's not unusual. So there's nothing extraordinary in the back half of the year in terms of labor inflation."

And yes, there's different ways we look at it, one is the clinical cost. 
And we actually see good recovery in our general health business, in our cardiometabolic business. I mentioned in my remarks our Advanced Diagnostics business, which includes a portion of cancer and genetic and molecular testing to recovery. We still see our prescription drug monitoring and toxicology business being somewhat a little hybrid, but they're actually starting to recover, not back to '19 levels, but it's coming along. 
And then on geographic basis, we do see much of the accounts are back to '19 levels. And as I said before, the Northeast is stubborn. We see -- we have started to move in the right direction. Massachusetts and Connecticut and New York City being the slowest recoverer, if you will, and that's all boroughs, not just Manhattan. 
And we're hopeful, as the opening continues, as people get back into life within Manhattan and New York that, that will recover as well. So to answer your question, it started with -- it has a more of a nice steady progression clinically and also geographically. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that?"

Just on the follow-up, you mentioned that you renewed the Aetna contract. So just wanted to understand how should we think of the model, how should we think about the pricing impact for the next 12 months? 
And then when we think about the value-based programs that you're now signing with payers, I think, Steve, you mentioned that it's actually growing faster than the rest of your book. Can you maybe give us some color on where you're seeing these value-based relationships? Is it mostly focused on commercial versus Medicare? And also, what's the framework? Are you sharing upside from the savings? Or are these more sort of fixed price contracts with some downside protection?"

So yes, so first off, the Aetna contract was extended. It will be invisible to you because there was no significant change in the pricing. And in that contract, we continue to build stronger elements of what we call value-based programs, and I'",505,"Yes, sure. So yes, so first off, the Aetna contract was extended. It will be invisible to you because there was no significant change in the pricing. And in that contract, we continue to build stronger elements of what we call value-based programs, and I'll touch on that in a minute, Ricky. 
So it's more focused on commercial, although, obviously, Medicare Advantage as well. There are certain things you can do in the purely commercial that are harder to do in Medicare Advantage because of some of the rules around that program. But the framing is not us sharing our upside with them, but really, they're sharing their upside with us. So we win together. 
So as we show greater value for their membership by getting more work to a better value lab, like ourselves, relative to out-of-network providers or, in some cases, other high-cost providers in network, they -- obviously, their members or for their fully insured book, they themselves, they might. And then we earn upside to a base level contract, and that base level contract is not at a discount. It's really been kind of the historical levels. 
So we didn't have to give up in order to gain. But it was really more about the case that we've been making for years that's getting more and more buy-in from the payers that were part of the solution. And working with us and not focusing on our price, but focusing on what we can do to drive better quality, better service and better value for their members is good for everybody in that ecosystem. 
So that's really the elements we've shared, with steerage, where they give us list of accounts. Where a lot of lab works go into out-of-network or higher-cost providers. We go in with their support to call on those [ physicians ] and educate for the people who have high deductible plans, coinsurance, et cetera. So the patients are bearing some of that higher cost, which obviously has more influence benefit if they're fully covered by the payer in terms of the doctor. 
And then we talked about M&A incentives, where, in the past, when we would buy hospital outreach as soon as we start billing in, it falls to our price, obviously, and a huge windfall for the payers. But that it's good for them if we buy outreach and, therefore, instead of taking that hit immediately, maybe a step down in those rates. And we share some of those savings over those first couple of years. And that's an element we've gotten into just about every one of the major payer contracts. 
So it's things like that, Ricky, where we've made the case and they're finally buying in that. When we're successful and they're successful, together, we can do more of that. And therefore, there is upside than in the past we didn't see, that now we have a chance to earn when we prove that we've actually saved the money and driven improvement for their members."

So what I did was I laid out the CAGRs from 2018 and said, obviously, the pandemic has clouded issues with the base business and then at some point, we all hope COVID is a much smaller piece of our revenues. And the base business CAGR that we laid out would have suggested $7.40 to $8. And what we were saying is, based on a base business being fully recovered by the end of the year and everything else that we we're confident we should be in that range. And yes, we felt because of everything we knew at that point that it should be in the upper end of that $7.40 to $8. 
PAMA was absolutely included in that. As I shared, that at this point, if nothing changes, should be the last year of the sizable reductions that we've had since PAMA was implemented. So based on the current fee schedule and the current methodology, there can be a 15% cut on any CPT code next year. And we estimate our overall book of business is going to be somewhere between 10% to 15%, so higher than 10% but less than 15% based on what we can see. 
However, because that traditional Medicare book of business is much smaller than it was when we started, the dollar impact is actually going to be similar to what it was in the first couple of years of PAMA. So it was still a large number, somewhere around 1% of our overall revenues. 
And then once you get beyond that, even if PAMA isn't fixed, based on our understanding of commercial pricing, we don't know everything, but certainly, we know our prices. And we've shared that we really stabilized commercial pricing, combined with some competitive intelligence in the marketplace. We feel that, while there might be some cuts with the recalculation, they're going to be relatively small compared to what we incurred for several years."

So I've implied and Mark just laid out the expectations around COVID testing. We did assume that the clinical testing would come down and the return-to-life testing would go up, and a portion of that return-to-life testing has to do back-to-school programs. And what we highlighted is we've been working with the different partners with 2 programs that are funded with the funding for testing. 
One is the $600 billion program -- $600 million program for return-to-school programs, where we have partners to help us with that. And school systems throughout the United States could apply for that money and get the money to reimburse whatever program they come up. And then there's a larger program of about $10 billion. But as you can understand, and I mean, every school system throughout the United States is going to have its own plan. 
And so they're going to start ramping up soon, getting into the month of August and then September. And I think there is going to be a fair amount of variance across the United States on who does what and when. And I do believe that, given what we see now with the delta variant, I'm sure that will have some bearing on the need for testing to make sure that we're safe when kids return back to school. 
And also, return-to-office programs. We do expect that there will be more returning to the workplace, those people that have been working remotely. I think, clearly, there's a heightened level of safety with that happening. And as I said in my earlier remarks, testing is vital to that. So we've embedded that in our expectations as well. 
But we assume that clinical testing would come down. We believe that a lot of our capacity is not used for the hospital portion of COVID testing as in the early days of COVID testing. And some of the recent increase that we've seen has been related to some of the effects we see from the delta variant, so far, in the last week or 2.

So if you think about PPR tests today, where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we hav",361,"Yes. I just want to remind everybody how that surveillance testing works. It's very different than our clinical testing. So if you think about PPR tests today, where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we have come up with and others as well that our methodology is a heavily pooled approach. We pool a handful of samples today when we're testing in low positivity regions for economic reasons. 
But it's our responsibility if we have a positive to retest those individual samples. So you don't want to pool too many because the math suggests that you're going to be retesting a lot of samples. And so when you go to surveillance, the assumption is that nobody has it. And so therefore, you're going to do a lot less retesting. 
But actually, in this case, we're not obligated to do it because they're not even identified. So what happens is, the collection is done. The entity, in this case, the school knows whose 10 samples, let's say, are in that specimen collection device. It's not shared with us. All we do is test it, and we say this group is negative, hopefully. And in the case where it's positive, then they, the administrators, know which students need to be retested. And then that's a separate order, that's a separate payment, et cetera. 
And so the reason that's important is that in order to make this economic and because of the economies of scale we get with this huge pooling, we have to do approximately 10 specimens to equate to a single one for our core PCR business. So the volumes have to be tenfold to have the same dollar value to our top line. 
So yes, there's absolutely some contracts we won and got some of that volume. But to really move the needle, it has to be really broadly endorsed and embraced. And while the funding is there, to this point, we've seen some momentum, but not enough to be significant at this point and really move the needle to offset the decline in the clinical testing we've seen over the last several months."

Second, as you asked about oncology, we've seen good recovery in our AP business and anatomic pathology business. And as I said in my remarks, our Advanced Diagnostics business, which is our definition of sometimes called esoteric, that has actually recovered nicely and we are making investments there, and we think we're tracking well against our investment accelerated growth plans. So we feel good about that. 
And the second question, which has to do with point-of-care. And when I say point-of-care, this is the PCR point-of-care and then also the antigen test. We do believe there's some portion of the testing demand, if you will, that was -- that's taking place with these new approaches. We do believe there is a place specifically with return to work programs through antigen testing and some of the point-of-care applications. 
Well, equally, what you see with our volumes that's somewhat stabilized, as you saw in the second quarter when we reported our numbers and the modest increase that we saw is PCR continues to be the gold standard. And so in many cases, they do reflect that to the PCR testing when there is a positive for sure and a questionable negative metric, not the false negative. So we do believe we have a good place in the marketplace, and we do believe there is a place for the point-of-care devices, including antigen as well as PCR going forward."

And also there are more -- each of them have more concentration in certain geographies. So as we shared, the Northeast and specifically New York City is growing at a different rate. so you'd assume that payers that have more membership there, we might have a different answer than the payers that are in Texas or Florida, let's say, or even California.
So we've looked that because it's one of our key -- we have a process we call [ Oceans ] and we have these breakthrough objectives, one of them is growing our share in these health plans. And we look at it regularly and we share information back and forth to understand kind of our share of wallet with those. And so we have a chance to see as they themselves also are recovering in terms of the volume that's going through their membership, whether we seem to be growing at the same pace in that recovery. And that's the basis for saying that we're growing faster.
So you know, in this business, a couple of hundred basis points is a big difference. It's not going to be a percent or double-digit kind -- a differential. But a couple of hundred basis points of share growth is meaningful. That's clearly what we saw before the pandemic started, as you look back to our 2019 performance, what we shared in the first 2 months of 2020. So once the business utilization becomes fully recovered, we're confident that we'll get back to that, you know, not just historical growth with market, but finally getting to growth above that by share gains. And that's what we laid out in our multi-year outlook at Investor Day."

And so a lot of that is local, and so you asked a question where we're making investments, we'll put those investment dollars where we think we need extra capacity to drive those programs by payer. And there's a lot of variation around where those opportunities are by the payer, and that detail is what we're speaking to when we're talking about investments in the health plans."

I'll just give you one other example, which we've shared in the past, but it's really expanded broadly. So take toxicology and prescription drug monitoring, the payers, as that was starting to grow, and there was some concern on the payers part around the behavior of some of the providers, they put in some really onerous rules in place, such as pre-authorization and so on. Of course, that impacts everybody, including the people like ourselves, who are very responsible around our panels and how we conduct ourselves. 
And so we went through some of the payers, talked to them about that. And said, “Hey, not only is that right for us, it's not right for the patient because it can be -- make it more difficult for them to get testing they need. But also if you got rid of that, you would actually steer more work to the good labs.” And when I say, it's not just us, certainly our key competitor and some others, are just like us, very responsible. We do good work in toxicology and prescription drug monitoring.
So they put in rules in place where we were actually exempted from pre-auth. So that's another example where it's really not an investment. It's an investment of time to work with them to get them to understand and get them to change some of these roles and behaviors. But again, it's an example where we're benefiting, but sort of the patients and a lot of other people because it's a more thoughtful approach to rules around lab testing."

Well, we had another strong quarter and continue to build momentum, thanks to faster-than-expected recovery in our base business. 
Organic base testing revenues grew compared to 2019 levels in the quarter. This is the first quarter since 2019 that organic base testing revenues grew. The growth was driven by contributions from new hospital lab management contracts as well as people returning to health care systems. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months, which is reflected in the outlook we have provided for the remainder of 2021. 
This morning, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter of 2021, provide perspective on industry dynamics and update you on our base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our outlook and underlying assumptions. 
First, with regard to COVID-19 testing. We are closely watching the rapid spread of the Delta variant, where our testing continues to help control the spread of the virus. In recent weeks, we have seen PCR volumes stabilize and begin to increase modestly. Positivity rates have increased in all geographies served by our performing laboratories over the last 2 weeks. 
COVID-19 testing also remains critical as employees return to the workplace, and students return to the classroom in a few weeks. And whilst we experienced another milestone, we expect people to return to pre-pandemic health care and, in some cases, catch up with health care they might have postponed during the pandemic. 
Now turning to PAMA and the recent MedPAC report mandated under the LAB Act. We were pleased that MedPAC found it feasible to change the CMS data collection process to a statistically valid sample of private payer rates for independent labs, hospital labs and physician office labs. This approach would produce an accurate, representative market view of laboratory rates, while reducing the burden of reporting laboratories, which is consistent with the charge of the LAB Act in the original intent of PAMA. 
The MedPAC report estimates that Medicare spending for the top 100 tests on the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule could increase by 10% to 15% over current rates based on certain rate and volume assumptions. And separately, our trade association recently appealed its legal challenge to PAMA, which was dismissed by the U.S. District Court in late March. ACLA has asserted its right to challenge the regulatory overreach by HHS in the implementation of PAMA. 
Along with our trade association, we will continue to work with policymakers to establish a Clinical Lab Fee Schedule that is truly representative of the market and supports continued innovation and access to vital laboratory services for Medicare beneficiaries, as Congress originally intended. Now is the time to strengthen our laboratory infrastructure and support continued access to high-quality lab services that patients depend on. 
Turning to our results for the second quarter. Total revenues grew by nearly 40% to $2.6 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 264% on a reported basis to $4.96 and nearly 124% on an adjusted basis to $3.18. Cash provided by operations increased by more than 30% to $460 million. 
In the second quarter, we continue to see a better-than-expected recovery in our base business, with organic base testing revenues essentially returning to pre-pandemic levels in June. We're seeing strong recovery in most of the country and a slower recovery in the Northeast. Demand for our COVID-19 testing slowed in the quarter as expected, reflecting an industry-wide trend, though the last few weeks of June, demand stabilized and has since increased modestly, which we believe is attributable to some extent to the emergence of the Delta variant. 
We performed an average of 57,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the second quarter, well below our current capacity of approximately 300,000 tests per day. We have engaged with businesses in the travel and entertainment sectors in the quarter, and working with partners to support a safe return of students to the classroom. We're also collaborating with CIC Health, Ginkgo Bioworks, Battelle Memorial Institute to make testing easy, fast and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country. 
We continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. And here are some highlights from the second quarter. 
We continue to execute on our M&A strategy. In June, we announced the completion of our acquisition of an outreach laboratory services business with Mercy Health, one of the nation's most highly integrated multi-state health care systems with providers and patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. With this acquisition, we are on our way to grow our base business revenues approximately 2% from accretive strategic acquisitions this year, and with additional M&A opportunities in the second half of the year. 
We continue to grow our health plan business, and made progress in the quarter with value-based programs with UnitedHealthcare and Anthem. Our volumes of these health plans are growing faster than the company average. We have also invested an additional employee headcount to better support these important relationships. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to renew our long-standing contractual relationship with one of our largest health plan customers, Aetna. We remain a preferred laboratory provider and partner of Aetna's network. In addition, for the first time in over a decade, Quest is one of Highmark Delaware's in-network nonhospital-affiliated preferred labs, serving more than 450,000 members. 
It's good to be back in the market, competing on the basis of quality, service and value. We're helping all of us be focused on health care's Triple Aim of improving population health, enhancing the patient experience and reducing costs. And towards that aim, we are launching a new campaign designed to remind customers of the value that Quest brings to health care. 
Our Powering Affordable Care campaign speaks about our leadership in clinical innovation; our ability to enable better clinical outcomes for quality, speed and accuracy of test results; our improved patient experience with accessible, easy-to-use patient resources; and finally, our ability to reduce cost of care. 
Base consumer-initiated testing revenues continued to grow in the quarter. Today, more than 17 million patients have an account on the MyQuest app and patient portal, with nearly 100,000 patients enrolling each week. Finally, in Advanced Diagnostics, we're pleased to see full recovery in the growth drivers we're investing in, which we discussed at our recent Investor Day and are tracking to accelerate growth. 
Now turning to our second strategy. We made progress driving operational excellence. We're on schedule to complete the full transition to our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey next month. This highly automated facility has consolidated testing previously performed in Teterboro, Baltimore and Philadelphia. 
There continues to be intense effort and energy around our Invigorate productivity initiatives, and we're on track to deliver our targeted 3% improvement across the business. We are focused on getting paid for what we do, and have made steady progress in reducing payer denials. Also, patient concessions for our base revenues were down in the second quarter to 2019 levels, driven by a focus on collection improvements. 
One positive outcome of the pandemic has been the patient and physician acceptance of the digitization of our experience. We are more customer-focused and efficient today with more self-serve options for customers, and we have moved a greater percentage of volumes to digital paperless transactions. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to provide more details on our financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mark?"

In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base",852,"Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base testing revenue, slightly offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of last year. 
Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew nearly 5% in the second quarter, and it was up more than 1%, excluding acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of acquisitions, increased 45.2% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing approximately 5%. Compared to our second quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased nearly 7%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 2% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped up over the last year. 
Importantly, compared to our 2019 baseline, our base testing volumes were nearly fully recovered in June. However, as Steve noted earlier, the geographic recovery continues to be somewhat uneven, with positive growth across most of the U.S., except the minorities which remains below the 2019 baseline. With that said, we continue to see steady recovery in the Northeast. 
COVID-19 testing volumes continue to decline as expected in Q2, in line with broader trends across the industry. We resolved an approximately 5.2 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the second quarter. COVID-19 testing volumes stabilized over the last several weeks, and we averaged approximately 43,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 7,000 serology tests per day in the last 2 weeks of June. 
Revenue per acquisition declined 3.6% versus the prior year, driven largely by recent PLS wins and acquisitions. Combined, these 2 factors amounted to a decline of nearly 5% in revenue per req in the quarter. Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with expectations. 
Reported operating income in the second quarter was $533 million or 20.9% of revenues compared to $283 million or 15.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q2 was $584 million or 22.9% of revenues compared to $294 million or 16.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by the strong revenue growth in the second quarter due primarily to the ongoing recovery in our base business. 
Reported EPS was $4.96 in the quarter compared to $1.36 a year ago. The second quarter of 2021 benefited from the gain on the sale of our minority ownership interest in Q Squared Solutions in April. Adjusted EPS was $3.18 compared to $1.42 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.2 billion through June year-to-date versus $602 million in the same period last year, which included $65 million from the CARES Act funding that we eventually returned to the government later in 2020. 
Turning to guidance. We have established our full year 2021 outlook as follows: revenues expected to be between $9.54 billion and $9.79 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 4% versus the prior year; reported EPS expected to be in a range of $11.48 and $12.18, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $10.65 and $11.35; cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.9 billion; and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. 
Before concluding, I'll briefly review some assumptions embedded in our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Our outlook continues to assume a decline in clinical demand for COVID-19 molecular testing throughout the back half of the year. Return-to-life testing, such as the K-12 school testing program, could partially offset declining clinical demand later in the year. 
Reimbursement for clinical COVID-19 molecular testing continues to hold relatively steady. We currently expect this trend to continue, assuming the public health emergency is extended throughout 2021. However, average reimbursement is likely to trend lower in the second half as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes shift from clinical diagnostic testing to return-to-life surveillance testing. 
As you consider the EPS outlook we have shared today, keep in mind the following. At our Investor Day in March, we discussed making approximately $75 million in targeted investments to support our long-term strategies to accelerate growth. These investments are ramping, with $50 million expected to fall in the second half. 
We also continue to incur expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address supply chain challenges and maintain staffing levels to ensure high levels of service and quality as the base business recovers faster than expected. We forecast these expenses to be approximately $30 million in the back half of the year. 
Finally, the low end of our outlook assumes an average of at least 20,000 COVID-19 molecular tests per day and 3,000 serology tests per day. It also assumes low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in the second half of '21 versus 2019. The midpoint of our guidance assumes slightly stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and a modestly faster recovery of the base business. And the high end of our guidance assumes both a greater level of COVID-19 testing and the strong continued recovery in the base business. 
I will now turn it back to Steve."

Of course, there's moving pieces because it's also dependent on how the base business moves. And then the high end of guidance would be significantly more COVID testing. And then the stronger base business recovery, more in the mid-single digits revenue. So that's how we try to dimensionalize the range for you. 
In terms of labor pressure, we certainly saw some of that, and we responded to it. That's built into the whole year. It's not accelerating at this point in our outlook in the back half. So we have a process where we make annual salary and wage adjustments that was implemented earlier in the year. We certainly make some market adjustments periodically, which we've done, that's not unusual. So there's nothing extraordinary in the back half of the year in terms of labor inflation."

So we feel we're actually getting some traction with everything we've put in place. And I can tell you, the engagement between us and those organizations are quite good. 
And I've said before in my remarks, we see an opportunity to get a variation to move with a high-quality, low-cost, high-value laboratory like Quest Diagnostics and then tighten up the network to what we described as preferred lab network.

And yes, there's different ways we look at it, one is the clinical cost. 
And we actually see good recovery in our general health business, in our cardiometabolic business. I mentioned in my remarks our Advanced Diagnostics business, which includes a portion of cancer and genetic and molecular testing to recovery. We still see our prescription drug monitoring and toxicology business being somewhat a little hybrid, but they're actually starting to recover, not back to '19 levels, but it's coming along. 
And then on geographic basis, we do see much of the accounts are back to '19 levels. And as I said before, the Northeast is stubborn. We see -- we have started to move in the right direction. Massachusetts and Connecticut and New York City being the slowest recoverer, if you will, and that's all boroughs, not just Manhattan. 
And we're hopeful, as the opening continues, as people get back into life within Manhattan and New York that, that will recover as well.

And then when we think about the value-based programs that you're now signing with payers, I think, Steve, you mentioned that it's actually growing faster than the rest of your book. Can you maybe give us some color on where you're seeing these value-based relationships? Is it mostly focused on commercial versus Medicare? And also, what's the framework? Are you sharing upside from the savings? Or are these more sort of fixed price contracts with some downside protection?"

It will be invisible to you because there was no significant change in the pricing. And in that contract, we continue to build stronger elements of what we call value-based programs, and I'll touch on that in a minute, Ricky. 
So it's more focused on commercial, although, obviously, Medicare Advantage as well. There are certain things you can do in the purely commercial that are harder to do in Medicare Advantage because of some of the rules around that program. But the framing is not us sharing our upside with them, but really, they're sharing their upside with us. So we win together. 
So as we show greater value for their membership by getting more work to a better value lab, like ourselves, relative to out-of-network providers or, in some cases, other high-cost providers in network, they -- obviously, their members or for their fully insured book, they themselves, they might. And then we earn upside to a base level contract, and that base level contract is not at a discount. It's really been kind of the historical levels. 
So we didn't have to give up in order to gain. But it was really more about the case that we've been making for years that's getting more and more buy-in from the payers that were part of the solution. And working with us and not focusing on our price, but focusing on what we can do to drive better quality, better service and better value for their members is good for everybody in that ecosystem. 
So that's really the elements we've shared, with steerage, where they give us list of accounts. Where a lot of lab works go into out-of-network or higher-cost providers. We go in with their support to call on those [ physicians ] and educate for the people who have high deductible plans, coinsurance, et cetera. So the patients are bearing some of that higher cost, which obviously has more influence benefit if they're fully covered by the payer in terms of the doctor. 
And then we talked about M&A incentives, where, in the past, when we would buy hospital outreach as soon as we start billing in, it falls to our price, obviously, and a huge windfall for the payers. But that it's good for them if we buy outreach and, therefore, instead of taking that hit immediately, maybe a step down in those rates. And we share some of those savings over those first couple of years. And that's an element we've gotten into just about every one of the major payer contracts. 
So it's things like that, Ricky, where we've made the case and they're finally buying in that. When we're successful and they're successful, together, we can do more of that. And therefore, there is upside than in the past we didn't see, that now we have a chance to earn when we prove that we've actually saved the money and driven improvement for their members."

So what I did was I laid out the CAGRs from 2018 and said, obviously, the pandemic has clouded issues with the base business and then at some point, we all hope COVID is a much smaller piece of our revenues. And the base business CAGR that we laid out would have suggested $7.40 to $8. And what we were saying is, based on a base business being fully recovered by the end of the year and everything else that we we're confident we should be in that range. And yes, we felt because of everything we knew at that point that it should be in the upper end of that $7.40 to $8. 
PAMA was absolutely included in that. As I shared, that at this point, if nothing changes, should be the last year of the sizable reductions that we've had since PAMA was implemented. So based on the current fee schedule and the current methodology, there can be a 15% cut on any CPT code next year. And we estimate our overall book of business is going to be somewhere between 10% to 15%, so higher than 10% but less than 15% based on what we can see. 
However, because that traditional Medicare book of business is much smaller than it was when we started, the dollar impact is actually going to be similar to what it was in the first couple of years of PAMA. So it was still a large number, somewhere around 1% of our overall revenues. 
And then once you get beyond that, even if PAMA isn't fixed, based on our understanding of commercial pricing, we don't know everything, but certainly, we know our prices. And we've shared that we really stabilized commercial pricing, combined with some competitive intelligence in the marketplace. We feel that, while there might be some cuts with the recalculation, they're going to be relatively small compared to what we incurred for several years."

And then secondly, given we are kind of weeks away from kids heading back to school, I'm sure there's been some discussions, but could you give us some insight into the internal or on-the-ground discussions happening? Like are there broad-based general screening, plans for back-to-school and maybe a big one-off push at the start of the year? Just any more additional color there would be really helpful."

So I've implied and Mark just laid out the expectations around COVID testing. We did assume that the clinical testing would come down and the return-to-life testing would go up, and a portion of that return-to-life testing has to do back-to-school programs. And what we highlighted is we've been working with the different partners with 2 programs that are funded with the funding for testing. 
One is the $600 billion program -- $600 million program for return-to-school programs, where we have partners to help us with that. And school systems throughout the United States could apply for that money and get the money to reimburse whatever program they come up. And then there's a larger program of about $10 billion. But as you can understand, and I mean, every school system throughout the United States is going to have its own plan. 
And so they're going to start ramping up soon, getting into the month of August and then September. And I think there is going to be a fair amount of variance across the United States on who does what and when. And I do believe that, given what we see now with the delta variant, I'm sure that will have some bearing on the need for testing to make sure that we're safe when kids return back to school. 
And also, return-to-office programs. We do expect that there will be more returning to the workplace, those people that have been working remotely. I think, clearly, there's a heightened level of safety with that happening. And as I said in my earlier remarks, testing is vital to that. So we've embedded that in our expectations as well. 
But we assume that clinical testing would come down. We believe that a lot of our capacity is not used for the hospital portion of COVID testing as in the early days of COVID testing. And some of the recent increase that we've seen has been related to some of the effects we see from the delta variant, so far, in the last week or 2. So hopefully, I provided some color on what's assumed in the guidance so far."
361335,1673162773,2350559,"Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Quest Diagnostics Incorporated","Executives","Yes. I just want to remind everybody how that surveillance testing works. It's very different than our clinical testing. So if you think about PPR tests today, where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we hav",361,"Yes. I just want to remind everybody how that surveillance testing works. It's very different than our clinical testing. So if you think about PPR tests today, where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we have come up with and others as well that our methodology is a heavily pooled approach. We pool a handful of samples today when we're testing in low positivity regions for economic reasons. 
But it's our responsibility if we have a positive to retest those individual samples. So you don't want to pool too many because the math suggests that you're going to be retesting a lot of samples. And so when you go to surveillance, the assumption is that nobody has it. And so therefore, you're going to do a lot less retesting. 
But actually, in this case, we're not obligated to do it because they're not even identified. So what happens is, the collection is done. The entity, in this case, the school knows whose 10 samples, let's say, are in that specimen collection device. It's not shared with us. All we do is test it, and we say this group is negative, hopefully. And in the case where it's positive, then they, the administrators, know which students need to be retested. And then that's a separate order, that's a separate payment, et cetera. 
And so the reason that's important is that in order to make this economic and because of the economies of scale we get with this huge pooling, we have to do approximately 10 specimens to equate to a single one for our core PCR business. So the volumes have to be tenfold to have the same dollar value to our top line. 
So yes, there's absolutely some contracts we won and got some of that volume. But to really move the needle, it has to be really broadly endorsed and embraced. And while the funding is there, to this point, we've seen some momentum, but not enough to be significant at this point and really move the needle to offset the decline in the clinical testing we've seen over the last several months."

Just -- are you seeing anything particular in terms of oncology and esoteric versus routine testing? Just a little bit more color on that. You gave some geographical differences, but I want some mix differences. 
And then another question that keeps coming up. In contrast to where you're guiding to, we just got off the Danaher call, and they're talking about -- they did -- they went from 10 million point-of-care tests in the first quarter to 14 million point-of-care tests in the second quarter. So one of the questions we continually get on the central labs is the impact, longer-term, on the business on point-of-care testing is, is this trend going to continue, particularly given the number of players that are sort of entering this market from the point-of-care and at-home space? So I'd love to get your general thoughts on sort of your thoughts on volume shifts for certain applications into the point-of-care market."

So yes, what we said is our general health and our cardiometabolic testing, which is sometimes referred to by us as our General Diagnostics, and I would say, the industry sometimes says routine. Routine has recovered nicely, and that's throughout the United States, a nice recovery there. 
Second, as you asked about oncology, we've seen good recovery in our AP business and anatomic pathology business. And as I said in my remarks, our Advanced Diagnostics business, which is our definition of sometimes called esoteric, that has actually recovered nicely and we are making investments there, and we think we're tracking well against our investment accelerated growth plans. So we feel good about that. 
And the second question, which has to do with point-of-care. And when I say point-of-care, this is the PCR point-of-care and then also the antigen test. We do believe there's some portion of the testing demand, if you will, that was -- that's taking place with these new approaches. We do believe there is a place specifically with return to work programs through antigen testing and some of the point-of-care applications. 
Well, equally, what you see with our volumes that's somewhat stabilized, as you saw in the second quarter when we reported our numbers and the modest increase that we saw is PCR continues to be the gold standard. And so in many cases, they do reflect that to the PCR testing when there is a positive for sure and a questionable negative metric, not the false negative. So we do believe we have a good place in the marketplace, and we do believe there is a place for the point-of-care devices, including antigen as well as PCR going forward."

And also there are more -- each of them have more concentration in certain geographies. So as we shared, the Northeast and specifically New York City is growing at a different rate. so you'd assume that payers that have more membership there, we might have a different answer than the payers that are in Texas or Florida, let's say, or even California.
So we've looked that because it's one of our key -- we have a process we call [ Oceans ] and we have these breakthrough objectives, one of them is growing our share in these health plans. And we look at it regularly and we share information back and forth to understand kind of our share of wallet with those. And so we have a chance to see as they themselves also are recovering in terms of the volume that's going through their membership, whether we seem to be growing at the same pace in that recovery. And that's the basis for saying that we're growing faster.
So you know, in this business, a couple of hundred basis points is a big difference. It's not going to be a percent or double-digit kind -- a differential. But a couple of hundred basis points of share growth is meaningful. That's clearly what we saw before the pandemic started, as you look back to our 2019 performance, what we shared in the first 2 months of 2020. So once the business utilization becomes fully recovered, we're confident that we'll get back to that, you know, not just historical growth with market, but finally getting to growth above that by share gains. And that's what we laid out in our multi-year outlook at Investor Day."

I'll just give you one other example, which we've shared in the past, but it's really expanded broadly. So take toxicology and prescription drug monitoring, the payers, as that was starting to grow, and there was some concern on the payers part around the behavior of some of the providers, they put in some really onerous rules in place, such as pre-authorization and so on. Of course, that impacts everybody, including the people like ourselves, who are very responsible around our panels and how we conduct ourselves. 
And so we went through some of the payers, talked to them about that. And said, “Hey, not only is that right for us, it's not right for the patient because it can be -- make it more difficult for them to get testing they need. But also if you got rid of that, you would actually steer more work to the good labs.” And when I say, it's not just us, certainly our key competitor and some others, are just like us, very responsible. We do good work in toxicology and prescription drug monitoring.
So they put in rules in place where we were actually exempted from pre-auth. So that's another example where it's really not an investment. It's an investment of time to work with them to get them to understand and get them to change some of these roles and behaviors. But again, it's an example where we're benefiting, but sort of the patients and a lot of other people because it's a more thoughtful approach to rules around lab testing."

Well, we had another strong quarter and continue to build momentum, thanks to faster-than-expected recovery in our base business. 
Organic base testing revenues grew compared to 2019 levels in the quarter. This is the first quarter since 2019 that organic base testing revenues grew. The growth was driven by contributions from new hospital lab management contracts as well as people returning to health care systems. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months, which is reflected in the outlook we have provided for the remainder of 2021. 
This morning, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter of 2021, provide perspective on industry dynamics and update you on our base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our outlook and underlying assumptions. 
First, with regard to COVID-19 testing. We are closely watching the rapid spread of the Delta variant, where our testing continues to help control the spread of the virus. In recent weeks, we have seen PCR volumes stabilize and begin to increase modestly. Positivity rates have increased in all geographies served by our performing laboratories over the last 2 weeks. 
COVID-19 testing also remains critical as employees return to the workplace, and students return to the classroom in a few weeks. And whilst we experienced another milestone, we expect people to return to pre-pandemic health care and, in some cases, catch up with health care they might have postponed during the pandemic. 
Now turning to PAMA and the recent MedPAC report mandated under the LAB Act. We were pleased that MedPAC found it feasible to change the CMS data collection process to a statistically valid sample of private payer rates for independent labs, hospital labs and physician office labs. This approach would produce an accurate, representative market view of laboratory rates, while reducing the burden of reporting laboratories, which is consistent with the charge of the LAB Act in the original intent of PAMA. 
The MedPAC report estimates that Medicare spending for the top 100 tests on the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule could increase by 10% to 15% over current rates based on certain rate and volume assumptions. And separately, our trade association recently appealed its legal challenge to PAMA, which was dismissed by the U.S. District Court in late March. ACLA has asserted its right to challenge the regulatory overreach by HHS in the implementation of PAMA. 
Along with our trade association, we will continue to work with policymakers to establish a Clinical Lab Fee Schedule that is truly representative of the market and supports continued innovation and access to vital laboratory services for Medicare beneficiaries, as Congress originally intended. Now is the time to strengthen our laboratory infrastructure and support continued access to high-quality lab services that patients depend on. 
Turning to our results for the second quarter. Total revenues grew by nearly 40% to $2.6 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 264% on a reported basis to $4.96 and nearly 124% on an adjusted basis to $3.18. Cash provided by operations increased by more than 30% to $460 million. 
In the second quarter, we continue to see a better-than-expected recovery in our base business, with organic base testing revenues essentially returning to pre-pandemic levels in June. We're seeing strong recovery in most of the country and a slower recovery in the Northeast. Demand for our COVID-19 testing slowed in the quarter as expected, reflecting an industry-wide trend, though the last few weeks of June, demand stabilized and has since increased modestly, which we believe is attributable to some extent to the emergence of the Delta variant. 
We performed an average of 57,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the second quarter, well below our current capacity of approximately 300,000 tests per day. We have engaged with businesses in the travel and entertainment sectors in the quarter, and working with partners to support a safe return of students to the classroom. We're also collaborating with CIC Health, Ginkgo Bioworks, Battelle Memorial Institute to make testing easy, fast and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country. 
We continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. And here are some highlights from the second quarter. 
We continue to execute on our M&A strategy. In June, we announced the completion of our acquisition of an outreach laboratory services business with Mercy Health, one of the nation's most highly integrated multi-state health care systems with providers and patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. With this acquisition, we are on our way to grow our base business revenues approximately 2% from accretive strategic acquisitions this year, and with additional M&A opportunities in the second half of the year. 
We continue to grow our health plan business, and made progress in the quarter with value-based programs with UnitedHealthcare and Anthem. Our volumes of these health plans are growing faster than the company average. We have also invested an additional employee headcount to better support these important relationships. 
During the quarter, we were also pleased to renew our long-standing contractual relationship with one of our largest health plan customers, Aetna. We remain a preferred laboratory provider and partner of Aetna's network. In addition, for the first time in over a decade, Quest is one of Highmark Delaware's in-network nonhospital-affiliated preferred labs, serving more than 450,000 members. 
It's good to be back in the market, competing on the basis of quality, service and value. We're helping all of us be focused on health care's Triple Aim of improving population health, enhancing the patient experience and reducing costs. And towards that aim, we are launching a new campaign designed to remind customers of the value that Quest brings to health care. 
Our Powering Affordable Care campaign speaks about our leadership in clinical innovation; our ability to enable better clinical outcomes for quality, speed and accuracy of test results; our improved patient experience with accessible, easy-to-use patient resources; and finally, our ability to reduce cost of care. 
Base consumer-initiated testing revenues continued to grow in the quarter. Today, more than 17 million patients have an account on the MyQuest app and patient portal, with nearly 100,000 patients enrolling each week. Finally, in Advanced Diagnostics, we're pleased to see full recovery in the growth drivers we're investing in, which we discussed at our recent Investor Day and are tracking to accelerate growth. 
Now turning to our second strategy. We made progress driving operational excellence. We're on schedule to complete the full transition to our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey next month. This highly automated facility has consolidated testing previously performed in Teterboro, Baltimore and Philadelphia. 
There continues to be intense effort and energy around our Invigorate productivity initiatives, and we're on track to deliver our targeted 3% improvement across the business. We are focused on getting paid for what we do, and have made steady progress in reducing payer denials. Also, patient concessions for our base revenues were down in the second quarter to 2019 levels, driven by a focus on collection improvements. 
One positive outcome of the pandemic has been the patient and physician acceptance of the digitization of our experience. We are more customer-focused and efficient today with more self-serve options for customers, and we have moved a greater percentage of volumes to digital paperless transactions. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to provide more details on our financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mark?"

In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base",852,"Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base testing revenue, slightly offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of last year. 
Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew nearly 5% in the second quarter, and it was up more than 1%, excluding acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of acquisitions, increased 45.2% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing approximately 5%. Compared to our second quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased nearly 7%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 2% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped up over the last year. 
Importantly, compared to our 2019 baseline, our base testing volumes were nearly fully recovered in June. However, as Steve noted earlier, the geographic recovery continues to be somewhat uneven, with positive growth across most of the U.S., except the minorities which remains below the 2019 baseline. With that said, we continue to see steady recovery in the Northeast. 
COVID-19 testing volumes continue to decline as expected in Q2, in line with broader trends across the industry. We resolved an approximately 5.2 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the second quarter. COVID-19 testing volumes stabilized over the last several weeks, and we averaged approximately 43,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 7,000 serology tests per day in the last 2 weeks of June. 
Revenue per acquisition declined 3.6% versus the prior year, driven largely by recent PLS wins and acquisitions. Combined, these 2 factors amounted to a decline of nearly 5% in revenue per req in the quarter. Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with expectations. 
Reported operating income in the second quarter was $533 million or 20.9% of revenues compared to $283 million or 15.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q2 was $584 million or 22.9% of revenues compared to $294 million or 16.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by the strong revenue growth in the second quarter due primarily to the ongoing recovery in our base business. 
Reported EPS was $4.96 in the quarter compared to $1.36 a year ago. The second quarter of 2021 benefited from the gain on the sale of our minority ownership interest in Q Squared Solutions in April. Adjusted EPS was $3.18 compared to $1.42 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.2 billion through June year-to-date versus $602 million in the same period last year, which included $65 million from the CARES Act funding that we eventually returned to the government later in 2020. 
Turning to guidance. We have established our full year 2021 outlook as follows: revenues expected to be between $9.54 billion and $9.79 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 4% versus the prior year; reported EPS expected to be in a range of $11.48 and $12.18, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $10.65 and $11.35; cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.9 billion; and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. 
Before concluding, I'll briefly review some assumptions embedded in our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Our outlook continues to assume a decline in clinical demand for COVID-19 molecular testing throughout the back half of the year. Return-to-life testing, such as the K-12 school testing program, could partially offset declining clinical demand later in the year. 
Reimbursement for clinical COVID-19 molecular testing continues to hold relatively steady. We currently expect this trend to continue, assuming the public health emergency is extended throughout 2021. However, average reimbursement is likely to trend lower in the second half as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes shift from clinical diagnostic testing to return-to-life surveillance testing. 
As you consider the EPS outlook we have shared today, keep in mind the following. At our Investor Day in March, we discussed making approximately $75 million in targeted investments to support our long-term strategies to accelerate growth. These investments are ramping, with $50 million expected to fall in the second half. 
We also continue to incur expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address supply chain challenges and maintain staffing levels to ensure high levels of service and quality as the base business recovers faster than expected. We forecast these expenses to be approximately $30 million in the back half of the year. 
Finally, the low end of our outlook assumes an average of at least 20,000 COVID-19 molecular tests per day and 3,000 serology tests per day. It also assumes low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in the second half of '21 versus 2019. The midpoint of our guidance assumes slightly stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and a modestly faster recovery of the base business. And the high end of our guidance assumes both a greater level of COVID-19 testing and the strong continued recovery in the base business. 
I will now turn it back to Steve."

Of course, there's moving pieces because it's also dependent on how the base business moves. And then the high end of guidance would be significantly more COVID testing. And then the stronger base business recovery, more in the mid-single digits revenue. So that's how we try to dimensionalize the range for you. 
In terms of labor pressure, we certainly saw some of that, and we responded to it. That's built into the whole year. It's not accelerating at this point in our outlook in the back half. So we have a process where we make annual salary and wage adjustments that was implemented earlier in the year. We certainly make some market adjustments periodically, which we've done, that's not unusual. So there's nothing extraordinary in the back half of the year in terms of labor inflation."

So we feel we're actually getting some traction with everything we've put in place. And I can tell you, the engagement between us and those organizations are quite good. 
And I've said before in my remarks, we see an opportunity to get a variation to move with a high-quality, low-cost, high-value laboratory like Quest Diagnostics and then tighten up the network to what we described as preferred lab network.

If you remember, we entered the half with our base business being down somewhat, around high single digits, and kind of improve throughout Q1 and that continued into Q2. And yes, there's different ways we look at it, one is the clinical cost. 
And we actually see good recovery in our general health business, in our cardiometabolic business. I mentioned in my remarks our Advanced Diagnostics business, which includes a portion of cancer and genetic and molecular testing to recovery. We still see our prescription drug monitoring and toxicology business being somewhat a little hybrid, but they're actually starting to recover, not back to '19 levels, but it's coming along. 
And then on geographic basis, we do see much of the accounts are back to '19 levels. And as I said before, the Northeast is stubborn. We see -- we have started to move in the right direction. Massachusetts and Connecticut and New York City being the slowest recoverer, if you will, and that's all boroughs, not just Manhattan. 
And we're hopeful, as the opening continues, as people get back into life within Manhattan and New York that, that will recover as well.

And then when we think about the value-based programs that you're now signing with payers, I think, Steve, you mentioned that it's actually growing faster than the rest of your book. Can you maybe give us some color on where you're seeing these value-based relationships? Is it mostly focused on commercial versus Medicare? And also, what's the framework? Are you sharing upside from the savings? Or are these more sort of fixed price contracts with some downside protection?"

It will be invisible to you because there was no significant change in the pricing. And in that contract, we continue to build stronger elements of what we call value-based programs, and I'll touch on that in a minute, Ricky. 
So it's more focused on commercial, although, obviously, Medicare Advantage as well. There are certain things you can do in the purely commercial that are harder to do in Medicare Advantage because of some of the rules around that program. But the framing is not us sharing our upside with them, but really, they're sharing their upside with us. So we win together. 
So as we show greater value for their membership by getting more work to a better value lab, like ourselves, relative to out-of-network providers or, in some cases, other high-cost providers in network, they -- obviously, their members or for their fully insured book, they themselves, they might. And then we earn upside to a base level contract, and that base level contract is not at a discount. It's really been kind of the historical levels. 
So we didn't have to give up in order to gain. But it was really more about the case that we've been making for years that's getting more and more buy-in from the payers that were part of the solution. And working with us and not focusing on our price, but focusing on what we can do to drive better quality, better service and better value for their members is good for everybody in that ecosystem. 
So that's really the elements we've shared, with steerage, where they give us list of accounts. Where a lot of lab works go into out-of-network or higher-cost providers. We go in with their support to call on those [ physicians ] and educate for the people who have high deductible plans, coinsurance, et cetera. So the patients are bearing some of that higher cost, which obviously has more influence benefit if they're fully covered by the payer in terms of the doctor. 
And then we talked about M&A incentives, where, in the past, when we would buy hospital outreach as soon as we start billing in, it falls to our price, obviously, and a huge windfall for the payers. But that it's good for them if we buy outreach and, therefore, instead of taking that hit immediately, maybe a step down in those rates. And we share some of those savings over those first couple of years. And that's an element we've gotten into just about every one of the major payer contracts. 
So it's things like that, Ricky, where we've made the case and they're finally buying in that. When we're successful and they're successful, together, we can do more of that. And therefore, there is upside than in the past we didn't see, that now we have a chance to earn when we prove that we've actually saved the money and driven improvement for their members."

So what I did was I laid out the CAGRs from 2018 and said, obviously, the pandemic has clouded issues with the base business and then at some point, we all hope COVID is a much smaller piece of our revenues. And the base business CAGR that we laid out would have suggested $7.40 to $8. And what we were saying is, based on a base business being fully recovered by the end of the year and everything else that we we're confident we should be in that range. And yes, we felt because of everything we knew at that point that it should be in the upper end of that $7.40 to $8. 
PAMA was absolutely included in that. As I shared, that at this point, if nothing changes, should be the last year of the sizable reductions that we've had since PAMA was implemented. So based on the current fee schedule and the current methodology, there can be a 15% cut on any CPT code next year. And we estimate our overall book of business is going to be somewhere between 10% to 15%, so higher than 10% but less than 15% based on what we can see. 
However, because that traditional Medicare book of business is much smaller than it was when we started, the dollar impact is actually going to be similar to what it was in the first couple of years of PAMA. So it was still a large number, somewhere around 1% of our overall revenues. 
And then once you get beyond that, even if PAMA isn't fixed, based on our understanding of commercial pricing, we don't know everything, but certainly, we know our prices. And we've shared that we really stabilized commercial pricing, combined with some competitive intelligence in the marketplace. We feel that, while there might be some cuts with the recalculation, they're going to be relatively small compared to what we incurred for several years."

We see opportunities to accelerate Advanced Diagnostics, and we feel good about the recovery we've seen there. And then also, the opportunity we see around the consumer and consumer-initiated testing. So our performance was allowing us to make these investments to accelerate growth, to get to that outlook that we provided to you for '22 and beyond, which is 4% to 5% top line growth and high single-digit earnings growth. So we feel good about our ability to make those investments, and we are making them. So we're hiring the people, we're spending the money, and it's included in the guidance in the back half."

And it's not a base business recovery that stalls or goes backwards. It's really a much slower than what we've seen and that we would expect. 
And we don't think there's a high probability for that. But one thing we've learned in this pandemic is, all these things are somewhat volatile and hard to predict. If you saw a lot of retrenchments across the country because of the Delta variant or other things that might cause geographies to shut down, we want to make sure that we provide you guidance that 95%-plus deliverable or even more. 
So once you get beyond the floor, there's so many different moving parts that could go in opposite directions. It's kind of hard to give you a point estimate. We wanted to make sure that people also understood that the COVID average per day we’re anticipating for the balance year is significantly lower than we're getting right now. 
As you might imagine, we've been working on this outlook for a while. The recent news with, obviously, Delta driving up the positivity rate cases, obviously, our volume is increasing. One thing we've also learned is not to overreact to short term. So we're very transparent. So we give you those volumes every 2 weeks.

So I've implied and Mark just laid out the expectations around COVID testing. We did assume that the clinical testing would come down and the return-to-life testing would go up, and a portion of that return-to-life testing has to do back-to-school programs. And what we highlighted is we've been working with the different partners with 2 programs that are funded with the funding for testing. 
One is the $600 billion program -- $600 million program for return-to-school programs, where we have partners to help us with that. And school systems throughout the United States could apply for that money and get the money to reimburse whatever program they come up. And then there's a larger program of about $10 billion. But as you can understand, and I mean, every school system throughout the United States is going to have its own plan. 
And so they're going to start ramping up soon, getting into the month of August and then September. And I think there is going to be a fair amount of variance across the United States on who does what and when. And I do believe that, given what we see now with the delta variant, I'm sure that will have some bearing on the need for testing to make sure that we're safe when kids return back to school. 
And also, return-to-office programs. We do expect that there will be more returning to the workplace, those people that have been working remotely. I think, clearly, there's a heightened level of safety with that happening. And as I said in my earlier remarks, testing is vital to that. So we've embedded that in our expectations as well. 
But we assume that clinical testing would come down. We believe that a lot of our capacity is not used for the hospital portion of COVID testing as in the early days of COVID testing. And some of the recent increase that we've seen has been related to some of the effects we see from the delta variant, so far, in the last week or 2. So hopefully, I provided some color on what's assumed in the guidance so far."

I just want to remind everybody how that surveillance testing works. It's very different than our clinical testing. So if you think about PCR tests today, where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we hav",361,"Yes. I just want to remind everybody how that surveillance testing works. It's very different than our clinical testing. So if you think about PCR tests today, where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we have come up with and others as well that our methodology is a heavily pooled approach. We pool a handful of samples today when we're testing in low positivity regions for economic reasons. 
But it's our responsibility if we have a positive to retest those individual samples. So you don't want to pool too many because the math suggests that you're going to be retesting a lot of samples. And so when you go to surveillance, the assumption is that nobody has it. And so therefore, you're going to do a lot less retesting. 
But actually, in this case, we're not obligated to do it because they're not even identified. So what happens is, the collection is done. The entity, in this case, the school knows whose 10 samples, let's say, are in that specimen collection device. It's not shared with us. All we do is test it, and we say this group is negative, hopefully. And in the case where it's positive, then they, the administrators, know which students need to be retested. And then that's a separate order, that's a separate payment, et cetera. 
And so the reason that's important is that in order to make this economic and because of the economies of scale we get with this huge pooling, we have to do approximately 10 specimens to equate to a single one for our core PCR business. So the volumes have to be tenfold to have the same dollar value to our top line. 
So yes, there's absolutely some contracts we won and got some of that volume. But to really move the needle, it has to be really broadly endorsed and embraced. And while the funding is there, to this point, we've seen some momentum, but not enough to be significant at this point and really move the needle to offset the decline in the clinical testing we've seen over the last several months."

And then another question that keeps coming up. In contrast to where you're guiding to, we just got off the Danaher call, and they're talking about -- they did -- they went from 10 million point-of-care tests in the first quarter to 14 million point-of-care tests in the second quarter. So one of the questions we continually get on the central labs is the impact, longer-term, on the business on point-of-care testing is, is this trend going to continue, particularly given the number of players that are sort of entering this market from the point-of-care and at-home space? So I'd love to get your general thoughts on sort of your thoughts on volume shifts for certain applications into the point-of-care market."

So yes, what we said is our general health and our cardiometabolic testing, which is sometimes referred to by us as our General Diagnostics, and I would say, the industry sometimes says routine. Routine has recovered nicely, and that's throughout the United States, a nice recovery there. 
Second, as you asked about oncology, we've seen good recovery in our AP business and anatomic pathology business. And as I said in my remarks, our Advanced Diagnostics business, which is our definition of sometimes called esoteric, that has actually recovered nicely and we are making investments there, and we think we're tracking well against our investment accelerated growth plans. So we feel good about that. 
And the second question, which has to do with point-of-care. And when I say point-of-care, this is the PCR point-of-care and then also the antigen test. We do believe there's some portion of the testing demand, if you will, that was -- that's taking place with these new approaches. We do believe there is a place specifically with return to work programs through antigen testing and some of the point-of-care applications. 
Well, equally, what you see with our volumes that's somewhat stabilized, as you saw in the second quarter when we reported our numbers and the modest increase that we saw is PCR continues to be the gold standard. And so in many cases, they do reflect that to the PCR testing when there is a positive for sure and a questionable negative metric, not the false negative. So we do believe we have a good place in the marketplace, and we do believe there is a place for the point-of-care devices, including antigen as well as PCR going forward."

So as we shared, the Northeast and specifically New York City is growing at a different rate. so you'd assume that payers that have more membership there, we might have a different answer than the payers that are in Texas or Florida, let's say, or even California.
So we've looked that because it's one of our key -- we have a process we call [ Oceans ] and we have these breakthrough objectives, one of them is growing our share in these health plans. And we look at it regularly and we share information back and forth to understand kind of our share of wallet with those. And so we have a chance to see as they themselves also are recovering in terms of the volume that's going through their membership, whether we seem to be growing at the same pace in that recovery. And that's the basis for saying that we're growing faster.
So you know, in this business, a couple of hundred basis points is a big difference. It's not going to be a percent or double-digit kind -- a differential. But a couple of hundred basis points of share growth is meaningful. That's clearly what we saw before the pandemic started, as you look back to our 2019 performance, what we shared in the first 2 months of 2020. So once the business utilization becomes fully recovered, we're confident that we'll get back to that, you know, not just historical growth with market, but finally getting to growth above that by share gains.

So take toxicology and prescription drug monitoring, the payers, as that was starting to grow, and there was some concern on the payers part around the behavior of some of the providers, they put in some really onerous rules in place, such as pre-authorization and so on. Of course, that impacts everybody, including the people like ourselves, who are very responsible around our panels and how we conduct ourselves. 
And so we went through some of the payers, talked to them about that. And said, “Hey, not only is that right for us, it's not right for the patient because it can be -- make it more difficult for them to get testing they need. But also if you got rid of that, you would actually steer more work to the good labs.” And when I say, it's not just us, certainly our key competitor and some others, are just like us, very responsible. We do good work in toxicology and prescription drug monitoring.
So they put in rules in place where we were actually exempted from pre-auth. So that's another example where it's really not an investment. It's an investment of time to work with them to get them to understand and get them to change some of these roles and behaviors. But again, it's an example where we're benefiting, but sort of the patients and a lot of other people because it's a more thoughtful approach to rules around lab testing."

We put in place our new immunoassay platform from Siemens. We've talked about it, it's a big investment for us. We are getting some pretty good gains from it and more to come such that we put in place new front-end automation and through the lab automation with our partner, Inpeco, and actually Siemens is on the systems integration with that as well.
So we are pleased with the progress made so far and we're looking forward to more productivity from that going forward as we continue to burn-in systems and work out some of the early details. And that's -- those improvements are already part of the 3% productivity gains that we have in our operational excellence program. They are already included in our outlook that we provided at Investor Day. 
Okay. So thank you, everyone, for this call, and we appreciate your continued support. You have a great day."

Well, we had a strong third quarter as COVID-19 molecular volumes increased throughout the summer, while our base business continued to deliver a solid value growth versus the prior year and 2019.",1384,"Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, we had a strong third quarter as COVID-19 molecular volumes increased throughout the summer, while our base business continued to deliver a solid value growth versus the prior year and 2019. 
In late summer, we experienced some softness in the base business across the country, but soft in rebound in September. Importantly, our base business continued to improve sequentially in the third quarter, which speaks to the ongoing recovery. We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher-than-anticipated COVID-19 volumes as well as continued progress we expect to see in our base business, despite rising labor cost and inflationary pressures. The momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day. 
So this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the third quarter of 2021 and update you on our base business, and then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our updated outlook and underlying assumptions.
But before turning to our results in the third quarter, I'd like to update you on the progress we've made in our quest for Health Equity initiative, a more than $100 million initiative aimed at reducing health care disparities in underserved neighborhoods. Since we've established it just over a year ago, we have launched 18 programs across the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from supporting COVID-19 testing of vaccination events, to educating young students and healthy nutritional choices, to providing funding support for our long-haul COVID-19 clinic in Puerto Rico. 
Recently, we announced a collaboration with the American Heart Association that will expand research and mentorship opportunities for Black and Hispanic scholars and drive hypertension management and COVID-19 relief. We're off to a good start, and I look forward updating you on our continued progress as Quest for Health Equity enters its second year.
Now turning to our results for the third quarter. Total revenue of $2.77 billion, down 40 basis points versus the prior year. Earnings per share were $4.02 on a reported basis, down approximately 3% versus the prior year and $3.96 on an adjusted basis, down 8% versus the prior year. The revenue and earnings declines in the third quarter reflect lower COVID-19 testing in 2021 versus the prior year, partially offset by continued recovery in our base business. Cash provided by operations increased by nearly 20% year-to-date through September to approximately $1.75 billion.
Now starting with COVID-19 testing, our COVID-19 molecular volumes increased in the third quarter versus the second quarter due to the spread of the Delta variant over the course of the summer. Testing began to increase meaningfully in mid-July and peaked in early mid-September. Our observed positivity rate peaked in mid-August and has steadily been declining across much of the country in recent weeks. We performed an average of 83,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the third quarter and maintained a strong average turnaround times of approximately 1 day for most specimens throughout the surge. 
As clinical COVID-19 volumes declined, we are expanding our nonclinical COVID-19 testing to support the return to school, office, travel and entertainment. We're making testing easy, fast and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country. We are currently performing K-12 school testing in approximately 20 states, with 5 additional states ready to come online. We're testing passengers on Cardinal Cruise lines, and Quest exclusively provided testing at the Boston Marathon earlier this month. In the base business, we continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.
Now here are some highlights from the third quarter. Our M&A pipeline remains strong. In the third quarter, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition of an independent lab in Florida. We continue to build on our exceptional health plan access of approximately 90% of all commercially-insured lives in the United States. At our Investor Day, we discussed how we have fundamentally changed our relationship with health plans, and we continue to see the promise of value-based relationships come to life.
So here's a couple of examples. We are working with national health plans to help their self-insured employers to employ our customers, improve quality, outcomes and lower the cost of care for both the employers and their employees. Also, effective October 1, we gained access to 1 million Vantage Medicaid members in Florida as their coverage transitions to Centene's Sunshine Health Plan. We're getting good feedback from the provider community and our growing testing volumes through this expanded access opportunity.
Our hospital health system revenue continues to track well above 2019 levels, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contracts. As we highlighted previously, 2021 performance is benefiting from 2 of our largest POS contracts to date, Hackensack Meridian Health and Memorial Hermann. Altogether, our POS business is expected to exceed $500 million in annual revenue this year. 
Trends in our hospital reference business also remained steady, with third quarter base testing volumes above 2019 levels. We also generated record consumer-initiated testing revenue through QuestDirect in the third quarter. While COVID testing has been strong contributing to growth, we expect our base direct-to-consumer testing revenue to more than double this year.
Recently, we soft launched a comprehensive health profile on QuestDirect, similar to our Blueprint for Wellness offering for employers. This expanded health plan and P&L offers a deep dive into consumers' health profile, with a battery of tests and biometric measurements to provide a personalized health quotient score that can be used to track health progress over time. And then finally, our MyQuest app and patient portal now has almost 20 million users.
In advanced diagnostics, we continue to ramp investments and see strong momentum in key growth drivers. We're seeing strong growth in noninvasive prenatal testing, significantly above 2019 levels and saw solid contribution in our specialty genetics portfolio from Blueprint Genetics. We continue to work closely with the CDC to sequence positive COVID specimens in an ongoing effort to track emerging variants, expanding of the work that we performed in the quarter. 
And then finally, we plan to introduce a test service based on a new F proof companion diagnostic for Agilent for a therapy from Eli Lilly for a certain type of high-risk early breast cancer. Quest will be the first laboratory to offer it to physicians nationally at the end of the month.
Turning to our second strategy, driving operational excellence. We made progress and remain on track to deliver our targeted 3% annual efficiencies across the business. Last week, we announced that we completed the integration and consolidation of our Northeast regional operations into our new 250,000 square foot next-generation lab in Clifton, New Jersey. This state-of-the-art, highly automated facility services more than 40 million people across 7 states.
In Patient Services, we are seeing all-time high numbers of patients making appointments to visit our patient service centers. Now more than 50% of patient service center visits are now by appointment versus walk-ins. And this enables patients to be very satisfied and also improves our ability to drive productivity for our phlebotomists.
Similar to our immunoassay platform consolidation, we recently procured a highly automated euro analysis platform that is expected to generate millions in annual savings once these new systems are standardized across our laboratory network.
And then finally, I'd like to recognize and thank all of our nearly 50,000 employees who have worked tirelessly to provide critical COVID-19 testing to our country throughout the pandemic and continue to serve the health care needs of patients who depend on Quest every day. As a demonstration of our gratitude, we're assisting our employees with a onetime payment of up to $500 designed to reimburse costs that they incurred during the pandemic.
Additionally, another year of pandemic pressures and travel restrictions have made it very difficult for many employees to take their hard-earned time off. Therefore, we are providing a payout of most unused paid time off for our hourly employees to ensure they don't forfeit their earned unused time at year-end. 
Now I would like to turn it over to Mark to provide more details on the third quarter financial performance and updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mark?"

In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.77 billion, down 0.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were essentially flat compared to the prior year, which is reflected by lower revenue from COVID-1",699,"Thanks, Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.77 billion, down 0.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were essentially flat compared to the prior year, which is reflected by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the third quarter of last year, largely offset by the strong ongoing recovery in our base testing revenue.
Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew approximately 6% in the third quarter, and it was up nearly 2%, excluding acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 5.3% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing approximately 2%. Compared to our third quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 9%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 4% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year. 
We saw a rebound in our base business volumes in September, following a modest softening in August that we believe was at least partially caused by the rise of the Delta variant and the timing of summer vacations. Importantly, the base business revenue and volume grew sequentially in the third quarter. This helps illustrate the ongoing recovery as historically, total revenue and volume typically stepped down in Q3 versus Q2 due to summer seasonality.
As most of you know, COVID-19 testing volumes grew in the third quarter versus Q2, which was in line with broader COVID-19 testing trends across the country. We received approximately 7.6 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the third quarter. So far in October, average COVID-19 molecular volumes have declined approximately 10% from where we exited Q3, but are still above the levels we expected prior to the surge of the Delta variant, while the base business continues to improve since September.
Revenue per requisition declined 5.4% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume and, to a lesser extent, recent PLS wins. Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $652 million or 23.5% of revenues compared to $718 million or 25.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q3 was $694 million or 25% of revenues compared to $831 million or 29.8% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by the recovery in our base business.
Reported EPS was $4.02 in the quarter compared to $4.14 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.96 compared to $4.31 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.75 billion through September year-to-date versus $1.46 billion in the same period last year.
Turning to guidance. We have raised our full year 2021 outlook as follows. Revenue is expected to be between $10.45 billion and $10.6 billion, an increase of approximately 11% to 12% versus the prior year. Reported EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.69 and $15.09, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $13.50 and $13.90. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. 
Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated outlook. We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to continue to decline from Q3 levels throughout the remainder of the year. At the low end of our outlook, we assumed approximately 50,000 molecular tests per day in Q4 and serology volumes to hold relatively steady at approximately 5,000 tests per day. As you may know, late last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through late January. We expect reimbursement for clinical COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the remainder of the year. However, we continue to assume average reimbursements to trend lower in Q4 and as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes potentially shift from clinical diagnostic testing to more return-to-life surveillance testing.
Finally, we continue to assume low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in Q4 versus 2019. Getting to the midpoint, our higher end of our outlook range assumes stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and/or stronger growth in our base business.
I will now turn it back to Steve."

Kevin, just to be clear upfront, we haven't provided guidance yet for 2022. We provided an outlook, and we did confirm that today. And things have largely played out where we saw them for 2022 back in March. The base volumes have recovered. We thought we were ahead in June when it was close to being flat to 2019, and potentially saw some upside.
Obviously, with Delta, it took a little bit of a step back. But we still expect to enter 2022 with a base volume utilization level similar to pre-pandemic. So that's good.
The second thing is we did assume that COVID will continue at a much lower level than we saw in '20 and '21, but still to be significant and certainly much larger than our current flu testing. And we've referenced in the past that at some point, COVID testing will still be here, but maybe more on the level of flu testing.
At this point, we felt comfortable with what we had assumed back in March around continued need for COVID testing for PCR. And we envisioned a stronger role for serology going into 2022 and think that's a potential. So we feel good about that.
And then we did reference inflationary pressures. We certainly have longer-term contracts on a lot of our purchases, but things like fuel, certainly, we're subject to inflation in the near term and going into 2022. And then most notably, as many people have talked, there's certainly inflation in wages and benefits and especially wages.
And that -- we look at that, we gave a range and we still feel very comfortable that when you put all those pieces together, that the $8.5 billion baseline for revenue in the $7.40 to $8 is certainly still deliverable, maybe in a slightly different way, but still very comfortable that, that's likely where we're going to land when we do finally provide guidance for 2022."

And -- the second strategy is to drive operational excellence, and we have maintained and just reiterated that we do believe we can continue to deliver 3% efficiency or productivity gains going forward.
And that 3% comes from a variety of programs across Quest Diagnostics, and one of which is what we did in Clifton and also reiterated a couple of other programs on the prepared remarks, are working with our suppliers, with new integrated platforms, what we've done around immunoassay, what we're doing around our immunourine analysis is -- are 2 good examples of more work we can get the benefits from them and there's others. 
So there's a lot more efficiencies and productivity we can continue to get. And as I said before, this is a cost-cutting. This is improvement. And so every time we make an improvement in our operation, we expect our quality improves and our service performance improves, and it has. So we continue to make profit. You see it in our numbers this year, and you'll continue to see in our '22 numbers as well, and that's always been used to offset headwinds.
And we do have headwinds. We've had headwinds from wage build increases in the past, albeit maybe it could be a little bit higher going forward given what we see in the labor market. And then second is we have seen headwinds from price consequences as well, which we've been able to offset. 
And we'll have some of those in '22 as we've outlined before. And then also any additional inflationary pressures, we will be able to offset most of that, if not all of that, to be able to hit the outlook. And we just reiterated our confidence in our ability to do that. So hopefully, that's helpful."

We obviously considered a net benefit because giving access helps us grow our business. It certainly makes us more attractive, especially in a world of consumerism. And it's a good thing, but it certainly will drive cost -- the labor cost as a percentage of overall cost in the other direction."

One is that we're picking up access in the number of lives. I mentioned 90% of inter lives or we're a network with within the United States, and we're happy about the progress of picking some more up this coming year. So that's moving along.
Second, as far as pricing is concerned, we continue to march through our contracts as they are up from renewal. And we have said in earlier calls that we're now very fairly priced. As a matter of fact, we believe we offer a very affordable price offering to the health plans and their memberships with great quality, great service and very competitive pricing, so much so that we're part of these preferred lab networks.
So we're justified. We are getting some modest price increases. And we do believe, going forward, that we can continue to pound that drum. And we are using what other people are using across the United States that, in fact, now that we're entering a new inflationary period, our costs are going up just like yours and therefore, we need to start talking about modest price increases going forward.

So this whole notion of a price below Medicare, which was the historical practice, is going away with PAMA.
Now you add inflation, as you suggest, and it's absolutely part of the conversation we've been having over the last number of months. And I can tell you that although it's not final, there is one national payer that we've been negotiating. And it's not final, but it looks like the first price increase we will have gotten from them and certainly my tenure and I'm sure more than a decade.
So we've been stabilizing as we shared our commercial negotiations to go from a world of price declines every contract extension to getting it more flat. And we actually have shared there's a handful of regional plans where we've got increases over the last couple of years. And now we have a national contract that I'm very optimistic we're going to get an increase.
And so how much of it's inflation? How much of it's PAMA? How much of it is our value proposition? And seeing that working with us is a benefit for everyone versus treating us as a commoditized provider of laboratory result. I? Can't tell you, but we're in a much better place."

So thanks, A.J., for your question. Let me take the first one, and I'll ask Mark to comment on the second part of your question.
First of all, COVID tests, we all know, has really increased considerably during the pandemic and has really hit an inflection point. And patients and consumers are now very comfortable with getting a portion of their health care delivered through telehealth networks, whatever that might be. And as we have watched it initially, a lot of the telehealth visits started with mental health and behavior health and have now transitioned to more general health and primary care and even specialized care.
So with all those visits happening in telehealth, you have to engage with the patient and have to be able to enter orders. And fortunately, for us, despite the pandemic and before the pandemic, we have strong relationships with all the telehealth companies. And as you would expect, they're only going to work with a small group of laboratories, and Quest would be one of those laboratories. So we're very well positioned with the telehealth providers.
But you also know that even though there are telehealth companies, telehealth is provided through integrated delivery systems, hospital systems in different ways, and they might use one of the telehealth provider platforms, but they're still providing that through their physicians and using their EMR. And so when they enter the order, it's going to be entered the order the same way as in the past. 
So we're watching it carefully. We do believe it's a positive trend for us given what I just described, but it's complicated because it all depends how telehealth platforms are deployed, and particularly with so many owned physicians by integrated delivery systems, and they're still conducting the business as they do. It all depends how they actually implement their telehealth services throughout their network and how that will affect our business. But again, for us, we believe it is a positive.
So Mark, do you want to take the second part?"

A lot of that investment has actually been more towards top line acceleration. So we've talked about what we're doing in advanced diagnostics. We talked about what we're doing, what requires to build the consumer business. So I'd say a disproportionate amount of the opportunity as we try to balance near-term results with longer-term value creation has really been in top line.
But yes, as we looked at some of the things we did during the pandemic, we have an opportunity to update our molecular equipment and into more efficient, more state-of-the-art, probably faster than where we would have cycled. So that will give us some efficiency that maybe we wouldn't have otherwise. 
So I wouldn't, at this point, suggest that we're ready to commit to more than the 3% productivity because obviously, that's a large number in and of itself, and small basis points changes are really significant. But directionally, I would say, yes, A.J., that this pandemic goal of value creation and additional cash has enabled us to accelerate some investments, most of it on the top line growth, but certainly some on the productivity side as well."

Base volume, in total, is obviously anything non-COVID related as we've been through the pandemic. We've been reporting strong growth in base volume, which includes our M&A and our POS, as you would expect. But we've also been trying to provide some color on utilization in the absence of an independent way to measure that we look at our base volume ex the acquired volume and ex the new PLS deals.
And we've talked about that continuing to improve, in addition to the growth we're getting from M&A and from PLS. So in June, the organic base volumes, ex the new PLS deals was getting close to back to the 2019 levels, and then it kind of stabilized in August. And July, it took a little bit of a step back in August. And then as we see where we are, through September and into October, it's getting back again very close to being fully recovered in 2019. And that's why I said earlier, that we would expect certainly by the end of this year and going into '22 that we'll be fully recovered. 
Now it is regionally variable as we've talked in the past, and that really has not changed. There are certain regions that are actually above where they were in 2019, most notably our Southwest region as we're looking at Florida, South, the volume trends are above. And then a couple of other areas that are kind of in that middle point, and then the one area of note that's really been lagging in the East. And it continues to lag. While it certainly has improved from where it was several months ago, it's still down and kind of an outlier, especially in the 5 boroughs of New York City. 
And then quickly, I'll answer the question on the revenue expectations for molecular testing, and I'll let Steve talk about the back-to-life. So we are still around $90 in the quarter. we're not expecting a meaningful decline in the fourth quarter. Certainly, if back-to-life really, really took off, which is not what we're expecting in the middle of our guidance here, it could have a little bit of a role. But again, it's still net positive. It's just math. So you can expect, for your modeling purposes, that just a very, very slight decline in Q4, nothing of significance."

And as you can expect, it's tough for us to know exactly, particularly which bucket we can put those in. But I can tell you that the trend line is trending towards more of the return to life. We see the infection rates coming down, and we see programs that we've worked on going up.
Examples are the return to school programs. We mentioned 20 states and 5 more coming. We're also doing some testing for employers if they have mandates in place where they're requiring vaccination or testing. So we see some increase in testing related to, again, employers bringing people back to the workplace and requiring testing or vaccination for that.
So I would say trending-wise, it is a larger percentage than before. But it's very difficult for us to give you exact numbers on that because we just don't get it through the orders that we received. But we think what we provided for guidance is clearly what's going to happen in '22."

Can you give us a sense of how much flu testing you do a year, if that's what you're anchoring for baseline COVID testing going forward? And then separately, I was just hoping you could talk about COVID reimbursement and the outlook of that for next year? 
Obviously, you mentioned PHE got extended at least for the early part of next year.

Is that tied to PAG? Or help us understand sort of how that's negotiated, and if there's a step down there for next year."

So it's quite a bit there, Ralph, we'll see if we can touch on all of them. So we don't generally share the precise revenue for any given test offering, but it's significantly lower than our current levels of COVID and what we would anticipate.
So the flu is not the baseline for 2022. We still expect COVID testing to be multiples of our fee revenues in 2022. And the reason flu testing is smaller than would be otherwise is there's not a ton of molecular testing them. Physicians have become very comfortable with doing point of care. Even though molecular is more precised, they feel that it's good enough in the office and they have an opportunity to make money on it.
So we will probably be several years, although I don't have the ability to call it precisely before we would expect COVID to be at our flu level. And then in terms of the pricing, we have either specific agreements or general agreements that as long as in the commercial rates -- as long as the federal health emergency continues, that the pricing will reflect what were being paid by the federal government. 
So it's not mechanistically tied to every contract, but we know that the expectation would be when that goes away. And again, there's still always a possibility they can decouple that $100 reimbursement rate from the health emergency. And so there's some other risks as well. But as long as that continues, we would expect most of our commercial pricing to be at the same rate. And then obviously, when that goes away, that we would expect the negotiations to take it down to more the NLA level. 
So when I talked about 2022 at the Investor Day, I talked about a reimbursement rate around $50, which is what the NLA is. And so again, when you put all these pieces together, I want to be clear we still fully expect to be in the upper end of that $7.40 to $8. I just wanted to caution against upside to that, given everything that's going on with inflation and so on, because we do have some positive things that have developed over the last 6 months or so.
And some of that is probably going to be partially offset, if not, largely offset by labor inflation. So we're still pretty much where we were back in March, in the higher end of the $7.40 to $8, and then certainly at least $8.5 billion of revenue, which importantly ties back to the 2018 CAGR that we shared with you at Investor Day. And so just getting there in a little different way, but still getting to where we said we would be."

But we've been managing our way through that. Fortunately, we have our own network of couriers. We have about 3,500 couriers in automobiles to request employees. We have a fleet of small airplanes that do some of the connections between our collection locations and our laboratories, and they're employed by us. And so we're happy we had those in these uncertain times. And we continue to have strong relationships with the national payers as well. So so far, so good."

Just since we're comparing to 2019, it's excluding some of the really large deals that we've done recently so that we don't cloud what we think utilization is.
So we had a PLS business size back in 2019. I'm not taking that out because, obviously, that's part of the trend as well. So when you look at the sources, we've shared that the recovery has been pretty broad-based. There's not a lot of differences, especially now early in the pandemic. There were some. We talked about for certain drug monitoring, certainly being one that was lagging. A lot of that was policy driven. Some of that -- not all of it, but a lot of it's been addressed. 
And certainly, we've seen the toxicology prescription drug monitoring business coming back in the same ballpark as some of our other clinical areas. We did see hospitals recovering faster early in the pandemic as they return to treating patients for elective surgeries and so on. Physician office was a little more lagging. But at this point, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, the physician business is quite strong, and we're seeing the volumes, especially in some of the regions, above where they were in 2019. So we don't feel, other than the East, that there's been any sort of a fundamental change in either patient engagement with physician offices and/or the prescribing practices for our diagnostics business specifically."

Well, we had a strong third quarter as COVID-19 molecular volumes increased throughout the summer, while our base business continued to deliver solid value growth versus the prior year and 2019.",1380,"Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, we had a strong third quarter as COVID-19 molecular volumes increased throughout the summer, while our base business continued to deliver solid value growth versus the prior year and 2019.  
In late summer, we experienced some softness in the base business across the country, but soft in rebound in September. Importantly, our base business continued to improve sequentially in the third quarter, which speaks to the ongoing recovery. We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher-than-anticipated COVID-19 volumes as well as continued progress we expect to see in our base business, despite rising labor cost and inflationary pressures. The momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day. 
So this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the third quarter of 2021 and update you on our base business, and then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our updated outlook and underlying assumptions.
But before turning to our results in the third quarter, I'd like to update you on the progress we've made in our Quest for Health Equity initiative, a more than $100 million initiative aimed at reducing health care disparities in underserved neighborhoods. Since we've established it just over a year ago, we have launched 18 programs across the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from supporting COVID-19 testing of vaccination events, to educating young students on healthy nutritional choices, to providing funding support for our long-haul COVID-19 clinic in Puerto Rico. 
Recently, we announced a collaboration with the American Heart Association that will expand research and mentorship opportunities for Black and Hispanic scholars to drive hypertension management and COVID-19 relief. We're off to a good start, and I look forward to updating you on our continued progress as Quest for Health Equity enters its second year.
Now turning to our results for the third quarter. Total revenue of $2.77 billion, down 40 basis points versus the prior year. Earnings per share were $4.02 on a reported basis, down approximately 3% versus the prior year and $3.96 on an adjusted basis, down 8% versus the prior year. The revenue and earnings declines in the third quarter reflect lower COVID-19 testing in 2021 versus the prior year, partially offset by continued recovery in our base business. Cash provided by operations increased by nearly 20% year-to-date through September to approximately $1.75 billion.
Now starting with COVID-19 testing. Our COVID-19 molecular volumes increased in the third quarter versus the second quarter due to the spread of the Delta variant over the course of the summer. Testing began to increase meaningfully in mid-July and peaked in early mid-September. Our observed positivity rate peaked in mid-August and has steadily been declining across much of the country in recent weeks. We performed an average of 83,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the third quarter and maintained strong average turnaround times of approximately 1 day for most specimens throughout the surge. 
As clinical COVID-19 volumes declined, we are expanding our nonclinical COVID-19 testing to support the return to school, office, travel and entertainment. We're making testing easy, fast and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country. We are currently performing K-12 school testing in approximately 20 states with 5 additional states ready to come online. We're testing passengers on Carnival Cruise Line and Quest exclusively provided testing at the Boston Marathon earlier this month. In the base business, we continue to make progress on our 2-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. 
Now here are some highlights from the third quarter. Our M&A pipeline remains strong. In the third quarter, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition of an independent lab in Florida. We continue to build on an exceptional health plan access of approximately 90% of all commercially-insured lives in the United States. At our Investor Day, we discussed how we have fundamentally changed our relationship with health plans, and we continue to see the promise of value-based relationships come to life. 
So here's a couple of examples. We are working with national health plans to help their self-insured employers, employer customers improve quality outcomes and lower the cost of care for both the employers and their employees. Also, effective October 1, we gained access to 1 million Advantage Medicaid members in Florida as their coverage transitions to Centene's Sunshine Health Plan. We're getting good feedback from the provider community and our growing testing volumes through this expanded access opportunity.
Our hospital health system revenue continues to track well above 2019 levels, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contracts. As we highlighted previously, 2021 performance is benefiting from 2 of our largest PLS contracts to date, Hackensack Meridian Health and Memorial Hermann. Altogether, our PLS business is expected to exceed $500 million in annual revenue this year. 
Trends in our hospital reference business also remained steady, with third quarter base testing volumes above 2019 levels. We also generated record consumer-initiated testing revenue through QuestDirect in the third quarter. While COVID testing has been strong contributor to growth, we expect our base direct-to-consumer testing revenue to more than double this year.
Recently, we soft launched a comprehensive health profile on QuestDirect, similar to our Blueprint for Wellness offering for employers. This expanded health plan and P&L offers a deep dive into consumers' health profile, with a battery of tests and biometric measurements to provide a personalized health quotient score that can be used to track health progress over time. And then finally, our MyQuest app and patient portal now has almost 20 million users.
In Advanced Diagnostics, we continue to ramp investments and see strong momentum in key growth drivers. We're seeing strong growth in noninvasive prenatal testing, significantly above 2019 levels and saw solid contribution in our specialty genetics portfolio from Blueprint Genetics. We continue to work closely with the CDC to sequence positive COVID specimens in an ongoing effort to track emerging variants, expanding of the work that we performed in the quarter.  
And then finally, we plan to introduce a test service based on a new FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Agilent for a therapy from Eli Lilly for a certain type of high-risk early breast cancer. Quest will be the first laboratory to offer it to physicians nationally at the end of the month.
Turning to our second strategy, driving operational excellence. We made progress to remain on track to deliver our targeted 3% annual efficiencies across the business. Last week, we announced that we completed the integration and consolidation of our Northeast regional operations into our new 250,000 square foot next-generation lab in Clifton, New Jersey. This state-of-the-art, highly automated facility services more than 40 million people across 7 states. 
In Patient Services, we are seeing all-time high numbers of patients making appointments to visit our Patient Service Centers. Now more than 50% of Patient Service Center visits are now by appointment versus walk-ins. And this enables patients to be very satisfied and also improves our ability to drive productivity for our phlebotomists.
Similar to our immunoassay platform consolidation, we recently procured a highly automated euro analysis platform that is expected to generate millions in annual savings once these new systems are standardized across our laboratory network.
And then finally, I'd like to recognize and thank all of our nearly 50,000 employees who have worked tirelessly to provide critical COVID-19 testing to our country throughout the pandemic and continue to serve the health care needs of patients who depend on Quest every day. As a demonstration of our gratitude, we're assisting our employees with a onetime payment of up to $500 designed to reimburse costs that they incurred during the pandemic. 
Additionally, another year of pandemic pressures and travel restrictions have made it very difficult for many employees to take their hard-earned time off. Therefore, we are providing a payout of most unused paid time off for our hourly employees to ensure they don't forfeit their earned unused time at year-end. 
Now I would like to turn it over to Mark to provide more details on the third quarter financial performance and updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mark?"

In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.77 billion, down 0.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were essentially flat compared to the prior year, which is reflected by lower revenue from COVID-1",699,"Thanks, Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.77 billion, down 0.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were essentially flat compared to the prior year, which is reflected by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the third quarter of last year, largely offset by the strong ongoing recovery in our base testing revenue.
Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew approximately 6% in the third quarter, and it was up nearly 2%, excluding acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 5.3% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing approximately 2%. Compared to our third quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 9%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 4% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year. 
We saw a rebound in our base business volumes in September, following a modest softening in August that we believe was at least partially caused by the rise of the Delta variant and the timing of summer vacations. Importantly, our base business revenue and volume grew sequentially in the third quarter. This helps illustrate the ongoing recovery as historically, total revenue and volume typically stepped down in Q3 versus Q2 due to summer seasonality. 
As most of you know, COVID-19 testing volumes grew in the third quarter versus Q2, which was in line with broader COVID-19 testing trends across the country. We resulted approximately 7.6 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the third quarter. So far in October, average COVID-19 molecular volumes have declined approximately 10% from where we exited Q3, but are still above the levels we expected prior to the surge of the Delta variant, while the base business continues to improve since September.
Revenue per requisition declined 5.4% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume and, to a lesser extent, recent PLS wins. Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $652 million or 23.5% of revenues compared to $718 million or 25.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q3 was $694 million or 25% of revenues compared to $831 million or 29.8% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by the recovery in our base business. Reported EPS was $4.02 in the quarter compared to $4.14 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.96 compared to $4.31 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.75 billion through September year-to-date versus $1.46 billion in the same period last year. 
Turning to guidance. We have raised our full year 2021 outlook as follows. Revenue is expected to be between $10.45 billion and $10.6 billion, an increase of approximately 11% to 12% versus the prior year. Reported EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.69 and $15.09, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $13.50 and $13.90. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.  
Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated outlook. We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to continue to decline from Q3 levels throughout the remainder of the year. At the low end of our outlook, we assumed approximately 50,000 molecular tests per day in Q4 and serology volumes to hold relatively steady at approximately 5,000 tests per day. As you may know, late last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through late January. We expect reimbursement for clinical COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the remainder of the year. However, we continue to assume average reimbursements to trend lower in Q4 and as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes potentially shift from clinical diagnostic testing to more return-to-life surveillance testing. 
Finally, we continue to assume low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in Q4 versus 2019. Getting to the midpoint, our higher end of our outlook range assumes stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and/or stronger growth in our base business. 
I will now turn it back to Steve."

Kevin, just to be clear upfront, we haven't provided guidance yet for 2022. We provided an outlook, and we did confirm that today. And things have largely played out where we saw them for 2022 back in March. The base volumes have recovered. We thought we were ahead in June when it was close to being flat to 2019, and potentially saw some upside. Obviously, with Delta, it took a little bit of a step back. But we still expect to enter 2022 with a base volume utilization level similar to pre-pandemic. So that's good. 
The second thing is we did assume that COVID will continue at a much lower level than we saw in '20 and '21, but still to be significant and certainly much larger than our current flu testing. And we've referenced in the past that at some point, COVID testing will still be here, but maybe more on the level of flu testing. 
At this point, we felt comfortable with what we had assumed back in March around continued need for COVID testing for PCR. And we envisioned a stronger role for serology going into 2022 and think that's a potential. So we feel good about that. 
And then we did reference inflationary pressures. We certainly have longer-term contracts on a lot of our purchases, but things like fuel, certainly, we're subject to inflation in the near term and going into 2022. And then most notably, as many people have talked, there's certainly inflation in wages and benefits, and especially in wages. 
And that -- as we look at that, we gave a range and we still feel very comfortable that when you put all those pieces together, that the $8.5 billion baseline for revenue in the $7.40 to $8 is certainly still deliverable, maybe in a slightly different way, but still very comfortable that, that's likely where we're going to land when we do finally provide guidance for 2022."

And -- the second strategy is to drive operational excellence, and we have maintained and just reiterated that we do believe we can continue to deliver 3% efficiency or productivity gains going forward. 
And that 3% comes from a variety of programs across Quest Diagnostics, and one of which is what we did in Clifton and also reiterated a couple of other programs on the prepared remarks, are working with our suppliers with new integrated platforms, what we've done around immunoassay, what we're doing around our [indiscernible] analysis is -- are 2 good examples of more work we can get the benefits from and there's others. So there's a lot more efficiencies and productivity we can continue to get. And as I said before, this is not cost-cutting. This is improvement. And so every time we make an improvement in our operation, we expect our quality improves and our service performance improves, and it has. So we continue to make progress. You see it in our numbers this year, and you'll continue to see it in our '22 numbers as well, and that's always been used to offset headwinds. 
And we do have headwinds. We've had headwinds from wage build increases in the past albeit maybe it could be a little bit higher going forward given what we see in the labor market. And then second is we have seen headwinds from price consequences as well, which we've been able to offset. And we'll have some of those in '22 as we've outlined before. And then also any additional inflationary pressures, we will be able to offset most of that, if not all of that, to be able to hit the outlook. And we just reiterated our confidence and our ability to do that. So hopefully, that's helpful."

Second, as far as pricing is concerned, we continue to march through our contracts as they are up from renewal. And we have said in earlier calls that we're now very fairly priced. As a matter of fact, we believe we offer a very affordable price offering to the health plans and their memberships with great quality, great service and very competitive pricing, so much so that we're part of these preferred lab networks.
So we're justified. We are getting some modest price increases. And we do believe, going forward, that we can continue to pound that drum and we are using what other people are using across the United States that, in fact, now that we're entering a new inflationary period, our costs are going up just like yours and therefore, we need to start talking about modest price increases going forward.

So this whole notion of a price below Medicare, which was the historical practice, is going away with PAMA.
Now you add inflation, as you suggest, and it's absolutely part of the conversation we've been having over the last number of months. And I can tell you that although it's not final, there is one national payer that we've been negotiating. And it's not final, but it looks like the first price increase we will have gotten from them in certainly tenure and I'm sure more than a decade.
So we've been stabilizing as we shared our commercial negotiations to go from a world of price declines every contract extension to getting it more flat. And we actually have shared there's a handful of regional plans where we've got increases over the last couple of years. And now we have a national contract that I'm very optimistic we're going to get an increase.
And so how much of it's inflation, how much of it's PAMA, how much of it is our value proposition and seeing that working with us is a benefit for everyone versus treating us as a commoditized provider of laboratory result, can't tell you, but we're in a much better place."

So thanks, A.J., for your question. Let me take the first one, and I'll ask Mark to comment on the second part of your question.
First of all, COVID tests, we all know, has really increased considerably during the pandemic and has really hit an inflection point. And patients and consumers are now very comfortable with getting a portion of their health care delivered through telehealth networks, whatever that might be. And as we have watched it initially, a lot of the telehealth visits started with mental health and behavior health and have now transitioned to more general health and primary care and even specialized care.
So with all those visits happening in telehealth, you have to engage with the patient and have to be able to enter orders. And fortunately, for us, despite the pandemic and before the pandemic, we have strong relationships with all the telehealth companies. And as you would expect, they're only going to work for us with a small group of laboratories, and Quest would be one of those laboratories. So we're very well positioned with the telehealth providers.
But you also know that even though there are telehealth companies, telehealth is provided through integrated delivery systems, hospital systems in different ways, and they might use one of the telehealth provider platforms, but they're still providing that through their physicians and using their EMR. And so when they enter the order, it's going to be enter the order the same way as in the past. 
So we're watching it carefully. We do believe that there's a positive trend for us given what I just described, but it's complicated because it all depends how telehealth platforms are deployed, and particularly with so many owned physicians by integrated delivery systems, and they're still conducting the business as they do. It all depends how they actually implement their telehealth services throughout their network and how that will affect our business. But again, for us, we believe it is a positive.
So Mark, do you want to take the second part?"

But yes, as we looked at some of the things we did during the pandemic, we have an opportunity to update our molecular equipment and into more efficient, more state-of-the-art, probably faster than where we would have cycled. So that will give us some efficiency that maybe we wouldn't have otherwise.

Can you give us a breakdown how much of that was contributed to like this back-to-life initiative, whether it's schools, city states, more like maintenance testing?

Base volume, in total, is obviously anything non-COVID related as we've been through the pandemic. We've been reporting strong growth in base volume, which includes our M&A and our PLS, as you would expect. But we've also been trying to provide some color on utilization in the absence of an independent way to measure that, we look at our base volume ex the acquired volume and ex the new PLS deals.
And we've talked about that continuing to improve, in addition to the growth we're getting from M&A and from PLS. So in June, the organic base volumes, ex the new PLS deals was getting close back to the 2019 levels, and then it kind of stabilized in August -- in July, it took a little bit of a step back in August. And then as we see where we are, through September and into October, it's getting back again very close to being fully recovered in 2019. And that's why I said earlier, that we would expect certainly by the end of this year and going into '22 that we'll be fully recovered. 
Now it is regionally variable as we've talked in the past, and that really has not changed. There are certain regions that are actually above where they were in 2019, most notably our Southwest region as we're looking at Florida in the South, the volume trends are above. And then a couple of other areas that are kind of in that middle point, and then the one area of note that's really been lagging is the East. And it continues to lag while it certainly has improved from where it was several months ago, it's still down and kind of an outlier, especially in the 5 boroughs of New York City. 
And then quickly, I'll answer the question on the revenue expectations for molecular testing, and I'll let Steve talk about the back-to-life. So we are still around $90 in the quarter. We're not expecting a meaningful decline in the fourth quarter. Certainly, if back-to-life really, really took off, which is not what we're expecting in the middle of our guidance here, it could have a little bit of a role. But again, it's still net positive, it's just math. So you can expect, for your modeling purposes, just a very, very slight decline in Q4, nothing of significance."

And as you can expect, it's tough for us to know exactly, particularly which bucket we can put those in. But I can tell you that the trend line is trending towards more of the return-to-life. We see the infection rates coming down, and we see programs that we've worked on going up.
Examples are the return to school programs. We mentioned 20 states and 5 more coming. We're also doing some testing for employers if they have mandates in place where they're requiring vaccination or testing. So we see some increase in testing related to, again, employers bringing people back to the workplace and requiring testing or vaccination for that.
So I would say trending-wise, it is a larger percentage than before. But it's very difficult for us to give you exact numbers on that because we just don't get it through the orders that we've received. But we think what we provided for guidance is clearly what's going to happen in '22."

Can you give us a sense of how much flu testing you do a year, if that's what you're anchoring for baseline COVID testing going forward? And then separately, I was just hoping you could talk about COVID reimbursement and the outlook of that for next year? 
Obviously, you mentioned PHE got extended at least for the early part of next year. If that continues to expand, would you expect reimbursement to be better than what you assumed in that $8 EPS for next year? And then also, what about commercial pricing, specifically for COVID? Is that tied to PAG? Or help us understand sort of how that's negotiated, and if there's a step down there for next year?"

So there's quite a bit there, Ralph. We'll see if we can touch on all of them.

So there's quite a bit there, Ralph. We'll see if we can touch on all of them. So we don't generally share the precise revenue for any given test offering, but it's significantly lower than our current levels of COVID and what we would anticipate.
So the flu is not the baseline for 2022. We still expect COVID testing to be multiples of our flu revenues in 2022. And the reason flu testing is smaller than would be otherwise is there's not a ton of molecular testing done. Physicians have become very comfortable with doing point of care. Even though molecular is more precised, they feel that it's good enough for the office and they have an opportunity to make money on it.
So it will probably be several years, although I don't have the ability to call it precisely before we would expect COVID to be at our flu level. And then in terms of the pricing, we have either specific agreements or general agreements that as long as -- in the commercial rates, but as long as the federal health emergency continues, that the pricing will reflect what were being paid by the federal government. 
So it's not mechanistically tied to every contract, but we know that the expectation would be when that goes away. And again, there's still always a possibility they can decouple that $100 reimbursement rate from the health emergency. And so there's some other risks as well. But as long as that continues, we would expect most of our commercial pricing to be at the same rate. And then obviously, when that goes away, that we would expect the negotiations to take it down to more the NLA level. 
So when I talked about 2022 at the Investor Day, I talked about a reimbursement rate around $50, which is what the NLA is. And so again, when you put all these pieces together, I want to be clear, we still fully expect to be in the upper end of that $7.40 to $8. I just wanted to caution against upside to that, given everything that's going on with inflation and so on, because we do have some positive things that have developed over the last 6 months or so.
And some of that is probably going to be partially offset, if not, largely offset by labor inflation. So we're still pretty much where we were back in March, in the higher end of the $7.40 to $8, and then certainly at least $8.5 billion of revenue, which importantly ties back to the 2018 CAGR that we shared with you at Investor Day. And so just getting there in a little different way, but still getting to where we said we would be."

So the last part of this is around logistics. And again, logistics have become a little more complicated given we do use commercial carriers for some portion of our logistics. But we've been managing our way through that. Fortunately, we have our own network of couriers. We have about 3,500 couriers in automobiles that are Quest employees.

Since we're comparing to 2019, it's excluding some of the really large deals that we've done recently so that we don't cloud what we think utilization is.
So we had a PLS business size back in 2019. I'm not taking that out because, obviously, that's part of the trend as well. So when you look at the sources, we've shared that -- the recovery has been pretty broad-based. There's not a lot of differences, especially now. Early in the pandemic, there were some. We talked about certain drug monitoring, certainly being one that was lagging. A lot of that was policy driven. Some of that -- not all of it, but a lot of it's been addressed. 
And certainly, we've seen the toxicology or prescription drug monitoring business coming back in the same ballpark as some of our other clinical areas. We did see hospitals recovering faster early in the pandemic as they return to treating patients for elective surgeries and so on. Physician office was a little more lagging. But at this point, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, the physician business is quite strong and we're seeing the volumes, especially in some of the regions, above where they were in 2019. So we don't feel, other than the East, that there's been any sort of a fundamental change in either patient engagement with physician offices and/or the prescribing practices for our diagnostics business specifically."
