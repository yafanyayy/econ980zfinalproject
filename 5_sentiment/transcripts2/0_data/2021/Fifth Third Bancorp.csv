Earlier today, we reported full year 2020 net income of $1.4 billion or $1.83 per share. We delivered strong financial results in 2020 despite the challenging operating environment brought on by the pandemic.
We had several highlights for the year. We generated a record adjusted pre-provision net revenue. We maintained our expense discipline, producing an adjusted efficiency ratio below 59%, which was stable compared to the prior year and remains near a decade low. We generated a record adjusted fee revenue, including records in both our commercial and wealth and asset management businesses. We also continue to generate peer-leading consumer household growth of 3% with outsized success in Chicago and our key southeast markets.
While nearly doubling our reserves, we generated 11.7% and adjusted return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, for the full year and generated an ROTCE of 18.4% in the fourth quarter. Just as importantly, we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping 99% of our branches open for business, while working closely with our customers to support them during these challenging times through the PPP program, part shipper leaf programs and other outreach efforts that we have previously discussed. Our efforts have been nosed externally.
We were recognized by an independent third-party as a top-performing bank among the 12 largest U.S. retail banks based on our pandemic response for our customers, communities and employees. Also, we had the honor winning the Greenwich middle market CX award, reflecting our commitment to delivering a superior customer experience before enduring the COVID-19 crisis.
Additionally, during the year, we published our inaugural ESG report, highlighting our efforts to generate sustainable value for all stakeholders. And just this week, we announced that we became the first regional bank to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations.
Turning to the fourth quarter. We reported net income of $604 million. Our reported EPS include a negative $0.10 impact from the item shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.88 per share. Jamie will walk you through the quarterly financial results in more detail in just a minute.
Focused execution on our key strategic priorities and our disciplined approach to credit risk management continue to drive strong financial performance. As we recently announced, we have taken decisive action to drive efficiencies and improve the long-term profitability of the bank by streamlining our operations, including divesting less profitable businesses such as property and casualty insurance, while still investing in areas of growth and profitability. For example, we recently finalized the acquisition of H2C, which strengthens our health care investment banking and strategic advisory capabilities. We continue to assess, select strategic investments in nonbank acquisitions to improve fee growth.
All reported and adjusted return metrics were solid and improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong operating results including the provision for credit loss performance. We expect a positive momentum in our operating results to continue in 2021.
Net interest income increased 1% sequentially despite loan portfolio headwinds. Underlying NIM, which excludes excess cash and PPP impacts, increased 8 basis points sequentially. We expect to generate differentiated NIM performance relative to peers in 2021 and beyond, reflecting the hedge and investment portfolio actions we have taken over the past several years.
Our credit portfolio remains solid, with net charge-offs of 43 basis points stable compared to the recent quarters. Also, our criticized assets and allowance for credit losses, both declined sequentially, reflecting our credit discipline and improved credit results and economic outlook. We continue to benefit from diversification and resilience of our fee-based businesses in retail, commercial and wealth and asset management. Many of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates.
Our robust capital equity levels further improved this quarter, indicative of our balance sheet strength. Our regulatory capital levels have increased for 3 consecutive quarters as a result of our strong earnings power, balance sheet dynamics and the Fed's temporary suspension of buybacks. With a partial relief announced by the Fed in December, we intend to execute up to $180 million in share repurchases in the first quarter. Through proactive management, we have built a strong and stable balance sheet and significantly improved the diversification of our fee revenue. We have done this all while maintaining our culture of expense discipline and demonstrating our commitment to consistent and solid due to cycle performance. Our financial performance continues to give us confidence that we can safely and soundly operate the company at a significant lower capital levels. Though our CET1 target remains at 9.5%. We will continue to valuate the appropriate target, capital target as the economy improves.
We are also seeing continued strength in our commercial loan production levels in our pipelines. Fourth quarter loan production was the highest in 2020 and was down around 20% from the year ago quarter, but was up over 50% from the third quarter. We are encouraged by the recent trends with sequential improvement in almost all regions and all verticals. Strong production was more than offset by elevated payoffs and another 1% decline in line utilization.
Our middle market pipeline improvement is well diversified throughout our footprint, including signal strength in our Southeast markets. In corporate banking, pipeline strengthened begin this quarter with improvement in industrials, retail, health care, solar and financial institutions, partially offset by continued sluggishness in hospitality and energy. Based on a strong pipeline and stable utilization trends for the first 3 weeks of January, we currently expect C&I loan balances to improve on a period end basis during the first quarter, excluding the impact of PPP loans. Commercial real estate pipelines continue to be well below pre-COVID levels.
Before I turn it over to Jamie to for discuss results and our outlook, I want to reiterate our strategic priorities, which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. Our 4 key strategic parties have not changed over the past several years and include leveraging technology to accelerate digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection. We will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on areas where we see the highest probability for driving strong financial returns and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Our balancing strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve as well as we navigate this environment in 2021 and beyond.
I'd like to once again thank our employees, I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers and each other doing these challenging times. Fifth Third continues to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities well remain committed to equality, equity and inclusion for all. Till then, we made a 3-year $2.8 billion pledge to this commitment through lending, investing and donating, including a $25 million contribution to the Fifth Third foundation.
Our financial results continue to reflect our focused execution, discipline and through the cycle principles, we remain committed to generating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top-performing regional bank.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook."

One quick housekeeping item before discussing our financial results for the quarter. As you'll see in our earnings materials, we are no longer adjusting certain metrics for purchase accounting accretion or intangible amortization, given that they largely offset and have an immaterial impact on pretax income. We hope this will help simplify our disclosures going forward to more easily assess our financial ratio.
Now turning to our fourth quarter performance. We ended 2020 with positive momentum and delivered strong financial results. Reported results were impacted by several notable items, including: A $23 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return; a $21 million after-tax charge related to our acquisition and disposition actions, as Greg mentioned; the sale of our HSA business remains in process and should close by the end of this quarter; we also recognized a $16 million after-tax charge related to our branch and nonbranch real estate efficiency strategies. This includes impairments associated with 7 branches we will be closing in April as part of our normal rigor on reviewing our network for efficiencies. These closures are in addition to the 37 branches we announced last quarter. Furthermore, as Greg discussed, we recorded a $19 million after-tax charitable contribution expense to promote racial equality, and we also recorded $4 million after-tax from COVID related expenses.Lastly, we had a onetime favorable item related to state taxes of $13 million.
In terms of the financial highlights for the quarter. Despite the nearly 160 basis point decline in 1-month LIBOR over the last 12 months, we were able to generate an adjusted PPNR above the fourth quarter of 2019 level. We generated an efficiency ratio of 58%. Our operating performance reflected a 1% increase in NII, a 16% increase in adjusted fees and a 4% increase in adjusted expenses.
Given the strong PPNR results, combined with continued credit-related improvements, we produced strong reported and adjusted return metrics, including an adjusted ROA of 1.31% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.4%, excluding AOCI, despite growing our regulatory capital 20 basis points during the quarter.
Drilling into the income statement performance. The sequential increase in NII of 1% reflected the strength of our balance sheet and deposit franchise. We saw a 4 basis point improvement in our total loan yields, which was supported by both the continued benefits from our long duration, deep in the money cash flow hedges as well as $10 million in additional PPP income. Our NII results included $11 million of incremental favorable prepayment penalties in the securities portfolio, reflecting 1 of the benefits from our strategy to invest in Bullet and locked out cash flows. Approximately 59% of the investment portfolio still invested in Bullet and locked out cash flow as at quarter end. And our investment portfolio yield increased 9 basis points sequentially to 3.1%. Net premium amortization in our securities portfolio was only $1 million in the fourth quarter.
On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs by another 5 basis points. For the fourth quarter, the average cost of our core deposits was only 5 basis points. CD and debt maturities also provided a 2 basis point improvement to NIM versus the third quarter. Reported NIM was stable compared to the third quarter, reflecting the favorable securities portfolio and PPP income I mentioned, offset by the impact of higher cash levels. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, improved 8 basis points to 3.14%.
Once again, we had another strong quarter generating noninterest income to cushion the rate driven NII pressure. The resilience in our fee income levels continues to highlight the revenue diversification that we have achieved. Total noninterest income increased 9% relative to the third quarter. Excluding the notable items, noninterest income increased 16%. We generated record commercial banking revenue, which increased double digits sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strength across most of the business. We also recorded TRA income of $74 million, as well as gains from several of our direct fintech investments in venture capital funds. These investments generated $75 million of fee income in 2020, and we expect continued gains in 2021.
Top line mortgage banking revenue declined $46 million sequentially. Driven by a $26 million headwind reflecting a decline in rate lock volumes, a $12 million impact from our decision to retain $250 million of our retail production during the quarter and $8 million due to margin compression. MSR decay in servicing fees were unchanged sequentially and will remain challenged in this environment.
While we did not deliver the mortgage results we expected, due to capacity pressures, we have seen meaningful improvement in December and January. Noninterest expenses also increased relative to the third quarter, albeit to a much lesser extent than fees. Adjusted expenses were up 3%, excluding the mark-to-market impacts associated with nonqualified deferred compensation, but is offset in security gains within noninterest income. The largest contributor of the expense growth was performance-based compensation, driven by the strong performance in fees related to business growth and other revenue-linked expenses.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans declined 3% sequentially, with both commercial and consumer balances in line with our previous guidance ranges. Commercial loan balances continued to reflect lower revolver utilization rates, which decreased another 1% in the quarter to 32%. Line utilization rates so far in January are stable relative to the fourth quarter. We currently expect utilization to remain unchanged for the first half of 2021, and are forecasting only a modest increase of approximately 1% in the second half of the year as the economy improves.
Average CRE loans were flat sequentially, with end-of-period balances declining 1%. As we have discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment and supports our strategy of lower exposure and our focus on high quality borrowers. We have provided more information related to our CRE exposures in our presentation this quarter.
Average total consumer loans increased 1% sequentially, driven by continued growth in the auto portfolio, partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card. We took additional action in the consumer portfolio at the end of December to improve our NII trajectory for 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion of our excess liquidity by purchasing government-guaranteed residential mortgages currently in forbearance under the Cares Act provision. These loans are in our held-for-sale portfolio as they are not expected to be held for more than 1 to 2 years. These loans provide a more attractive risk-adjusted return than other current investment alternatives.
Our securities portfolio of roughly $35 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of paydowns, combined with the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities. Our investment portfolio positioning continues to support NII in the current environment, allowing for patients and investing at the current unattractive long-term rates. Given the potential for strong economic growth in the second half of 2021, we do not believe long duration securities are providing an appropriate risk return trade-off. As a result, we do not expect to grow our investment portfolio in the near term.
Our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained at $3.5 billion. Also, our deliberate actions within the securities portfolio over the past several years, focused on structuring the portfolio in anticipation of a lower rate environment and should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds. Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash increased to $35 billion, growing $5 billion from the prior quarter and $33 billion compared to the year ago quarter. In addition to the loan growth headwinds outside of PPP, the significant increase in excess cash reflects record deposit growth over the past 9 months. Core deposits increased 3% compared to the third quarter despite a 12% reduction in consumer CD balances, which helped drive down interest-bearing core deposit costs by 5 basis points.
Moving on to credit. Overall, credit quality continues to be solid, reflecting their disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, balance sheet optimization and the improved macroeconomic environment. Charge-offs remained well-behaved at 43 basis points. Nonperforming assets declined $67 million or 7%, with the resulting NPA ratio of 79 basis points, declining 5 basis points sequentially. Also, our criticized assets declined 12% with appreciable improvements in energy, industrial and middle market.
Given the solid credit results, lower end-of-period loan balances and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook, our reserve coverage declined 8 basis points to 2.41% of portfolio loans and leases, with improvement in both consumer and commercial. The low level of net charge-offs, combined with the $131 million decline in the allowance resulted in a net $13 million benefit to the provision loan.
Our ACL decline of $131 million was attributable to several factors. Approximately 1/3 of the decline was the result of lower-period end loan balances with the remainder of the release due to both the improved economic outlook and the improved commercial credit risk profile, which is reflected in our lower NPA and criticized asset levels.
As is required under CECL, our reserve reflects all known macroeconomic and credit quality information as of December 31. While we are not predicting or forecasting reserve releases at this point, given both the significant uncertainty in the economy and our loan growth expectations, to the extent there would be meaningful and sustained improvement in the broader economy that's not unreasonable that reserves could come down from here even if credit losses tick up.
Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below 2019 levels until the end of 2021. An unemployment rate higher than the current 6.7%, ending 2021 at 7.2% and declining to 5.6% by the end of 2022. Importantly, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from fiscal stimulus, generally consistent with the $900 billion package passed at the end of December, but does not incorporate additional relief as currently proposed by the new administration. We did not change our scenario rates of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $200 million release to our fourth quarter reserve. Conversely applying of 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $900 million bill. Inclusive of the impact of approximately $136 million in the remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio is 2.53%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL would be approximately 2.65%.
Moving to capital. Our capital remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.3%, above our stated target of 9.5%, which amounts to approximately $1.2 billion of excess capital. As a reminder, we have remaining capacity to purchase 76 million shares from our 100 million share program authorized by our Board of Directors in 2019, representing $2.4 billion or 11% of our current shares outstanding. As Greg mentioned, we plan to execute approximately $180 million in share repurchases during the first quarter, and should the Federal reserve permit banks to continue to repurchase shares in 2021 under the current net income test framework, we would have around $1 billion of buyback capacity in total for 2021, assuming no change to our reserve coverage.
Moving to our current outlook. We have provided detailed guidance for both the full year and the first quarter, consistent with previous fourth quarter earnings calls. We expect full year 2021 total loans to be stable with 2020 on both an average and end-of-period basis, reflecting the full year headwinds of commercial line utilization declines from the second half of 2020 and PPP forgiveness offset by the benefit of the consumer loans added at the end of 2020 and our forecast of $2 billion of new PPP loan originations in 2021. Average commercial balances are expected to decline in the low to mid single-digit range compared to 2020, while consumer balances should increase in the mid- to high single digits range.
For the first quarter, we expect average total loan balances to increase approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting relative stability in the C&I portfolio, continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage and other consumer loans, partially offset by a 1% decline in CRE.
Given the loan outlook, combined with our expectations for the underlying margin to be around 3% and reflective of the structural rate protection from our securities and hedge portfolios, we expect NII to decline approximately 3% next year and also decline around 3% in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, assuming no deployment of our excess liquidity. We expect noninterest income to increase 2% to 3% in 2021, which includes a 1% headwind from lower TRA income in 2021. If not for the TRA impact, our fee expectations would be for 3% to 4% growth, which includes the impact of approximately $40 million in foregone annual revenue associated with our business exits as part of our expense savings program.
For the first quarter, we expect fees to increase mid-single digits year-over-year, which is not -- which is a 9% to 10% decline sequentially, reflecting seasonal impacts such as the lack of TRA revenue and lighter other noninterest income, partially offset by the seasonal uptick in wealth revenue from tax preparation fees in the first quarter and significantly stronger mortgage revenue. We expect top line mortgage revenue to improve $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and also anticipate stronger results in our loan and lease syndication businesses. We expect full year 2021 noninterest expense to decline approximately 1% relative to the adjusted 2020 expenses, driven by the impacts of our expense reduction program, but partially offset by expenses associated with strong fee growth, servicing expenses associated with the consumer loan portfolio purchased in the fourth quarter and continued investments to accelerate both our digital transformation and our sales force and branch expansion in our growth markets.
As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Compared to the first quarter of 2020, reported expenses, we expect total expenses to be flat on a sequential basis, excluding seasonal items, our total first quarter expenses are expected to be down approximately 3% to 4% from the fourth quarter. We currently expect to generate year-over-year adjusted positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 45 to 55 basis point range. If the proposed stimulus passes, we would expect to be at the lower end of that range.
In summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles. Disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment.
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A."

And right now, in our outlook, we expect first quarter forgiveness fees to be in line with the fourth quarter. Perhaps that's -- we'll do better than that from a forgiveness perspective. We've got about $400 million or a little bit less than 10% of the 2020 originations forgiven. And so as we model it out, we expect the majority of the fees from the 2020 originations to be forgiven in the third quarter as borrowers approach that 16-month time horizon of needing to make payments or have it forgiven. So right now, we expect the back half of the year to have a little bit more accelerated fees. And then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the 2021 round of PPP to be about $2 billion in originations, and then that will accrue at a lower rate, just given the 5-year term on those loans. So we expect about a 1.8% yield prior to any of the forgiveness fees."

Third, with regard to the PPP, we're assuming a $2 billion of originations, but as we -- and perhaps that's a conservative number because as we sit here today, we've submitted over $1 billion in apps in just the first 2 days. And then finally, as Greg mentioned, perhaps there'll be better commercial loan production through higher borrower demand and CapEx and inventory buildups.

In fact, by our math, if you bought in the third quarter or even in the first couple of months of the fourth quarter, you lost $2 in value for every $1 in carry you picked up over that period of time. So you still have more risk should the curve steepen further. And we don't want to be stuck in a bad trade, chasing balances at what are still historically low levels of rates.

I think the point that Greg made to me is the most important one is we have, on a sustained basis, continue to gain share even in our highest density markets over the course of the past 3 or 4 years on primary banking relationships, which we view as being the best measure of market share because the decisions you make on pricing a deposit product or you do headquarter deposits or otherwise, have a big impact on the FDIC numbers that you sometimes see people use on a period-to-period basis. So the strong household growth we have seen across the franchise, in particular, in focused markets like Chicago and the Southeast, as Greg mentioned, on the consumer side of the business and the strong core relationship growth that we continue to see out of our middle market franchise are the things that give us confidence in our ability to continue to compete."

It's really those fintech players out there that aren't under the same regulatory framework that we are creating some stress for us, nipping around the age of our profit pools and maybe shifting some customer behavior.

Earlier today, we reported full year 2020 net income of $1.4 billion or $1.83 per share. We delivered strong financial results in 2020 despite the challenging operating environment brought on by the pandemic. 
We had several highlights for the year. We generated a record adjusted pre-provision net revenue. We maintained our expense discipline, producing an adjusted efficiency ratio below 59%, which was stable compared to the prior year and remains near decade lows. We generated a record adjusted fee revenue, including records in both our commercial and wealth and asset management businesses. 
We also continue to generate peer-leading consumer household growth of 3%, with outsized success in Chicago and our key Southeast markets. While nearly doubling our reserves, we generated 11.7% adjusted return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, for the full year and generated an ROTCE of 18.4% in the fourth quarter. 
Just as importantly, we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping 99% of our branches open for business, while working closely with our customers to support them during these challenging times through the PPP program, hardship relief programs and other outreach efforts that we have previously discussed. 
Our efforts have been [ recognized ] externally. We were recognized by an independent third-party as a top-performing bank among the 12 largest U.S. retail banks based on our pandemic response for our customers, communities and employees. Also, we had the honor winning the Greenwich middle market CX award, reflecting our commitment to delivering a superior customer experience and for enduring the COVID-19 crisis. 
Additionally, during the year, we published our inaugural ESG Report, highlighting our efforts to generate sustainable value for all stakeholders. And just this week, we announced that we became the first regional bank to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. We reported net income of $604 million. Our reported EPS include a negative $0.10 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.88 per share. Jamie will walk you through the quarterly financial results in more detail in just a minute. 
Focused execution on our key strategic priorities and our disciplined approach to credit risk management continue to drive strong financial performance. As we recently announced, we have taken decisive action to drive efficiencies and improve the long-term profitability of the bank by streamlining our operations, including divesting less profitable businesses such as property and casualty insurance, while still investing in areas of growth and profitability. 
For example, we recently finalized the acquisition of H2C, which strengthens our health care investment banking and strategic advisory capabilities. We continue to assess, select strategic investments in nonbank acquisitions to improve fee growth. 
All reported and adjusted return metrics were solid and improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong operating results, including the provision for credit loss performance. We expect a positive momentum in our operating results to continue in 2021. 
Net interest income increased 1% sequentially despite loan portfolio headwinds. Underlying NIM, which excludes excess cash and PPP impacts, increased 8 basis points sequentially. We expect to generate differentiated NIM performance relative to peers in 2021 and beyond, reflecting the hedge and investment portfolio actions we have taken over the past several years. 
Our credit quality remains solid, with net charge-offs of 43 basis points stable compared to the recent quarters. Also, our criticized assets and allowance for credit losses both declined sequentially, reflecting our credit discipline and improved credit results and economic outlook. 
We continue to benefit from diversification and resilience of our fee-based businesses in retail, commercial and wealth and asset management. Many of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates. 
Our robust capital and liquidity levels further improved this quarter, indicative of our balance sheet strength. Our regulatory capital levels have increased for 3 consecutive quarters as a result of our strong earnings power, balance sheet dynamics and the Fed's temporary suspension of buybacks. With the partial relief announced by the Fed in December, we intend to execute up to $180 million in share repurchases in the first quarter. 
Through proactive management, we have built a strong and stable balance sheet and significantly improved the diversification of our fee revenue. We have done this all while maintaining our culture of expense discipline and demonstrating our commitment to consistent and solid through-the-cycle performance. 
Our financial performance continues to give us confidence that we can safely and soundly operate the company at significantly lower capital levels. Though our CET1 target remains at 9.5%, we will continue to evaluate the appropriate target -- capital target as the economy improves. 
We are also seeing continued strength in our commercial loan production levels in our pipelines. The fourth quarter loan production was the highest in 2020 and was down around 20% from the year ago quarter, but was up over 50% from the third quarter. We are encouraged by the recent trends, the sequential improvement in almost all regions and all verticals. Strong production was more than offset by elevated payoffs and another 1% decline in line utilization. 
Our middle market pipeline improvement was well diversified throughout our footprint, including [ signal ] strength in our Southeast markets. In corporate banking, the pipeline strengthened again this quarter with improvement in industrials, retail, health care, solar and financial institutions, partially offset by continued sluggishness in hospitality and energy. 
Based on a strong pipeline and stable utilization trends for the first 3 weeks of January, we currently expect C&I loan balances to improve on a period-end basis during the first quarter, excluding the impact of PPP loans. Commercial real estate pipelines continue to be well below pre-COVID levels. 
Before I turn it over to Jamie to further discuss results and our outlook, I want to reiterate our strategic priorities, which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. Our 4 key strategic priorities have not changed over the past several years and include leveraging technology to accelerate digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection. 
We will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on areas where we see the highest probability for driving strong financial returns and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well as we navigate this environment in 2021 and beyond. 
I'd like to once again thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers and each other doing these challenging times. Fifth Third continues to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities while remaining committed to equality, equity and inclusion for all. [ To that end ] we made a 3-year $2.8 billion pledge to this commitment through lending, investing and donating, including a $25 million contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation. 
Our financial results continue to reflect our focused execution, discipline and through-the-cycle principles. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top-performing regional bank. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook."

One quick housekeeping item before discussing our financial results for the quarter. 
As you'll see in our earnings materials, we are no longer adjusting certain metrics for purchase accounting accretion or intangible amortization, given that they largely offset and have an immaterial impact on pretax income. We hope this will help simplify our disclosures going forward to more easily assess our financial ratio. 
Now turning to our fourth quarter performance. We ended 2020 with positive momentum and delivered strong financial results. Reported results were impacted by several notable items, including a $23 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap; a $21 million after-tax charge related to our acquisition and disposition actions, as Greg mentioned; the sale of our HSA business remains in process and should close by the end of this quarter. 
We also recognized a $16 million after-tax charge related to our branch and nonbranch real estate efficiency strategies. This includes impairments associated with 7 branches we will be closing in April as part of our normal rigor on reviewing our network for efficiencies. These closures are in addition to the 37 branches we announced last quarter. 
Furthermore, as Greg discussed, we recorded a $19 million after-tax charitable contribution expense to promote racial equality. And we also recorded $4 million after-tax from COVID-related expenses. Lastly, we had a onetime favorable item related to state taxes of $13 million. 
In terms of the financial highlights for the quarter. Despite the nearly 160 basis point decline in 1-month LIBOR over the last 12 months, we were able to generate an adjusted PPNR above the fourth quarter of 2019 level. We generated an efficiency ratio of 58%. 
Our operating performance reflected a 1% increase in NII, a 16% increase in adjusted fees and a 4% increase in adjusted expenses. Given the strong PPNR results, combined with continued credit-related improvements, we produced strong reported and adjusted return metrics, including an adjusted ROA of 1.31% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.4%, excluding AOCI, despite growing our regulatory capital 20 basis points during the quarter. 
Drilling into the income statement performance. The sequential increase in NII of 1% reflected the strength of our balance sheet and deposit franchise. We saw a 4 basis point improvement in our total loan yields, which was supported by both the continued benefits from our long-duration, deep-in-the-money cash flow hedges as well as $10 million in additional PPP income. 
Our NII results included $11 million of incremental favorable prepayment penalties in the securities portfolio, reflecting one of the benefits from our strategy to invest in bullet and locked-out cash flows. Approximately 59% of the investment portfolio still invested in bullet and locked-out cash flows at quarter end. And our investment portfolio yield increased 9 basis points sequentially to 3.1%. Net premium and amortization in our securities portfolio was only $1 million in the fourth quarter. 
On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs by another 5 basis points. For the fourth quarter, the average cost of our core deposits was only 5 basis points. CD and debt maturities also provided a 2 basis point improvement to NIM versus the third quarter. 
Reported NIM was stable compared to the third quarter, reflecting the favorable securities portfolio and PPP income I mentioned, offset by the impact of higher cash levels. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, improved 8 basis points to 3.14%. 
Once again, we had another strong quarter generating noninterest income to cushion the rate-driven NII pressure. The resilience in our fee income levels continues to highlight the revenue diversification that we have achieved. Total noninterest income increased 9% relative to the third quarter. Excluding the notable items, noninterest income increased 16%. 
We generated record commercial banking revenue, which increased double digits sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strength across most of the business. We also recorded TRA income of $74 million, as well as gains from several of our direct fintech investments in venture capital funds. These investments generated $75 million of fee income in 2020, and we expect continued gains in 2021. 
Top line mortgage banking revenue declined $46 million sequentially, driven by a $26 million headwind, reflecting a decline in rate lock volumes; a $12 million impact from our decision to retain $250 million of our retail production during the quarter; and $8 million due to margin compression. MSR decay in servicing fees were unchanged sequentially and will remain challenged in this environment. 
While we did not deliver the mortgage results we expected due to capacity pressures, we have seen meaningful improvement in December and January. Noninterest expenses also increased relative to the third quarter, albeit to a much lesser extent than fees. 
Adjusted expenses were up 3%, excluding the mark-to-market impacts associated with nonqualified deferred compensation, but is offset in security gains within noninterest income. The largest contributor of the expense growth was performance-based compensation, driven by the strong performance in fees related to business growth and other revenue-linked expenses. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans declined 3% sequentially, with both commercial and consumer balances in line with our previous guidance ranges. Commercial loan balances continued to reflect lower revolver utilization rates, which decreased another 1% in the quarter to 32%. 
Line utilization rates so far in January are stable relative to the fourth quarter. We currently expect utilization to remain unchanged for the first half of 2021 and are forecasting only a modest increase of approximately 1% in the second half of the year as the economy improves. 
Average CRE loans were flat sequentially, with end-of-period balances declining 1%. As we have discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment and supports our strategy of lower exposure and our focus on high-quality borrowers. We have provided more information related to our CRE exposures in our presentation this quarter. 
Average total consumer loans increased 1% sequentially, driven by continued growth in the auto portfolio, partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card. We took additional action in the consumer portfolio at the end of December to improve our NII trajectory for 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion of our excess liquidity by purchasing government-guaranteed residential mortgages currently in forbearance under the Cares Act provision. These loans are in our held-for-sale portfolio as they are not expected to be held for more than 1 to 2 years. These loans provide a more attractive risk-adjusted return than other current investment alternatives. 
Our securities portfolio of roughly $35 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of paydowns, combined with the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities. Our investment portfolio positioning continues to support NII in the current environment, allowing for patience in investing at the current unattractive long-term rates. Given the potential for strong economic growth in the second half of 2021, we do not believe long-duration securities are providing an appropriate risk return trade-off. As a result, we do not expect to grow our investment portfolio in the near term. 
Our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained at $3.5 billion. Also, our deliberate actions within the securities portfolio over the past several years focused on structuring the portfolio in anticipation of a lower rate environment and should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds. 
Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, increased to $35 billion, growing $5 billion from the prior quarter and $33 billion compared to the year ago quarter. In addition to the loan growth headwinds outside of PPP, the significant increase in excess cash reflects record deposit growth over the past 9 months. Core deposits increased 3% compared to the third quarter despite a 12% reduction in consumer CD balances, which helped drive down interest-bearing core deposit costs by 5 basis points. 
Moving on to credit. Overall, credit quality continues to be solid, reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, balance sheet optimization and the improved macroeconomic environment. Charge-offs remained well-behaved at 43 basis points. Nonperforming assets declined $67 million or 7%, with the resulting NPA ratio of 79 basis points declining 5 basis points sequentially. Also, our criticized assets declined 12%, with appreciable improvements in energy, industrial and middle market. 
Given the solid credit results, lower end-of-period loan balances and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook, our reserve coverage declined 8 basis points to 2.41% of portfolio loans and leases, with improvement in both consumer and commercial. The low level of net charge-offs, combined with the $131 million decline in the allowance, resulted in a net $13 million benefit to the provision [ loan ]. 
Our ACL decline of $131 million was attributable to several factors. Approximately 1/3 of the decline was the result of lower period-end loan balances, with the remainder of the release due to both the improved economic outlook and the improved commercial credit risk profile, which is reflected in our lower NPA and criticized asset levels. 
As is required under CECL, our reserve reflects all known macroeconomic and credit quality information as of December 31. While we are not predicting or forecasting reserve releases at this point, given both the significant uncertainty in the economy and our loan growth expectations, to the extent there would be meaningful and sustained improvement in the broader economy, it's not unreasonable that reserves could come down from here even if credit losses tick up. 
Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below 2019 levels until the end of 2021; an unemployment rate higher than the current 6.7%, ending 2021 at 7.2% and declining to 5.6% by the end of 2022. Importantly, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from fiscal stimulus, generally consistent with the $900 billion package passed at the end of December, but does not incorporate additional relief as currently proposed by the new administration. 
We did not change our scenario rates of 16% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $200 million release to our fourth quarter reserve. Conversely, applying a 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $900 million [ build ]. 
Inclusive of the impact of approximately $136 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio is 2.53%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL would be approximately 2.65%. 
Moving to capital. Our capital remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.3%, above our stated target of 9.5%, which amounts to approximately $1.2 billion of excess capital. 
As a reminder, we have remaining capacity to purchase 76 million shares from our 100 million share program authorized by our Board of Directors in 2019, representing $2.4 billion or 11% of our current shares outstanding. As Greg mentioned, we plan to execute approximately $180 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. And should the Federal reserve permit banks to continue to repurchase shares in 2021 under the current net income test framework, we would have around $1 billion of buyback capacity in total for 2021, assuming no change to our reserve coverage. 
Moving to our current outlook. We have provided detailed guidance for both the full year and the first quarter, consistent with previous fourth quarter earnings calls. We expect full year 2021 total loans to be stable with 2020 on both an average and end-of-period basis, reflecting the full year headwinds of commercial line utilization declines from the second half of 2020 and PPP forgiveness, offset by the benefit of the consumer loans added at the end of 2020 and our forecast of $2 billion of new PPP loan originations in 2021. 
Average commercial balances are expected to decline in the low to mid-single-digits range compared to 2020, while consumer balances should increase in the mid- to high single-digits range. For the first quarter, we expect average total loan balances to increase approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting relative stability in the C&I portfolio, continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage and other consumer loans, partially offset by a 1% decline in CRE. 
Given the loan outlook, combined with our expectations for the underlying margin to be around 3%, reflective of the structural rate protection from our securities and hedge portfolios, we expect NII to decline approximately 3% next year and also decline around 3% in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, assuming no deployment of our excess liquidity. We expect noninterest income to increase 2% to 3% in 2021, which includes a 1% headwind from lower TRA income in 2021. 
If not for the TRA impact, our fee expectations would be for 3% to 4% growth, which includes the impact of approximately $40 million in foregone annual revenue associated with our business exits as part of our expense savings program. For the first quarter, we expect fees to increase mid-single digits year-over-year, which is not -- which is a 9% to 10% decline sequentially, reflecting seasonal impacts such as the lack of TRA revenue and lighter other noninterest income, partially offset by the seasonal uptick in wealth revenue from tax preparation fees in the first quarter and significantly stronger mortgage revenue. 
We expect top line mortgage revenue to improve $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and also anticipate stronger results in our loan and lease syndication businesses. We expect full year 2021 noninterest expense to decline approximately 1% relative to the adjusted 2020 expenses, driven by the impacts of our expense reduction program, but partially offset by expenses associated with strong fee growth, servicing expenses associated with the consumer loan portfolio purchased in the fourth quarter and continued investments to accelerate both our digital transformation and our sales force and branch expansion in our growth markets. 
As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Compared to the first quarter of 2020 reported expenses, we expect total expenses to be flat. On a sequential basis, excluding seasonal items, our total first quarter expenses are expected to be down approximately 3% to 4% from the fourth quarter. 
We currently expect to generate year-over-year adjusted positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 45 to 55 basis point range. If the proposed stimulus passes, we would expect to be at the lower end of that range. 
In summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles: disciplined client selection; conservative underwriting; and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment.

And so as we model it out, we expect the majority of the fees from the 2020 originations to be forgiven in the third quarter as borrowers approach that 16-month time horizon of needing to make payments or have it forgiven. 
So right now, we expect the back half of the year to have a little bit more accelerated fees. And then, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the 2021 round of PPP to be about $2 billion in originations, and then that will accrue at a lower rate, just given the 5-year term on those loans. So we expect about a 1.8% yield prior to any of the forgiveness fees."

I think for now, we've done a lot of work on the residential mortgage portfolio to improve it. And we think the returns are incredibly attractive. I think, going forward, I'd like to see the loan growth be in other categories, just given the convexity risk you have in residential mortgage and that we -- we've done enough. 
So that's why we expect in the first quarter to get back to selling all of our production. But again, I think the trade that we were able to execute was a nice deployment of excess cash and, certainly, a far better return than just buying mortgage-backed securities.

A lot of banks, to your point, [ is defined ] in on the 25 basis points of steepening or even before that. But credit spreads have tightened 10 basis points or more over that time so that the net entry point improvement to us is not that compelling.

So you still have more risk should the curve steepen further. And we don't want to be stuck in a bad trade, chasing balances at what are still historically low levels of rates.

And that being added to the acquisitions, our fintech plays to add to our products and capabilities to deliver to our customers our services. 
So we're going to continue to focus on that. We're very competitive. The household growth that we've seen at 3%, strong growth in our Southeast markets. We're a leader in the Chicago market. So we like those investments. 
So we're very comfortable on our ability to compete. We think our investment structure we have in place today allows us to continue to grow our franchise and be extremely competitive.

No, I mean, Mike, new competition is always something that we watch closely. And I think I wouldn't isolate it just to the folks who are traditional financial institutions that are building into our markets. We pay a lot of attention to the fintech companies. In particular, given that, in some cases, they are arbitraging the regulatory apparatus at the moment, in a way, that creates imbalanced competition. 
I think the point that Greg made to me is the most important one, is we have, on a sustained basis, continued to gain share even in our highest density markets over the course of the past 3 or 4 years on primary banking relationships, which we view as being the best measure of market share. Because the decisions you make on pricing a deposit product or you domicile headquarter deposits or otherwise, have a big impact on the FDIC numbers that you sometimes see people use on a period-to-period basis. 
So the strong household growth we have seen across the franchise, in particular, in focused markets like Chicago and the Southeast, as Greg mentioned, on the consumer side of the business and the strong core relationship growth that we continue to see out of our middle market franchise are the things that give us confidence in our ability to continue to compete."

Assuming that the economy recovers, as we all think it will, as bank stock prices, as you know, from your own stock price since the Pfizer announcement right after the election has been fantastic, what do you see as the -- everything is hopefully going to shape out real well this year, but what are the risks that you worry about when you go down that elevator at night?"

The investments that we've made, I think, are aligned with our long-term growth expectations and success of our business. So I feel really good about how we're competing today. 
The challenge always is, is when we look -- what watch these fintech players come forward -- not under the same regulatory oversight that we're doing with capital expectations and so forth, so there's a threat there that we're kind of watching. If they get access to the banking system, payment rails and so forth, that could create some stress for us that I'm very concerned about. 
But as far as our investments in fintech entities themselves, the investments that we're making, I'm comfortable with. It's really those fintech players out there that aren't under the same regulatory framework that we are creating some stress for us, snooping around the edge of our profit pools and maybe shifting some customer behavior. So that's probably the thing that keeps me up most at night. 
As far as competing against other banks, I think we've done all the right things to do that, just making sure we keep our eyes open, and we have been, on what it looks like against some of these other nontraditional bank players. To that end, that's why we've made significant investments in our digital capabilities and really created a digital bank ourselves. All of our lending products are online available, [ projects or ] production online, service capabilities. And we've made huge investments in our digital capabilities to make sure we're well positioned to deal with those type of threats."

Earlier today, we reported full year 2020 net income of $1.4 billion or $1.83 per share. We delivered strong financial results in 2020 despite the challenging operating environment brought on by the pandemic. 
We had several highlights for the year. We generated a record adjusted pre-provision net revenue. We maintained our expense discipline, producing an adjusted efficiency ratio below 59%, which was stable compared to the prior year and remains near decade lows. We generated a record adjusted fee revenue, including records in both our commercial and wealth and asset management businesses. 
We also continue to generate peer-leading consumer household growth of 3%, with outsized success in Chicago and our key Southeast markets. While nearly doubling our reserves, we generated 11.7% adjusted return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, for the full year and generated an ROTCE of 18.4% in the fourth quarter. 
Just as importantly, we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping 99% of our branches open for business, while working closely with our customers to support them during these challenging times through the PPP program, hardship relief programs and other outreach efforts that we have previously discussed. 
Our efforts have been [ recognized ] externally. We were recognized by an independent third-party as a top-performing bank among the 12 largest U.S. retail banks based on our pandemic response for our customers, communities and employees. Also, we had the honor winning the Greenwich middle market CX award, reflecting our commitment to delivering a superior customer experience and for enduring the COVID-19 crisis. 
Additionally, during the year, we published our inaugural ESG Report, highlighting our efforts to generate sustainable value for all stakeholders. And just this week, we announced that we became the first regional bank to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. We reported net income of $604 million. Our reported EPS include a negative $0.10 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.88 per share. Jamie will walk you through the quarterly financial results in more detail in just a minute. 
Focused execution on our key strategic priorities and our disciplined approach to credit risk management continue to drive strong financial performance. As we recently announced, we have taken decisive action to drive efficiencies and improve the long-term profitability of the bank by streamlining our operations, including divesting less profitable businesses such as property and casualty insurance, while still investing in areas of growth and profitability. 
For example, we recently finalized the acquisition of H2C, which strengthens our health care investment banking and strategic advisory capabilities. We continue to assess, select strategic investments in nonbank acquisitions to improve fee growth. 
All reported and adjusted return metrics were solid and improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong operating results, including the provision for credit loss performance. We expect a positive momentum in our operating results to continue in 2021. 
Net interest income increased 1% sequentially despite loan portfolio headwinds. Underlying NIM, which excludes excess cash and PPP impacts, increased 8 basis points sequentially. We expect to generate differentiated NIM performance relative to peers in 2021 and beyond, reflecting the hedge and investment portfolio actions we have taken over the past several years. 
Our credit quality remains solid, with net charge-offs of 43 basis points stable compared to the recent quarters. Also, our criticized assets and allowance for credit losses both declined sequentially, reflecting our credit discipline and improved credit results and economic outlook. 
We continue to benefit from diversification and resilience of our fee-based businesses in retail, commercial and wealth and asset management. Many of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates. 
Our robust capital and liquidity levels further improved this quarter, indicative of our balance sheet strength. Our regulatory capital levels have increased for 3 consecutive quarters as a result of our strong earnings power, balance sheet dynamics and the Fed's temporary suspension of buybacks. With the partial relief announced by the Fed in December, we intend to execute up to $180 million in share repurchases in the first quarter. 
Through proactive management, we have built a strong and stable balance sheet and significantly improved the diversification of our fee revenue. We have done this all while maintaining our culture of expense discipline and demonstrating our commitment to consistent and solid through-the-cycle performance. 
Our financial performance continues to give us confidence that we can safely and soundly operate the company at significantly lower capital levels. Though our CET1 target remains at 9.5%, we will continue to evaluate the appropriate target -- capital target as the economy improves. 
We are also seeing continued strength in our commercial loan production levels in our pipelines. The fourth quarter loan production was the highest in 2020 and was down around 20% from the year ago quarter, but was up over 50% from the third quarter. We are encouraged by the recent trends, the sequential improvement in almost all regions and all verticals. Strong production was more than offset by elevated payoffs and another 1% decline in line utilization. 
Our middle market pipeline improvement was well diversified throughout our footprint, including [ signal ] strength in our Southeast markets. In corporate banking, the pipeline strengthened again this quarter with improvement in industrials, retail, health care, solar and financial institutions, partially offset by continued sluggishness in hospitality and energy. 
Based on a strong pipeline and stable utilization trends for the first 3 weeks of January, we currently expect C&I loan balances to improve on a period-end basis during the first quarter, excluding the impact of PPP loans. Commercial real estate pipelines continue to be well below pre-COVID levels. 
Before I turn it over to Jamie to further discuss results and our outlook, I want to reiterate our strategic priorities, which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. Our 4 key strategic priorities have not changed over the past several years and include leveraging technology to accelerate digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection. 
We will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on areas where we see the highest probability for driving strong financial returns and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well as we navigate this environment in 2021 and beyond. 
I'd like to once again thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers and each other doing these challenging times. Fifth Third continues to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities while remaining committed to equality, equity and inclusion for all. [ To that end ] we made a 3-year $2.8 billion pledge to this commitment through lending, investing and donating, including a $25 million contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation. 
Our financial results continue to reflect our focused execution, discipline and through-the-cycle principles. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top-performing regional bank. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook."

One quick housekeeping item before discussing our financial results for the quarter. 
As you'll see in our earnings materials, we are no longer adjusting certain metrics for purchase accounting accretion or intangible amortization, given that they largely offset and have an immaterial impact on pretax income. We hope this will help simplify our disclosures going forward to more easily assess our financial ratio. 
Now turning to our fourth quarter performance. We ended 2020 with positive momentum and delivered strong financial results. Reported results were impacted by several notable items, including a $23 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap; a $21 million after-tax charge related to our acquisition and disposition actions, as Greg mentioned; the sale of our HSA business remains in process and should close by the end of this quarter. 
We also recognized a $16 million after-tax charge related to our branch and nonbranch real estate efficiency strategies. This includes impairments associated with 7 branches we will be closing in April as part of our normal rigor on reviewing our network for efficiencies. These closures are in addition to the 37 branches we announced last quarter. 
Furthermore, as Greg discussed, we recorded a $19 million after-tax charitable contribution expense to promote racial equality. And we also recorded $4 million after-tax from COVID-related expenses. Lastly, we had a onetime favorable item related to state taxes of $13 million. 
In terms of the financial highlights for the quarter. Despite the nearly 160 basis point decline in 1-month LIBOR over the last 12 months, we were able to generate an adjusted PPNR above the fourth quarter of 2019 level. We generated an efficiency ratio of 58%. 
Our operating performance reflected a 1% increase in NII, a 16% increase in adjusted fees and a 4% increase in adjusted expenses. Given the strong PPNR results, combined with continued credit-related improvements, we produced strong reported and adjusted return metrics, including an adjusted ROA of 1.31% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.4%, excluding AOCI, despite growing our regulatory capital 20 basis points during the quarter. 
Drilling into the income statement performance. The sequential increase in NII of 1% reflected the strength of our balance sheet and deposit franchise. We saw a 4 basis point improvement in our total loan yields, which was supported by both the continued benefits from our long-duration, deep-in-the-money cash flow hedges as well as $10 million in additional PPP income. 
Our NII results included $11 million of incremental favorable prepayment penalties in the securities portfolio, reflecting one of the benefits from our strategy to invest in bullet and locked-out cash flows. Approximately 59% of the investment portfolio still invested in bullet and locked-out cash flows at quarter end. And our investment portfolio yield increased 9 basis points sequentially to 3.1%. Net premium and amortization in our securities portfolio was only $1 million in the fourth quarter. 
On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs by another 5 basis points. For the fourth quarter, the average cost of our core deposits was only 5 basis points. CD and debt maturities also provided a 2 basis point improvement to NIM versus the third quarter. 
Reported NIM was stable compared to the third quarter, reflecting the favorable securities portfolio and PPP income I mentioned, offset by the impact of higher cash levels. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, improved 8 basis points to 3.14%. 
Once again, we had another strong quarter generating noninterest income to cushion the rate-driven NII pressure. The resilience in our fee income levels continues to highlight the revenue diversification that we have achieved. Total noninterest income increased 9% relative to the third quarter. Excluding the notable items, noninterest income increased 16%. 
We generated record commercial banking revenue, which increased double digits sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strength across most of the business. We also recorded TRA income of $74 million as well as gains from several of our direct fintech investments in venture capital funds. These investments generated $75 million of fee income in 2020, and we expect continued gains in 2021. 
Top line mortgage banking revenue declined $46 million sequentially, driven by a $26 million headwind, reflecting a decline in rate lock volumes; a $12 million impact from our decision to retain $250 million of our retail production during the quarter; and $8 million due to margin compression. MSR decay in servicing fees were unchanged sequentially and will remain challenged in this environment. 
While we did not deliver the mortgage results we expected due to capacity pressures, we have seen meaningful improvement in December and January. Noninterest expenses also increased relative to the third quarter, albeit to a much lesser extent than fees. 
Adjusted expenses were up 3%, excluding the mark-to-market impacts associated with nonqualified deferred compensation, but is offset in security gains within noninterest income. The largest contributor of the expense growth was performance-based compensation, driven by the strong performance in fees related to business growth and other revenue-linked expenses. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans declined 3% sequentially, with both commercial and consumer balances in line with our previous guidance ranges. Commercial loan balances continued to reflect lower revolver utilization rates, which decreased another 1% in the quarter to 32%. 
Line utilization rates so far in January are stable relative to the fourth quarter. We currently expect utilization to remain unchanged for the first half of 2021 and are forecasting only a modest increase of approximately 1% in the second half of the year as the economy improves. 
Average CRE loans were flat sequentially, with end-of-period balances declining 1%. As we have discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment and supports our strategy of lower exposure and our focus on high-quality borrowers. We have provided more information related to our CRE exposures in our presentation this quarter. 
Average total consumer loans increased 1% sequentially, driven by continued growth in the auto portfolio, partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card. We took additional action in the consumer portfolio at the end of December to improve our NII trajectory for 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion of our excess liquidity by purchasing government-guaranteed residential mortgages currently in forbearance under the Cares Act provision. These loans are in our held-for-sale portfolio as they are not expected to be held for more than 1 to 2 years. These loans provide a more attractive risk-adjusted return than other current investment alternatives. 
Our securities portfolio of roughly $35 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of paydowns, combined with the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities. Our investment portfolio positioning continues to support NII in the current environment, allowing for patience in investing at the current unattractive long-term rates. Given the potential for strong economic growth in the second half of 2021, we do not believe long-duration securities are providing an appropriate risk return trade-off. As a result, we do not expect to grow our investment portfolio in the near term. 
Our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained at $3.5 billion. Also, our deliberate actions within the securities portfolio over the past several years focused on structuring the portfolio in anticipation of a lower rate environment and should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds. 
Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, increased to $35 billion, growing $5 billion from the prior quarter and $33 billion compared to the year ago quarter. In addition to the loan growth headwinds outside of PPP, the significant increase in excess cash reflects record deposit growth over the past 9 months. Core deposits increased 3% compared to the third quarter despite a 12% reduction in consumer CD balances, which helped drive down interest-bearing core deposit costs by 5 basis points. 
Moving on to credit. Overall, credit quality continues to be solid, reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, balance sheet optimization and the improved macroeconomic environment. Charge-offs remained well-behaved at 43 basis points. Nonperforming assets declined $67 million or 7%, with the resulting NPA ratio of 79 basis points declining 5 basis points sequentially. Also, our criticized assets declined 12%, with appreciable improvements in energy, industrial and middle market. 
Given the solid credit results, lower end-of-period loan balances and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook, our reserve coverage declined 8 basis points to 2.41% of portfolio loans and leases, with improvement in both consumer and commercial. The low level of net charge-offs, combined with the $131 million decline in the allowance, resulted in a net $13 million benefit to the provision [ loan ]. 
Our ACL decline of $131 million was attributable to several factors. Approximately 1/3 of the decline was the result of lower period-end loan balances, with the remainder of the release due to both the improved economic outlook and the improved commercial credit risk profile, which is reflected in our lower NPA and criticized asset levels. 
As is required under CECL, our reserve reflects all known macroeconomic and credit quality information as of December 31. While we are not predicting or forecasting reserve releases at this point, given both the significant uncertainty in the economy and our loan growth expectations, to the extent there would be meaningful and sustained improvement in the broader economy, it's not unreasonable that reserves could come down from here even if credit losses tick up. 
Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below 2019 levels until the end of 2021; an unemployment rate higher than the current 6.7%, ending 2021 at 7.2% and declining to 5.6% by the end of 2022. Importantly, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from fiscal stimulus, generally consistent with the $900 billion package passed at the end of December, but does not incorporate additional relief as currently proposed by the new administration. 
We did not change our scenario rates of 16% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $200 million release to our fourth quarter reserve. Conversely, applying a 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $900 million [ build ]. 
Inclusive of the impact of approximately $136 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio is 2.53%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL would be approximately 2.65%. 
Moving to capital. Our capital remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.3%, above our stated target of 9.5%, which amounts to approximately $1.2 billion of excess capital. 
As a reminder, we have remaining capacity to purchase 76 million shares from our 100 million share program authorized by our Board of Directors in 2019, representing $2.4 billion or 11% of our current shares outstanding. As Greg mentioned, we plan to execute approximately $180 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. And should the Federal reserve permit banks to continue to repurchase shares in 2021 under the current net income test framework, we would have around $1 billion of buyback capacity in total for 2021, assuming no change to our reserve coverage. 
Moving to our current outlook. We have provided detailed guidance for both the full year and the first quarter, consistent with previous fourth quarter earnings calls. We expect full year 2021 total loans to be stable with 2020 on both an average and end-of-period basis, reflecting the full year headwinds of commercial line utilization declines from the second half of 2020 and PPP forgiveness, offset by the benefit of the consumer loans added at the end of 2020 and our forecast of $2 billion of new PPP loan originations in 2021. 
Average commercial balances are expected to decline in the low to mid-single-digits range compared to 2020, while consumer balances should increase in the mid- to high single-digits range. For the first quarter, we expect average total loan balances to increase approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting relative stability in the C&I portfolio, continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage and other consumer loans, partially offset by a 1% decline in CRE. 
Given the loan outlook, combined with our expectations for the underlying margin to be around 3%, reflective of the structural rate protection from our securities and hedge portfolios, we expect NII to decline approximately 3% next year and also decline around 3% in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, assuming no deployment of our excess liquidity. We expect noninterest income to increase 2% to 3% in 2021, which includes a 1% headwind from lower TRA income in 2021. 
If not for the TRA impact, our fee expectations would be for 3% to 4% growth, which includes the impact of approximately $40 million in foregone annual revenue associated with our business exits as part of our expense savings program. For the first quarter, we expect fees to increase mid-single digits year-over-year, which is not -- which is a 9% to 10% decline sequentially, reflecting seasonal impacts such as the lack of TRA revenue and lighter other noninterest income, partially offset by the seasonal uptick in wealth revenue from tax preparation fees in the first quarter and significantly stronger mortgage revenue. 
We expect top line mortgage revenue to improve $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and also anticipate stronger results in our loan and lease syndication businesses. We expect full year 2021 noninterest expense to decline approximately 1% relative to the adjusted 2020 expenses, driven by the impacts of our expense reduction program, but partially offset by expenses associated with strong fee growth, servicing expenses associated with the consumer loan portfolio purchased in the fourth quarter and continued investments to accelerate both our digital transformation and our sales force and branch expansion in our growth markets. 
As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Compared to the first quarter of 2020 reported expenses, we expect total expenses to be flat. On a sequential basis, excluding seasonal items, our total first quarter expenses are expected to be down approximately 3% to 4% from the fourth quarter. 
We currently expect to generate year-over-year adjusted positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 45 to 55 basis point range. If the proposed stimulus passes, we would expect to be at the lower end of that range. 
In summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles: disciplined client selection; conservative underwriting; and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment.

First of all, I'd say we were encouraged by the fourth quarter pipeline growth that we've seen, up significantly over the third quarter, albeit slightly down from where we were at the end of 2019. So we're seeing progress out there. It's really -- it's pretty broad-based across all of our regions and across our verticals. So we're encouraged by the strength we're seeing there. 
Obviously, there's a lot of unknowns going in as we go into 2021: digital stimulus, the vaccines and so forth, the recovery. And so it's a hard thing for us to gauge what the expectations are, but there's a lot of liquidity out there right now. So we're optimistic that if the vaccines get distributed appropriately, and we get the economy back in full swing second half of the year, that those numbers might look stronger. 
But right now, we're just being, at the end of the day, conservative, but encouraged by the pipelines that we've seen already. I don't know, Tim, if you have anything to add?"

And right now, in our outlook, we expect first quarter forgiveness fees to be in line with the fourth quarter. Perhaps that's -- we -- we'll be better than that from a forgiveness perspective. We've got about $400 million or a little bit less than 10% of the 2020 originations forgiven. And so as we model it out, we expect the majority of the fees from the 2020 originations to be forgiven in the third quarter as borrowers approach that 16-month time horizon of needing to make payments or have it forgiven. 
So right now, we expect the back half of the year to have a little bit more accelerated fees. And then, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the 2021 round of PPP to be about $2 billion in originations, and then that will accrue at a lower rate, just given the 5-year term on those loans. So we expect about a 1.8% yield prior to any of the forgiveness fees."

I think, going forward, I'd like to see the loan growth be in other categories, just given the convexity risk you have in residential mortgage and that we -- we've done enough. 
So that's why we expect in the first quarter to get back to selling all of our production.

In terms of the CCAR opt in, it's funny because we've discussed this as a team, and we officially have until April 5 to decide. But right now, given that our binding capital constraint is our own internal target of 9.5% versus the Fed's prior Stress Capital Buffer for us at 7% or even 7.2% in their COVID tests, should they adopt those December results in the SCB, frankly, we feel like our team deserves arrest at following the 6 stress tests we did during the pandemic.

And that being added to the acquisitions, our fintech plays to add to our products and capabilities to deliver to our customers our services. 
So we're going to continue to focus on that. We're very competitive. The household growth that we've seen at 3%, strong growth in our Southeast markets. We're a leader in the Chicago market. So we like those investments. 
So we're very comfortable on our ability to compete. We think our investment structure we have in place today allows us to continue to grow our franchise and be extremely competitive.

No, I mean, Mike, new competition is always something that we watch closely. And I think I wouldn't isolate it just to the folks who are traditional financial institutions that are building into our markets. We pay a lot of attention to the fintech companies. In particular, given that, in some cases, they are arbitraging the regulatory apparatus at the moment, in a way, that creates imbalanced competition. 
I think the point that Greg made to me is the most important one, is we have, on a sustained basis, continued to gain share even in our highest density markets over the course of the past 3 or 4 years on primary banking relationships, which we view as being the best measure of market share. Because the decisions you make on pricing a deposit product or you domicile headquarter deposits or otherwise, have a big impact on the FDIC numbers that you sometimes see people use on a period-to-period basis. 
So the strong household growth we have seen across the franchise, in particular, in focused markets like Chicago and the Southeast, as Greg mentioned, on the consumer side of the business and the strong core relationship growth that we continue to see out of our middle market franchise are the things that give us confidence in our ability to continue to compete."

But do you think it's made it more volatile, less volatile?"

And you would -- the way the modeling works, you would have to have an economic outlook as well as the outlook was essentially in 4Q of '19, and that might be hard to ever get back to, at least in the next couple of years. So I think the bias for all of our reserves across the industry is probably to take a longer period of time. 
And ultimately, if -- you said if -- take a guess as to where that plays out over the next 2 years. Or at the end of 2 years from now, would you be at your day 1?

The investments that we've made, I think, are aligned with our long-term growth expectations and success of our business. So I feel really good about how we're competing today. 
The challenge always is, is when we look -- what watch these fintech players come forward -- not under the same regulatory oversight that we're doing with capital expectations and so forth, so there's a threat there that we're kind of watching. If they get access to the banking system, payment rails and so forth, that could create some stress for us that I'm very concerned about. 
But as far as our investments in fintech entities themselves, the investments that we're making, I'm comfortable with. It's really those fintech players out there that aren't under the same regulatory framework that we are creating some stress for us, snooping around the edge of our profit pools and maybe shifting some customer behavior. So that's probably the thing that keeps me up most at night. 
As far as competing against other banks, I think we've done all the right things to do that, just making sure we keep our eyes open, and we have been, on what it looks like against some of these other nontraditional bank players. To that end, that's why we've made significant investments in our digital capabilities and really created a digital bank ourselves. All of our lending products are online available, [ projects or ] production online, service capabilities. And we've made huge investments in our digital capabilities to make sure we're well positioned to deal with those type of threats."

Earlier today, we reported full year 2020 net income of $1.4 billion or $1.83 per share. We delivered strong financial results in 2020 despite the challenging operating environment brought on by the pandemic. 
We had several highlights for the year. We generated a record adjusted pre-provision net revenue. We maintained our expense discipline, producing an adjusted efficiency ratio below 59%, which was stable compared to the prior year and remains near decade lows. We generated a record adjusted fee revenue, including records in both our commercial and wealth and asset management businesses. 
We also continue to generate peer-leading consumer household growth of 3%, with outsized success in Chicago and our key Southeast markets. While nearly doubling our reserves, we generated 11.7% adjusted return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, for the full year and generated an ROTCE of 18.4% in the fourth quarter. 
Just as importantly, we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping 99% of our branches open for business, while working closely with our customers to support them during these challenging times through the PPP program, hardship relief programs and other outreach efforts that we have previously discussed. 
Our efforts have been [ recognized ] externally. We were recognized by an independent third-party as a top-performing bank among the 12 largest U.S. retail banks based on our pandemic response for our customers, communities and employees. Also, we had the honor winning the Greenwich middle market CX award, reflecting our commitment to delivering a superior customer experience and for enduring the COVID-19 crisis. 
Additionally, during the year, we published our inaugural ESG Report, highlighting our efforts to generate sustainable value for all stakeholders. And just this week, we announced that we became the first regional bank to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. We reported net income of $604 million. Our reported EPS include a negative $0.10 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.88 per share. Jamie will walk you through the quarterly financial results in more detail in just a minute. 
Focused execution on our key strategic priorities and our disciplined approach to credit risk management continue to drive strong financial performance. As we recently announced, we have taken decisive action to drive efficiencies and improve the long-term profitability of the bank by streamlining our operations, including divesting less profitable businesses such as property and casualty insurance, while still investing in areas of growth and profitability. 
For example, we recently finalized the acquisition of H2C, which strengthens our health care investment banking and strategic advisory capabilities. We continue to assess, select strategic investments in nonbank acquisitions to improve fee growth. 
All reported and adjusted return metrics were solid and improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong operating results, including the provision for credit loss performance. We expect a positive momentum in our operating results to continue in 2021. 
Net interest income increased 1% sequentially despite loan portfolio headwinds. Underlying NIM, which excludes excess cash and PPP impacts, increased 8 basis points sequentially. We expect to generate differentiated NIM performance relative to peers in 2021 and beyond, reflecting the hedge and investment portfolio actions we have taken over the past several years. 
Our credit quality remains solid, with net charge-offs of 43 basis points stable compared to the recent quarters. Also, our criticized assets and allowance for credit losses both declined sequentially, reflecting our credit discipline and improved credit results and economic outlook. 
We continue to benefit from diversification and resilience of our fee-based businesses in retail, commercial and wealth and asset management. Many of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates. 
Our robust capital and liquidity levels further improved this quarter, indicative of our balance sheet strength. Our regulatory capital levels have increased for 3 consecutive quarters as a result of our strong earnings power, balance sheet dynamics and the Fed's temporary suspension of buybacks. With the partial relief announced by the Fed in December, we intend to execute up to $180 million in share repurchases in the first quarter. 
Through proactive management, we have built a strong and stable balance sheet and significantly improved the diversification of our fee revenue. We have done this all while maintaining our culture of expense discipline and demonstrating our commitment to consistent and solid through-the-cycle performance. 
Our financial performance continues to give us confidence that we can safely and soundly operate the company at significantly lower capital levels. Though our CET1 target remains at 9.5%, we will continue to evaluate the appropriate target -- capital target as the economy improves. 
We are also seeing continued strength in our commercial loan production levels in our pipelines. The fourth quarter loan production was the highest in 2020 and was down around 20% from the year ago quarter, but was up over 50% from the third quarter. We are encouraged by the recent trends, the sequential improvement in almost all regions and all verticals. Strong production was more than offset by elevated payoffs and another 1% decline in line utilization. 
Our middle market pipeline improvement was well diversified throughout our footprint, including [ signal ] strength in our Southeast markets. In corporate banking, the pipeline strengthened again this quarter with improvement in industrials, retail, health care, solar and financial institutions, partially offset by continued sluggishness in hospitality and energy. 
Based on a strong pipeline and stable utilization trends for the first 3 weeks of January, we currently expect C&I loan balances to improve on a period-end basis during the first quarter, excluding the impact of PPP loans. Commercial real estate pipelines continue to be well below pre-COVID levels. 
Before I turn it over to Jamie to further discuss results and our outlook, I want to reiterate our strategic priorities, which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. Our 4 key strategic priorities have not changed over the past several years and include leveraging technology to accelerate digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection. 
We will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on areas where we see the highest probability for driving strong financial returns and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well as we navigate this environment in 2021 and beyond. 
I'd like to once again thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers and each other doing these challenging times. Fifth Third continues to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities while remaining committed to equality, equity and inclusion for all. [ To that end ] we made a 3-year $2.8 billion pledge to this commitment through lending, investing and donating, including a $25 million contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation. 
Our financial results continue to reflect our focused execution, discipline and through-the-cycle principles. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top-performing regional bank. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook."

One quick housekeeping item before discussing our financial results for the quarter. 
As you'll see in our earnings materials, we are no longer adjusting certain metrics for purchase accounting accretion or intangible amortization, given that they largely offset and have an immaterial impact on pretax income. We hope this will help simplify our disclosures going forward to more easily assess our financial ratio. 
Now turning to our fourth quarter performance. We ended 2020 with positive momentum and delivered strong financial results. Reported results were impacted by several notable items, including a $23 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap; a $21 million after-tax charge related to our acquisition and disposition actions, as Greg mentioned; the sale of our HSA business remains in process and should close by the end of this quarter. 
We also recognized a $16 million after-tax charge related to our branch and nonbranch real estate efficiency strategies. This includes impairments associated with 7 branches we will be closing in April as part of our normal rigor on reviewing our network for efficiencies. These closures are in addition to the 37 branches we announced last quarter. 
Furthermore, as Greg discussed, we recorded a $19 million after-tax charitable contribution expense to promote racial equality. And we also recorded $4 million after-tax from COVID-related expenses. Lastly, we had a onetime favorable item related to state taxes of $13 million. 
In terms of the financial highlights for the quarter. Despite the nearly 160 basis point decline in 1-month LIBOR over the last 12 months, we were able to generate an adjusted PPNR above the fourth quarter of 2019 level. We generated an efficiency ratio of 58%. 
Our operating performance reflected a 1% increase in NII, a 16% increase in adjusted fees and a 4% increase in adjusted expenses. Given the strong PPNR results, combined with continued credit-related improvements, we produced strong reported and adjusted return metrics, including an adjusted ROA of 1.31% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.4%, excluding AOCI, despite growing our regulatory capital 20 basis points during the quarter. 
Drilling into the income statement performance. The sequential increase in NII of 1% reflected the strength of our balance sheet and deposit franchise. We saw a 4 basis point improvement in our total loan yields, which was supported by both the continued benefits from our long-duration, deep-in-the-money cash flow hedges as well as $10 million in additional PPP income. 
Our NII results included $11 million of incremental favorable prepayment penalties in the securities portfolio, reflecting one of the benefits from our strategy to invest in bullet and locked-out cash flows. Approximately 59% of the investment portfolio still invested in bullet and locked-out cash flows at quarter end. And our investment portfolio yield increased 9 basis points sequentially to 3.1%. Net premium and amortization in our securities portfolio was only $1 million in the fourth quarter. 
On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs by another 5 basis points. For the fourth quarter, the average cost of our core deposits was only 5 basis points. CD and debt maturities also provided a 2 basis point improvement to NIM versus the third quarter. 
Reported NIM was stable compared to the third quarter, reflecting the favorable securities portfolio and PPP income I mentioned, offset by the impact of higher cash levels. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, improved 8 basis points to 3.14%. 
Once again, we had another strong quarter generating noninterest income to cushion the rate-driven NII pressure. The resilience in our fee income levels continues to highlight the revenue diversification that we have achieved. Total noninterest income increased 9% relative to the third quarter. Excluding the notable items, noninterest income increased 16%. 
We generated record commercial banking revenue, which increased double digits sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strength across most of the business. We also recorded TRA income of $74 million as well as gains from several of our direct fintech investments in venture capital funds. These investments generated $75 million of fee income in 2020, and we expect continued gains in 2021. 
Top line mortgage banking revenue declined $46 million sequentially, driven by a $26 million headwind, reflecting a decline in rate lock volumes; a $12 million impact from our decision to retain $250 million of our retail production during the quarter; and $8 million due to margin compression. MSR decay in servicing fees were unchanged sequentially and will remain challenged in this environment. 
While we did not deliver the mortgage results we expected due to capacity pressures, we have seen meaningful improvement in December and January. Noninterest expenses also increased relative to the third quarter, albeit to a much lesser extent than fees. 
Adjusted expenses were up 3%, excluding the mark-to-market impacts associated with nonqualified deferred compensation, but is offset in security gains within noninterest income. The largest contributor of the expense growth was performance-based compensation, driven by the strong performance in fees related to business growth and other revenue-linked expenses. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans declined 3% sequentially, with both commercial and consumer balances in line with our previous guidance ranges. Commercial loan balances continued to reflect lower revolver utilization rates, which decreased another 1% in the quarter to 32%. 
Line utilization rates so far in January are stable relative to the fourth quarter. We currently expect utilization to remain unchanged for the first half of 2021 and are forecasting only a modest increase of approximately 1% in the second half of the year as the economy improves. 
Average CRE loans were flat sequentially, with end-of-period balances declining 1%. As we have discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment and supports our strategy of lower exposure and our focus on high-quality borrowers. We have provided more information related to our CRE exposures in our presentation this quarter. 
Average total consumer loans increased 1% sequentially, driven by continued growth in the auto portfolio, partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card. We took additional action in the consumer portfolio at the end of December to improve our NII trajectory for 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion of our excess liquidity by purchasing government-guaranteed residential mortgages currently in forbearance under the Cares Act provision. These loans are in our held-for-sale portfolio as they are not expected to be held for more than 1 to 2 years. These loans provide a more attractive risk-adjusted return than other current investment alternatives. 
Our securities portfolio of roughly $35 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of paydowns, combined with the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities. Our investment portfolio positioning continues to support NII in the current environment, allowing for patience in investing at the current unattractive long-term rates. Given the potential for strong economic growth in the second half of 2021, we do not believe long-duration securities are providing an appropriate risk return trade-off. As a result, we do not expect to grow our investment portfolio in the near term. 
Our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained at $3.5 billion. Also, our deliberate actions within the securities portfolio over the past several years focused on structuring the portfolio in anticipation of a lower rate environment and should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds. 
Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, increased to $35 billion, growing $5 billion from the prior quarter and $33 billion compared to the year ago quarter. In addition to the loan growth headwinds outside of PPP, the significant increase in excess cash reflects record deposit growth over the past 9 months. Core deposits increased 3% compared to the third quarter despite a 12% reduction in consumer CD balances, which helped drive down interest-bearing core deposit costs by 5 basis points. 
Moving on to credit. Overall, credit quality continues to be solid, reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, balance sheet optimization and the improved macroeconomic environment. Charge-offs remained well-behaved at 43 basis points. Nonperforming assets declined $67 million or 7%, with the resulting NPA ratio of 79 basis points declining 5 basis points sequentially. Also, our criticized assets declined 12%, with appreciable improvements in energy, industrial and middle market. 
Given the solid credit results, lower end-of-period loan balances and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook, our reserve coverage declined 8 basis points to 2.41% of portfolio loans and leases, with improvement in both consumer and commercial. The low level of net charge-offs, combined with the $131 million decline in the allowance, resulted in a net $13 million benefit to the provision [ loan ]. 
Our ACL decline of $131 million was attributable to several factors. Approximately 1/3 of the decline was the result of lower period-end loan balances, with the remainder of the release due to both the improved economic outlook and the improved commercial credit risk profile, which is reflected in our lower NPA and criticized asset levels. 
As is required under CECL, our reserve reflects all known macroeconomic and credit quality information as of December 31. While we are not predicting or forecasting reserve releases at this point, given both the significant uncertainty in the economy and our loan growth expectations, to the extent there would be meaningful and sustained improvement in the broader economy, it's not unreasonable that reserves could come down from here even if credit losses tick up. 
Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below 2019 levels until the end of 2021; an unemployment rate higher than the current 6.7%, ending 2021 at 7.2% and declining to 5.6% by the end of 2022. Importantly, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from fiscal stimulus, generally consistent with the $900 billion package passed at the end of December, but does not incorporate additional relief as currently proposed by the new administration. 
We did not change our scenario rates of 16% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $200 million release to our fourth quarter reserve. Conversely, applying a 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $900 million [ build ]. 
Inclusive of the impact of approximately $136 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio is 2.53%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL would be approximately 2.65%. 
Moving to capital. Our capital remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.3%, above our stated target of 9.5%, which amounts to approximately $1.2 billion of excess capital. 
As a reminder, we have remaining capacity to purchase 76 million shares from our 100 million share program authorized by our Board of Directors in 2019, representing $2.4 billion or 11% of our current shares outstanding. As Greg mentioned, we plan to execute approximately $180 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. And should the Federal reserve permit banks to continue to repurchase shares in 2021 under the current net income test framework, we would have around $1 billion of buyback capacity in total for 2021, assuming no change to our reserve coverage. 
Moving to our current outlook. We have provided detailed guidance for both the full year and the first quarter, consistent with previous fourth quarter earnings calls. We expect full year 2021 total loans to be stable with 2020 on both an average and end-of-period basis, reflecting the full year headwinds of commercial line utilization declines from the second half of 2020 and PPP forgiveness, offset by the benefit of the consumer loans added at the end of 2020 and our forecast of $2 billion of new PPP loan originations in 2021. 
Average commercial balances are expected to decline in the low to mid-single-digits range compared to 2020, while consumer balances should increase in the mid- to high single-digits range. For the first quarter, we expect average total loan balances to increase approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting relative stability in the C&I portfolio, continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage and other consumer loans, partially offset by a 1% decline in CRE. 
Given the loan outlook, combined with our expectations for the underlying margin to be around 3%, reflective of the structural rate protection from our securities and hedge portfolios, we expect NII to decline approximately 3% next year and also decline around 3% in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, assuming no deployment of our excess liquidity. We expect noninterest income to increase 2% to 3% in 2021, which includes a 1% headwind from lower TRA income in 2021. 
If not for the TRA impact, our fee expectations would be for 3% to 4% growth, which includes the impact of approximately $40 million in foregone annual revenue associated with our business exits as part of our expense savings program. For the first quarter, we expect fees to increase mid-single digits year-over-year, which is not -- which is a 9% to 10% decline sequentially, reflecting seasonal impacts such as the lack of TRA revenue and lighter other noninterest income, partially offset by the seasonal uptick in wealth revenue from tax preparation fees in the first quarter and significantly stronger mortgage revenue. 
We expect top line mortgage revenue to improve $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and also anticipate stronger results in our loan and lease syndication businesses. We expect full year 2021 noninterest expense to decline approximately 1% relative to the adjusted 2020 expenses, driven by the impacts of our expense reduction program, but partially offset by expenses associated with strong fee growth, servicing expenses associated with the consumer loan portfolio purchased in the fourth quarter and continued investments to accelerate both our digital transformation and our sales force and branch expansion in our growth markets. 
As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Compared to the first quarter of 2020 reported expenses, we expect total expenses to be flat. On a sequential basis, excluding seasonal items, our total first quarter expenses are expected to be down approximately 3% to 4% from the fourth quarter. 
We currently expect to generate year-over-year adjusted positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 45 to 55 basis point range. If the proposed stimulus passes, we would expect to be at the lower end of that range. 
In summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles: disciplined client selection; conservative underwriting; and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. 
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A."

Obviously, there's a lot of unknowns going in as we go into 2021: digital stimulus, the vaccines and so forth, the recovery. And so it's a hard thing for us to gauge what the expectations are, but there's a lot of liquidity out there right now. So we're optimistic that if the vaccines get distributed appropriately, and we get the economy back in full swing second half of the year, that those numbers might look stronger.

And right now, in our outlook, we expect first quarter forgiveness fees to be in line with the fourth quarter. Perhaps that's -- we -- we'll be better than that from a forgiveness perspective. We've got about $400 million or a little bit less than 10% of the 2020 originations forgiven. And so as we model it out, we expect the majority of the fees from the 2020 originations to be forgiven in the third quarter as borrowers approach that 16-month time horizon of needing to make payments or have it forgiven. 
So right now, we expect the back half of the year to have a little bit more accelerated fees. And then, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the 2021 round of PPP to be about $2 billion in originations, and then that will accrue at a lower rate, just given the 5-year term on those loans. So we expect about a 1.8% yield prior to any of the forgiveness fees."

I think for now, we've done a lot of work on the residential mortgage portfolio to improve it. And we think the returns are incredibly attractive. I think, going forward, I'd like to see the loan growth be in other categories, just given the convexity risk you have in residential mortgage and that we -- we've done enough. 
So that's why we expect in the first quarter to get back to selling all of our production. But again, I think the trade that we were able to execute was a nice deployment of excess cash and, certainly, a far better return than just buying mortgage-backed securities.

I think it's a great question, and we're seeing a divergence in practice across the banks. Our view, in terms of what the rate environment would need to progress to in order to put our excess liquidity to work, is we would like to see 50 basis points or more improvement in the entry points, either through the spread widening or curve steepening. 
A lot of banks, to your point, [ is defined ] in on the 25 basis points of steepening or even before that. But credit spreads have tightened 10 basis points or more over that time so that the net entry point improvement to us is not that compelling. In fact, by our math, if you bought in the third quarter or even in the first couple of months of the fourth quarter, you lost $2 in value for every $1 in carry you picked up over that period of time. 
So you still have more risk should the curve steepen further. And we don't want to be stuck in a bad trade, chasing balances at what are still historically low levels of rates. So the good news for us is we are very well positioned in the investment portfolio. We have the luxury of time. Portfolio cash flows are about $1 billion a quarter is how we're modeling it. So we just think being patient -- we can afford to be patient, and we'll move when we think we are getting the appropriate risk return in the environment."

I think the point that Greg made to me is the most important one, is we have, on a sustained basis, continued to gain share even in our highest density markets over the course of the past 3 or 4 years on primary banking relationships, which we view as being the best measure of market share. Because the decisions you make on pricing a deposit product or you domicile headquarter deposits or otherwise, have a big impact on the FDIC numbers that you sometimes see people use on a period-to-period basis. 
So the strong household growth we have seen across the franchise, in particular, in focused markets like Chicago and the Southeast, as Greg mentioned, on the consumer side of the business and the strong core relationship growth that we continue to see out of our middle market franchise are the things that give us confidence in our ability to continue to compete."

Would see -- based on your full year and your first quarter expenses, it would seem like, at the midpoint of the range, you would -- you're factoring in about $1.1 billion a quarter of expenses from 2Q to 4Q. And I guess you get there in 2Q with -- most of the way there with the seasonal expenses going away. But I mean is it fair to say, like, how do we think about that glide path? And should we be thinking that by fourth quarter, as some of these expense initiatives filter through, you could be even below that $1.1 billion as you run rate, as you head into 2022?"

If the growth ends up being better than the 3% to 4%, then expenses, obviously, revenue ranges, would be higher. 
But for our outlook, right, you are exactly right. And then the benefit that we might have in the fourth quarter, to the extent our lean process automation and other initiatives pay off sooner than the 2022 time horizon, then you could see some additional improvement in the fourth quarter. But for now, we're expecting $100 million to $150 million of savings to occur in 2022 and not in 2021."

And you would -- the way the modeling works, you would have to have an economic outlook as well as the outlook was essentially in 4Q of '19, and that might be hard to ever get back to, at least in the next couple of years. So I think the bias for all of our reserves across the industry is probably to take a longer period of time. 
And ultimately, if -- you said if -- take a guess as to where that plays out over the next 2 years. Or at the end of 2 years from now, would you be at your day 1?

The investments that we've made, I think, are aligned with our long-term growth expectations and success of our business. So I feel really good about how we're competing today. 
The challenge always is, is when we look -- what watch these fintech players come forward -- not under the same regulatory oversight that we're doing with capital expectations and so forth, so there's a threat there that we're kind of watching. If they get access to the banking system, payment rails and so forth, that could create some stress for us that I'm very concerned about. 
But as far as our investments in fintech entities themselves, the investments that we're making, I'm comfortable with. It's really those fintech players out there that aren't under the same regulatory framework that we are creating some stress for us, snooping around the edge of our profit pools and maybe shifting some customer behavior. So that's probably the thing that keeps me up most at night. 
As far as competing against other banks, I think we've done all the right things to do that, just making sure we keep our eyes open, and we have been, on what it looks like against some of these other nontraditional bank players. To that end, that's why we've made significant investments in our digital capabilities and really created a digital bank ourselves.

Hope you're all well and staying healthy. Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $694 million or $0.93 per share. We continued our positive momentum in the past several quart",869,"Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Hope you're all well and staying healthy. Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $694 million or $0.93 per share. We continued our positive momentum in the past several quarters and once again delivered strong financial results in the first quarter. These strong results reflect record commercial banking fee revenue, continued success generating consumer household growth and a strong underlying net interest margin. 
Our performance reflects focused execution on our key strategic priorities. We continue to benefit from the diversification and resilience of our fee-based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial and Wealth & Asset Management, which are generating strong results and helping to cushion the impact of lower short-term rates. We have maintained our disciplined client selection and conservative underwriting, which are evident in our credit metrics. 
During the quarter, we recorded a benefit in our provision for credit losses, reflecting a stronger economic outlook as well as historically low net charge-offs, which included improvements in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. In addition to muted credit losses, our criticized assets and NPLs also improved sequentially. 
Nonperforming loans decreased 11% from the prior quarter, with NPL inflows at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2019. Our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong. As a result, our robust CET1 ratio further improved to 10.5% this quarter. Our CET1 target remains at 9.5%. 
As we have stated many times before, we are focused on deploying capital for organic growth opportunities, evaluating nonbank opportunities where it fits our strategy and share repurchases. Based on our current dividend, trailing 4 quarters of net income, we have the capacity to repurchase shares up to $347 million in the second quarter. After that, we have more flexibility in terms of how and when return capital to shareholders under the SCD framework. Jamie will provide more details on our capital plan. 
The improved macroeconomic data and outlook are aligned with our strongest overall commercial loan production since before the pandemic. Furthermore, we have seen our pipeline strengthen considerably over the past 90 days with significant strength in manufacturing, renewables, health care and technology, partially offset by new demand in leisure and hospitality and CRE. 
Production was offset by elevated payoffs and paydowns, combined with another 1% decline in line utilization. We have retained the customer and their core banking relationship as virtually none of our commercial payoffs during the quarter with the result of client attrition. Additionally, paydowns in our corporate bank largely reflected clients tapping the capital markets, where we benefited significantly from additional capital market fees. 
Given the strong production trends, firming pipeline and retention of the client relationship, we remain well positioned to take advantage of a more favorable economic backdrop to clients execute their growth plans in the second half of 2021. We will continue to assess the implications of client supply chain constraints as we progress through the year. 
Consumer employment and savings in trends also remain favorable given the fiscal stimulus pump demand and a gradual reopening of the economy throughout our footprint. Despite the overall economic recovery over the past several quarters, I recognize that not everyone in our society has benefited equally. This is why I'm very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. 
I am particularly pleased that we exceeded our 5-year $32 billion commitment to invest in low and moderate-income communities by more than $9 billion. We also recently announced a $2.8 billion commitment in support of racial equality focused on lending, investing and financial accessibility. 
We also announced a new banking product this quarter called Momentum Banking, which competes with the fintechs and is now our flagship mass market banking offering. Momentum Banking provides customers with liquidity solutions and our newly enhanced mobile app to help them avoid unnecessary fees including immediate access to funds from digital deposits, short-term on-demand borrowing options, simple gold based savings targets, free customer access to their paycheck to 2 days earlier with a qualifying direct deposit starting in June and no monthly service fees. 
In addition, we honor to once again be named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, also reflecting our strong corporate culture, compliance program and ESG actions. We are 1 of just 5 banks globally to receive this accolade this year. We believe our balance sheet strength diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well in 2021 and beyond. 
We remain committed to generating sustainable long-term value for shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top regional bank. I would like to once again thank all our employees. I am very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers and each other over the past year. You have enabled Fifth Third to continue to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook."
270961,693599375,2253678,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We generated strong returns this quarter, reflecting our solid operating performance and continued improvement in credit quality. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.4% and an ROTCE, excluding AOCI,",2270,"Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We generated strong returns this quarter, reflecting our solid operating performance and continued improvement in credit quality. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.4% and an ROTCE, excluding AOCI, of 19.8%. PPNR results were also strong, driven by strength in both NII and fees. 
Consequently, expenses were elevated relative to our previous guidance due to performance and market-linked compensation expenses. We recorded a $244 million release to our credit reserves this quarter, which lowered our ACL ratio from 2.41% to 2.19%. Our historically low charge-offs, which came in better than expected, combined with an improving economic outlook versus previous expectations, resulted in a $173 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. 
Continuing with the income statement performance. Net interest income declined just 1% sequentially due to the lower day count and a reduction in prepayment penalties received in the securities portfolio compared to the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by the impact of $2.1 billion in government-guaranteed residential mortgage forbearance loans purchased from a third-party servicer in December and another $600 million in March. 
We have continued to take action to prudently deploy excess liquidity in order to improve our NII trajectory for 2021, and these loans provided a more attractive risk-adjusted return relative to other alternatives. Our first quarter NII results also included approximately $12 million in incremental PPP fees, reflecting loan forgiveness compared to the fourth quarter. 
Additionally, as we discussed previously, our prior quarter NII results included prepayment penalty income for our investment portfolio, which declined $10 million sequentially. From a liability management perspective, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs another 2 basis points this quarter, resulting in a cost of only 6 basis points. 
Reported NIM increased 4 basis points sequentially, reflecting a decline in excess cash, incremental PPP forgiveness fees and day count, partially offset by the aforementioned securities prepayment penalty income decline. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, decreased just 4 basis points to 310 basis points. 
With a top quartile margin relative to peers, an asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion in excess liquidity, we believe that we remain well positioned for a higher rate environment, while also benefiting from structural protection against lower rates given our securities and hedge portfolios. Additionally, we have updated our interest rate risk disclosures to reflect a 38% deposit beta to better align with our future expectations based on the last rate hike cycle experience. 
In a plus 100 basis point scenario where we invest about 1/3 of our excess liquidity over a 12-month period, we would expect annual NII to be about 15% higher compared to a static rate environment. Total reported noninterest income decreased 5%. Adjusted noninterest income, excluding the TRA impact, increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. 
Our fee performance reflected strength throughout our lines of business, including record commercial banking fees led by robust debt capital markets revenue, mortgage banking revenue, driven by strong production and strong leasing business revenue. 
Top line mortgage banking revenue increased $42 million sequentially, reflecting improved execution and strong production in both retail and correspondent, which was partially offset by incremental margin pressure. Also, as we discussed in January, our fourth quarter results included a $12 million headwind from our decision to retain a portion of our retail production. 
Mortgage servicing fees of $59 million and MSR net valuation gains of $18 million were more than offset by asset decay of $81 million. If primary mortgage rates were to move higher, we would expect to see some servicing revenue improvement, which would likely be more than offset by production and margin pressures in that environment. As a result, we currently expect full year mortgage revenue to decline low to mid-single digits given our rate outlook. 
Reported noninterest expenses decreased 2% relative to the fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses were up 3%, driven by seasonal items in the first quarter in addition to elevated compensation-related expenses linked to strong fee performance as well as the mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred comp plans. 
Current quarter expenses included $10 million in servicing expenses from our purchased loan portfolios. For the full year, we expect to incur $50 million to $55 million in servicing expenses for purchased loans, including the impact of an additional $1 billion in forbearance pool purchases in April. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans and leases were flat sequentially. C&I results continued to reflect stronger production levels offset by paydowns. Additionally, revolver utilization rates decreased another 1% this quarter to a record low 31% due to the extraordinary levels of market liquidity and robust capital markets. The sequential decline in utilization came primarily from COVID high-impact industries and our energy vertical. 
Also, our leveraged loan outstandings declined more than 10% sequentially. As Greg mentioned, we are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining customer relationships throughout this environment and are benefiting from the fee opportunities. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially, with end-of-period balances up 2%, reflecting drawdowns on prior commitments, which were paused during the pandemic. 
Average total consumer loans were flat sequentially as continued strength in the auto portfolio was offset by declines in home equity, credit card and residential mortgage balances. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $2.2 billion with an average FICO score around 7 80 with lower advance rates, higher internal credit scores and better spreads compared to last year. 
Our securities portfolio increased approximately 1% this quarter as we opportunistically pre invested expected second quarter cash flows of approximately $1 billion during March. With respect to broader securities portfolio positioning, we remain patient, but we will continue to be opportunistic as the environment evolves. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point range. 
We are optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of 2021 will present more attractive risk return opportunities. We continue to feel very good about our investment portfolio positioning, with 57% of the investment portfolio invested in bullet and locked out cash flows at quarter end. 
Our securities portfolio had $2 million of net discount accretion in the first quarter and our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained strong at $2.4 billion pretax. 
Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash decreased $2 billion sequentially and increased $30 billion compared to the year ago quarter. The unprecedented excess cash levels are the result of record deposit growth over the past year. Core deposits were flat compared to the fourth quarter as growth in consumer transaction deposits impacted by the fiscal stimulus was offset by seasonal declines in commercial transaction deposits and a reduction in consumer CD balances. 
We are experiencing strong deposit growth so far in April and expect low single-digit growth in the second quarter from both consumer and commercial customers. 
Moving to credit. Our overall credit quality continues to reflect our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, prudent management of our balance sheet exposures and the continued improvement of the macroeconomic environment. The first quarter net charge-off ratio of 27 basis points improved 16 basis points sequentially. 
Nonperforming assets declined $81 million or 9%, with the resulting NPA ratio of 72 basis points, declining 7 basis points sequentially. Also, our criticized assets declined 8% with considerable improvements in casinos, restaurants and leisure travel as well as in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios, partially offset by continued pressure in commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels. 
Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes the labor market continues to improve, with unemployment reaching 5% by the middle of next year and ending our 3-year RNS period in this low 4% range. As a result, this scenario assumes most of the labor market disruption created by the pandemic and resulting government programs is resolved by 2024 but still leaves a persistent employment gap of a few million jobs compared to pre-COVID expectation. 
Additionally, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from the administration's recent fiscal stimulus and assumes an infrastructure package over $1 trillion this past -- this year. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million release to our reserve. Conversely, applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $788 million bill. 
Inclusive of the impact of approximately $109 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.29%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.4%. 
With the recent economic recovery in our base case expectations point to further improvement, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. Like all of you, we continue to closely watch COVID case and vaccination trends, which could impact the timing of reopening of local economies and reverse the strengthening consumer confidence trends. 
Our March 31 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth, lower unemployment and improving credit quality, including the expected benefits of government programs. Moving to capital. Our capital remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio grew during the quarter, ending at 10.5%, above our stated target of 9.5% and which amounts to approximately $1.4 billion of excess capital. 
Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, is up 8% since the year ago quarter. During the quarter, we completed $180 million in buybacks, which reduced our share count by approximately 5 million shares compared to the fourth quarter. As Craig mentioned, we have the capacity to repurchase up to $347 million in the second quarter, based on our current dividend and the federal reserves, average trailing 4 quarters of net income framework. 
As a category 4 bank, we expect to have additional flexibility with respect to capital distribution starting in the third quarter. As prudent stewards of capital, we expect to get closer to our CET1 target by mid-2022. While we did not participate in CCAR 2021, we are required to submit our Board approved capital plan to the Fed. Those plans support the potential to raise our dividend in the third quarter and repurchase over $800 million in the second half of 2021. 
Moving to our current outlook. For the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up a bit compared to last year, reflecting relative stability in commercial, combined with low single-digit growth in consumer, which includes the additional $1 billion in Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases in April. 
We continue to expect CRE to remain stable in this environment. Our loan outlook assumes commercial revolver utilization rates migrate closer to 33% by year-end. It also includes the impact of $2 billion in loan balances we expect to add from the latest round of PPP, including the $1.7 billion we have generated to date which will continue to be offset by forgiveness throughout the year. 
We expect our underlying NIM to be in the [ 3 0 5 ] area for the full year. Combined with our loan outlook, we expect NII to decline just 1% this year assuming stable securities balances. On a sequential basis, we expect NII to be stable to up 1%. 
Within our NII guidance, we assume we generate approximately $150 million in PPP-related interest income in 2021, of which $53 million was realized in the first quarter compared to $100 million in the full year of 2020. We expect full year fees to increase 4% to 5% compared to 2020 or 5% to 6%, excluding the impact of the TRA. 
Improvement from our previous guide reflects a more robust economic rebound as well as our continued success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger processing revenue, capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be partially offset by mortgage. We expect second quarter fees to decline 3% to 5%, reflecting lower mortgage and leasing revenues partially offset by low single-digit growth in card and processing and treasury management revenue. 
We expect relatively stable commercial banking revenues sequentially. Given both our stronger fee and NII outlook, combined with the servicing cost from the loan portfolio purchases, we expect full year expenses to be up 1%, driven by volume-based compensation and other expenses. On a sequential basis, we expect expenses to decline 5% to 7%. 
We expect to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 30 to 40 basis point range, given the strong first quarter performance and assuming our base case scenario continues to play out. Second quarter losses are likely to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range. 
In summary, our first quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us very well during this environment. 
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A."

We couldn't be more pleased to date with the progress we've seen in that market, especially if you look at household growth, new customer acquisition, strength of our commercial businesses in those -- in the Southeast markets. So the progress we made to date, we're going to continue to invest in those markets as it makes sense. From an other investment perspective, obviously, we balance our investments for the greatest return for our shareholders.

So we're seeing some benefit there, but a lot still to come as we add another 30-plus branches in the Southeast this year and another 35 next year. On the commercial Banking and wealth management side of the equation, I think we've talked in the past about the additions we have made in the southeast on the fee income side of the business, both Coker Capital and HTC are headquartered down there and have strong southeast presences. But we also talked about adding 30 additional middle market bankers to the southeast. And only about 7 of those positions were filled in the first quarter with another 10 offers outstanding. So very clearly, those benefits are not yet in the run rate, but we've been very pleased with the quality of talent that we are able to attract. And we expect that to continue to further accelerate the shift in the business mix between the Midwest and the southeast markets."

So we did change our deposit betas from 70% down to 38%. So with that in mind, obviously, that reflects a very asset-sensitive balance sheet, as you can see in the disclosures. How we look at it right now is that given our view on the economy, we believe there's still momentum and a bias for higher rates as 2021 plays out and even 2022. So for us, we can afford to be patient. And fortunately, our investment portfolio is running off at a pretty slow pace and the hedges aren't running off at all. We still have 2.5 more years before we have that headwind. So we're really not forced into traits today that would sacrifice future NII levels just to make income now. So I think we'll continue to be patient. We'll be opportunistic, but we would certainly like to see entry points a little bit better. And our focus would be more on just extension of protection as opposed to laying on net new notional amounts to where we are today."

Great question and a difficult answer, but I'll start with the easy parts. In terms of where our deposit growth has come from. We're up 27% year-over-year, $30-plus billion. 70% of that has come from our commercial customer base and 30% has come out of the consumer book. In terms of the consumer book, the growth has really driven, as we've talked about, the 3% household growth, but also just the consumers deleveraging. And when you slice the consumer deposit book, just March over March, average DDA and IVTs per account are up about 30%. Savings are up 15%. So we're seeing that consumer behavior being a little more conservative, plus the additional stimulus and all the other liquidity programs available are just adding significant balances to these consumer accounts. I think that will come down as consumer spending picks up, and we should expect that excess liquidity of about $2,000 per account start to wane in the back half of this year. But for the second quarter, we do expect consumer deposit growth to continue. We've seen that with the stimulus payments with tax refunds, and so we see a portion of that excess liquidity being applied to paying down unsecured loans, but for the most part, sticking. From a commercial perspective, I think clients are just being more conservative. And I expect the commercial deposit balances perhaps ticked down a little bit slower in over a period of years as folks -- while we see strong pipelines and encouragement for loan growth, I think corporations will hold a little bit extra liquidity given what we've just been through. And so I think you might see the ability to grow loans without really seeing a lot of runoff in the commercial deposits. But I think consumer spending will drive a decline in the consumer book perhaps sooner than commercial."

So while we feel very positive about our credit performance to date through the pandemic, there are still segments of the economy and our loan book that have not returned to those pre-pandemic levels of health. So we do think full normalization will take time and will not occur over a period of just a few quarters. And I guess to answer the heart of your question, to get back to those adoption level reserve rates, we would need to see a sustained strengthening and the credit characteristics of those borrowers that are most at risk for the longer-term negative impacts from the pandemic in concert with improving economic forecast.

But the headwind is going to be margin compression. So while we transition to more of a purchase environment here over the summer months, volumes should be strong, margins will compress. And then as those prepayments, refis slow down, we expect to see a little bit of a lift in the servicing portfolio. So it's less of a headwind and perhaps even a positive in the back half of the year.

But I don't see the balance sheet, at least in 2021 being that big of a driver. I guess there's the 9 basis points of erosion with the CECL transition that kicks in, in the first quarter of 2022. But overall, our income levels are more than sufficient to cover the balance sheet growth. So the real benefit for us is just buying back the $347 million in the second quarter and then $800 million or more in the back half of the year to try to bring that down to 9.5% by midyear 2022. That's our goal and then also have a dividend increase here in the third quarter."

You actually had a more modest increase in both deposits and the cash this quarter than what we're seeing for the overall industry. And just wondering how you'd reconcile that difference? Yes, it's really driven by our commercial clients. And in particular, our focus on retailers, where you typically have seasonal runoff in the first quarter of every year from elevated fourth quarter balances. I think on a year-over-year basis, our growth is certainly at the high end. And I think we've done a very nice job of capturing more than our fair share of the excess liquidity in the commercial book. And then obviously, the household growth on the consumer side has contributed. So I feel good about how we're positioned from a deposit gathering perspective, it's just more about when is the right time to start putting the money to work."

So when you look at our expense guide diligent as we are and as focused as we are on expenses. At the end of the day, we did raise the expense guide 2 points. Half of that is from the volume-related compensation expense and fee growth and then half is from these additional loan servicing costs that are more than offset by the improvement in NII."

First off, normalized line utilization for us going into the pandemic would have been 36%, 37% on average. So obviously, with the pandemic, you saw a spike up to 40-plus-percent. But think about a normalized range, 36%, 37% we're running about 31% right now. So hopefully, the second half of the year is a little stronger as we anticipate to look at our bottoms-up forecast. We can pick up another 2% lift. That's stretch out there, but we think that's doable, given what we're seeing in our pipelines, just back up to 33%, which is still not the normalized level. If you think about each 1%, it's about $750 million of outstandings for us. So an impact of the 2% uplift by year-end is less than 1% on total loan growth for 2021, given the ramp-up throughout the year. So it's possible. But once again, I think there's a lot of lot variables out there that we're watching but we are encouraged by the pipeline strength that we're seeing right now. Our production levels in commercial in the first quarter. We're at pre pandemic level, so we're encouraged by that. If you look at the pipelines going forward, the forecast right now will be about 30% up in production over 2020, but slightly below prebiotic levels. And we're seeing good strength in manufacturing, health care, TMT and renewables right now. And if you look at our markets, where we're seeing some good progress. Indiana, Michigan, California and the Carolinas would jump out as a source of strength from an asset perspective. So production is strong. Pipelines look good. We're hopeful we'll see back half of this year an improvement in line utilization. And once again, there's a lot of liquidity out there. So it's something we're watching. I think just to add to what Greg said. I mean, Scott, we're asking the same question to ourselves, right, in terms of what the visibility we have into the economy. And some of the signals we're seeing about a pickup in inflation and input costs. I had the chance since the beginning of the year to be out in 12 of our 15 different regions and to spend time with clients there. So we've been asking that question. And what we're hearing from them primarily are either supply chain disruptions. Some of that, obviously, is that some of the global dynamics that we have talked about, whether it was stuff stuck in the canal or shortage is semiconductors, but it also is just access to materials. And then on the other side of the equation, labor shortages, in particular, as it relates to the skilled trades. And the byproduct of that is we're not seeing the inventory building that you might otherwise expect to see yet. So we're watching inventory levels closely. We're watching the index closely as leading indicators to when we may see a pickup in utilization. I think 1 positive note, which is reflected in the results in the first quarter is we are seeing increased demand on the equipment side of the business. And that is encouraging because that obviously would be the other free condition to an expansion."

Our strategy, as I think we've discussed quite frequently as a primary relationship strategy. It's a focus on primary banking. It's a focus on being the place where you get paid on where you pay your bills and how you build up liquidity. And the byproduct of that, obviously, as Jamie mentioned earlier, is we did see really positive trends in the consumer side of the business because the liquidity that consumers have built up really is in the transaction accounts as opposed to somewhere else. So our deposit growth on the consumer side has been underpinned by, call it, 2% to 3% household growth over a period of several years now. We would like to continue to bump that number up. And we think that the momentum banking product, coupled with the expansion in the Southeast. Gives us a path to doing that in terms of the overall household growth rates that we experienced, which will support noninterest-bearing deposit growth. I think on the other side of the equation, yes, when somebody elects to use a short-term liquidity product, take our early access product, the deposit advanced product that we've had in the market for several years now. That is a lower cost way to cover a cash flow shortfall than an overdraft fee. But it's also a very sustainable way. And owing to the fact that we have had those products and our product set for several years now, our overdraft charges as a percentage of total consumer deposits are lower than all but one of the large U.S. banks already. So I think from our perspective, we're giving the consumer the widest possible range of options to avoid fees. We're getting the benefit of that in the form of household growth and of primacy, which is the entry point for us to the broadest range of products services that we offer. And because of our position on the overdraft side of the equation and the low reliance on that fee line, we have left to give up there and are going to be able to outgrow any sort of an impact on the fees per household measure."

Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $694 million or $0.93 per share. We continued our positive momentum from the past several quarters and once again delivered strong financial results in the first quarter. These strong results reflect record commercial banking fee revenue, continued success generating consumer household growth and a strong underlying net interest margin. 
Our performance reflects focused execution on our key strategic priorities. We continue to benefit from the diversification and resilience of our fee-based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial and wealth and asset management, which are generating strong results and helping to cushion the impact of lower short-term rates. We have maintained our disciplined client selection and conservative underwriting, which are evident in our credit metrics. 
During the quarter, we recorded a benefit in our provision for credit losses, reflecting a stronger economic outlook as well as historically low net charge-offs, which included improvements in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. In addition to muted credit losses, our criticized assets and NPLs also improved sequentially. Nonperforming loans decreased 11% from the prior quarter, with NPL inflows at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2019. 
Our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong. As a result, our robust CET1 ratio further improved to 10.5% this quarter. Our CET1 target remains at 9.5%. 
As we have stated many times before, we are focused on deploying capital for organic growth opportunities, evaluating nonbank opportunities where it fits our strategy and share repurchases. Based on our current dividend, trailing 4 quarters of net income, we have the capacity to repurchase shares up to $347 million in the second quarter. After that, we have more flexibility in terms of how and when we return capital to shareholders under the SCB framework. Jamie will provide more details on our capital plan. 
The improved macroeconomic data and outlook are aligned with our strongest overall commercial loan production since before the pandemic. Furthermore, we have seen our pipeline strengthen considerably over the past 90 days, with significant strength in manufacturing, renewables, health care and technology, partially offset by new demand in leisure and hospitality and CRE. 
Production was offset by elevated payoffs and paydowns, combined with another 1% decline in line utilization. We have retained the customer and their core banking relationship as virtually none of our commercial payoffs during the quarter were the result of client attrition. Additionally, paydowns in our corporate bank largely reflected clients tapping the capital markets, where we benefited significantly from additional capital market fees. 
Given the strong production trends, firming pipeline and retention of the client relationship, we remain well positioned to take advantage of a more favorable economic backdrop so clients execute their growth plans in the second half of 2021. We will continue to assess the implications of client supply chain constraints as we progress through the year. Consumer employment, savings and spending trends also remain favorable, given the fiscal stimulus-pumped demand and a gradual reopening of the economy throughout our footprint. 
Despite the overall economic recovery over the past several quarters, I recognize that not everyone in our society has benefited equally. This is why I'm very proud that, in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. I am particularly pleased that we exceeded our 5-year $32 billion commitment to invest in low and moderate-income communities by more than $9 billion. We also recently announced a $2.8 billion commitment in support of racial equality, focused on lending, investing and financial accessibility. 
We also announced a new banking product this quarter called Momentum Banking, which competes with the fintechs and is now our flagship mass market banking offering. Momentum Banking provides customers with liquidity solutions in our newly enhanced mobile app to help them avoid unnecessary fees, including immediate access to funds from digital deposits; short-term, on-demand borrowing options; simple goal-based savings targets; free customer access to their paycheck to 2 days earlier, with a qualifying direct deposit starting in June; and no monthly service fees. 
In addition, we were honored to once again be named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, also reflecting our strong corporate culture, compliance program and ESG actions. We are one of just 5 banks globally to receive this accolade this year. We believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well in 2021 and beyond. 
We remain committed to generating sustainable long-term value for shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top regional bank. I would like to once again thank all our employees. I am very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers and each other over the past year. You have enabled Fifth Third to continue to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook."

We generated strong returns this quarter, reflecting our solid operating performance and continued improvement in credit quality.

We generated strong returns this quarter, reflecting our solid operating performance and continued improvement in credit quality. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.4% and an ROTCE, excluding AOCI, of 19.8%. PPNR results were also strong, driven by strength in both NII and fees. 
Consequently, expenses were elevated relative to our previous guidance due to performance and market-linked compensation expenses. We recorded a $244 million release to our credit reserves this quarter, which lowered our ACL ratio from 2.41% to 2.19%. Our historically low charge-offs, which came in better than expected, combined with an improving economic outlook versus previous expectations, resulted in a $173 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. 
Continuing with the income statement performance. Net interest income declined just 1% sequentially due to the lower day count and a reduction in prepayment penalties received in the securities portfolio compared to the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by the impact of $2.1 billion in government-guaranteed residential mortgage forbearance loans purchased from a third-party servicer in December and another $600 million in March. 
We have continued to take action to prudently deploy excess liquidity in order to improve our NII trajectory for 2021, and these loans provided a more attractive risk-adjusted return relative to other alternatives. Our first quarter NII results also included approximately $12 million in incremental PPP fees, reflecting loan forgiveness compared to the fourth quarter. 
Additionally, as we discussed previously, our prior quarter NII results included prepayment penalty income for our investment portfolio, which declined $10 million sequentially. From a liability management perspective, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs another 2 basis points this quarter, resulting in a cost of only 6 basis points. 
Reported NIM increased 4 basis points sequentially, reflecting a decline in excess cash, incremental PPP forgiveness fees and day count, partially offset by the aforementioned securities prepayment penalty income decline. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, decreased just 4 basis points to 310 basis points. 
With a top-quartile margin relative to peers, an asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion in excess liquidity, we believe that we remain well positioned for a higher rate environment, while also benefiting from structural protection against lower rates, given our securities and hedge portfolios. Additionally, we have updated our interest rate risk disclosures to reflect a 38% deposit beta to better align with our future expectations based on the last rate hike cycle experience. 
In a plus-100-basis-point scenario, where we invest about 1/3 of our excess liquidity over a 12-month period, we would expect annual NII to be about 15% higher compared to a static rate environment. Total reported noninterest income decreased 5%. Adjusted noninterest income, excluding the TRA impact, increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Our fee performance reflected strength throughout our lines of business, including record commercial banking fees, led by robust debt capital markets revenue; mortgage banking revenue, driven by strong production; and strong leasing business revenue. 
Top line mortgage banking revenue increased $42 million sequentially, reflecting improved execution and strong production in both retail and correspondent, which was partially offset by incremental margin pressure. Also, as we discussed in January, our fourth quarter results included a $12 million headwind from our decision to retain a portion of our retail production. 
Mortgage servicing fees of $59 million and MSR net valuation gains of $18 million were more than offset by asset decay of $81 million. If primary mortgage rates were to move higher, we would expect to see some servicing revenue improvement, which would likely be more than offset by production and margin pressures in that environment. As a result, we currently expect full year mortgage revenue to decline low to mid-single digits, given our rate outlook. 
Reported noninterest expenses decreased 2% relative to the fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses were up 3%, driven by seasonal items in the first quarter in addition to elevated compensation-related expenses linked to strong fee performance, as well as the mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred comp plans. 
Current quarter expenses included $10 million in servicing expenses from our purchased loan portfolios. For the full year, we expect to incur $50 million to $55 million in servicing expenses for purchased loans, including the impact of an additional $1 billion in forbearance pool purchases in April. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans and leases were flat sequentially. C&I results continue to reflect stronger production levels, offset by paydowns. Additionally, revolver utilization rates decreased another 1% this quarter to a record-low 31% due to the extraordinary levels of market liquidity and robust capital markets. The sequential decline in utilization came primarily from COVID high-impact industries and our energy vertical. 
Also, our leveraged loan outstandings declined more than 10% sequentially. As Greg mentioned, we are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining customer relationships throughout this environment and are benefiting from the fee opportunities. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially, with end-of-period balances up 2%, reflecting drawdowns on prior commitments, which were paused during the pandemic. 
Average total consumer loans were flat sequentially as continued strength in the auto portfolio was offset by declines in home equity, credit card and residential mortgage balances. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $2.2 billion, with an average FICO score around 780, with lower advance rates, higher internal credit scores and better spreads compared to last year. 
Our securities portfolio increased approximately 1% this quarter as we opportunistically preinvested expected second quarter cash flows of approximately $1 billion during March. With respect to broader securities portfolio positioning, we remain patient, but we will continue to be opportunistic as the environment evolves. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point range. 
We are optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of 2021 will present more attractive risk return opportunities. We continue to feel very good about our investment portfolio positioning, with 57% of the investment portfolio invested in bullet and locked-out cash flows at quarter end. Our securities portfolio had $2 million of net discount accretion in the first quarter, and our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remain strong at $2.4 billion pretax. 
Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, decreased $2 billion sequentially and increased $30 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The unprecedented excess cash levels are the result of record deposit growth over the past year. 
Core deposits were flat compared to the fourth quarter as growth in consumer transaction deposits impacted by the fiscal stimulus was offset by seasonal declines in commercial transaction deposits and a reduction in consumer CD balances. We are experiencing strong deposit growth so far in April and expect low single-digit growth in the second quarter from both consumer and commercial customers. 
Moving to credit. Our overall credit quality continues to reflect our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, prudent management of our balance sheet exposures and the continued improvement of the macroeconomic environment. The first quarter net charge-off ratio of 27 basis points improved 16 basis points sequentially. 
Nonperforming assets declined $81 million or 9%, with the resulting NPA ratio of 72 basis points declining 7 basis points sequentially. Also, our criticized assets declined 8%, with considerable improvements in casinos, restaurants and leisure travel as well as in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios, partially offset by continued pressure in commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels. 
Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes the labor market continues to improve, with unemployment reaching 5% by the middle of next year and ending our 3-year R&S period in this low 4% range. As a result, this scenario assumes most of the labor market disruption created by the pandemic and resulting government programs is resolved by 2024, but still leaves a persistent employment gap of a few million jobs compared to pre-COVID expectation. 
Additionally, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from the administration's recent fiscal stimulus and assumes an infrastructure package over $1 trillion this past -- this year. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million release to our reserve. 
Conversely, applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $788 million bill. Inclusive of the impact of approximately $109 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.29%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.4%. 
With the recent economic recovery, and our base case expectations point to further improvement, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out, given the uncertain environment. Like all of you, we continue to closely watch COVID case and vaccination trends, which could impact the timing of reopening of local economies and reverse the strengthening consumer confidence trends. Our March 31 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth, lower unemployment and improving credit quality, including the expected benefits of government programs. 
Moving to capital. Our capital remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio grew during the quarter, ending at 10.5%, above our stated target of 9.5%, which amounts to approximately $1.4 billion of excess capital. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, is up 8% since the year-ago quarter. 
During the quarter, we completed $180 million in buybacks, which reduced our share count by approximately 5 million shares compared to the fourth quarter. As Greg mentioned, we have the capacity to repurchase up to $347 million in the second quarter based on our current dividend and the Federal Reserve's average trailing 4 quarters of net income framework. 
As a Category IV bank, we expect to have additional flexibility with respect to capital distribution starting in the third quarter. As prudent stewards of capital, we expect to get closer to our CET1 target by mid-2022. While we did not participate in CCAR 2021, we are required to submit our Board-approved capital plan to the Fed. Those plans support the potential to raise our dividend in the third quarter and repurchase over $800 million in the second half of 2021. 
Moving to our current outlook. For the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up a bit compared to last year, reflecting relative stability in commercial, combined with low single-digit growth in consumer, which includes the additional $1 billion in Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases in April. We continue to expect CRE to remain stable in this environment. 
Our loan outlook assumes commercial revolver utilization rates migrate closer to 33% by year-end. It also includes the impact of $2 billion in loan balances we expect to add from the latest round of PPP, including the $1.7 billion we have generated to date, which will continue to be offset by forgiveness throughout the year. We expect our underlying NIM to be in the 3.05% area for the full year. 
Combined with our loan outlook, we expect NII to decline just 1% this year, assuming stable securities balances. On a sequential basis, we expect NII to be stable to up 1%. Within our NII guidance, we assume we generate approximately $150 million in PPP-related interest income in 2021, of which $53 million was realized in the first quarter compared to $100 million in the full year of 2020. 
We expect full year fees to increase 4% to 5% compared to 2020 or 5% to 6%, excluding the impact of the TRA. Improvement from our previous guide reflects a more robust economic rebound as well as our continued success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger processing revenue, capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be partially offset by mortgage. We expect second quarter fees to decline 3% to 5%, reflecting lower mortgage and leasing revenues, partially offset by low single-digit growth in card and processing and treasury management revenue. 
We expect relatively stable commercial banking revenues sequentially. Given both our stronger fee and NII outlook, combined with the servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases, we expect full year expenses to be up 1%, driven by volume-based compensation and other expenses. On a sequential basis, we expect expenses to decline 5% to 7%. 
We expect to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 30 to 40 basis point range, given the strong first quarter performance and assuming our base case scenario continues to play out. Second quarter losses are likely to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range. 
In summary, our first quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us very well during this environment.

It's really about being a better provider of products and services in those markets and really taking advantage of the opportunity these markets create for us. 
We couldn't be more pleased to date with the progress we've seen in that market, especially if you look at household growth, new customer acquisition, strength of our commercial businesses in those -- in the Southeast markets. So the progress we've made to date, we're going to continue to invest in those markets as it makes sense. 
From an other investment perspective, obviously, we balance our investments for the greatest return for our shareholders. But right now, we think the Southeast is still a good place for us to continue to invest until we get to the scale and take advantage of the opportunities that are out there.

Just to add to what Greg said, when we announced the build-out of the de novo strategy in the markets in the Southeast, we announced that we were going to build about 120 branches.

So we're seeing some benefit there, but a lot still to come as we add another 30-plus branches in the Southeast this year and another 35 next year. 
On the commercial banking and wealth management side of the equation, I think we've talked in the past about the additions we have made in the Southeast on the fee income side of the business. Both Coker Capital and H2C are headquartered down there and have strong Southeast presences. But we also talked about adding 30 additional middle market bankers to the Southeast. And only about 7 of those positions were filled in the first quarter, with another 10 offers outstanding. 
So very clearly, those benefits are not yet in the run rate, but we've been very pleased with the quality of talent that we are able to attract. And we expect that to continue to further accelerate the shift in the business mix between the Midwest and the Southeast markets."

So we did change our deposit betas from 70% down to 38%. 
So with that in mind, obviously, that reflects a very asset-sensitive balance sheet, as you can see in the disclosures. How we look at it right now is that, given our view on the economy, we believe there's still momentum and a bias for higher rates as 2021 plays out and even 2022. So for us, we can afford to be patient. 
And fortunately, our investment portfolio is running off at a pretty slow pace, and the hedges aren't running off at all. We still have 2.5 more years before we have that headwind. So we're really not forced into trades today that would sacrifice future NII levels just to make income now. 
So I think we'll continue to be patient. We'll be opportunistic, but we would certainly like to see entry points a little bit better. And our focus would be more on just extension of protection as opposed to laying on net new notional amounts to where we are today."

Great question and a difficult answer, but I'll start with the easy parts.

Great question and a difficult answer, but I'll start with the easy parts. In terms of where our deposit growth has come from, we're up 27% year-over-year, $30-plus billion. 70% of that has come from our commercial customer base and 30% has come out of the consumer book. 
In terms of the consumer book, the growth has really driven, as we've talked about, the 3% household growth, but also just the consumers deleveraging. And when you slice the consumer deposit book, just March over March, average DDA and IBTs per account are up about 30%. Savings are up 15%. So we're seeing that consumer behavior being a little more conservative, plus the additional stimulus and all the other liquidity programs available are just adding significant balances to these consumer accounts. 
I think that will come down as consumer spending picks up, and we should expect that excess liquidity of about $2,000 per account start to wane in the back half of this year. But for the second quarter, we do expect consumer deposit growth to continue. We've seen that with these stimulus payments, with tax refunds. And so we see a portion of that excess liquidity being applied to paying down unsecured loans, but for the most part, sticking. 
From a commercial perspective, I think clients are just being more conservative. And I expect the commercial deposit balances perhaps tick down a little bit slower in over a period of years as folks -- while we see strong pipelines and encouragement for loan growth. I think corporations will hold a little bit extra liquidity, given what we've just been through. 
And so I think you might see the ability to grow loans without really seeing a lot of runoff in the commercial deposits. But I think consumer spending will drive a decline in the consumer book, perhaps sooner than commercial."

So while we feel very positive about our credit performance to date through the pandemic, there are still segments of the economy and our loan book that have not returned to those pre-pandemic levels of health. So we do think full normalization will take time and will not occur over a period of just a few quarters. 
And I guess to answer the heart of your question, to get back to those adoption-level reserve rates, we would need to see a sustained strengthening and the credit characteristics of those borrowers that are most at risk for the longer-term negative impacts from the pandemic, in concert with improving economic forecasts. And most importantly, those forecasts need to improve above our current expectations. So I think it will take some time."

In terms of the Ginnie Mae pools, they're becoming more and more difficult to locate. I think, as everybody has been executing on that play for their own portfolio and as we talked about, we bought back our $750 million in the third quarter of 2020. So that, combined with the fact that we're over $3 billion of product now, I think that's a healthy and appropriate allocation for our balance sheet. So I'm not looking to add more there. 
In terms of the mortgage retention, we did retain, in the fourth quarter, a $0.25 billion or so of our retail production. This quarter, we did not elect to retain anything that was salable. So we're currently selling everything that is salable and then retaining jumbo, nonconforming and other items. So I think that's -- and that, for now, would be our intention for the rest of this year."

The first quarter was very strong, and we've got the trains running on time and everything is in a good spot, as you can tell from the first quarter results. 
So in terms of the outlook for the year, we expect the mortgage originations to be up a bit, call it, mid-single digits; second quarter volumes, mid-single digits. But the headwind is going to be margin compression. So while we transition to more of a purchase environment here over the summer months, volumes should be strong, margins will compress. 
And then as those prepayments, refis slow down, we expect to see a little bit of a lift in the servicing portfolio. So it's less of a headwind and, perhaps, even a positive in the back half of the year. But net-net, I think, on a year-over-year basis, we're looking at a slight decline in both the top line and bottom line mortgage fees."

So when you look at our expense guide, as diligent as we are and as focused as we are on expenses, at the end of the day, we did raise the expense guide to 2 points.

First off, normalized line utilization for us going into the pandemic would have been 36%, 37% on an average. So obviously, with the pandemic, you saw a spike up to 40-plus-percent. 
But think about a normalized range, 36%, 37% we're running about 31% right now. So hopefully, the second half of the year is a little stronger as we anticipate to look at a bottoms-up forecast. We can pick up another 2% lift. That's a stretch out there, but we think that's doable, given what we're seeing in our pipelines just back up to 33%, which is still not the normalized level. 
If you think about each 1%, it's about $750 million of outstandings for us. So the impact of a 2% uplift by year-end is less than 1% on total loan growth for 2021, given the ramp-up throughout the year. So it's possible. But once again, I think there's a lot of variables out there that we're watching, but we are encouraged by the pipeline strength that we're seeing right now. 
Our production levels in commercial in the first quarter, we're at pre-pandemic level, so we're encouraged by that. If you look at the pipelines going forward, the forecast right now will be about 30% up in production over 2020, but slightly below pre-pandemic levels. And we're seeing good strength in manufacturing, in health care, TMT and renewables right now. 
And if you look at our markets, where we're seeing some good progress, Indiana, Michigan, California and the Carolinas would jump out as a source of strength from an asset perspective. So production is strong. Pipelines look good. We're hopeful we'll see the second -- back half of this year an improvement in line utilization. And once again, there's a lot of liquidity out there.

I had the chance since the beginning of the year to be out in 12 of our 15 different regions and to spend time with clients there. So we've been asking that question. 
And what we're hearing from them, primarily, are either supply chain disruptions. Some of that, obviously, is that some of the global dynamics that we have talked about, whether it was that stuff stuck in the canal or shortage of semiconductors, but it also is just access to materials. And then on the other side of the equation, labor shortages, in particular, as it relates to the skilled trades. And the by-product of that is we're not seeing the inventory building that you might otherwise expect to see yet. 
So we're watching inventory levels closely. We're watching the ISM index closely as leading indicators to when we may see a pickup in utilization. I think one positive note, which is reflected in the results in the first quarter, is we are seeing increased demand on the equipment side of the business. And that is encouraging because that obviously would be the other free condition to an expansion."

Our strategy, as I think we've discussed quite frequently as a primary relationship strategy, it's a focus on primary banking. It's a focus on being in a place where you get paid, on where you pay your bills and how you build up liquidity. And the by-product of that, obviously, as Jamie mentioned earlier, is we did see really positive trends in the consumer side of the business because the liquidity that consumers have built up really is in the transaction accounts as opposed to somewhere else. 
So our deposit growth on the consumer side has been underpinned by, call it, 2% to 3% household growth over a period of several years now. We would like to continue to bump that number up. And we think that the Momentum Banking products, coupled with the expansion in the Southeast, gives us a path to doing that in terms of the overall household growth rates that we experienced, which will support noninterest-bearing deposit growth. 
I think on the other side of the equation, yes, when somebody elects to use a short-term liquidity product, take our early access product, the deposit advanced product that we've had in the market for several years now, that is a lower cost way to cover a cash flow shortfall than an overdraft fee, but it's also a very sustainable way. And owing to the fact that we have had those products and our product set for several years now, our overdraft charges as a percentage of total consumer deposits are lower than all but one of the large U.S. banks already. 
So I think, from our perspective, we're giving the consumer the widest possible range of options to avoid fees. We're getting the benefit of that in the form of household growth and of primacy, which is the entry point for us to the broadest range of products and services that we offer. And because of our position on the overdraft side of the equation and the low reliance on that fee line, we have less to give up there and are going to be able to outgrow any sort of an impact on the fees per household measure."

Commercial loan production increased 10% from last quarter, with strengthened middle market across our footprint as well as in corporate banking. We generated strong consumer household growth of 4% compared to last year, and we also experienced historically low net charge-offs of 16 basis points, reflecting improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. 
We generated an adjusted ROTCE of nearly 20% for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting strong business and credit results across our franchise. Our results were supported by our continued improvement in our diversified businesses. 
In fact, we achieved record results in several of our fee-based businesses, including commercial banking and wealth and asset management. 
Despite the pressure from low interest rates, net interest income increased 3% sequentially, and the underlying NIM increased 2 basis points. 
We believe that our disciplined approach to managing the balance sheet, including in our securities and hedge portfolios, will continue to generate differentiated performance relative to peers. 
We also continue to maintain our expense discipline, while still investing for long-term outperformance. As a result of our strong revenue growth, combined with our expense management, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 58%. 
We are prioritizing investments that drive further operational efficiencies to improve our resiliency, generate household growth and improve the customer experience. To that end, we recently announced an expanded partnership with FIS to modernize our core deposit and wealth systems to the cloud, which will enable us to further our digital transformation. This will significantly improve the flexibility and scalability of our technology infrastructure and accelerate our speed to market. 
Combining this agreement with the renegotiation of our existing payment processing relationship allows us to modernize our platform, while maintaining an efficient overall cost structure. 
From a commercial standpoint, loan production this quarter was the highest since before the pandemic, with significant sequential improvements in technology, renewable energy and manufacturing. However, our strong production was once again offset by elevated paydowns and PPP forgiveness. 
While we continue to retain the customer in their core banking relationship, loan growth remains muted due to the environment. 
Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines and retention of the client relationship all continue to support the potential for improved loan growth once supply and labor constraints normalize. 
We currently expect our 31% commercial revolver utilization rate to increase 1% by year-end. 
On the consumer side, as I mentioned, we once again generated robust household growth. This strong performance reflects our ability to acquire new customers, combined with low attrition, both of which were supported by our brands and digital investments. 
Our recent Southeast de novo branches have helped contribute to our household growth. 
On the digital side, we continue to leverage technology and data analytics to deliver solutions that improve the customer experience, increase revenue and drive efficiencies. We recently launched Fifth Third Momentum banking across our footprint, a banking value proposition unparalleled in our industry. Momentum combines the best of a traditional bank offering with several leading fintech capabilities, including Early Pay, which gives customers free access to their paycheck up to 2 days early; extra time, which allows customers to [indiscernible] until midnight the following business day without a fee; MyAdvance, which gives customers short-term on-demand liquidity advances; smart savings and other features all provided with no monthly fee. 
Our strategy to keep the customer at the center has significantly reduced our reliance on cumulative consumer deposit fees, including overdraft in ATM fees where Fifth Third had been among the lowest compared to peers for several years. Fifth Third Momentum Banking accelerates our efforts to help customers avoid unnecessary fees. 
As I mentioned, during the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses, reflecting historically low net charge-offs, combined with a stronger economic outlook. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and continue support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs. 
In addition to historical low credit losses, our criticized assets and NPAs once again improved this quarter. Criticized assets declined another 16%, and our NPA ratio declined 11 basis points sequentially. 
Our balance sheet and earnings power remained very strong. Our CET1 ratio of 10.4% was relatively stable compared to last quarter, despite share repurchases of $347 million in the second quarter. 
As we have said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities, dividend increases and share repurchases. 
Additionally, our capital position and earnings capacity supported an increase in our common dividend starting in the third quarter. We currently expect to request a $0.03 increase to our quarterly dividend in September, subject to Board approval and economic conditions. 
We also expect to execute share repurchases totaling approximately [ $150 million ] in the second half of 2021 and continue to target a 9.5% CET1 by June 2022. 
We recently announced the strategic acquisition of Provide, a fintech health care practice finance firm, provide focuses on the dental, veterinarian and vision segments and delivers digital capabilities, which supported best-in-class experience and speed to close. Provide previously utilized and originate the cell. As a result, the closing of the acquisition will not include a transfer of loan balances. However, post close, Fifth Third will retain all loan originations. 
We currently hold around $400 million in loans generated by Provide and have noncredit relationships with over 70% of these borrowers through deposit and our treasury management products. The acquisition is expected to close in early August and will utilize approximately 20 basis points of capital. 
In summary, we believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on discipline throughout the company will serve us well this year and beyond. We remain committed to generating sustainable long-term value and consistently producing top quartile results. 
I would once again like to thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen on occasion to support our customers. Our commitment to generate sustainable value for stakeholders is evident in our second annual ESG report published in June. This expands on last year's report with increased transparency, including enhanced disclosures on priority topics, such as inclusion and diversity, our climate strategy and our commitment to fair and responsible banking. 
We remain guided by our purpose, vision and core values and expect to continue delivering strong results over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook."
270961,693599381,2349419,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We are very pleased with the financial results this quarter reflecting focused execution to the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses",2631,"Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We are very pleased with the financial results this quarter reflecting focused execution to the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported results for the quarter included a $37 million reduction in fee income for the negative mark related to the Visa total return swap. 
Our improved business performance throughout the bank resulted in strong return metrics. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.43% and an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of 19.7%. 
Our adjusted earnings per share were a record for the bancorp. We generated healthy PPNR results, the strongest since before the pandemic, with net interest income growing 3% sequentially, continued success growing and diversifying noninterest income and diligent expense management. 
Improvements in credit quality this quarter resulted in a $159 million release to our credit reserves, resulting in an ACL ratio of 206 basis points compared to 219 basis points last quarter. With historically low charge-offs of just 16 basis points this quarter, and an improved economic outlook, we recorded a $115 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. 
Moving to the income statement. Net interest income increased $32 million sequentially, reflecting our ability to effectively manage the balance sheet, despite the environmental headwinds from low interest rates and elevated paydowns given capital market conditions. 
Our NII growth was driven by average loan growth of 1% and $11 million of incremental prepayment penalty benefits from our bullet and locked-out cash flow strategy in our investment portfolio, which that position remains at 58% at quarter end. 
Our loan balances benefited from the additional $1 billion of Ginnie Mae forbearance loan buyout purchases in early April, bringing the total third-party purchases to $3.7 billion. The other NII benefits were from a higher day count and not replacing long-term debt maturities, partially offset by the impact of declining average commercial loan balances and lower loan yields. 
PPP-related interest income was $53 million this quarter, unchanged relative to the prior quarter. 
On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit cost by another basis point this quarter to 5 basis points and also had maturities of approximately $2.3 billion of long-term debt. 
With most deposit products at or near their assumed floors, the remaining liability management benefits going forward will likely be limited to CD and reductions in long-term debt balances due to maturities. 
Reported NIM increased 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter as the aforementioned investment portfolio, long-term debt and Ginnie Mae loan buyout impacts were partially offset by the decline in commercial loan balances and lower loan yields. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, increased 2 basis points to 312 basis points. 
With a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion in excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise, while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low given our securities portfolio and derivatives. 
Total reported noninterest income decreased just 1% sequentially. Adjusted noninterest income increased 1% driven by record commercial banking revenue, with strength in loan syndications and financial risk management products, solid card and processing revenue from higher credit and debit interchange revenue, reflecting the robust economic rebound, and an increase in both commercial and consumer deposit fees. These increases were partially offset by sequential declines in mortgage and lease syndications. 
Top line mortgage banking revenue decreased $8 million sequentially, reflecting incremental margin pressure. Production was strong during the quarter in both the retail and correspondent channels, with second quarter originations of $5 billion, up 7% sequentially. 
Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 15%, with strength in deposit service charges, commercial banking revenue, wealth and asset management and card and processing revenue, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business and the robust economic rebound over the past year. 
The performance and resilience of our fee income levels over the past several quarters highlight the benefit of the revenue diversification that we have achieved. 
Noninterest expense decreased 5% compared to the first quarter, reflecting declines in compensation and benefits expenses, lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiations and disciplined expense management throughout the bank. This was partially offset by expenses linked to strong business performance as well as servicing expenses associated with loan purchases and a $12 million mark-to-market impact from our nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which had a corresponding offset in security gains. 
For the full year, we expect to incur around $50 million in third-party servicing expense for purchased loans. Our compensation-related expense growth this year continues to be proportionate to the success we are seeing in our fee-based businesses. 
On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 15% compared to 4% expense growth. Additionally, compared to the pre-pandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019, total adjusted fees have increased 14% compared to expense growth of just 3%. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans and leases were up 1% sequentially as consumer loan growth was partially offset by a decline in commercial loans. Additionally, period-end loans were up 1%, excluding PPP. 
Average total consumer loans increased 4% as ongoing strength in the auto portfolio and the impact of Ginnie Mae loans purchased were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances, reflecting the continued impacts of government stimulus. 
Average commercial loans declined 1% compared to the prior quarter, largely driven by PPP forgiveness and elevated payoffs, which were partially offset by strong production across most of our verticals and throughout our middle market footprint. 
Production was up 10% compared to the prior quarter and up over 20% compared to the pre-pandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of PPP, our end-of-period C&I loans were up slightly sequentially, as client sentiment and business activities in several industries are showing signs of stabilization. 
Revolver utilization of 31% was flat compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the market liquidity and capital markets conditions. We are encouraged by the fact that we have successfully retained virtually all clients throughout the pandemic, which will enable us to further deepen and grow these relationships going forward. 
Average CRE loans were flat sequentially, with end-of-period balances declining 3%. Our securities portfolio increased 1% this quarter. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows, but we'll remain patient on deploying the excess cash. We will continue to be opportunistic as the economic environment evolves. 
Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. We remain optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of '21 and an eventual Fed tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk return opportunities in the future. 
Average short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, remain elevated due to continued strength in core deposit balances, which have grown 10% year-over-year. We have seen strength in both consumer and commercial deposits. Compared to the prior quarter, average core deposits increased 3%. 
About 2/3 of the balance growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis has come from consumer, reflecting continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and strong household growth. 
Moving to credit. Our strong credit performance once again this quarter reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and prudent balance sheet management, while also benefiting from continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and improvement in the broader economy. 
The second quarter net charge-off ratio of 16 basis points was historically low and improved 11 basis points sequentially. 
Nonperforming assets declined 16% or $126 million. The NPA ratio declined 11 basis points sequentially to 61 basis points, which is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Also our criticized assets declined 16%, with significant improvements in retail nonessential, leisure and health care as well as in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios. However, we continue to focus on non-owner-occupied commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels. 
Moving to the ACL. Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes the labor market continues to improve and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% by the first quarter of 2022 and ending our 3-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. 
We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million reserve release. Conversely, applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $763 million bill. 
Inclusive of the impact of approximately $108 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.15%. Additionally, excluding the $3.7 billion in PPP loans, with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.2%. 
While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. We continue to monitor the COVID situation, which could still impact many businesses, particularly those we have identified as being in highly impacted industries or reverse the rising consumer confidence trends. 
Our June 30th allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment, with lower unemployment and continued improving credit quality. 
Moving to capital. Our capital levels remained strong in the second quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.4%, which is $1.3 billion above our stated target of 9.5%. 
Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 3% during the quarter. As a Category 4 institution, Fifth Third was not subject to the latest Federal Reserve stress test, and we did not opt in. 
At the end of June, the Fed notified us that our SCB would be 2.5% effective July 1, which is the floor under the regulatory capital rules. Without the floor, our buffer would have been approximately 2.1%. 
During the quarter, we completed $347 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by approximately 9 million shares compared to the first quarter. As Greg mentioned, we expect to repurchase approximately $850 million of shares in the second half of 2021, while also increasing our common dividend in September. 
We also announced our acquisition of Provide this quarter. We will utilize approximately 20 basis points of CET1 upon closing. This financially compelling acquisition of an asset-generation engine dovetails perfectly with our existing strategic focus on digital enablement and generating profitable growth on our balance sheet. 
We believe in Provide's strong growth prospects. From an origination standpoint, they've produced $300 million in the first half of 2021, of which Fifth Third purchased approximately 80%. We expect second half originations to be around $400 million, and given the expected early August closing, virtually all of that will go on our balance sheet. 
We expect over $1 billion in originations in 2022, and  could grow to over $2 billion annually within a few years. 
Moving to our current outlook. For the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable compared to last year, reflecting continued pressure from PPP forgiveness and paydowns in commercial, combined with low double-digit growth in consumer. 
We continue to expect CRE balances to remain stable in this environment. We continue to expect our underlying NIM to be in the 305 basis point area for the full year. Combined with our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% this year, assuming stable security balances and incorporating all PPP impacts. 
On a sequential basis, we expect NII to decline around 2% given the impact of the securities portfolio prepayment income we experienced in the second quarter that we do not assume will repeat in our outlook as well as an assumed decline in PPP income. 
Within our NII guidance, we expect approximately $165 million in PPP-related interest income for 2021, of which $106 million was realized in the first half of the year, compared to $100 million in 2020 and approximately $50 million expected in 2022. 
For the third quarter of 2021, we expect approximately $40 million in PPP income. Therefore, excluding PPP impacts, we would expect third quarter NII to decline around 1% compared to the second quarter or up over 2% from the third quarter of 2020. 
Given the continued strength throughout our businesses, we expect full year fees to increase 7% to 8% compared to 2020 or 8% to 9% excluding the impact of the TRA. Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy as well as our ongoing success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger processing revenue, capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be partially offset by mortgage declines. 
Additionally, as we discussed in January, we expect to generate private equity gains from several of our direct investments in venture capital funds throughout 2021, potentially exceeding the 2020 level of $75 million. We have recognized around $30 million in gains through the first half of 2021, which we expect to double in the second half of 2021. 
We expect third quarter total fees to be relatively stable from the second quarter and would be up mid- to high-single digits year-over-year. 
In the mortgage business, we expect revenue throughout the second half of the year to benefit from lower asset decay and higher servicing fees. The top line revenue is expected to decline high single digits year-over-year due to continued headwinds from margin compression. 
Our fee outlook does not incorporate a pretax gain of approximately $60 million associated with the sale of our HSA business that is expected to close in the third quarter. 
We do plan to redeploy half of that gain in the third quarter, split evenly between a $15 million donation to the Fifth Third Foundation that will complete our previously announced philanthropy commitment to accelerating racial equality and inclusion in our communities and a $15 million additional marketing program, supporting momentum given the upside potential we see in that product. 
We expect full year expenses to be up 2% to 3% given our strong revenue outlook and the continued servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases as well as the incremental expenses associated with the Provide acquisition. 
On a sequential basis, we expect expenses to be down 1%, excluding the redeployment of half of the HSA gain. As we recently discussed, we expect to consolidate 42 branches, primarily in our legacy Midwest footprint, which we expect to complete in early 2022. 
Additionally, we've opened 5 branches so far this year and plan to add approximately 25 more Southeast in-market de novo branches in the second half of 2021. All run rate branch impacts are included in our outlook. 
We generated year-over-year positive operating leverage this quarter, and we expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage for the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management. 
We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be 20 to 25 basis points given the strong first half performance and assuming our base case scenario continues to play out. Third quarter losses are likely to be in the 15 to 20 basis point range. 
In summary, our second quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us well during this environment. 
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A."

The one thing we are proud of at Fifth Third is how much we've reduced our exposure on the consumer side from a punitive fee standpoint and how we are, I would say, a very consumer-focused and consumer-friendly bank. 
I think 3% or so of our revenue is in consumer overdrafts, and our peers are significantly higher than those levels. We expect to continue to improve upon that with the Momentum bank offering and some of the features that Greg talked about in his prepared remarks. 
So I think you can continue to expect that from us and that if we were to have any future changes on overdraft policies or fees, it would only be to the positive and that we would more than make up for it with the incremental volume from momentum.

First off, it's -- right now, there's just a lot of uncertainty out there right now, as we're dealing with the labor shortage and the supply chain disruptions, which are extremely real that you see across the board in all conversations with our customers. 
But with that said, our -- we're back to pretty much prepandemic level production numbers, but payoffs continues to be stale. And obviously, you've got some of the headwind with the PPP. 
So when you think about the environment in front of us, I think loan growth is going to continue to be a challenge as we go through the rest of the year. I think we offset that by our strength from our fee businesses, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, to compensate for some of those challenges. 
But I do think this changes over time. If you think about [indiscernible] every 1% is $750 million. So there's a lot of upside opportunity there. 
At some point, labor shortage and supply chain constraints start to abate if we pick up the benefit of that. 
We also added about $2.4 million in new commitments since the beginning of the year and continue to acquire new households and commercial relationships. So we're very, very positive that's what the future might hold. When we get some economic and some environmental challenges in front of us that we have to continue to deal with."

How are you sort of thinking about the steady state? Is it back to where we were in CECL day 1. Or just given the backdrop and what we've already got through, can we kind of blow through that a little bit on -- meaning go lower than that? How do you think about those dynamics?"

When you look at the quarter, with the ACL release of $159 million, we had that split fairly evenly between the consumer portfolio and the commercial portfolio. And the decline was essentially driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook prior -- versus the prior quarter. 
When you look ahead, we continue to overweight non-baseline scenarios at 20%. So the upside is 20%. The base is 60% and the downside is 20%, and that's really driven by the uncertainty in the environment, including the vaccine efficacy. And frankly, this week's concerns highlight that risk. 
So when you look at the asymmetrical nature of the upside and downside scenarios that weighting versus the 80-10-10 on CECL day 1 generates about a $90 million higher reserve. 
So I guess, the first part to your fairly complicated question is that the scenario weightings do matter, and we expect to maintain the 60-20-20, while this period of uncertainty continues to exist. 
And then relative to day 1, it really is a tale of 2 portfolios. So when you look at the commercial side, to get back to those day 1 adoption reserve rates, you really do need to see a sustained strengthening in the credit characteristics of the borrowers that are most at risk to the longer-term negative impacts from the pandemic. And so that would have to occur in conjunction with improving economic forecast above our current expectations. 
But then when you look at the consumer side, we're actually already below the CECL day 1 level. We're at [ 199 ] at the end of the second quarter versus the [ 246 ] on CECL day 1, and that's driven by the combination of the loan mix as well as improvements in real estate and auto collateral values experienced since the adoption of CECL as well as the economic forecast at the end of the second quarter. 
And then we've had improvement in credit quality in auto and card as well as in the delinquency rate. So consumer is already there. But commercial, again, we'd have to have things play out differently than what we -- better than what we currently expect."

That's a lot there, so let me try and dissect a little bit for you.

That's a lot there, so let me try and dissect a little bit for you. 
First off, the FIS announcement we just made is a continuation of a relationship that's been in place for quite some time is a replacement of our WAM to our core deposit platforms. But we've been on this journey to reengineer our technical infrastructure, focusing on the actual resiliency and the scale both of our businesses, replace our HR platform with Workday. 
We completed our enterprise data strategy. We've completely replatformed the mortgage LOS environment. So the FIS is the natural extension of the continuation of the modernization of those activities. 
We also reengineered and restructured the pricing agreement of our legacy relationship with FIS. That's going to make help that -- the cost associated with that implementation of the new FIS components a lot more reasonable, digestible for us. We'll manage our costs going forward. So we're pretty pleased with the way that came out. 
As far as a competitive advantage, listen, I think at the end of the day, this is a long game. We have to continue to refresh our platforms. We got to continue to modernize our platforms to the cloud. I think every bank is trying to get this right. 
So whether it comes to competitive advantage or not, I think it's a requirement, and it's basically table stakes to be in the business to be a digital bank. Our customers expect to bank anywhere at any time. We have to have platforms that are always on. So that's just a retransformation of our business. 
We have to repurpose our expense dollars from the legacy brick-and-mortar infrastructure, and we've got to continue to reinvest in technology. So we're going to continue to do that. And I think the banks will continue to do that are going to be a competitive disadvantage. 
But many banks, as you've already heard, who are continuing to focus on core modernization were going to be doing the same thing. We think we have a great strategy for that modernization and for bringing in new technologies. We have a buy-partner-build strategy that we've worked on very hard. If the technology is already out there, we buy. If we can't buy it, we partner. And if we can't partner, we build it and Momentum is an example of that. 
Partnerships like GreenSky and OutExchange, Date systems, CommonBond, get out of the list in our recent acquisition of provide. So we -- I think we've got a good strategy for moving quickly, but it is going to take time to get all the legacy stuff platform. But net-net, once again, I think it's -- may not be a competitive advantage at the end of the day, but definitely it will be a requirement to be in this business in the future."

I'm happy to take that one. So health care was the right starting point for us. It's the first industry vertical that we launched here over a decade ago, and we have a vertically integrated strategy on that front across our corporate banking group. Our middle market banking grew out in the regions and now also business banking. 
I think Provide was an important next step for us in the strategy because it gave us the opportunity to provide a differentiated value proposition to independent medical practices, like Greg mentioned, with a big focus on dentists, vets and otherwise. And Provide is a little bit unique in that it had, as a fintech company, actually already grown into one of the largest lenders into that market, primarily by their technology and their expertise. 
And just as a point of example there, the digital experience that they offer enables them to get loans approved and closed about 70% faster than a typical lending process within that market. 
And in addition, because of the sector focus, they have a growing digital marketplace that actually allows existing practice owners who would like to transition into retirement to post their practices for sale and to get connected with folks who are interested in buying an established practice. 
So functions, I guess, a little bit like the Craig's List or the eBay of dental practices today. 
Are there opportunities in other verticals? Yes, we do think there are, and we have been pretty active, as Greg mentioned, in partnering with many of those firms. Whether those relationships evolve from a partnership into an outright acquisition, I think it depends a lot on the circumstances of the business at a given point in time. 
But in the case of Provide, their next leg of the growth journey was going to be about the delivery of the broad, the full set of products and services. And it absolutely makes sense for them to be part of the bank as opposed to a stand-alone entity on that journey."

We",431,"Yes. I think if you look back at our actions in the first quarter, to answer the second part of your question, if you look back at our first quarter actions, we did lag into a little bit of additional investment portfolio buildup at that point in time. We preinvested $1 billion of our second quarter cash flows. And then given the entry points and the rally in the bond market decided to maintain that additional leverage throughout the quarter. 
So we did grow the book a little bit in the second quarter. Our guide assumes we hold it fairly stable as the year progresses because we don't expect to get to those 2% or better entry points. But should the market get there, we would lag into the trade and not do everything all at once. 
But when you look at our additional $30 billion of excess liquidity that we're sitting on, we've earmarked about 1/3 of that to go into the investment portfolio. So to get $10 billion of purchases done would certainly take some time, and we've ramped that up over time. 
And our goal here is we sit through peer results and actions versus ours, and we certainly are an outlier in terms of being, I think, more prudent and more cautious at deploying at these low rates. Our goal is let's maximize our NII over the next 5 years, not over the next 12 months. And we think, ultimately, that this is the better outcome. 
And the Fed will eventually taper. Not sure when that will be, but we're the largest bond buyer in the world as price and discriminate in their purchases every month, but certainly distorts the market. So eventually, that distortion is going to end, and we think we'll get better entry points than what we see today. 
And then in terms of the first part of your question, the growth in the yield this quarter in the investment portfolio is really the benefit of what we did 5 years ago, with structuring the portfolio to be more weighted to bullet and locked-out cash flows, so that to the extent there are prepayments in the portfolio, the make-whole provisions provide a nice pickup in investment yield. 
And as we -- we never include those in our outlook, so that the guide on NII might look soft on the surface, but if things continue to be the same, then, obviously, NII will outperform the guide should those prepayment penalties continue to occur. We're sitting on almost $2 billion in gains in the investment portfolio."

You're seeing that in backlogs, order delays, restaurants not being able to be open, small businesses not open full time, can't get labor, so it's a big challenge right now. And when does that start to update? When does that start to correct itself? And I'm not sure when that is. 
I believe it will happen, obviously. But to what is the essence? Later this year? Is it next year? So I think that's going to pull a lot of pressure. 
Inventory levels are extremely low compared to what the demand that is out there. We're not seeing that tick up right now. Line utilization is kind of flattened right now, but we're not seeing that tick up that we were hoping to see. 
So those are all kind of concerns that I have right now. Obviously, inflation is another concern out there as we watch that and how the Fed manages through that complexity and more to come on that.

I think the growth, if you look at new client relationships and otherwise, is very strong in the commercial business in the Southeast. So they are contributing disproportionately to the incremental fee income. 
But I wouldn't tell you that it is focused exclusively on the Southeast. If you look at our new commercial relationships, about 30% of them this year are lead with treasury management. And then there's another percentage, which I don't have off the top of my head, but which has come to us primarily through the capital markets business. 
So we are having good success using those products as wedge opportunities to drive new relationships. If you look forward, I think we're trying to build what is a really nicely diversified capital markets business with low activities, like rates and commodities hedging and otherwise, to complement the M&A advisory business and what we do in equities, with what we do on the bond market. 
I mean, what we continue to anticipate is at some point here, the capital markets will be a little bit less accommodative. We'll get the benefit of that in loan balances, but you'll see some lightening on bond fees. 
But the other side of it is we're sitting on an M&A pipeline now, which is almost double what it was in January 1 of this year. So we do have a nice M&A advisory pipeline that should come behind it. 
On the treasury management side, we've pretty consistently grown at the rate of the industry, plus 2 to 3 percentage points. I am of the belief that we can do better than that, but it's definitely better to be taking share there over time than it is to have the alternative situation.

The bigger economic opportunity is on the $750 million of forbearance loans that we bought directly back from Ginnie Mae on our own production as well as within our resi mortgage portfolio. 
To the extent that there are any nonaccrual or delinquents that cure, we do have -- we have had sales this year that generate several million dollars in fees, and we expect to do that over the next 6, 7 quarters as well. So I think it's more of a run rate normal course of business than it is any onetime pop."

And then we do feel that should loan growth accelerates, we certainly have a buffer from where we think we need to run the company from a capital perspective.

The second quarter was obviously very strong from a margin perspective, and we're pleased with how the balance sheet has been performing. 
But given the high levels of PPP as well as the investment securities prepayment penalties that we don't expect to recur, or at least don't forecast to recur, we would expect to see the NIM decline a bit to a more normalized level, which is that 305 basis point area is what we've talked about, I think, pretty much all year in terms of what we think this balance sheet should stabilize that certainly for the foreseeable future. 
So NIM should come down, call it, 5 bps or so in the third quarter. I would say the big drivers there, certainly, the PPP, the prepayment penalties, a little bit of day count and otherwise still maintain that floor of [ 305 ] or better."

Earlier today, we reported second quarter net income of $709 million or $0.94 per share. On an adjusted basis, we earned $0.98 per share. Once again, our financial results were very strong,",1153,"Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported second quarter net income of $709 million or $0.94 per share. On an adjusted basis, we earned $0.98 per share. Once again, our financial results were very strong, continuing the positive momentum from the past several quarters.
During the quarter, we generated sequential PPNR growth of 15% on an adjusted basis and growth of 6% compared to the year ago quarter. Commercial loan production increased 10% from last quarter, with strength in middle market across our footprint as well as in corporate banking. We generated strong consumer household growth of 4% compared to last year, and we also experienced historically low net charge-offs of 16 basis points, reflecting improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios.
We generated an adjusted ROTCE of nearly 20% for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting strong business and credit results across the franchise. Our results were supported by our continued improvement in our diversified businesses. In fact, we achieved record results in several of our fee-based businesses, including commercial banking and wealth and asset management.
Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, net interest income increased 3% sequentially, and the underlying NIM increased 2 basis points. We believe that our disciplined approach to managing the balance sheet, including in our securities and hedge portfolios, will continue to generate differentiated performance relative to peers.
We also continue to maintain our expense discipline while still investing for long-term outperformance. As a result of our strong revenue growth, combined with our expense management, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 58%.
We are prioritizing investments that drive further operational efficiencies to improve our resiliency, generate household growth and improve the customer experience. To that end, we recently announced an expanded partnership with FIS to modernize our core deposit and wealth systems to the cloud, which will enable us to further our digital transformation. This will significantly improve the flexibility and scalability of our technology infrastructure and accelerate our speed to market. Combining this agreement with the renegotiation of our existing payment processing relationship allows us to modernize our platforms while maintaining an efficient overall cost structure.
From a commercial standpoint, loan production this quarter was at highest since before the pandemic, with significant sequential improvements in technology, renewable energy and manufacturing. However, our strong production was once again offset by elevated paydowns and PPP forgiveness. While we continue to retain the customer in their core banking relationship, loan growth remains muted due to the environment. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines and retention of the client relationship all continue to support the potential for improved loan growth once supply and labor constraints normalize. We currently expect our 31% commercial revolver utilization rate to increase 1% by year-end.
On the consumer side, as I mentioned, we once again generated robust household growth. This strong performance reflects our ability to acquire new customers, combined with low attrition, both of which were supported by our brands and digital investments. Our recent Southeast de novo branches have helped contribute to our household growth.
On the digital side, we continue to leverage technology and data analytics to deliver solutions that improve the customer experience, increase revenue and drive efficiencies. We recently launched Fifth Third Momentum Banking across our footprint, a banking value proposition unparalleled in our industry. Momentum combines the best of a traditional bank offering with several leading fintech capabilities, including: Early Pay, which gives customers free access to their paycheck up to 2 days early; Extra Time, which allows customers secure an overdraft until midnight the following business day without a fee; MyAdvance, which gives customers short-term on-demand liquidity advances; smart savings; and other features, all provided with no monthly fee. Our strategy to keep the customer at the center has significantly reduced our reliance on punitive consumer deposit fees, including overdrafts and ATM fees where Fifth Third has been among the lowest compared to peers for several years. Fifth Third Momentum Banking accelerates our efforts to help customers avoid unnecessary fees.
As I mentioned, during the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses, reflecting historically low net charge-offs, combined with a stronger economic outlook. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs.
In addition to historical low credit losses, our criticized assets and NPAs once again improved this quarter. Criticized assets declined another 16%, and our NPA ratio declined 11 basis points sequentially.
Our balance sheet and earnings power remained very strong. Our CET1 ratio of 10.4% was relatively stable compared to last quarter, despite share repurchases of $347 million in the second quarter. As we have said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities, dividend increases and share repurchases.
Additionally, our capital position and earnings capacity support an increase in our common dividend starting in the third quarter. We currently expect to request a $0.03 increase to our quarterly dividend in September, subject to Board approval and economic conditions. We also expect to execute share repurchases totaling approximately $850 million in the second half of 2021 and continue to target a 9.5% CET1 by June 2022.
We recently announced the strategic acquisition of Provide, a fintech health care practice finance firm. Provide focuses on the dental, veterinarian and vision segments and delivers digital capabilities, with supported best-in-class experience and speed to close. Provide previously utilized and originate the [indiscernible]. As a result, the closing of the acquisition will not include a transfer of loan balances. However, post close, Fifth Third will retain all loan originations. We currently hold around $400 million in loans generated by Provide and have noncredit relationships with over 70% of these borrowers through deposit and our treasury management products. The acquisition is expected to close in early August and will utilize approximately 20 basis points of capital.
In summary, we believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on discipline throughout the company will serve us well this year and beyond. We remain committed to generating sustainable long-term value and consistently producing top quartile results.
I would once again like to thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers. Our commitment to generate sustainable value for stakeholders is evident in our second annual ESG report published in June. This expands on last year's report with increased transparency, including enhanced disclosures on priority topics, such as inclusion and diversity, our climate strategy and our commitment to fair and responsible banking.
We remain guided by our purpose, vision and core values and expect to continue delivering strong results over the long term. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook."

We are very pleased with the financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both",2632,"Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We are very pleased with the financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported results for the quarter included a $37 million reduction in fee income for the negative mark related to the Visa total return swap.
Our improved business performance throughout the bank resulted in strong return metrics. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.43% and an adjusted ROTCE, excluding AOCI, of 19.7%.
Our adjusted earnings per share were a record for the Bancorp. We generated healthy PPNR results, the strongest since before the pandemic, with net interest income growing 3% sequentially, continued success growing and diversifying noninterest income and diligent expense management.
Improvements in credit quality this quarter resulted in a $159 million release to our credit reserves, resulting in an ACL ratio of 206 basis points compared to 219 basis points last quarter. With historically low charge-offs of just 16 basis points this quarter and an improved economic outlook, we recorded a $115 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses.
Moving to the income statement. Net interest income increased $32 million sequentially, reflecting our ability to effectively manage the balance sheet despite the environmental headwinds from low interest rates and elevated paydowns given capital market conditions. Our NII growth was driven by average loan growth of 1% and $11 million of incremental prepayment penalty benefits from our bullet and locked-out cash flow strategy in our investment portfolio, which that position remains at 58% at quarter end.
Our loan balances benefited from the additional $1 billion of Ginnie Mae forbearance loan buyout purchases in early April, bringing the total third-party purchases to $3.7 billion. The other NII benefits were from a higher day count and not replacing long-term debt maturities partially offset by the impact of declining average commercial loan balances and lower loan yields. PPP-related interest income was $53 million this quarter, unchanged relative to the prior quarter.
On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit cost by another basis point this quarter to 5 basis points and also had maturities of approximately $2.3 billion of long-term debt. With most deposit products at or near their assumed floors, the remaining liability management benefits going forward will likely be limited to CDs and reductions in long-term debt balances due to maturities.
Reported NIM increased 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter as the aforementioned investment portfolio, long-term debt and Ginnie Mae loan buyout impacts were partially offset by the decline in commercial loan balances and lower loan yields. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, increased 2 basis points to 312 basis points. With a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion in excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low given our securities portfolio and derivatives.
Total reported noninterest income decreased just 1% sequentially. Adjusted noninterest income increased 1% driven by record commercial banking revenue, with strength in loan syndications and financial risk management products, solid card and processing revenue from higher credit and debit interchange revenue, reflecting the robust economic rebound, and an increase in both commercial and consumer deposit fees. These increases were partially offset by sequential declines in mortgage and lease syndications.
Top line mortgage banking revenue decreased $8 million sequentially, reflecting incremental margin pressure. Production was strong during the quarter in both the retail and correspondent channels, with second quarter originations of $5 billion, up 7% sequentially.
Compared to the year ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 15%, with strength in deposit service charges, commercial banking revenue, wealth and asset management and card and processing revenue, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business and the robust economic rebound over the past year. The performance and resilience of our fee income levels over the past several quarters highlight the benefit of the revenue diversification that we have achieved.
Noninterest expense decreased 5% compared to the first quarter, reflecting declines in compensation and benefits expenses, lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiations and disciplined expense management throughout the bank. This was partially offset by expenses linked to strong business performance as well as servicing expenses associated with loan purchases and a $12 million mark-to-market impact from our nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which had a corresponding offset in security gains. For the full year, we expect to incur around $50 million in third-party servicing expense for purchased loans.
Our compensation-related expense growth this year continues to be proportionate to the success we are seeing in our fee-based businesses. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 15% compared to 4% expense growth. Additionally, compared to the prepandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019, total adjusted fees have increased 14% compared to expense growth of just 3%.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans and leases were up 1% sequentially as consumer loan growth was partially offset by a decline in commercial loans. Additionally, period-end loans were up 1%, excluding PPP.
Average total consumer loans increased 4% as ongoing strength in the auto portfolio and the impact of Ginnie Mae loans purchased were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances, reflecting the continued impacts of government stimulus. Average commercial loans declined 1% compared to the prior quarter, largely driven by PPP forgiveness and elevated payoffs, which were partially offset by strong production across most of our verticals and throughout our middle market footprint.
Production was up 10% compared to the prior quarter and up over 20% compared to the prepandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of PPP, our end-of-period C&I loans were up slightly sequentially, as client sentiment and business activities in several industries are showing signs of stabilization.
Revolver utilization of 31% was flat compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the market liquidity and capital markets conditions. We are encouraged by the fact that we have successfully retained virtually all clients throughout the pandemic, which will enable us to further deepen and grow these relationships going forward.
Average CRE loans were flat sequentially, with end-of-period balances declining 3%. Our securities portfolio increased 1% this quarter. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows, but we'll remain patient on deploying the excess cash. We will continue to be opportunistic as the economic environment evolves. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. We remain optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of 2021 and an eventual Fed tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk return opportunities in the future.
Average short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, remain elevated due to continued strength in core deposit balances, which have grown 10% year-over-year. We have seen strength in both consumer and commercial deposits. Compared to the prior quarter, average core deposits increased 3%. About 2/3 of the balance growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis has come from consumer, reflecting continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and strong household growth.
Moving to credit. Our strong credit performance once again this quarter reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and prudent balance sheet management while also benefiting from continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and improvement in the broader economy. The second quarter net charge-off ratio of 16 basis points was historically low and improved 11 basis points sequentially.
Nonperforming assets declined 16% or $126 million. The NPA ratio declined 11 basis points sequentially to 61 basis points, which is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2019.
Also, our criticized assets declined 16%, with significant improvements in retail nonessential, leisure and health care as well as in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios. However, we continue to focus on nonowner-occupied commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels.
Moving to the ACL. Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes the labor market continues to improve and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% by the first quarter of 2022 and ending our 3-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. 
We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million reserve release. Conversely, applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $763 million bill.
Inclusive of the impact of approximately $108 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.15%. Additionally, excluding the $3.7 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.22%.
While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. We continue to monitor the COVID situation, which could still impact many businesses, particularly those we have identified as being in highly impacted industries or reverse the rising consumer confidence trends. Our June 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment, with lower unemployment and continued improving credit quality.
Moving to capital. Our capital levels remained strong in the second quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.4%, which is $1.3 billion above our stated target of 9.5%. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 3% during the quarter.
As a Category IV institution, Fifth Third was not subject to the latest Federal Reserve stress test, and we did not opt in. At the end of June, the Fed notified us that our SCB would be 2.5% effective July 1, which is the floor under the regulatory capital rules. Without the floor, our buffer would have been approximately 2.1%.
During the quarter, we completed $347 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by approximately 9 million shares compared to the first quarter. As Greg mentioned, we expect to repurchase approximately $850 million of shares in the second half of 2021, while also increasing our common dividend in September.
We also announced our acquisition of Provide this quarter. We will utilize approximately 20 basis points of CET1 upon closing. This financially compelling acquisition of an asset-generation engine dovetails perfectly with our existing strategic focus on digital enablement and generating profitable growth on our balance sheet.
We believe in Provide's strong growth prospects. From an origination standpoint, they've produced $300 million in the first half of 2021, of which Fifth Third purchased approximately 80%. We expect second half originations to be around $400 million, and given the expected early August closing, virtually all of that will go on our balance sheet. We expect over $1 billion in originations in 2022 and could grow to over $2 billion annually within a few years.
Moving to our current outlook. For the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable compared to last year, reflecting continued pressure from PPP forgiveness and paydowns in commercial, combined with low double-digit growth in consumer. We continue to expect CRE balances to remain stable in this environment.
We continue to expect our underlying NIM to be in the 305 basis point area for the full year. Combined with our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% this year, assuming stable security balances and incorporating all PPP impacts.
On a sequential basis, we expect NII to decline around 2% given the impact of the securities portfolio prepayment income we experienced in the second quarter that we do not assume will repeat in our outlook as well as an assumed decline in PPP income. Within our NII guidance, we expect approximately $165 million in PPP-related interest income for 2021, of which $106 million was realized in the first half of the year, compared to $100 million in 2020 and approximately $50 million expected in 2022. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect approximately $40 million in PPP income. Therefore, excluding PPP impacts, we would expect third quarter NII to decline around 1% compared to the second quarter or up over 2% from the third quarter of 2020.
Given the continued strength throughout our businesses, we expect full year fees to increase 7% to 8% compared to 2020 or 8% to 9% excluding the impact of the TRA. Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy as well as our ongoing success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger processing revenue, capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be partially offset by mortgage declines.
Additionally, as we discussed in January, we expect to generate private equity gains from several of our direct investments in venture capital funds throughout 2021, potentially exceeding the 2020 level of $75 million. We have recognized around $30 million in gains through the first half of 2021, which we expect to double in the second half of 2021.
We expect third quarter total fees to be relatively stable from the second quarter and would be up mid- to high-single digits year-over-year. In the mortgage business, we expect revenue throughout the second half of the year to benefit from lower asset decay and higher servicing fees. The top line revenue is expected to decline high single digits year-over-year due to continued headwinds from margin compression.
Our fee outlook does not incorporate a pretax gain of approximately $60 million associated with the sale of our HSA business that is expected to close in the third quarter. We do plan to redeploy half of that gain in the third quarter, split evenly between a $15 million donation to the Fifth Third Foundation that will complete our previously announced philanthropy commitment to accelerating racial equality and inclusion in our communities and a $15 million additional marketing program supporting Momentum given the upside potential we see in that product.
We expect full year expenses to be up 2% to 3% given our strong revenue outlook and the continued servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases as well as the incremental expenses associated with the Provide acquisition. On a sequential basis, we expect expenses to be down 1%, excluding the redeployment of half of the HSA gain.
As we recently discussed, we expect to consolidate 42 branches, primarily in our legacy Midwest footprint, which we expect to complete in early 2022. Additionally, we've opened 5 branches so far this year and plan to add approximately 25 more Southeast in-market de novo branches in the second half of 2021. All run rate branch impacts are included in our outlook.
We generated year-over-year positive operating leverage this quarter, and we expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage for the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management.
We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be 20 to 25 basis points given the strong first half performance and assuming our base case scenario continues to play out. Third quarter losses are likely to be in the 15 to 20 basis point range.
In summary, our second quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A."

The one thing we are proud of at Fifth Third is how much we've reduced our exposure on the consumer side from a punitive fee standpoint and how we are, I would say, a very consumer-focused and consumer-friendly bank. I think 3% or so of our revenue is in consumer overdrafts, and our peers are significantly higher than those levels. We expect to continue to improve upon that with the Momentum bank offering and some of the features that Greg talked about in his prepared remarks.
So I think you can continue to expect that from us and that if we were to have any future changes on overdraft policies or fees, it would only be to the positive and that we would more than make up for it with the incremental volume from Momentum.

First off, it's -- right now, there's just a lot of uncertainty out there right now, as we're dealing with the labor shortages and the supply chain disruptions, which are extremely real, and you see that across the board and all conversations with our customers. But with that said, our -- we're back to pretty much prepandemic level production numbers. But payoffs continues to be stout. And obviously, you've got some of the headwind with PPP.
So when you think about the environment in front of us, I think loan growth is going to continue to be a challenge as we go through the rest of the year. I think we will offset that by our strength from our fee businesses, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, to compensate for some of those challenges.
But I do think this changes over time. When you think about line utilization at 31% [indiscernible] every 1% is $750 million. So there's a lot of upside opportunity there. At some point, labor shortage and supply chain constraints start to abate, and we'd pick up the benefit of that.
We also added about $2.4 million in new commitments since the beginning of the year and continue to acquire new households and commercial relationships. So we're very, very positive as to what the future might hold. But we got some economic and some environmental challenges in front of us that we have to continue to deal with."

When you look at the quarter, with the ACL release of $159 million, we had that split fairly evenly between the consumer portfolio and the commercial portfolio. And the decline was essentially driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook prior -- versus the prior quarter.
When you look ahead, we continue to overweight non-baseline scenarios at 20%. So the upside is 20%. The base is 60% and the downside is 20%, and that's really driven by the uncertainty in the environment, including the vaccine efficacy. And frankly, this week's concerns highlight that risk.
So when you look at the asymmetrical nature of the upside and downside scenarios, that weighting versus the 80-10-10 on CECL day 1 generates about a $90 million higher reserve. So I guess the first part to your fairly complicated question is that the scenario weightings do matter, and we expect to maintain the 60-20-20 while this period of uncertainty continues to exist.
And then relative to day 1, it really is a tale of 2 portfolios. So when you look at the commercial side, to get back to those day 1 adoption reserve rates, you really do need to see a sustained strengthening in the credit characteristics of the borrowers that are most at risk to the longer-term negative impacts from the pandemic. And so that would have to occur in conjunction with improving economic forecast above our current expectations.
But then when you look at the consumer side, we're actually already below the CECL day 1 level. We're at 1 99 at the end of the second quarter versus the 2 46 on CECL day 1, and that's driven by the combination of the loan mix as well as improvements in real estate and auto collateral values experienced since the adoption of CECL as well as the economic forecast at the end of the second quarter. And then we've had improvement in credit quality in auto and card as well as in the delinquency rate. So consumer is already there. But commercial, again, we'd have to have things play out differently than what we -- better than what we currently expect."

So let me try and dissect a little bit for you.

That's a lot there. So let me try and dissect a little bit for you. First off, the FIS announcement we just made is a continuation of a relationship that's been in place for quite some time, this replacement of our WIM to our core deposit platforms. But we've been on this journey to reengineer our technical infrastructure, focusing on the actual resiliency and the scale of our businesses, replace our HR platform with Workday. We completed our enterprise data strategy. We've completely replatformed our mortgage LOS environment. So the FIS is the natural extension of the continuation of the modernization of those activities.
We also reengineered and restructured the pricing agreement of our legacy relationship with FIS. That's going to make help that -- the cost associated with that implementation of the new FIS components a lot more reasonable, digestible for us, and we'll manage our costs going forward. So we're pretty pleased with the way that came out.
As far as the competitive advantage, listen, I think at the end of the day, this is a long game. We have to continue to refresh our platforms. We got to continue to modernize our platforms to the cloud. I think every bank is trying to get this right.
So whether it becomes a competitive advantage or not, I think it's a requirement, and it's basically table stakes to be in the business -- to be a digital bank. Our customers expect to bank anywhere, anytime. We have to have platforms that are always on. So that's just a retransformation of our business.
We have to repurpose our expense dollars from the legacy brick-and-mortar infrastructure, and we've got to continue to reinvest in technology. So we're going to continue to do that. And I think the banks who don't do that are going to be at a competitive disadvantage. But many banks, as you've already heard, are continuing to focus on core modernization. We're going to be doing the same thing.
We think we have a great strategy for that modernization and for bringing in new technologies. We had a buy-partner-build strategy that we've worked on very hard. And if the technology is already out there, we buy. If we can't buy it, we partner. And if we can't partner, we build it, and Momentum is an example of that.
We have partnerships like GreenSky and [indiscernible] data systems, CommonBond, get down the list, and our recent acquisition of Provide. So we -- I think we've got a good strategy for moving quickly, but it is going to take time to get all the legacy stuff replatformed. But net-net, once again, I think it's -- may not be a competitive advantage at the end of the day, but definitely a requirement to be in this business in the future."

So health care was the right starting point for us.

I'm happy to take that one. So health care was the right starting point for us. It's the first industry vertical that we launched here over a decade ago, and we have a vertically integrated strategy on that front across our corporate banking group, our middle market banking group out in the regions and now also business banking.
I think Provide was an important next step for us in the strategy because it gave us the opportunity to provide a differentiated value proposition to independent medical practices, like Greg mentioned, with a big focus on dentists, vets and otherwise. And Provide is a little bit unique in that it had, as a fintech company, actually already grown into one of the largest lenders into that market, driven primarily by their technology and their expertise. And just as a point of example there, the digital experience that they offer enables them to get loans approved and closed about 70% faster than a typical lending process within that market.
And in addition, because of the sector focus, they have a growing digital marketplace that actually allows existing practice owners who would like to transition into retirement to post their practices for sale and to get connected with folks who are interested in buying an established practice. So functions, I guess, a little bit like the Craigslist or the eBay of dental practices today.
Are there opportunities in other verticals? Yes, we do think there are, and we have been pretty active, as Greg mentioned, in partnering with many of those firms. Whether those relationships evolve from a partnership into an outright acquisition, I think it depends a lot on the circumstances of the business at a given point in time. 
But in the case of Provide, their next leg of the growth journey was going to be about the delivery of the broad, the full set of products and services. And it absolutely makes sense for them to be part of the bank as opposed to a stand-alone entity on that journey."

On the securities portfolio, can you share with us -- I saw the yield, as you presented in your deck, increased sequentially, and I was wondering how you achieved that in this rate environment. Was it due to the derivatives and hedges you have on the books?
And then second, I think you said that, obviously, you're going to keep your -- keep the liquidity in the portfolio until rates start to rise. I think you may have mentioned the 2% rate. Would you lean into it as rates were to go to 2% if they do? Or would you wait until we actually got to 2% before you really move?"

I think if you look back at our actions in the first quarter -- to answer the second part of your question, if you look back at our first quarter actions, we did lag into a little bit of additional investment portfolio buildup at that point in time.",431,"Yes. I think if you look back at our actions in the first quarter -- to answer the second part of your question, if you look back at our first quarter actions, we did lag into a little bit of additional investment portfolio buildup at that point in time. We preinvested $1 billion of our second quarter cash flows and then, given the entry points and the rally in the bond market, decided to maintain that additional leverage throughout the quarter.
So we did grow the book a little bit in the second quarter. Our guide assumes we hold it fairly stable as the year progresses because we don't expect to get to those 2% or better entry points. But should the market get there, we would lag into the trade and not do everything all at once.
But when you look at our additional $30 billion of excess liquidity that we're sitting on, we've earmarked about 1/3 of that to go into the investment portfolio. So to get $10 billion of purchases done would certainly take some time, and we've ramped that up over time.
And our goal here, as we sit through peer results and actions versus ours, and we certainly are an outlier in terms of being, I think, more prudent and more cautious at deploying at these low rates. Our goal is let's maximize our NII over the next 5 years, not over the next 12 months. And we think, ultimately, that this is the better outcome.
And the Fed will eventually taper. Not sure when that will be. But when the largest bond buyer in the world is price indiscriminate in their purchases every month, that certainly distorts the market. So eventually, that distortion is going to end, and we think we'll get better entry points than what we see today.
And then in terms of the first part of your question, the growth in the yield this quarter in the investment portfolio is really the benefit of what we did 5 years ago, with structuring the portfolio to be more weighted to bullet and locked-out cash flows. So that to the extent there are prepayments in the portfolio, the make-whole provisions provide a nice pickup in investment yield.
And as we -- we never include those in our outlook so that the guide on NII might look soft on the surface. But if things continue to be the same, then obviously, NII will outperform the guide should those prepayment penalties continue to occur. We're sitting on almost $2 billion in gains in the investment portfolio."

I think right now, as I mentioned earlier, Gerard, if you think about every customer I sit down with, Tim sits down with, and we have a conversation -- and you're seeing it in various ways, labor shortage, supply chain constraints, significant issues out there right now. You're seeing that in backlogs, order delays, restaurants not being able to be open, small businesses not open full time, can't get labor. So it's a big challenge right now. And when does that start to abate? When does that start to correct itself? And I'm not sure when that is. I believe it will happen, obviously.
But to -- when is that? Later this year? Is it next year? So I think that's going to pull a lot of pressure. Inventory levels are extremely low compared to what the demand that is out there. We're not seeing that tick up right now. Line utilization is kind of flattened right now, but we're not seeing that tick up that we were hoping to see.
So those are all kind of concerns that I have right now. Obviously, inflation is another concern out there as we watch that, how the Fed manages through that complexity. And more to come on that.

I think the growth, if you look at new client relationships and otherwise, is very strong in the commercial business in the Southeast. So they are contributing disproportionately to the incremental fee income.
But I wouldn't tell you that it is focused exclusively on the Southeast. If you look at our new commercial relationships, about 30% of them this year are lead with treasury management. And then there's another percentage, which I don't have off the top of my head, but which has come to us primarily through the capital markets business. So we are having good success using those products as wedge opportunities to drive new relationships.
If you look forward, I think we're trying to build what is a really nicely diversified capital markets business with low activities, like rates and commodities hedging and otherwise, to complement the M&A advisory business and what we do in equities with what we do on the bond market. I mean what we continue to anticipate is at some point here, the capital markets will be a little bit less accommodative. We'll get the benefit of that in loan balances, but you'll see some lightening on bond fees.
But the other side of it is we're sitting on an M&A pipeline now, which is almost double what it was in January 1 of this year. So we do have a nice M&A advisory pipeline that should come behind it.
On the treasury management side, we've pretty consistently grown at the rate of the industry, plus 2 to 3 percentage points. I am of the belief that we can do better than that, but it's definitely better to be taking share there over time than it is to have the alternative situation.

I can't really -- we're hopeful, but I can tell my team, hope is not a strategy. We're hopeful we start to see that tick up a little bit based on the production levels that we're seeing out there right now. Hopefully, again, some of these challenges in front of us on the supply chain and labor front maybe abating later this year.
But once again, it's a tough thing to say when do we get back to a normalized run rate. It's going to be a lot. I mean it's going to be in quarters, not -- and maybe a year plus before we get there, I believe."

If the right opportunity presents itself in a market that's attractive to us that kind of solves what MB Financial solved for us in Chicago, obviously, we'll always consider those type of opportunities. But there are far and few between and not the focus of the organization.
As far as Biden's executive order, listen, there's still a lot of work to be done. The agencies, the OCC, Fed and FDIC and the DOJ are trying to figure out what that means. So more to come on that, but you can believe, as I do, that transactions -- the economics of transactions could be more challenging going forward based on executive order, and the time line to get those transactions approved may take a little bit longer. But good transactions will get done."

But yes, to your point, we have a lot of capital deployment opportunity ahead of us to get to the 9.5%. And certainly, if loan growth doesn't materialize, then we'll look to continue to hit the 9.5%.
And then we do feel that should loan growth accelerate, we certainly have a buffer from where we think we need to run the company from a capital perspective.

If you're looking for green shoots, I think that borrowers who are either smaller or who rely on structures that look more like asset-based lending structures are starting to tap their lines.

Now in aggregate, that's not a large segment of our balance sheet, which is the reason that you see utilization overall at Fifth Third being stable.

So NIM should come down, call it, 5 bps or so in the third quarter. I would say the big drivers there, certainly, the PPP, the prepayment penalties, a little bit of day count and otherwise still maintain that floor of 305 or better."

Earlier today, we reported third quarter net income of $704 million or $0.97 per share. On a core basis, we earned $0.94 per share. Once again, we delivered strong and steady financial results while fully supporting our customers, communities and employees. 
During the quarter, we generated an adjusted ROTCE of nearly 19%, which represents the fifth straight quarter exceeding 18%. We generated period-end C&I loan growth of 4% compared to the prior quarter, excluding the impact of PPP. Commercial loan production increased 5% from last quarter, representing the strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019. We generated strong consumer household growth of 3% compared to last year, with growth in every region in our footprint, reflecting the continued success of our branch and digital initiatives. And as expected, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our performance this quarter reflected strong business outcomes across our franchise, resulting in improved and diversified revenues. This was combined with disciplined balance sheet management, expense management, we had another quarter of benign credit results. We closed the Provide acquisition and the sale of HSA deposits in the quarter to improve long-term growth and profitability.  Provide, a leading fintech company serving health care practices will further accelerate profitable relationship growth. The seller HSA deposits is part of our multiyear strategy to simplify the organization and prioritize investments in order to generate differentiated outcomes for our customers and shareholders. 
Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, adjusted PPNR increased 4% compared to the year ago quarter highlighting the strong results from our fee-based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial and wealth and asset management. Excluding the impact of PPP, average total loans increased 1% compared to last quarter. reflecting strong commercial loan production as well as strength in our indirect auto through residential mortgage portfolios. Commercial loan production increased 5% sequentially with record quarters in Corporate Banking and Middle Market.  
Despite some of the challenges we have been hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, the strong production was led by our health care, renewable energy and retail verticals and was well diversified geographically. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines and retention of the client relationship all support continued loan growth. As it relates to Provide, we are very pleased with the progress we have seen so far. We are even more excited about the opportunities for continued growth. As we have previously mentioned, we expect strong origination volumes in 2022, reflecting a robust pipeline, and of product capabilities and key talent hires, provides supports our relationship approach with approximately 2/3 of customers having either a deposit account or a payments relationship with Fifth Third. 
During the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses as well as historically low net charge-offs of 8 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. In addition to historical low credit losses, we experienced another quarter of improvement in criticized assets and NPAs. Our criticized assets declined nearly 20%. Our NPA ratio declined 9 basis points sequentially. Our NPA to NPL ratios this quarter have reverted back to pre-pandemic levels. Our strong craft performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and continued support from fiscal and monetary government times programs. 
Our balance sheet and earnings power remained very strong. As we've said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities, paying a strong dividend and share repurchases. Bank acquisitions remain a lower priority. I'd like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continually risen to the occasion for our customers, communities and each other. I'm very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take delivered options to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. 
For our customers, we are excited to roll out Genie, our new AI-driven digital system in the fourth quarter. This will drive targeted marketing capabilities, digital engagement and improved customer retention. For our communities, we made a $15 million contribution to our foundation this quarter as part of our $2.8 billion commitment to accelerate racial equity, equality and inclusion in our communities. In total, we have contributed $40 million in philanthropic support since the end of last year. We continue to make targeted investments to accelerate economic revitalization as you may have seen in last week's announcement, a Fifth Third Neighborhood Investment Program. This innovative initiative further demonstrates our commitment to being an ESG leader in addition to other recent proof points, including charting over $6 billion towards our $8 billion renewable energy goal to be achieved by 2025, announcing a new position about climate risk to focus on identifying, measuring and managing the physical and transition risk of our clients and a robust transparent and peer-leading ESG disclosure. 
In summary, we believe our balancing strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined management throughout the company will serve us well into 2022 and beyond. We expect to generate positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and also for the full year in 2021. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value and consistently producing through-the-cycle top quartile results. 
With that, I'll turn over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook."

We're very pleased with our financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported earnings included a $21 million after-tax benefit or $0.03 per share from the 3 items noted on Page 2 of the release. Our strong business performance [indiscernible] bank is reflected in our return metrics. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.32% and an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of 18.7%. 
Improvements in our loan portfolio credit quality resulted in a $63 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 200 basis points compared to 206 last quarter. Combined with our historically low net charge-offs, we had a $42 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. 
Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting the benefits of our balance sheet positioning, continuing benefits from PPP income and income from our Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases. Our NII results relative to the second quarter included a $6 million reduction in PPP income, a $4 million decline in prepayment penalties in our investment portfolio and the impact of lower earning asset yields, partially offset by a higher day count and a reduction in long-term debt. Our allocation to bullet and locked out structures is currently 60% of the total investment portfolio which is expected to continue to provide ongoing NII protection in this low rate environment. 
On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs another basis point this quarter to 4 basis points. With a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion of excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low, given our securities portfolio and derivatives. 
Total reported noninterest income increased 13% sequentially, impacted by a $60 million gain associated with the disposition of HSA deposits as previously communicated. Adjusted noninterest income increased 3%, driven by strong mortgage banking, treasury management, leasing and wealth and asset management revenues. Commercial Banking revenue, which achieved record results for the past 2 quarters remained solid as strength in M&A advisory fees, particularly in our health care vertical was more than offset by lower corporate bond fees. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 13% with improvement in every single caption, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year. Our total noninterest revenue was 41% of total revenue in the third quarter. Reported noninterest expense increased 2% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the $15 million foundation contribution. Adjusted expenses were flat sequentially as an increase in marketing expense associated with Momentum Banking and increased T&E expense were offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expense. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest expense increased 2%, primarily driven by an increase in performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results, servicing expenses associated with Ginnie Mae loan purchases and the impact of the Provide acquisition. These items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiation and lower net occupancy expense. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 13% compared to just 2% expense growth. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases declined half of 8% sequentially, including the headwind from PPP loans. Excluding PPP, average loans and leases increased 1%, with period-end loans up 1.5%, pointing to positive momentum as we head into the fourth quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% as continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage balances were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances. 
While we did not retain incremental conforming mortgage originations in the third quarter, we have elected to retain approximately $400 million of our retail mortgage production for the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and we'll continue to evaluate the economic trade-offs given our balance sheet capacity in this environment. Average commercial loans declined 2% compared to the prior quarter due entirely to PPP forgiveness. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased around half of 8% with C&I loans up 2%. Production was robust across the board, up 5% compared to the prior quarter, with both corporate and middle market banking generating record production, which was well diversified geographically. As a result, period-end C&I loans, excluding PPP, increased 4%. 
Revolver utilization of 31% was stable compared to the prior quarter. However, it is worth noting that total commitments have increased approximately $5 billion since the end of last year, driven by new client acquisition and an increase in demand from existing clients in anticipation of future business growth. Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances in mortgage and construction driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic, reflecting our cautious approach to those sectors. Our securities portfolio was stable sequentially. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows but will remain patient on deploying the excess liquidity. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to begin our excess cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. 
We remain optimistic that continued GDP growth in the Fed's eventual tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk-return opportunities in the future. Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, remain elevated, reflecting growth in core deposits since the onset of the pandemic, which are up 6% year-over-year. 
Moving to credit. Our strong credit performance this quarter once again reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, prudent balance sheet management and the continued benefit of fiscal and monetary stimulus programs and improvement in the broader economy. As Greg mentioned, the third quarter net charge-off ratio of 8 basis points was historically low and improved 8 basis points sequentially. Nonperforming assets declined 15% with the NPA ratio declining 9 basis points sequentially to 52 basis points. The decline in criticized assets reflected significant improvements in retail nonessential and leisure, consistent with the reopening of the economy and higher activity in those sectors as well as improvements in our energy and leverage loan portfolios. We continue to focus on segments of nonowner-occupied commercial real estate particularly central business district hotels as activity has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
Moving to the ACL. Our base case macroeconomic scenario is relatively similar to last quarter, which assumes the labor market continues to improve, and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% in the first quarter of 2022 and ending our 3-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. However,  our ACL release was lower this quarter as the improvement in the underlying economic forecast decelerated from the second quarter. Additionally, the ACL requirement in the downside scenario worsened compared to the second quarter due to a forecasted slower pace of recovery and a larger increase in unemployment. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $788 million higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $176 million lower. 
While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and lending implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist. Our September 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate to the economic environment with lower unemployment and continued improvement in credit quality. 
Moving to capital. Our capital levels remained strong in the third quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%. During the quarter, we completed $550 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 14.5 million shares compared to the second quarter. We also raised our common dividend $0.03 or 11% to $0.30 per share. Our capital plan support approximately $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021 and we continue to target a 9.5% CET1 by June 2022. 
Moving to our fourth quarter outlook. We expect average total loan balances to increase 2% sequentially, excluding the PPP headwind. Including the PPP impact, we expect average total loans to increase approximately 1%. Our outlook reflects 0.5 point of improvement from commercial revolving line utilization, continued strength in commercial production given our record pipeline and a continued stabilization in paydowns based on activity that we are seeing so far in October. We expect average C&I growth of 4% to 5%, excluding PPP in the fourth quarter, and CRE balances to decline around 1% or so, primarily due to construction constraints. As a result, we anticipate total average commercial loan growth of around 3% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average total consumer loan balances to increase around 1% sequentially, including the impacts of Ginnie Mae forbearance pool purchases in our held-for-sale portfolio. We purchased $300 million during the third quarter, an additional $700 million in early October. 
Given our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, assuming stable securities balances and a $17 million reduction in PPP income. Excluding PPP, we expect fourth quarter NII to be up slightly relative to the third quarter. 
Our guidance indicates full year 2021 NII declines less than 1% compared to full year 2020 despite no meaningful growth in investment securities balances throughout the year and an average decline in 1-month LIBOR of approximately 40 basis points. We expect NIM to decline 3 to 4 basis points in the fourth quarter, primarily due to loan yield compression. We expect fourth quarter fees to increase around 6% compared to the third quarter and to be up around 8% on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impacts of the TRA. This results in full year 2021 fee growth, excluding the impacts of the TRA of approximately 10% compared to 2020. Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy, resulting in a record full year commercial banking revenue led by 20% growth in capital markets fees, record wealth and asset management revenue up double digits and double-digit growth in card and processing revenue. We expect private equity income to be in the $40 million area in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes a sequential decline in top line mortgage revenue of approximately 40%, with roughly half of that decline due to seasonally lower fourth quarter volumes and declining spreads and half to our decision to retain $400 million in retail production that I mentioned earlier. 
We expect fourth quarter expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued growth in technology investments, servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae loan purchases and continued marketing support related to our rollout of momentum, offset by disciplined expense management throughout the company and initial savings beginning from our process automation program. As a result, our full year 2021 total core revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in core expenses despite the rate environment. We will have achieved positive operating leverage in a year in which the vast majority of the industry will likely experience an erosion in efficiency. We expect total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter to be in the 10 to 15 basis points range, which would result in full year 2021 charge-offs of 15 basis points or so. 
In summary,  our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to remain the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A."

First off, we're very encouraged what we're seeing from a production perspective. We've got commercial loan production in the third quarter. '21 was strong at $5.4 billion. That was up from $5.1 billion in the second quarter and $5.2 billion in the third quarter 2019. We expect that production to continue to be stable going into the fourth quarter, so that's encouraging. We expect average loans up 1% with PPP and 2% up without PPP assets. So that's some strength there. We're also seeing line utilization tick up a little bit more in our core middle market, which is nice to see that for change. So when you think about our geographies, what we're seeing right now from a geography perspective, North Carolina, Texas, Cincinnati, Columbus were our top 4 markets from commercial loan growth in Q3, which is encouraging. If you look at 6 regions that had all-time highs, which we're very encouraged with Chicago, Green Rapids, Columbus, Kentucky, North Carolina and Texas. So that felt really good, and we're starting to see once again, some good momentum out there. Net new relationships, something we watch very carefully brought in 419 new commercial relationships year-to-date. Most of that was in core middle market and some of that in March quarter. But net-net, we're seeing good progress out there, good performance. Encouraged by what we're seeing to date as we go into the fourth quarter and then into 2022."

So I had the chance to be out in 8 of our 14 regions this past quarter. I think you get really excellent color when you have an opportunity to sit with clients and with bankers. I mean they're all feeling the shortages as it relates to labor and supply chain. We have hotel operators who are now only cleaning rooms when people leave. As an example, I visited an electronics client out West and asked to see their demo room, and there was nothing but holes in the walls where is the equipment and they had sold all the inventory because they are struggling to get the parts in to be able to fill orders. So all those issues are still real. I think the good news is we are seeing M&A as a catalyst. We're seeing CapEx now as a catalyst, in particular, for businesses that are able to substitute equipment and automation for manual processes. And then bluntly, as Greg mentioned, I think we feel pretty confident that a lot of the improvement we're seeing is just coming from taking share. I mean the relationship count Greg mentioned be higher than where we were at prior to the pandemic. So we'll have taken more new relationships on board this year through 9 months than we had in all of 2018 or 2019 just as an example. So the good general pickup there. It would be great to continue to see a little bit more activity as it relates to utilization as folks try to build inventories and otherwise, it's just -- that's going to be the wildcard for us."

What we're seeing from a line utilization perspective is that the middle market line utilization is up almost 1%, whereas corporate banking continues to trend down. So quarter-over-quarter, that utilization was stable. And if we want to go into the decimals, it was 31.3 at the end of June, and it's 31.1 as we sit here on September 30, but we are starting to see more borrowing demand and pickup in the middle market space as opposed to the corporate banking. And then in terms of pricing, while NIM came in as expected in line with our July guide, we do have the headwind in the C&I yield portfolio because it is very competitive out there. I think, for the most part, banks are competing on price and nonbanks are competing on structure. So for us, the price headwind comes in just a little bit tighter spread, but also some of the reduction in the LIBOR floor. So you lose some of that excess earnings in this environment, but you can perhaps recapture the yield benefit as the Fed starts to move on the front end of the curve, hopefully in the next year to 18 months. So as expected, but certainly a headwind when it comes to pricing."

If you look out on the bullets themselves, they're at a 2 65 yield with cash flows, I think we're projecting about $7 billion of cash flows in that portfolio over the next 5 years. So there will be a step down should rates stay where they are today. Reinvestment yields right now, I think, are in the 170 to 180 range. So barring a curve steepener, it will be a slow, but definitely downward trend on the portfolio yield. The good news for us is we're very well positioned, and it is pretty insulated from the environment relative to how the peers have positioned their portfolio."

So we've tightened the range on that bundle savings from $100 million to $150 million to $125 million. And then obviously, we're not getting into expense guide for 2022 because we'll continue to evaluate how much of those savings will be reinvested into sales force expansion on commercial as well as the wealth and asset management. But we feel good about the progress we're making on the LPA program. In fact, if you look in the press release, buried, I think, at the bottom of Page 14 is an FTE count, and we're down a couple of hundred FTE even with adding about 100 from the Provide acquisition, and that's starting to show the benefit of that LPA savings.

And we certainly have dry powder, whether it's through the asset sensitivity or the $33 billion of excess cash that we could choose to deploy to mitigate those effects if need be.

We were able to take out the 200-plus additional people and so forth, branch closes some of the things that we're working on right now. And on the other expense side of the house supports that positive operating leverage. And we continue to grow fees at a really robust rate, close to 10% CAGR over the last couple of years. So net-net, positive operating leverage is something we're very focused on. We believe we can continue to deliver on. In addition to that, the tech spend will roughly run around 10-plus percent. When you think about the core platform modernization, we talked about the fourth or fifth inning. I think of it more as a cricket test batch. It's been going on. It's going to continue to go on for quite some time. We're going to have to deal with that. But at the end of the day, I think as we put these new platforms in, we're able to do in a very systematic way with respect to how we turn these platforms on. So it's not the big bang approach. We're able to turn it on by geography, by product line. So we're very insulated for having to do a big bang impact. With that said, you have some dual system platforms that are going to run simultaneously until we get all markets, all products converted over in the case of some of our major implementations coming up like our core deposit platform. So that's going to take a little bit of time. But at the end of the day, we should be a lot more efficient. We should be able to bring further -- more enhancements at a different case forward. to our business. We should be able to continue to take out costs through our lean process automation and our investments in AI technology. So net-net, tech is going to be a source of spend for us in that range that I mentioned before as we go forward. But then nothing we're getting paid very well for it. Our objective is to go head-to-head with the fintech players, the large bank competitors that we have to deal with and be very successful. And we've been able to do that and demonstrate that. When you think about the fintech players that are out there, we've got the same capabilities. We've got our products like Momentum, but we also got 53,000 free ATMs, 1,100 banking centers and 10,000 service personnel that they don't have, and we got the core relationships. So net-net, we'll continue to stay focused, but that's kind of the range of what we're going to operate in."

That's where I'd like to operate at somewhere 23% to 25% of total assets, but it's not a capacity constraint, it's more, I think, given the environment, that's a more productive place to be. In terms of the CMBS, I think the heart of your question is asked what is the non-agency CMBS portion of the portfolio, and that's $3.8 billion or so. And again, for us, it's super senior tranches.

Earlier today, we reported third quarter net income of $704 million or $0.97 per share. On a quarter basis, we earned $0.94 per share. Once again, we delivered strong and steady financial results while fully supporting our customers, communities and employees. 
During the quarter, we generated an adjusted ROTCE of nearly 19%, which represents the fifth straight quarter exceeding 18%. We generated period-end C&I loan growth of 4% compared to the prior quarter, excluding the impact of PPP. Commercial loan production increased 5% from last quarter, representing the strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019. We generated strong consumer household growth of 3% compared to last year, with growth in every region in our footprint, reflecting the continued success of our branch and digital initiatives. And as expected, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our performance this quarter reflected strong business outcomes across our franchise, resulting in improved and diversified revenues. This was combined with disciplined balance sheet management, expense management, we had another quarter of benign credit results. We closed the Provide acquisition and the sale of HSA deposits in the quarter to improve long-term growth and profitability.  Provide, a leading fintech company serving health care practices will further accelerate profitable relationship growth. The sale of our HSA deposits is part of our multiyear strategy to simplify the organization and prioritize investments in order to generate differentiated outcomes for our customers and shareholders. 
Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, adjusted PPNR increased 4% compared to the year ago quarter, highlighting the strong results from our fee-based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial and wealth and asset management. Excluding the impact of PPP, average total loans increased 1% compared to last quarter, reflecting strong commercial loan production as well as strength in our indirect auto through residential mortgage portfolios. Commercial loan production increased 5% sequentially with record quarters in Corporate Banking and Middle Market.  
Despite some of the challenges we have been hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, the strong production was led by our healthcare, renewable energy and retail verticals, it was well diversified geographically. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines and retention of the client relationship all support continued loan growth. As it relates to Provide, we are very pleased with the progress we have seen so far. We are even more excited about the opportunities for continued growth. As we have previously mentioned, we expect strong origination volumes in 2022, reflecting a robust pipeline, and of product capabilities and key talent hires. Provide supports our relationship approach with approximately 2/3 of customers having either a deposit account or a payments relationship with Fifth Third. 
During the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses as well as historically low net charge-offs of 8 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. In addition to historical low credit losses, we experienced another quarter of improvement in criticized assets and NPAs. Our criticized assets declined nearly 20%. Our NPA ratio declined 9 basis points sequentially. Our NPA to NPL ratios this quarter have reverted back to pre-pandemic levels. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs. 
Our balance sheet and earnings power remained very strong. As we've said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities, paying a strong dividend and share repurchases. Bank acquisitions remain a lower priority. I'd like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continually risen to the occasion for our customers, communities and each other. I'm very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate action to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. 
For our customers, we are excited to roll out [Genie], our new AI-driven digital assistant in the fourth quarter. This will drive targeted marketing capabilities, digital engagement and improved customer retention. For our communities, we made a $15 million contribution to our foundation this quarter as part of our $2.8 billion commitment to accelerate racial equity, equality and inclusion in our communities. In total, we have contributed $40 million in philanthropic support since the end of last year. We continue to make targeted investments to accelerate economic revitalization as you may have seen in last week's announcement, a Fifth Third Neighborhood Investment Program. This innovative initiative further demonstrates our commitment to being an ESG leader in addition to other recent proof points including chairing over $6 billion towards our $8 billion renewable energy goal to be achieved by 2025, announcing a new position about climate risk to focus on identifying, measuring and managing the physical and transition risk of our clients and a robust transparent and peer-leading ESG disclosure. 
In summary, we believe our balancing strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined management throughout the company will serve us well into 2022 and beyond. We expect to generate positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and also for the full year in 2021. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value and consistently producing through-the-cycle top quartile results. 
With that, I'll turn over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook."

We're very pleased with our financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on bot",2033,"Thank you, Greg, and I thank all of you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported earnings included a $21 million after-tax benefit or $0.03 per share from the 3 items noted on Page 2 of the release. Our strong business performance of the bank is reflected in our return metrics. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.32% and an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of 18.7%. 
Improvements in our loan portfolio credit quality resulted in a $63 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 200 basis points compared to 206 last quarter. Combined with our historically low net charge-offs, we had a $42 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. 
Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting the benefits of our balance sheet positioning, continuing benefits from PPP income and income from our Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases. Our NII results relative to the second quarter included a $6 million reduction in PPP income, a $4 million decline in prepayment penalties in our investment portfolio and the impact of lower earning asset yields, partially offset by a higher day count and a reduction in long-term debt. Our allocation to bullet and locked-out structures is currently 60% of the total investment portfolio, which is expected to continue to provide ongoing NII protection in this low rate environment. 
On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs another basis point this quarter to 4 basis points. With a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion of excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low, given our securities portfolio and derivatives. 
Total reported noninterest income increased 13% sequentially, impacted by a $60 million gain associated with the disposition of HSA deposits as previously communicated. Adjusted noninterest income increased 3%, driven by strong mortgage banking, treasury management, leasing and wealth and asset management revenues. Commercial Banking revenue, which achieved record results for the past 2 quarters remained solid as strength in M&A advisory fees, particularly in our health care vertical was more than offset by lower corporate bond fees. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 13% with improvement in every single caption, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year. Our total noninterest revenue was 41% of total revenue in the third quarter. Reported noninterest expense increased 2% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the $15 million foundation contribution. Adjusted expenses were flat sequentially as an increase in marketing expense associated with Momentum Banking and increased T&E expense were offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expense. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest expense increased 2%, primarily driven by an increase in performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results, servicing expenses associated with Ginnie Mae loan purchases and the impact of the Provide acquisition. These items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiation and lower net occupancy expense. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 13% compared to just 2% expense growth. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases declined half of 8% sequentially, including the headwind from PPP loans. Excluding PPP, average loans and leases increased 1%, with period-end loans up 1.5%, pointing to positive momentum as we head into the fourth quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% as continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage balances were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances. 
While we did not retain incremental conforming mortgage originations in the third quarter, we have elected to retain approximately $400 million of our retail mortgage production for the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and we'll continue to evaluate the economic trade-offs given our balance sheet capacity in this environment. Average commercial loans declined 2% compared to the prior quarter due entirely to PPP forgiveness. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased around half of 8% with C&I loans up 2%. Production was robust across the board, up 5% compared to the prior quarter, with both corporate and middle market banking generating record production, which was well diversified geographically. As a result, period-end C&I loans, excluding PPP, increased 4%. 
Revolver utilization of 31% was stable compared to the prior quarter. However, it is worth noting that total commitments have increased approximately $5 billion since the end of last year, driven by new client acquisition and an increase in demand from existing clients in anticipation of future business growth. Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances in mortgage and construction driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic, reflecting our cautious approach to those sectors. Our securities portfolio was stable sequentially. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows but will remain patient on deploying the excess liquidity. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to begin our excess cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. 
We remain optimistic that continued GDP growth in the Fed's eventual tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk-return opportunities in the future. Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash remain elevated, reflecting growth in core deposits since the onset of the pandemic, which are up 6% year-over-year. 
Moving to credit. Our strong credit performance this quarter once again reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, prudent balance sheet management and the continued benefit of fiscal and monetary stimulus programs and improvement in the broader economy. As Greg mentioned, the third quarter net charge-off ratio of 8 basis points was historically low and improved 8 basis points sequentially. Nonperforming assets declined 15% with the NPA ratio declining 9 basis points sequentially to 52 basis points. The decline in criticized assets reflected significant improvements in retail nonessential and leisure, consistent with the reopening of the economy and higher activity in those sectors as well as improvements in our energy and leverage loan portfolios. We continue to focus on segments of nonowner-occupied commercial real estate particularly central business district hotels as activity has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
Moving to the ACL. Our base case macroeconomic scenario is relatively similar to last quarter, which assumes the labor market continues to improve, and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% in the first quarter of 2022 and ending our 3-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. However, our ACL release was lower this quarter as the improvement in the underlying economic forecast decelerated from the second quarter. Additionally, the ACL requirement in the downside scenario worsened compared to the second quarter due to a forecasted slower pace of recovery and a larger increase in unemployment. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $788 million higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $176 million lower. 
While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and lending implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist. Our September 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate for the economic environment would lower unemployment and continued improvement in credit quality. 
Moving to capital. Our capital levels remained strong in the third quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%. During the quarter, we completed $550 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 14.5 million shares compared to the second quarter. We also raised our common dividend $0.03 or 11% to $0.30 per share. Our capital plans support approximately $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021 and we continue to target a 9.5% CET1 by June 2022. 
Moving to our fourth quarter outlook. We expect average total loan balances to increase 2% sequentially, excluding the PPP headwind. Including the PPP impact, we expect average total loans to increase approximately 1%. Our outlook reflects 0.5 point of improvement from commercial revolving line utilization, continued strength in commercial production given our record pipeline and a continued stabilization in paydowns based on activity that we are seeing so far in October. We expect average C&I growth of 4% to 5%, excluding PPP in the fourth quarter, and CRE balances to decline around 1% or so, primarily due to construction constraints. As a result, we anticipate total average commercial loan growth of around 3% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average total consumer loan balances to increase around 1% sequentially, including the impacts of Ginnie Mae forbearance pool purchases in our held-for-sale portfolio. We purchased $300 million during the third quarter, an additional $700 million in early October. 
Given our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, assuming stable securities balances and a $17 million reduction in PPP income. Excluding PPP, we expect fourth quarter NII to be up slightly relative to the third quarter. 
Our guidance indicates full year 2021 NII declines less than 1% compared to full year 2020 despite no meaningful growth in investment securities balances throughout the year, and an average decline in 1-month LIBOR of approximately 40 basis points. We expect NIM to decline 3 to 4 basis points in the fourth quarter, primarily due to loan yield compression. We expect fourth quarter fees to increase around 6% compared to the third quarter and to be up around 8% on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impacts of the TRA. This results in full year 2021 fee growth, excluding the impacts of the TRA of approximately 10% compared to 2020. Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy, resulting in a record full year commercial banking revenue led by 20% growth in capital markets fees, record wealth and asset management revenue up double digits and double-digit growth in card and processing revenue. We expect private equity income to be in the $40 million area in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes a sequential decline in top line mortgage revenue of approximately 40%, with roughly half of that decline due to seasonally lower fourth quarter volumes and declining spreads and half to our decision to retain $400 million in retail production that I mentioned earlier. 
We expect fourth quarter expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued growth in technology investments, servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae loan purchases and continued marketing support related to our rollout of Momentum, offset by disciplined expense management throughout the company and initial savings beginning from our process automation program. As a result, our full year 2021 total core revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in core expenses despite the rate environment. We will have achieved positive operating leverage in a year in which the vast majority of the industry will likely experience an erosion in efficiency. We expect total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter to be in the 10 to 15 basis points range, which would result in full year 2021 charge-offs of 15 basis points or so. 
In summary,  our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to                  the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A."

Let me start off, and then I'll flip it over to Tim, and maybe Jamie. First off, we're very encouraged what we're seeing from a production perspective. We've got commercial loan production in the third quarter. '21 was strong at $5.4 billion",257,"This is Greg. Let me start off, and then I'll flip it over to Tim, and maybe Jamie. First off, we're very encouraged what we're seeing from a production perspective. We've got commercial loan production in the third quarter. '21 was strong at $5.4 billion. That was up from $5.1 billion in the second quarter and $5.2 billion in the third quarter 2019. We expect that production to continue to be stable going into the fourth quarter, so that's encouraging. We expect average loans up 1% with PPP and 2% up without PPP assets. So that's some strength there. We're also seeing line utilization tick up a little bit more in our core middle market, which is nice to see that for change. So when you think about our geographies, what we're seeing right now from a geography perspective, North Carolina, Texas, Cincinnati, Columbus were our top 4 markets from commercial loan growth in Q3, which is encouraging. If you look at 6 regions that had all-time highs, which we're very encouraged with Chicago, Green Rapids, Columbus, Kentucky, North Carolina and Texas. So that felt really good, and we're starting to see once again, some good momentum out there. Net new relationships, something we watch very carefully brought in 419 new commercial relationships year-to-date. Most of that was in core middle market and some of that in March quarter. But net-net, we're seeing good progress out there, good performance. Encouraged by what we're seeing to date as we go into the fourth quarter and then into 2022."

So I had the chance to be out in 8 of our 14 regions this past quarter. I think you get really excellent color when you have an opportunity to sit with clients and with bankers. I mean they're all feeling the shortages as it relates to labor and supply chain. We have hotel operators who are now only cleaning rooms when people leave. As an example, I visited an electronics client out West and asked to see their demo room, and there was nothing but holes in the walls. I said ""Where is the equipment?"" and they had sold all the inventory because they are struggling to get the parts in to be able to fill orders. So all those issues are still real. I think the good news is we are seeing M&A as a catalyst. We're seeing CapEx now as a catalyst, in particular, for businesses that are able to substitute equipment and automation for manual processes. And then bluntly, as Greg mentioned, I think we feel pretty confident that a lot of the improvement we're seeing is just coming from taking share. I mean the relationship count Greg mentioned be higher than where we were at prior to the pandemic. So we'll have taken more new relationships on board this year through 9 months than we had in all of 2018 or 2019, just as an example. So the good general pickup there. It would be great to continue to see a little bit more activity as it relates to utilization as folks try to build inventories and otherwise, it's just -- that's going to be the wildcard for us."

What we're seeing from a line utilization perspective is that the middle market line utilization is up almost 1%, whereas corporate banking continues to trend down. So quarter-over-quarter, that utilization was stable. And if we want to go into the decimals, it was 31.3 at the end of June, and it's 31.1 as we sat here on September 30, but we are starting to see more borrowing demand and pickup in the middle market space as opposed to the corporate banking. And then in terms of pricing, while NIM came in as expected in line with our July guide, we do have the headwind in the C&I yield portfolio because it is very competitive out there. I think, for the most part, banks are competing on price and nonbanks are competing on structure. So for us, the price headwind comes in just a little bit tighter spread, but also some of the reduction in the LIBOR floor. So you lose some of that excess earnings in this environment, but you can perhaps recapture the yield benefit as the Fed starts to move on the front end of the curve, hopefully in the next year to 18 months. So as expected, but certainly a headwind when it comes to pricing."

So that's hurts the yield a bit at 10, 15 basis points or so. If you look out on the bullets themselves, they're at a 2.65% yield with cash flows, I think we're projecting about $7 billion of cash flows in that portfolio over the next 5 years. So there will be a step down should rates stay where they are today. Reinvestment yields right now, I think, are in the [170 to 180] range.  So barring a curve steepener, it will be a slow, but definitely downward trend on the portfolio yield. The good news for us is we're very well positioned, and it is pretty insulated from the environment relative to how the peers have positioned their portfolio."

Thanks for the question. The one update we have on expense savings in our program for 2022 is that we are targeting $125 million in savings for 2022, and that's a combination of the lean process automation, intelligent operations, the branch closures. We have 42 branches closing in the first quarter of 2022 and then some smaller vendor savings bundled together. So we've tightened the range on that bundle savings from $100 million to $150 million to $125 million. And then obviously, we're not getting into expense guide for 2022 because we'll continue to evaluate how much of those savings will be reinvested into sales force expansion on commercial as well as the wealth and asset management. But we feel good about the progress we're making on the LPA program. In fact, if you look in the press release, buried, I think, at the bottom of Page 14 is an FTE count, and we're down a couple of hundred FTE even with adding about 100 from the Provide acquisition, and that's starting to show the benefit of that LPA savings. So we've made progress. We've had some success. There's about $6 million of savings in our fourth quarter forecast tied into that program, but then the $125 million for next year."

Listen, I think 10% is probably the right number for us, it is not cast in stone. As you mentioned, operating leverage -- positive operating leverage, that's something we're very focused on. We delivered -- we'll deliver in 20",523,"Yes. And Mike, this is Greg. Listen, I think 10% is probably the right number for us, it is not cast in stone. As you mentioned, operating leverage -- positive operating leverage, that's something we're very focused on. We delivered -- we'll deliver in 2021 as we go into our planning process for 2022, our focus is on positive operating leverage. So as I mentioned earlier, a lot of that -- some of that tech spend is going right to process efficiencies. We were able to take out the 200-plus additional people and so forth, branch closes some of the things that we're working on right now. And on the other expense side of the house supports that positive operating leverage. And we continue to grow fees at a really robust rate, close to 10% CAGR over the last couple of years. So net-net, positive operating leverage is something we're very focused on. We believe we can continue to deliver on. In addition to that, the tech spend will roughly run around 10-plus percent. When you think about the core platform modernization, we talked about the fourth or fifth inning. I think of it more as a cricket test match. It's been going on. It's going to continue to go on for quite some time. We're going to have to deal with that. But at the end of the day, I think as we put these new platforms in, we're able to do in a very systematic way with respect to how we turn these platforms on. So it's not the big bang approach. We're able to turn it on by geography, by product line. So we're very insulated for having to do a big bang impact. With that said, you have some dual system platforms that are going to run simultaneously until we get all markets, all products converted over in the case of some of our major implementations coming up like our core deposit platform. So that's going to take a little bit of time. But at the end of the day, we should be a lot more efficient. We should be able to bring further -- more enhancements at a different case forward to our business. We should be able to continue to take out costs through our Lean process automation and our investments in AI technology. So net-net, tech is going to be a source of spend for us in that range that I mentioned before as we go forward. But net-net, we're getting paid very well for it. Our objective is to go head-to-head with the fintech players, the large bank competitors that we have to deal with and be very successful. And we've been able to do that and demonstrate that. When you think about the fintech players that are out there, we've got the same capabilities. We've got our products like Momentum, but we also got 53,000 free ATMs, 1,100 banking centers and 10,000 service personnel that they don't have, and we got the core relationships. So net-net, we'll continue to stay focused, but that's kind of the range of what we're going to operate in."

The short answer is that when we look at the excess liquidity, call it, $30 billion, we expect 1/3 of it to go into the securities portfolio, a 1/3 of it into loans, a 1/3 of it, we think, while deposits in the banking system may not decline, we do expect those deposits to find a more productive home, perhaps money market funds or other investment vehicles. So for us, we're running at 18% or so in the securities book as a percent of total assets. So if we take, call it, $10 billion of the excess liquidity and put it into the book, we're at 23%, 24%. That's where I'd like to operate at somewhere 23% to 25% of total assets, but it's not a capacity constraint, it's more, I think, given the environment, that's a more productive place to be. In terms of the CMBS, I think the heart of your question is what is the non-agency CMBS portion of the portfolio, and that's $3.8 billion or so. And again, for us, it's super senior tranches. We feel very good about the credit enhancement, 30-plus percent there. So not a large credit risk position to have, whereas the rest of the CMBS book would be agency guaranteed."

Earlier today, we reported third quarter net income of $704 million or $0.97 per share. On a quarter basis, we earned $0.94 per share. Once again, we delivered strong and steady financial results while fully supporting our customers, communities and employees. 
During the quarter, we generated an adjusted ROTCE of nearly 19%, which represents the fifth straight quarter exceeding 18%. We generated period-end C&I loan growth of 4% compared to the prior quarter, excluding the impact of PPP. Commercial loan production increased 5% from last quarter, representing the strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019. We generated strong consumer household growth of 3% compared to last year, with growth in every region in our footprint, reflecting the continued success of our branch and digital initiatives. And as expected, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our performance this quarter reflected strong business outcomes across our franchise, resulting in improved and diversified revenues. This was combined with disciplined balance sheet management, expense management, we had another quarter of benign credit results. We closed the Provide acquisition and the sale of HSA deposits in the quarter to improve long-term growth and profitability.  Provide, a leading fintech company serving health care practices will further accelerate profitable relationship growth. The sale of our HSA deposits is part of our multiyear strategy to simplify the organization and prioritize investments in order to generate differentiated outcomes for our customers and shareholders. 
Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, adjusted PPNR increased 4% compared to the year ago quarter, highlighting the strong results from our fee-based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial and wealth and asset management. Excluding the impact of PPP, average total loans increased 1% compared to last quarter, reflecting strong commercial loan production as well as strength in our indirect auto through residential mortgage portfolios. Commercial loan production increased 5% sequentially with record quarters in Corporate Banking and Middle Market.  
Despite some of the challenges we have been hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, the strong production was led by our healthcare, renewable energy and retail verticals, it was well diversified geographically. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines and retention of the client relationship all support continued loan growth. As it relates to Provide, we are very pleased with the progress we have seen so far. We are even more excited about the opportunities for continued growth. As we have previously mentioned, we expect strong origination volumes in 2022, reflecting a robust pipeline, and of product capabilities and key talent hires. Provide supports our relationship approach with approximately 2/3 of customers having either a deposit account or a payments relationship with Fifth Third. 
During the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses as well as historically low net charge-offs of 8 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. In addition to historical low credit losses, we experienced another quarter of improvement in criticized assets and NPAs. Our criticized assets declined nearly 20%. Our NPA ratio declined 9 basis points sequentially. Our NPA to NPL ratios this quarter have reverted back to pre-pandemic levels. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs. 
Our balance sheet and earnings power remained very strong. As we've said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities, paying a strong dividend and share repurchases. Bank acquisitions remain a lower priority. I'd like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continually risen to the occasion for our customers, communities and each other. I'm very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate action to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. 
For our customers, we are excited to roll out [Genie], our new AI-driven digital assistant in the fourth quarter. This will drive targeted marketing capabilities, digital engagement and improved customer retention. For our communities, we made a $15 million contribution to our foundation this quarter as part of our $2.8 billion commitment to accelerate racial equity, equality and inclusion in our communities. In total, we have contributed $40 million in philanthropic support since the end of last year. We continue to make targeted investments to accelerate economic revitalization as you may have seen in last week's announcement, a Fifth Third Neighborhood Investment Program. This innovative initiative further demonstrates our commitment to being an ESG leader in addition to other recent proof points including chairing over $6 billion towards our $8 billion renewable energy goal to be achieved by 2025, announcing a new position about climate risk to focus on identifying, measuring and managing the physical and transition risk of our clients and a robust transparent and peer-leading ESG disclosure. 
In summary, we believe our balancing strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined management throughout the company will serve us well into 2022 and beyond. We expect to generate positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and also for the full year in 2021. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value and consistently producing through-the-cycle top quartile results. 
With that, I'll turn over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook."

We're very pleased with our financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank.

We're very pleased with our financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported earnings included a $21 million after-tax benefit or $0.03 per share from the 3 items noted on Page 2 of the release. Our strong business performance of the bank is reflected in our return metrics. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.32% and an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of 18.7%. 
Improvements in our loan portfolio credit quality resulted in a $63 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 200 basis points compared to 206 last quarter. Combined with our historically low net charge-offs, we had a $42 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. 
Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting the benefits of our balance sheet positioning, continuing benefits from PPP income and income from our Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases. Our NII results relative to the second quarter included a $6 million reduction in PPP income, a $4 million decline in prepayment penalties in our investment portfolio and the impact of lower earning asset yields, partially offset by a higher day count and a reduction in long-term debt. Our allocation to bullet and locked-out structures is currently 60% of the total investment portfolio, which is expected to continue to provide ongoing NII protection in this low rate environment. 
On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs another basis point this quarter to 4 basis points. With a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion of excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low, given our securities portfolio and derivatives. 
Total reported noninterest income increased 13% sequentially, impacted by a $60 million gain associated with the disposition of HSA deposits as previously communicated. Adjusted noninterest income increased 3%, driven by strong mortgage banking, treasury management, leasing and wealth and asset management revenues. Commercial Banking revenue, which achieved record results for the past 2 quarters remained solid as strength in M&A advisory fees, particularly in our health care vertical was more than offset by lower corporate bond fees. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 13% with improvement in every single caption, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year. Our total noninterest revenue was 41% of total revenue in the third quarter. Reported noninterest expense increased 2% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the $15 million foundation contribution. Adjusted expenses were flat sequentially as an increase in marketing expense associated with Momentum Banking and increased T&E expense were offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expense. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest expense increased 2%, primarily driven by an increase in performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results, servicing expenses associated with Ginnie Mae loan purchases and the impact of the Provide acquisition. These items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiation and lower net occupancy expense. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 13% compared to just 2% expense growth. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases declined half of 8% sequentially, including the headwind from PPP loans. Excluding PPP, average loans and leases increased 1%, with period-end loans up 1.5%, pointing to positive momentum as we head into the fourth quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% as continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage balances were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances. 
While we did not retain incremental conforming mortgage originations in the third quarter, we have elected to retain approximately $400 million of our retail mortgage production for the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and we'll continue to evaluate the economic trade-offs given our balance sheet capacity in this environment. Average commercial loans declined 2% compared to the prior quarter due entirely to PPP forgiveness. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased around half of 8% with C&I loans up 2%. Production was robust across the board, up 5% compared to the prior quarter, with both corporate and middle market banking generating record production, which was well diversified geographically. As a result, period-end C&I loans, excluding PPP, increased 4%. 
Revolver utilization of 31% was stable compared to the prior quarter. However, it is worth noting that total commitments have increased approximately $5 billion since the end of last year, driven by new client acquisition and an increase in demand from existing clients in anticipation of future business growth. Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances in mortgage and construction driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic, reflecting our cautious approach to those sectors. Our securities portfolio was stable sequentially. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows but will remain patient on deploying the excess liquidity. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to begin our excess cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. 
We remain optimistic that continued GDP growth in the Fed's eventual tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk-return opportunities in the future. Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash remain elevated, reflecting growth in core deposits since the onset of the pandemic, which are up 6% year-over-year. 
Moving to credit. Our strong credit performance this quarter once again reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, prudent balance sheet management and the continued benefit of fiscal and monetary stimulus programs and improvement in the broader economy. As Greg mentioned, the third quarter net charge-off ratio of 8 basis points was historically low and improved 8 basis points sequentially. Nonperforming assets declined 15% with the NPA ratio declining 9 basis points sequentially to 52 basis points. The decline in criticized assets reflected significant improvements in retail nonessential and leisure, consistent with the reopening of the economy and higher activity in those sectors as well as improvements in our energy and leverage loan portfolios. We continue to focus on segments of nonowner-occupied commercial real estate particularly central business district hotels as activity has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
Moving to the ACL. Our base case macroeconomic scenario is relatively similar to last quarter, which assumes the labor market continues to improve, and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% in the first quarter of 2022 and ending our 3-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. However, our ACL release was lower this quarter as the improvement in the underlying economic forecast decelerated from the second quarter. Additionally, the ACL requirement in the downside scenario worsened compared to the second quarter due to a forecasted slower pace of recovery and a larger increase in unemployment. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $788 million higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $176 million lower. 
While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and lending implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist. Our September 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate for the economic environment would lower unemployment and continued improvement in credit quality. 
Moving to capital. Our capital levels remained strong in the third quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%. During the quarter, we completed $550 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 14.5 million shares compared to the second quarter. We also raised our common dividend $0.03 or 11% to $0.30 per share. Our capital plans support approximately $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021 and we continue to target a 9.5% CET1 by June 2022. 
Moving to our fourth quarter outlook. We expect average total loan balances to increase 2% sequentially, excluding the PPP headwind. Including the PPP impact, we expect average total loans to increase approximately 1%. Our outlook reflects 0.5 point of improvement from commercial revolving line utilization, continued strength in commercial production given our record pipeline and a continued stabilization in paydowns based on activity that we are seeing so far in October. We expect average C&I growth of 4% to 5%, excluding PPP in the fourth quarter, and CRE balances to decline around 1% or so, primarily due to construction constraints. As a result, we anticipate total average commercial loan growth of around 3% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average total consumer loan balances to increase around 1% sequentially, including the impacts of Ginnie Mae forbearance pool purchases in our held-for-sale portfolio. We purchased $300 million during the third quarter, an additional $700 million in early October. 
Given our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, assuming stable securities balances and a $17 million reduction in PPP income. Excluding PPP, we expect fourth quarter NII to be up slightly relative to the third quarter. 
Our guidance indicates full year 2021 NII declines less than 1% compared to full year 2020 despite no meaningful growth in investment securities balances throughout the year, and an average decline in 1-month LIBOR of approximately 40 basis points. We expect NIM to decline 3 to 4 basis points in the fourth quarter, primarily due to loan yield compression. We expect fourth quarter fees to increase around 6% compared to the third quarter and to be up around 8% on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impacts of the TRA. This results in full year 2021 fee growth, excluding the impacts of the TRA of approximately 10% compared to 2020. Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy, resulting in a record full year commercial banking revenue led by 20% growth in capital markets fees, record wealth and asset management revenue up double digits and double-digit growth in card and processing revenue. We expect private equity income to be in the $40 million area in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes a sequential decline in top line mortgage revenue of approximately 40%, with roughly half of that decline due to seasonally lower fourth quarter volumes and declining spreads and half to our decision to retain $400 million in retail production that I mentioned earlier. 
We expect fourth quarter expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued growth in technology investments, servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae loan purchases and continued marketing support related to our rollout of Momentum, offset by disciplined expense management throughout the company and initial savings beginning from our process automation program. As a result, our full year 2021 total core revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in core expenses despite the rate environment. We will have achieved positive operating leverage in a year in which the vast majority of the industry will likely experience an erosion in efficiency. We expect total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter to be in the 10 to 15 basis points range, which would result in full year 2021 charge-offs of 15 basis points or so. 
In summary,  our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A."

First off, we're very encouraged what we're seeing from a production perspective. We've got commercial loan production in the third quarter. '21 was strong at $5.4 billion. That was up from $5.1 billion in the second quarter and $5.2 billion in the third quarter 2019. We expect that production to continue to be stable going into the fourth quarter, so that's encouraging. We expect average loans up 1% with PPP and 2% up without PPP assets. So that's some strength there. We're also seeing line utilization tick up a little bit more in our core middle market, which is nice to see that for change. So when you think about our geographies, what we're seeing right now from a geography perspective, North Carolina, Texas, Cincinnati, Columbus were our top 4 markets from commercial loan growth in Q3, which is encouraging. If you look at 6 regions that had all-time highs, which we're very encouraged with Chicago, Green Rapids, Columbus, Kentucky, North Carolina and Texas. So that felt really good, and we're starting to see once again, some good momentum out there. Net new relationships, something we watch very carefully brought in 419 new commercial relationships year-to-date. Most of that was in core middle market and some of that in March quarter. But net-net, we're seeing good progress out there, good performance. Encouraged by what we're seeing to date as we go into the fourth quarter and then into 2022."

So I had the chance to be out in 8 of our 14 regions this past quarter. I think you get really excellent color when you have an opportunity to sit with clients and with bankers. I mean they're all feeling the shortages as it relates to labor and supply chain. We have hotel operators who are now only cleaning rooms when people leave. As an example, I visited an electronics client out West and asked to see their demo room, and there was nothing but holes in the walls. I said ""Where is the equipment?"" and they had sold all the inventory because they are struggling to get the parts in to be able to fill orders. So all those issues are still real. I think the good news is we are seeing M&A as a catalyst. We're seeing CapEx now as a catalyst, in particular, for businesses that are able to substitute equipment and automation for manual processes. And then bluntly, as Greg mentioned, I think we feel pretty confident that a lot of the improvement we're seeing is just coming from taking share. I mean the relationship count Greg mentioned be higher than where we were at prior to the pandemic. So we'll have taken more new relationships on board this year through 9 months than we had in all of 2018 or 2019, just as an example. So the good general pickup there. It would be great to continue to see a little bit more activity as it relates to utilization as folks try to build inventories and otherwise, it's just -- that's going to be the wildcard for us."

What we're seeing from a line utilization perspective is that the middle market line utilization is up almost 1%, whereas corporate banking continues to trend down. So quarter-over-quarter, that utilization was stable. And if we want to go into the decimals, it was 31.3 at the end of June, and it's 31.1 as we sat here on September 30, but we are starting to see more borrowing demand and pickup in the middle market space as opposed to the corporate banking. And then in terms of pricing, while NIM came in as expected in line with our July guide, we do have the headwind in the C&I yield portfolio because it is very competitive out there. I think, for the most part, banks are competing on price and nonbanks are competing on structure. So for us, the price headwind comes in just a little bit tighter spread, but also some of the reduction in the LIBOR floor. So you lose some of that excess earnings in this environment, but you can perhaps recapture the yield benefit as the Fed starts to move on the front end of the curve, hopefully in the next year to 18 months. So as expected, but certainly a headwind when it comes to pricing."

So that's hurts the yield a bit at 10, 15 basis points or so. If you look out on the bullets themselves, they're at a 2.65% yield with cash flows, I think we're projecting about $7 billion of cash flows in that portfolio over the next 5 years. So there will be a step down should rates stay where they are today. Reinvestment yields right now, I think, are in the [170 to 180] range.  So barring a curve steepener, it will be a slow, but definitely downward trend on the portfolio yield. The good news for us is we're very well positioned, and it is pretty insulated from the environment relative to how the peers have positioned their portfolio."

The one update we have on expense savings in our program for 2022 is that we are targeting $125 million in savings for 2022, and that's a combination of the lean process automation, intelligent operations, the branch closures. We have 42 branches closing in the first quarter of 2022 and then some smaller vendor savings bundled together. So we've tightened the range on that bundle savings from $100 million to $150 million to $125 million. And then obviously, we're not getting into expense guide for 2022 because we'll continue to evaluate how much of those savings will be reinvested into sales force expansion on commercial as well as the wealth and asset management. But we feel good about the progress we're making on the LPA program. In fact, if you look in the press release, buried, I think, at the bottom of Page 14 is an FTE count, and we're down a couple of hundred FTE even with adding about 100 from the Provide acquisition, and that's starting to show the benefit of that LPA savings.

And I expect that should continue into the fourth quarter. And then the other phenomenon on the LIBOR floor is more a consequence of getting through renewal season and some of the other things happening out of the second quarter. So that should dissipate, but that was call it, third half of that yield compression you see in the tables in the earnings release. So as we look ahead, I would expect a couple of -- 2 to 3 bps headwind from C&I loan yield compression for all of those factors into the fourth quarter, and that's why we're guiding the reported NIM down as well for the fourth quarter, similar to what we saw in the third quarter."

I think on top of that, we have done a nice job managing NII and the balance sheet through this environment. And we certainly have dry powder, whether it's through the asset sensitivity or the $33 billion of excess cash that we could choose to deploy to mitigate those effects if need be. But for now, we still think patience is still the way to go. And therefore, if there's a little bit of NIM compression along the way, that's fine.

As you mentioned, operating leverage -- positive operating leverage, that's something we're very focused on. We delivered -- we'll deliver in 2021 as we go into our planning process for 2022, our focus is on positive operating leverage. So as I mentioned earlier, a lot of that -- some of that tech spend is going right to process efficiencies. We were able to take out the 200-plus additional people and so forth, branch closes some of the things that we're working on right now. And on the other expense side of the house supports that positive operating leverage. And we continue to grow fees at a really robust rate, close to 10% CAGR over the last couple of years. So net-net, positive operating leverage is something we're very focused on. We believe we can continue to deliver on. In addition to that, the tech spend will roughly run around 10-plus percent. When you think about the core platform modernization, we talked about the fourth or fifth inning. I think of it more as a cricket test match. It's been going on. It's going to continue to go on for quite some time. We're going to have to deal with that. But at the end of the day, I think as we put these new platforms in, we're able to do in a very systematic way with respect to how we turn these platforms on. So it's not the big bang approach. We're able to turn it on by geography, by product line. So we're very insulated for having to do a big bang impact. With that said, you have some dual system platforms that are going to run simultaneously until we get all markets, all products converted over in the case of some of our major implementations coming up like our core deposit platform. So that's going to take a little bit of time. But at the end of the day, we should be a lot more efficient. We should be able to bring further -- more enhancements at a different case forward to our business. We should be able to continue to take out costs through our Lean process automation and our investments in AI technology. So net-net, tech is going to be a source of spend for us in that range that I mentioned before as we go forward. But net-net, we're getting paid very well for it. Our objective is to go head-to-head with the fintech players, the large bank competitors that we have to deal with and be very successful. And we've been able to do that and demonstrate that. When you think about the fintech players that are out there, we've got the same capabilities. We've got our products like Momentum, but we also got 53,000 free ATMs, 1,100 banking centers and 10,000 service personnel that they don't have, and we got the core relationships. So net-net, we'll continue to stay focused, but that's kind of the range of what we're going to operate in."

So for us, we're running at 18% or so in the securities book as a percent of total assets. So if we take, call it, $10 billion of the excess liquidity and put it into the book, we're at 23%, 24%. That's where I'd like to operate at somewhere 23% to 25% of total assets, but it's not a capacity constraint, it's more, I think, given the environment, that's a more productive place to be. In terms of the CMBS, I think the heart of your question is what is the non-agency CMBS portion of the portfolio, and that's $3.8 billion or so. And again, for us, it's super senior tranches. We feel very good about the credit enhancement, 30-plus percent there. So not a large credit risk position to have, whereas the rest of the CMBS book would be agency guaranteed."

Earlier today, we reported third quarter net income of $704 million or $0.97 per share. On a quarter basis, we earned $0.94 per share. Once again, we delivered strong and steady financial results while fully supporting our customers, communities and employees. 
During the quarter, we generated an adjusted ROTCE of nearly 19%, which represents the fifth straight quarter exceeding 18%. We generated period-end C&I loan growth of 4% compared to the prior quarter, excluding the impact of PPP. Commercial loan production increased 5% from last quarter, representing the strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019. We generated strong consumer household growth of 3% compared to last year, with growth in every region in our footprint, reflecting the continued success of our branch and digital initiatives. And as expected, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our performance this quarter reflected strong business outcomes across our franchise, resulting in improved and diversified revenues. This was combined with disciplined balance sheet management, expense management, we had another quarter of benign credit results. We closed the Provide acquisition and the sale of HSA deposits in the quarter to improve long-term growth and profitability.  Provide, a leading fintech company serving health care practices will further accelerate profitable relationship growth. The sale of our HSA deposits is part of our multiyear strategy to simplify the organization and prioritize investments in order to generate differentiated outcomes for our customers and shareholders. 
Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, adjusted PPNR increased 4% compared to the year ago quarter, highlighting the strong results from our fee-based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial and wealth and asset management. Excluding the impact of PPP, average total loans increased 1% compared to last quarter, reflecting strong commercial loan production as well as strength in our indirect auto through residential mortgage portfolios. Commercial loan production increased 5% sequentially with record quarters in Corporate Banking and Middle Market.  
Despite some of the challenges we have been hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, the strong production was led by our healthcare, renewable energy and retail verticals, it was well diversified geographically. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines and retention of the client relationship all support continued loan growth. As it relates to Provide, we are very pleased with the progress we have seen so far. We are even more excited about the opportunities for continued growth. As we have previously mentioned, we expect strong origination volumes in 2022, reflecting a robust pipeline, and of product capabilities and key talent hires. Provide supports our relationship approach with approximately 2/3 of customers having either a deposit account or a payments relationship with Fifth Third. 
During the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses as well as historically low net charge-offs of 8 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. In addition to historical low credit losses, we experienced another quarter of improvement in criticized assets and NPAs. Our criticized assets declined nearly 20%. Our NPA ratio declined 9 basis points sequentially. Our NPA to NPL ratios this quarter have reverted back to pre-pandemic levels. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs. 
Our balance sheet and earnings power remained very strong. As we've said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities, paying a strong dividend and share repurchases. Bank acquisitions remain a lower priority. I'd like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continually risen to the occasion for our customers, communities and each other. I'm very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate action to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. 
For our customers, we are excited to roll out Jeanie, our new AI-driven digital assistant in the fourth quarter. This will drive targeted marketing capabilities, digital engagement and improved customer retention. For our communities, we made a $15 million contribution to our foundation this quarter as part of our $2.8 billion commitment to accelerate racial equity, equality and inclusion in our communities. In total, we have contributed $40 million in philanthropic support since the end of last year. We continue to make targeted investments to accelerate economic revitalization as you may have seen in last week's announcement, a Fifth Third Neighborhood Investment Program. This innovative initiative further demonstrates our commitment to being an ESG leader in addition to other recent proof points including chairing over $6 billion towards our $8 billion renewable energy goal to be achieved by 2025, announcing a new position about climate risk to focus on identifying, measuring and managing the physical and transition risk of our clients and a robust transparent and peer-leading ESG disclosure. 
In summary, we believe our balancing strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined management throughout the company will serve us well into 2022 and beyond. We expect to generate positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and also for the full year in 2021. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value and consistently producing through-the-cycle top quartile results. 
With that, I'll turn over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook."

We're very pleased with our financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported earnings included a $21 million after-tax benefit or $0.03 per share from the 3 items noted on Page 2 of the release. Our strong business performance of the bank is reflected in our return metrics. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.32% and an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of 18.7%. 
Improvements in our loan portfolio credit quality resulted in a $63 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 200 basis points compared to 206 last quarter. Combined with our historically low net charge-offs, we had a $42 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. 
Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting the benefits of our balance sheet positioning, continuing benefits from PPP income and income from our Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases. Our NII results relative to the second quarter included a $6 million reduction in PPP income, a $4 million decline in prepayment penalties in our investment portfolio and the impact of lower earning asset yields, partially offset by a higher day count and a reduction in long-term debt. Our allocation to bullet and locked-out structures is currently 60% of the total investment portfolio, which is expected to continue to provide ongoing NII protection in this low rate environment. 
On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs another basis point this quarter to 4 basis points. With a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion of excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low, given our securities portfolio and derivatives. 
Total reported noninterest income increased 13% sequentially, impacted by a $60 million gain associated with the disposition of HSA deposits as previously communicated. Adjusted noninterest income increased 3%, driven by strong mortgage banking, treasury management, leasing and wealth and asset management revenues. Commercial Banking revenue, which achieved record results for the past 2 quarters remained solid as strength in M&A advisory fees, particularly in our health care vertical was more than offset by lower corporate bond fees. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 13% with improvement in every single caption, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year. Our total noninterest revenue was 41% of total revenue in the third quarter. Reported noninterest expense increased 2% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the $15 million foundation contribution. Adjusted expenses were flat sequentially as an increase in marketing expense associated with Momentum Banking and increased T&E expense were offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expense. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest expense increased 2%, primarily driven by an increase in performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results, servicing expenses associated with Ginnie Mae loan purchases and the impact of the Provide acquisition. These items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiation and lower net occupancy expense. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 13% compared to just 2% expense growth. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases declined half of 8% sequentially, including the headwind from PPP loans. Excluding PPP, average loans and leases increased 1%, with period-end loans up 1.5%, pointing to positive momentum as we head into the fourth quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% as continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage balances were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances. 
While we did not retain incremental conforming mortgage originations in the third quarter, we have elected to retain approximately $400 million of our retail mortgage production for the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and we'll continue to evaluate the economic trade-offs given our balance sheet capacity in this environment. Average commercial loans declined 2% compared to the prior quarter due entirely to PPP forgiveness. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased around half of 8% with C&I loans up 2%. Production was robust across the board, up 5% compared to the prior quarter, with both corporate and middle market banking generating record production, which was well diversified geographically. As a result, period-end C&I loans, excluding PPP, increased 4%. 
Revolver utilization of 31% was stable compared to the prior quarter. However, it is worth noting that total commitments have increased approximately $5 billion since the end of last year, driven by new client acquisition and an increase in demand from existing clients in anticipation of future business growth. Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances in mortgage and construction driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic, reflecting our cautious approach to those sectors. Our securities portfolio was stable sequentially. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows but will remain patient on deploying the excess liquidity. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to begin our excess cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. 
We remain optimistic that continued GDP growth in the Fed's eventual tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk-return opportunities in the future. Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash remain elevated, reflecting growth in core deposits since the onset of the pandemic, which are up 6% year-over-year. 
Moving to credit. Our strong credit performance this quarter once again reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, prudent balance sheet management and the continued benefit of fiscal and monetary stimulus programs and improvement in the broader economy. As Greg mentioned, the third quarter net charge-off ratio of 8 basis points was historically low and improved 8 basis points sequentially. Nonperforming assets declined 15% with the NPA ratio declining 9 basis points sequentially to 52 basis points. The decline in criticized assets reflected significant improvements in retail nonessential and leisure, consistent with the reopening of the economy and higher activity in those sectors as well as improvements in our energy and leverage loan portfolios. We continue to focus on segments of nonowner-occupied commercial real estate particularly central business district hotels as activity has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
Moving to the ACL. Our base case macroeconomic scenario is relatively similar to last quarter, which assumes the labor market continues to improve, and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% in the first quarter of 2022 and ending our 3-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. However, our ACL release was lower this quarter as the improvement in the underlying economic forecast decelerated from the second quarter. Additionally, the ACL requirement in the downside scenario worsened compared to the second quarter due to a forecasted slower pace of recovery and a larger increase in unemployment. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $788 million higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $176 million lower. 
While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and lending implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist. Our September 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate for the economic environment would lower unemployment and continued improvement in credit quality. 
Moving to capital. Our capital levels remained strong in the third quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%. During the quarter, we completed $550 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 14.5 million shares compared to the second quarter. We also raised our common dividend $0.03 or 11% to $0.30 per share. Our capital plans support approximately $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021 and we continue to target a 9.5% CET1 by June 2022. 
Moving to our fourth quarter outlook. We expect average total loan balances to increase 2% sequentially, excluding the PPP headwind. Including the PPP impact, we expect average total loans to increase approximately 1%. Our outlook reflects 0.5 point of improvement from commercial revolving line utilization, continued strength in commercial production given our record pipeline and a continued stabilization in paydowns based on activity that we are seeing so far in October. We expect average C&I growth of 4% to 5%, excluding PPP in the fourth quarter, and CRE balances to decline around 1% or so, primarily due to construction constraints. As a result, we anticipate total average commercial loan growth of around 3% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average total consumer loan balances to increase around 1% sequentially, including the impacts of Ginnie Mae forbearance pool purchases in our held-for-sale portfolio. We purchased $300 million during the third quarter, an additional $700 million in early October. 
Given our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, assuming stable securities balances and a $17 million reduction in PPP income. Excluding PPP, we expect fourth quarter NII to be up slightly relative to the third quarter. 
Our guidance indicates full year 2021 NII declines less than 1% compared to full year 2020 despite no meaningful growth in investment securities balances throughout the year, and an average decline in 1-month LIBOR of approximately 40 basis points. We expect NIM to decline 3 to 4 basis points in the fourth quarter, primarily due to loan yield compression. We expect fourth quarter fees to increase around 6% compared to the third quarter and to be up around 8% on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impacts of the TRA. This results in full year 2021 fee growth, excluding the impacts of the TRA of approximately 10% compared to 2020. Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy, resulting in a record full year commercial banking revenue led by 20% growth in capital markets fees, record wealth and asset management revenue up double digits and double-digit growth in card and processing revenue. We expect private equity income to be in the $40 million area in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes a sequential decline in top line mortgage revenue of approximately 40%, with roughly half of that decline due to seasonally lower fourth quarter volumes and declining spreads and half to our decision to retain $400 million in retail production that I mentioned earlier. 
We expect fourth quarter expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued growth in technology investments, servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae loan purchases and continued marketing support related to our rollout of Momentum, offset by disciplined expense management throughout the company and initial savings beginning from our process automation program. As a result, our full year 2021 total core revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in core expenses despite the rate environment. We will have achieved positive operating leverage in a year in which the vast majority of the industry will likely experience an erosion in efficiency. We expect total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter to be in the 10 to 15 basis points range, which would result in full year 2021 charge-offs of 15 basis points or so. 
In summary,  our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A."

Let me start off, and then I'll flip it over to Tim, and maybe Jamie. First off, we're very encouraged what we're seeing from a production perspective. We've got commercial loan production in the third quarter. '21 was strong at $5.4 billion",257,"This is Greg. Let me start off, and then I'll flip it over to Tim, and maybe Jamie. First off, we're very encouraged what we're seeing from a production perspective. We've got commercial loan production in the third quarter. '21 was strong at $5.4 billion. That was up from $5.1 billion in the second quarter and $5.2 billion in the third quarter 2019. We expect that production to continue to be stable going into the fourth quarter, so that's encouraging. We expect average loans up 1% with PPP and 2% up without PPP assets. So that's some strength there. We're also seeing line utilization tick up a little bit more in our core middle market, which is nice to see that for change. So when you think about our geographies, what we're seeing right now from a geography perspective, North Carolina, Texas, Cincinnati, Columbus were our top 4 markets from commercial loan growth in Q3, which is encouraging. If you look at 6 regions that had all-time highs, which we're very encouraged with Chicago, Green Rapids, Columbus, Kentucky, North Carolina and Texas. So that felt really good, and we're starting to see once again, some good momentum out there. Net new relationships, something we watch very carefully brought in 419 new commercial relationships year-to-date. Most of that was in core middle market and some of that in March quarter. But net-net, we're seeing good progress out there, good performance. Encouraged by what we're seeing to date as we go into the fourth quarter and then into 2022."

So I had the chance to be out in 8 of our 14 regions this past quarter. I think you get really excellent color when you have an opportunity to sit with clients and with bankers. I mean they're all feeling the shortages as it relates to labor and supply chain. We have hotel operators who are now only cleaning rooms when people leave. As an example, I visited an electronics client out West and asked to see their demo room, and there was nothing but holes in the walls. I said ""Where is the equipment?"" and they had sold all the inventory because they are struggling to get the parts in to be able to fill orders. So all those issues are still real. I think the good news is we are seeing M&A as a catalyst. We're seeing CapEx now as a catalyst, in particular, for businesses that are able to substitute equipment and automation for manual processes. And then bluntly, as Greg mentioned, I think we feel pretty confident that a lot of the improvement we're seeing is just coming from taking share. I mean the relationship count Greg mentioned be higher than where we were at prior to the pandemic. So we'll have taken more new relationships on board this year through 9 months than we had in all of 2018 or 2019, just as an example. So the good general pickup there. It would be great to continue to see a little bit more activity as it relates to utilization as folks try to build inventories and otherwise, it's just -- that's going to be the wildcard for us."

What we're seeing from a line utilization perspective is that the middle market line utilization is up almost 1%, whereas corporate banking continues to trend down. So quarter-over-quarter, that utilization was stable. And if we want to go into the decimals, it was 31.3 at the end of June, and it's 31.1 as we sat here on September 30, but we are starting to see more borrowing demand and pickup in the middle market space as opposed to the corporate banking. And then in terms of pricing, while NIM came in as expected in line with our July guide, we do have the headwind in the C&I yield portfolio because it is very competitive out there. I think, for the most part, banks are competing on price and nonbanks are competing on structure. So for us, the price headwind comes in just a little bit tighter spread, but also some of the reduction in the LIBOR floor. So you lose some of that excess earnings in this environment, but you can perhaps recapture the yield benefit as the Fed starts to move on the front end of the curve, hopefully in the next year to 18 months. So as expected, but certainly a headwind when it comes to pricing."

If you look out on the bullets themselves, they're at a 2.65% yield with cash flows, I think we're projecting about $7 billion of cash flows in that portfolio over the next 5 years. So there will be a step down should rates stay where they are today. Reinvestment yields right now, I think, are in the [170 to 180] range.  So barring a curve steepener, it will be a slow, but definitely downward trend on the portfolio yield. The good news for us is we're very well positioned, and it is pretty insulated from the environment relative to how the peers have positioned their portfolio."

So we've tightened the range on that bundle savings from $100 million to $150 million to $125 million. And then obviously, we're not getting into expense guide for 2022 because we'll continue to evaluate how much of those savings will be reinvested into sales force expansion on commercial as well as the wealth and asset management. But we feel good about the progress we're making on the LPA program. In fact, if you look in the press release, buried, I think, at the bottom of Page 14 is an FTE count, and we're down a couple of hundred FTE even with adding about 100 from the Provide acquisition, and that's starting to show the benefit of that LPA savings.

And then over years 3, 4, 5, then you start to have cash flow portfolio-ing. But right now, the total book -- bullets as well as the cash flowing securities, we're in a 2.75% yield, give or take. And then for the fourth quarter, yield should be a little bit better than that with a little bit of seasonal mutual fund dividends in the [indiscernible] plus a little bit of prepayment penalties that have occurred thus far in October."

And we certainly have dry powder, whether it's through the asset sensitivity or the $33 billion of excess cash that we could choose to deploy to mitigate those effects if need be.

We were able to take out the 200-plus additional people and so forth, branch closes some of the things that we're working on right now. And on the other expense side of the house supports that positive operating leverage. And we continue to grow fees at a really robust rate, close to 10% CAGR over the last couple of years. So net-net, positive operating leverage is something we're very focused on. We believe we can continue to deliver on. In addition to that, the tech spend will roughly run around 10-plus percent. When you think about the core platform modernization, we talked about the fourth or fifth inning. I think of it more as a cricket test match. It's been going on. It's going to continue to go on for quite some time. We're going to have to deal with that. But at the end of the day, I think as we put these new platforms in, we're able to do in a very systematic way with respect to how we turn these platforms on. So it's not the big bang approach. We're able to turn it on by geography, by product line. So we're very insulated for having to do a big bang impact. With that said, you have some dual system platforms that are going to run simultaneously until we get all markets, all products converted over in the case of some of our major implementations coming up like our core deposit platform. So that's going to take a little bit of time. But at the end of the day, we should be a lot more efficient. We should be able to bring further -- more enhancements at a different case forward to our business. We should be able to continue to take out costs through our Lean process automation and our investments in AI technology. So net-net, tech is going to be a source of spend for us in that range that I mentioned before as we go forward. But net-net, we're getting paid very well for it. Our objective is to go head-to-head with the fintech players, the large bank competitors that we have to deal with and be very successful. And we've been able to do that and demonstrate that. When you think about the fintech players that are out there, we've got the same capabilities. We've got our products like Momentum, but we also got 53,000 free ATMs, 1,100 banking centers and 10,000 service personnel that they don't have, and we got the core relationships. So net-net, we'll continue to stay focused, but that's kind of the range of what we're going to operate in."
