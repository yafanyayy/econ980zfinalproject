The company reported record quarterly net income of $312 million or $1.67 per share. Despite the heightened catastrophes experienced by the industry, and slowdown in the economic environment due to global pandemic, our financials significantly improved in the quarter. This improvement was evidenced in our current accident year combined ratio of 88.8% and strong investment income and net investment gains which contributed to an annualized quarterly return on equity of 20.6%. Starting first with our top line. Growth in our gross premiums written accelerated through the year with fourth quarter representing growth of 9.3%. Similarly, net premiums written grew by 8.2% to approximately $1.8 billion in the quarter. All lines of business grew in the insurance segment with the exception of workers' compensation. 
Professional liability led this growth with 29.6%, followed by commercial auto of 20.6%, other liability of 10.6% and short-tail lines of 2%. Growth in the reinsurance and monoline excess segment was 16.8%, bringing net premiums written to $205 million. Casualty reinsurance led this growth with 21.2% and followed by 9.3% in property reinsurance and 6% in monoline excess. Rate improvement, along with lower claims frequency and non-cap property losses contributed to our improvement in underwriting income of 44.2% to $165 million. Offsetting this improvement were higher catastrophe losses resulting from natural cats and COVID-19 related losses. We recognized $42 million of total catastrophe losses in the quarter or 2.3 loss ratio points, of which, 1.5 loss ratio points relates to COVID-19. You will see in our earnings release supplemental information that the cat losses for the reinsurance in monoline excess segment is negative due to a reclass of COVID-19 IBNR to the insurance segment. 
The current quarter's natural cat losses compare favorably with the prior year quarter of $20 million or 1.2 loss ratio points. The reported loss ratio was 61.3% in the current quarter compared with 62.4% in 2019. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $4 million or 0.2 loss ratio points in the current quarter. Accordingly, our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 59.2% compared with 61.4% a year ago. Rounding out the combined ratio, we benefited from an improving expense ratio of 1.3 points to 29.6%. We continue to benefit from growth in net premiums earned at 5.6%, which outpaced an increase in underwriting expenses of 1.2%. 
In addition, the expense ratio is benefiting from reduced costs impacted by the global pandemic, including travel and entertainment. This contributes a benefit of more than 50 basis points to the expense ratio. 
Touching on investments. Net investment income for the quarter increased 32% to approximately $181 million. The increase was driven by investment fund income of $53 million due to market value adjustments and arbitrage trading income of $26 million, in large part coming from investments in special purpose acquisition companies. Investment income from the fixed maturity portfolio declined due to lower reinvestment yields compared with the roll-off of securities due to maturities, calls and pay downs. In addition, we continue to maintain a cash and cash equivalent position of approximately $2.4 billion, enabling us to maintain a relatively short duration of 2.4 years and significant liquidity. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $163 million is primarily attributable to realized gains of $127 million and changes in unrealized gains on equity securities of $36 million. 
As previously announced, the realized gain was largely driven by the sale of a real estate investment in New York City, which resulted in a gain of $105 million. Foreign currency losses in the quarter were driven by the weakening U.S. dollar. 2 items of note. First, you'll see that on a year-to-date basis, we were about breakeven; second, the loss in the quarterly income statement is offset considerably by the increase in stockholders' equity. In the quarter, our unrealized currency translation loss improved by $66 million,   $7 million  . As a reminder, expenses included a nonrecurring cost of $8.4 million relating to the redemption of our $350 million subordinated debentures in the quarter. Stockholders per share before share repurchases and dividends increased $6 million in stockholders' equity. After share repurchases of approximately 6.4 million shares for $346 million at an average price per share of $54.43 and ordinary dividends totaling $84 million. That brings total return to shareholders of $430 million in the year. 
Finally, the company had strong cash flow from operations in the quarter of $480 million, and more than $1.6 billion for the full year, an increase of more than 41%. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob."

[Audio Gap] Something to babble on about for a relatively brief amount of time. So from my perspective, and I believe from our perspective, the market is clearly in the throws of firming. When we look at the marketplace, is of what we saw, at least at this stage in   86  , no, clearly not. There is not a vacuum when it comes to capacity. But clearly, there is a recognition within the industry amongst carriers that capacity is not going to be bold out in such a casual manner as it has been done in the past. And when it is provided, it will be with a lens towards a more appropriate rate associated with that. When we look at the marketplace over all, we think this is very appropriate. And whether it will prove to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and into 2002 and '03, we'll only see what the time, but the reality is no cycle looks like any other cycle. 
All that being said, when we look at Q4 and when we think about our own business, every product line at this stage with the exception of workers' compensation, we believe is achieving rate in excess of loss cost. And quite frankly, that is appropriate and necessary. When you think about where trend is and in addition to that, when you think about the realities of what one can expect from the investment income portfolio, particularly around the fixed income, we do need to be pushing full rate and driving down the combined ratio further in order to achieve a sensible risk-adjusted return. 
Just assures different product lines go at this [Audio Gap] on in the much of the PL market, also, the excess and umbrella market is quite firm as well. Property continues to be notably hard and auto, I would suggest, is also quite firm. One of the laggard has been primary GL, and we've been pleased to see over the past couple of quarters that seems to be building some momentum. And we think that's really important given what's going on, on the social inflation front and again as well as the realities of investment income. And as mentioned in prior calls and just a couple of moments ago, workers' comp does continue to be the outlier. Having said that, we continue to believe that's in the early stages of bottoming out and would expect that to be reversing direction by the end of -- or later part or end of '21, excuse me. 
Just on the topic of rate. From our perspective, we think that there are many market participants that have a good deal of catching up to do. When we think about the past several years, there have been moments where, quite frankly, it's been a little bit lonely when we've been pushing for rate. As you may have picked up in the release ex-comp, we got 15.5-ish points of rate. In the quarter, if you go by 9 points of rate, Q4 '18, 4.8, Q4 '17, 2.3, Q4 '16, we got a point of rate. We think that there are many parts -- market participants that have not been pushing for rate for an extended period of time. And again, we are going to see them needing to catch up, and they are going to need to catch a moving target. One other comment that I would just make on this front related to rate and loss costs and how people think about rate adequacy. It would appear as though there are some market participants that may be thinking about loss costs slightly differently than how we think about loss costs. When we look at the current circumstance, I think it's very clear that severity is on the rise for much of the liability market. 
And recently, as a result of COVID-19, there are certainly many parts of the market that have experienced somewhat of a benign period when it comes to frequency. And our observation is that some may be in for a little bit of a route awakening hopefully, sooner rather than later when COVID is somewhat behind us, we see frequency return to a more traditional normal and that severity trend continues to take off like a rocket ship for the foreseeable future as we [Audio Gap] in the industry. 
So when we look at the situation, here's sort of the short version. Policy count is up a little bit. Rate is up, but the number -- the amount of revenue or a number of widgets, if you will, that our insurers are producing is down. So what does that mean? That means that we are reasonably well positioned and you will see in all likelihood, from my perspective [Audio Gap] even with those policies that we've already issued because, again, there is a catch-up in our audit activities. 
Just a couple of other things quickly on the expense ratio. Again, Rich covered this pretty thoroughly. I would just offer a couple of quick [Audio Gap] reduction of activity on our end with travel and entertainment and so on that, that will one of these days come back. But we are actively looking at what does return to work look like for us. We certainly expect that people will be back in the office but will the travel be the same? Or were there opportunities to learn through this period of time where maybe travel will not have to return to what it once was. That all being said, the reality is that we envision the business growing considerably more and as the economy opens back up, and in addition to that, these higher rates, which will also contribute to the higher earned premium coming through will help out on that front. 
On the loss ratio front, obviously, there was some improvement there. We also have heard some commentary from some really asking, given all the rate increases the answer is [Audio Gap] that we're in the past. The simple reality is we do not know what the legal system is going to look like and what that is going to mean for loss cost activity once the economy opens back up. And we see the legal system, particularly the courts, operating at more of a traditional level. 
Having said all this, let me share with you just a quick observation. If 1 were hypothetically to look at our loss ratio that we had in 2020, and one were to apply a healthy level of trend, just to pick a number arbitrarily, a handful of points. And then one were to apply the type of rate increases earning through that we have been achieving, I think that gives you a reasonable indication as to what the math may look like. 
One other piece that one could factor in, hypothetically speaking, would be it is perhaps reasonable to a -- a reasonable assumption and obviously, there is significant loss associated with the pandemic and our 2020 numbers. So some might suggest that we're being a little bit optimistic. But quite frankly, when the day is all done, it's pretty simple, straightforward math. 
Just on the investment portfolio, again, I'm not going to repeat what you already heard from Rich, but again, it was a strong quarter, both as far as the gains we have shared with people in the past that on the realized gain front, it's a [Audio Gap] returns are going to be lumpy. Hen flowing in on average, give or take, $25 million a quarter is what we've suggested to people in the past. We still think that's appropriate, and there are going to be moments in time where they feel like there's a bit of a drought, and there are going to be moments in time where it feels like it's raining money. But on average, we think we get great risk-adjusted returns and again, the same thing applies to the funds. As we have suggested to people, there are going to be moments when the funds do great. They're going to be moments where the funds are lagging a little bit. But on average, we suggested that [Audio Gap] Rich mentioned, and I know we talked about this last quarter, how the duration is sitting there at about 2.4 years. We continue to have a view that 1 does not get [Audio Gap]. When we look at -- when we do the math, when we look at the numbers [Audio Gap]. The book value will be approximately $160 million.

The company reported record quarterly net income of $312 million or $1.67 per share. Despite the heightened catastrophes experienced by the industry and slowdown in the economic environment due to global pandemic, our financials significantly improved in the quarter. This improvement was evidenced in our current accident year combined ratio ex cats of 88.8% and strong investment income and net investment gains, which contributed to an annualized quarterly return on equity of 20.6%. 
Starting first with our top line. Growth in our gross premiums written accelerated through the year with fourth quarter representing growth of 9.3%. Similarly, net premiums written grew by 8.2% to approximately $1.8 billion in the quarter. All lines of business grew in the insurance segment with the exception of workers' compensation, increasing net premiums written by 7.2% to approximately $1.6 billion.
Professional liability led this growth with 29.6%, followed by commercial auto of 20.6%, other liability of 10.6% and short-tail lines of 2%. 
Growth in the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment was 16.8%, bringing net premiums written to $205 million. Casualty reinsurance led this growth with 21.2%, followed by 9.3% in property reinsurance and 6% in monoline excess. Rate improvement, along with lower claims frequency and noncat property losses contributed to our improvement in underwriting income of 44.2% to $165 million. Offsetting this improvement were higher catastrophe losses resulting from natural cats and COVID-19-related losses. We recognized $42 million of total catastrophe losses in the quarter or 2.3 loss ratio points, of which, 1.5 loss ratio points relates to COVID-19. You will see in our earnings release supplemental information that the cat losses for the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment is negative due to a reclass of COVID-19 IBNR to the insurance segment. 
The current quarter's natural cat losses compare favorably with the prior year quarter of $20 million or 1.2 loss ratio points. The reported loss ratio was 61.3% in the current quarter compared with 62.4% in 2019. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $4 million or 0.2 loss ratio points in the current quarter. Accordingly, our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 59.2% compared with 61.4% a year ago. Rounding out the combined ratio, we benefited from an improving expense ratio of 1.3 points to 29.6%. We continue to benefit from growth in net premiums earned at 5.6%, which outpaced an increase in underwriting expenses of 1.2%.
In addition, the expense ratio is benefiting from reduced costs impacted by the global pandemic, including travel and entertainment. This contributes a benefit of more than 50 basis points to the expense ratio.
Touching on investments. Net investment income for the quarter increased 32% to approximately $181 million. The increase was driven by investment fund income of $53 million due to market value adjustments and arbitrage trading income of $26 million, in large part coming from investments in special purpose acquisition companies. Investment income from the fixed maturity portfolio declined due to lower reinvestment yields compared with the roll-off of securities due to maturities, calls and pay downs. In addition, we continue to maintain a cash and cash equivalent position of approximately $2.4 billion, enabling us to maintain a relatively short duration of 2.4 years and significant liquidity. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $163 million is primarily attributable to realized gains of $127 million and changes in unrealized gains on equity securities of $36 million.
As previously announced, the realized gain was largely driven by the sale of a real estate investment in New York City, which resulted in a gain of $105 million. Foreign currency losses in the quarter were driven by the weakening U.S. dollar. Two items of note: first, you'll see that on a year-to-date basis, we were about breakeven; second, the loss in the quarterly income statement is offset considerably by the increase in stockholders' equity. 
In the quarter, our unrealized currency translation loss improved by $66 million, resulting in a net equity pickup of approximately $47 million. As a reminder, expenses included a nonrecurring cost of $8.4 million relating to the redemption of our $350 million subordinated debentures in the quarter. Stockholders' equity increased 5.3% in the quarter, and book value per share before share repurchases and dividends increased 6.1%. We ended the year with more than $6.3 billion in stockholders' equity after share repurchases of approximately 6.4 million shares for $346 million at an average price per share of $54.43 and ordinary dividends totaling $84 million. That brings total return to shareholders of $430 million in the year.
Finally, the company had strong cash flow from operations in the quarter of $480 million, and more than $1.6 billion for the full year, an increase of more than 41%.
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob. Thank you."

So from my perspective, and I believe from our perspective, the market is clearly in the",2096,"Okay. Rich, thank you very much. Very complete, you leave me nothing to say, but I'll come up with something to babble on about for a relatively brief amount of time. So from my perspective, and I believe from our perspective, the market is clearly in the throws of firming. When we look at the marketplace, is it what we saw, at least at this stage, in '86? No, clearly not. There is not a vacuum when it comes to capacity. But clearly, there is a recognition within the industry amongst carriers that capacity is not going to be built out in such a casual manner as it has been done in the past. And when it is provided, it will be with a lens towards a more appropriate rate associated with that. When we look at the marketplace over all, we think this is very appropriate. And whether it will prove to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and into 2002 and '03, we'll only see with time, but the reality is no cycle looks like any other cycle.
All that being said, when we look at Q4 and when we think about our own business, every product line at this stage with the exception of workers' compensation, we believe, is achieving rate in excess of loss costs And quite frankly, that is appropriate and necessary. When you think about where trend is and in addition to that, when you think about the realities of what one can expect from the investment income portfolio, particularly around the fixed income, we do need to be pushing full rate and driving down the combined ratio further in order to achieve a sensible risk-adjusted return.
[indiscernible] different product lines to go. At this stage, we are seeing meaningful firming continuing in the much of PL market, also, the excess and umbrella market is quite firm as well. Property continues to be notably hard, and auto, I would suggest, is also quite firm. One of the laggards has been primary GL, and we've been pleased to see over the past couple of quarters, it seems to be building some momentum. And we think that's really important given what's going on, on the social inflation front and again as well as the realities of investment income. And as mentioned in prior calls and just a couple of moments ago, workers' comp does continue to be the outlier. Having said that, we continue to believe that's in the early stages of bottoming out and would expect that to be reversing direction by the end of -- or later part or end of -- '21, excuse me.
Just on the topic of rate. From our perspective, we think that there are many market participants that have a good deal of catching up to do. When we think about the past several years, there have been moments where, quite frankly, it's been a little bit lonely when we've been pushing for rate. As you may have picked up in the release, ex-comp, we got 15.5-ish points of rate in the quarter. If you go back a year earlier to Q4 '19, we were getting just shy of 9 points of rate; Q4 '18, 4 points of rate; Q4 '17, 2.3; Q4 '16, we got 1 point of rate. We think that there are many parts -- market participants that have not been pushing for rate for an extended period of time. And again, we are going to see them needing to catch up, and they are going to need to catch a moving target. 
One other comment that I would just make on this front related to rate and loss costs and how people think about rate adequacy. It would appear as though there are some market participants that may be thinking about loss costs slightly differently than how we think about loss costs. When we look at the current circumstance, I think it's very clear that severity is on the rise for much of the liability market.
And recently, as a result of COVID-19, there are certainly many parts of the market that have experienced somewhat of a benign period when it comes to frequency. And our observation is that some may be in for a little bit of a rude awakening hopefully, sooner rather than later when COVID is somewhat behind us, we see frequency return to a more traditional normal, and that severity trend continues to take off like a rocket ship for the foreseeable future as we've been discussing.
Turning to our quarter. As Rich referenced, pretty healthy growth on the top line, the gross was up about 9%, the net was up about 8%. And obviously, the rate increase that we mentioned earlier is a big contributor to that. We've gotten the question from time to time, from our folks just saying,""Hey, help me do the math. So you're getting 15 points of rate in this quarter or so, but you're only growing a smaller amount. What's going on? Are you shrinking your business from an exposure perspective?"" And the answer to the question is yes and no. What I mean by that is our policy count is actually up a bit. But what's actually going on is that our insurers, while we may be selling more policies, and that number is growing, many of the insurers' business activity and -- particularly measured in their revenue, which we place the policies off of, is down as a result of this economic activity in the industry.
So when we look at the situation, here's sort of the short version. Policy count is up a little bit, rate is up, but the number -- the amount of revenue or number of widgets, if you will, that our insurers are producing is down. So what does that mean? That means that we are reasonably well positioned for growth when the economy starts to open back up, and you will see in all likelihood, from my perspective, a notable catch-up in audit premiums as the revenue begins to pick up even with those policies that we've already issued because, again, there is a catch-up in our audit activities.
Just a couple of other things quickly on the expense ratio. Again, Rich covered this pretty thoroughly. I would just offer a couple of quick [indiscernible]. One, the 15 basis point benefit, if you will, that the expense ratio is getting as a result of the reduction of activity on our end with travel and entertainment and so on that will one of these days come back. But we are actively looking at what does return to work look like for us. We certainly expect that people will be back in the office, but will the travel be the same, or were there opportunities to learn through this period of time where maybe travel will not have to return to what it once was? That all being said, the reality is that we envision the business growing considerably more and as the economy opens back up, and in addition to that, these higher rates, which will also contribute to the higher earned premium coming through will help out on that front.
On the loss ratio front, obviously, there was some improvement there. We also have heard some commentary from some really asking, ""Given all the rate increases why are we not seeing more improvement in the loss ratio?"" Short answer is that we're trying to be, as always, very measured and not declaring victory prematurely. As we've shared with some in the past, the simple reality is we do not know what the legal system is going to look like and what that is going to mean for loss cost activity once the economy opens back up and we see the legal system, particularly the courts, operating at more of a traditional level.
Having said all this, let me share with you just a quick observation. If one were hypothetically to look at our loss ratio that we had in 2020, and one were to apply a healthy level of trend, just to pick a number arbitrarily, a handful of points, and then one were to apply the type of rate increases earning through that we have been achieving, I think that gives you a reasonable indication as to what the math may look like.
One other piece that one could factor in, hypothetically speaking, would be it is perhaps reasonable to, a reasonable assumption I should say, that a pandemic will not happen every year, and obviously, there is significant loss associated with the pandemic in our 2020 numbers. So some might suggest that we're being a little bit optimistic, but quite frankly, when the day is all done, it's pretty simple, straightforward math.
Just on the investment portfolio, again, I'm not going to repeat what you already heard from Rich, but again, it was a strong quarter, both as far as the gains we have shared with people in the past that on the realized gain front, it's going to be lumpy. And quite frankly, our alternative returns are going to be lumpy. 
Hence, going in, on average, give or take, $25 million a quarter is what we've suggested to people in the past. We still think that's appropriate, and there are going to be moments in time where it may feel like there's a bit of a drought, and there are going to be moments in time where it feels like it's raining money. But on average, we think we get great risk-adjusted returns. 
And again, the same thing applies to the funds. As we have suggested to people, there are going to be moments when the funds do great. They're going to be moments where the funds are lagging a little bit. But on average, we've suggested that pencil in high teen probably $20 million a quarter. 
Rich mentioned, and I know we talked about this last quarter, how the duration is sitting there at about 2.4 years. We continue to have a view that one does not get rewarded for taking the duration out or going out on the yield curve. When we look at -- when we do the math, when we look at the numbers, yes, we could take it -- the duration back out a bit, but the simple fact is that if you move rate up, call it, or model in 100 basis points or so, the impact on a quarterly basis, we will pick up after tax, give or take, maybe $5 million. But if you move rate up 100 basis points, the impact on book value will be approximately $160 million. So we are, at this stage, prepared to live with the slightly lower book yield and maintain the flexibility, the high quality and the liquidity, and we think that makes sense.
One last topic for me is Lifson Re. You may have picked up the announcement we made just in time for the [indiscernible]. This is a vehicle that we created to sit side by side with our traditional reinsurance partners. We remain very committed to traditional reinsurance, but we felt as though that this was a good platform to sit side by side. 
We're very fortunate to have 2 outstanding partners in Lifson Re. And while there certainly are plenty of people to partner with, these 2 institutions, not only are financially well healed, but they are 2 organizations that are both thoughtful, sophisticated with tremendous expertise in the insurance industry, and they are truly partners. 
In addition to that, it was very important to us that there is a shared view around the topic of risk-adjusted return and a shared sense of obligation and duty to capital. 
So since people tend to unplug right after the Q&A, I'll just tuck-in my parting comments now. And that is while some might suggest that I sound a bit -- excuse me, optimistic. And some might even suggest that it is a genetic flaw of being overly optimistic. I think the simple reality of the situation is all you need to do is look at the facts and do the math. And if one were to go down that path and look at the facts and do the math, I think it paints a pretty clear picture for what the next several years look like for this organization. 
So I'm going to pause there. And Christine, at this time, we would like to open it up for questions."

But what I can tell you is this: For policies that were written during '19 that were providing coverage during 2020 or policies that were written early in '20, obviously, the expectation that many of those insurers had was that their revenue in all likelihood would be significantly above what it turned out to be when much of the economy shut down. And obviously, that had an impact on their revenue. 
So what I'm suggesting is if you assume that at some point during 2021, the economy begins to more meaningfully open up in this country and other economies around the world, I think what you will see is when people go out to do audits, the economic activity was more than they had estimated for 2021, and there will be a lot of premium catch-up through the audit process. I.e., if I own a store and I buy a policy today, I'm probably estimating that my revenue is going to be considerably less perhaps than it was in 2019. But if the economy opens back up, my revenue, in all likelihood, will open -- will pick up considerably. And when the insurance company goes out and does an audit to see what your revenues were, you will owe the insurance company considerable premium. And there will be a catch-up."

Good evening, everyone. The company reported record quarterly net income of $312 million or $1.67 per share.

The company reported record quarterly net income of $312 million or $1.67 per share. Despite the heightened catastrophes experienced by the industry and slowdown in the economic environment due to global pandemic, our financials significantly improved in the quarter. This improvement was evidenced in our current accident year combined ratio ex cats of 88.8% and strong investment income and net investment gains, which contributed to an annualized quarterly return on equity of 20.6%. 
Starting first with our top line. Growth in our gross premiums written accelerated through the year with fourth quarter representing growth of 9.3%. Similarly, net premiums written grew by 8.2% to approximately $1.8 billion in the quarter. All lines of business grew in the insurance segment with the exception of workers' compensation, increasing net premiums written by 7.2% to approximately $1.6 billion.
Professional liability led this growth with 29.6%, followed by commercial auto of 20.6%, other liability of 10.6% and short-tail lines of 2%. 
Growth in the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment was 16.8%, bringing net premiums written to $205 million. Casualty reinsurance led this growth with 21.2%, followed by 9.3% in property reinsurance and 6% in monoline excess. Rate improvement, along with lower claims frequency and noncat property losses contributed to our improvement in underwriting income of 44.2% to $165 million. Offsetting this improvement were higher catastrophe losses resulting from natural cats and COVID-19-related losses. We recognized $42 million of total catastrophe losses in the quarter or 2.3 loss ratio points, of which, 1.5 loss ratio points relates to COVID-19. You will see in our earnings release supplemental information that the cat losses for the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment is negative due to a reclass of COVID-19 IBNR to the insurance segment. 
The current quarter's natural cat losses compare favorably with the prior year quarter of $20 million or 1.2 loss ratio points. The reported loss ratio was 61.3% in the current quarter compared with 62.4% in 2019. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $4 million or 0.2 loss ratio points in the current quarter. Accordingly, our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 59.2% compared with 61.4% a year ago. Rounding out the combined ratio, we benefited from an improving expense ratio of 1.3 points to 29.6%. We continue to benefit from growth in net premiums earned at 5.6%, which outpaced an increase in underwriting expenses of 1.2%.
In addition, the expense ratio is benefiting from reduced costs impacted by the global pandemic, including travel and entertainment. This contributes a benefit of more than 50 basis points to the expense ratio.
Touching on investments. Net investment income for the quarter increased 32% to approximately $181 million. The increase was driven by investment fund income of $53 million due to market value adjustments and arbitrage trading income of $26 million, in large part coming from investments in special purpose acquisition companies. Investment income from the fixed maturity portfolio declined due to lower reinvestment yields compared with the roll-off of securities due to maturities, calls and pay downs. In addition, we continue to maintain a cash and cash equivalent position of approximately $2.4 billion, enabling us to maintain a relatively short duration of 2.4 years and significant liquidity. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $163 million is primarily attributable to realized gains of $127 million and changes in unrealized gains on equity securities of $36 million.
As previously announced, the realized gain was largely driven by the sale of a real estate investment in New York City, which resulted in a gain of $105 million. Foreign currency losses in the quarter were driven by the weakening U.S. dollar. Two items of note: first, you'll see that on a year-to-date basis, we were about breakeven; second, the loss in the quarterly income statement is offset considerably by the increase in stockholders' equity. 
In the quarter, our unrealized currency translation loss improved by $66 million, resulting in a net equity pickup of approximately $47 million. As a reminder, expenses included a nonrecurring cost of $8.4 million relating to the redemption of our $350 million subordinated debentures in the quarter. Stockholders' equity increased 5.3% in the quarter, and book value per share before share repurchases and dividends increased 6.1%. We ended the year with more than $6.3 billion in stockholders' equity after share repurchases of approximately 6.4 million shares for $346 million at an average price per share of $54.43 and ordinary dividends totaling $84 million. That brings total return to shareholders of $430 million in the year.
Finally, the company had strong cash flow from operations in the quarter of $480 million, and more than $1.6 billion for the full year, an increase of more than 41%.
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob. Thank you."

Very complete, you leave me nothing to say, but I'll come up with something to babble on about for a relatively brief amount of time. So from my perspective, and I believe from our perspective, the market is clearly in the",2097,"Okay. Rich, thank you very much. Very complete, you leave me nothing to say, but I'll come up with something to babble on about for a relatively brief amount of time. So from my perspective, and I believe from our perspective, the market is clearly in the throes of firming. When we look at the marketplace, is it what we saw, at least at this stage, in '86? No, clearly not. There is not a vacuum when it comes to capacity. But clearly, there is a recognition within the industry amongst carriers that capacity is not going to be built out in such a casual manner as it has been done in the past. And when it is provided, it will be with a lens towards a more appropriate rate associated with that. When we look at the marketplace over all, we think this is very appropriate. And whether it will prove to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and into 2002 and '03, we'll only see with time, but the reality is no cycle looks like any other cycle.
All that being said, when we look at Q4 and when we think about our own business, every product line at this stage with the exception of workers' compensation, we believe, is achieving rate in excess of loss costs And quite frankly, that is appropriate and necessary. When you think about where trend is and in addition to that, when you think about the realities of what one can expect from the investment income portfolio, particularly around the fixed income, we do need to be pushing full rate and driving down the combined ratio further in order to achieve a sensible risk-adjusted return.
[indiscernible] different product lines to go. At this stage, we are seeing meaningful firming continuing in the much of PL market, also, the excess and umbrella market is quite firm as well. Property continues to be notably hard, and auto, I would suggest, is also quite firm. One of the laggards has been primary GL, and we've been pleased to see over the past couple of quarters, it seems to be building some momentum. And we think that's really important given what's going on, on the social inflation front and again as well as the realities of investment income. And as mentioned in prior calls and just a couple of moments ago, workers' comp does continue to be the outlier. Having said that, we continue to believe that's in the early stages of bottoming out and would expect that to be reversing direction by the end of -- or later part or end of -- '21, excuse me.
Just on the topic of rate. From our perspective, we think that there are many market participants that have a good deal of catching up to do. When we think about the past several years, there have been moments where, quite frankly, it's been a little bit lonely when we've been pushing for rate. As you may have picked up in the release, ex-comp, we got 15.5-ish points of rate in the quarter. If you go back a year earlier to Q4 '19, we were getting just shy of 9 points of rate; Q4 '18, 4 points of rate; Q4 '17, 2.3; Q4 '16, we got one point of rate. We think that there are many parts -- market participants that have not been pushing for rate for an extended period of time. And again, we are going to see them needing to catch up, and they are going to need to catch a moving target. 
One other comment that I would just make on this front related to rate and loss costs and how people think about rate adequacy. It would appear as though there are some market participants that may be thinking about loss costs slightly differently than how we think about loss costs. When we look at the current circumstance, I think it's very clear that severity is on the rise for much of the liability market.
And recently, as a result of COVID-19, there are certainly many parts of the market that have experienced somewhat of a benign period when it comes to frequency. And our observation is that some may be in for a little bit of a rude awakening hopefully, sooner rather than later when COVID is somewhat behind us, we see frequency return to a more traditional normal, and that severity trend continues to take off like a rocket ship for the foreseeable future as we've been discussing.
Turning to our quarter. As Rich referenced, pretty healthy growth on the top line, the gross was up about 9%, the net was up about 8%. And obviously, the rate increase that we mentioned earlier is a big contributor to that. We've gotten the question from time to time, from our folks just saying, ""Hey, help me do the math. So you're getting 15 points of rate in this quarter or so, but you're only growing a smaller amount. What's going on? Are you shrinking your business from an exposure perspective?"" And the answer to the question is yes and no. What I mean by that is our policy count is actually up a bit. But what's actually going on is that our insurers, while we may be selling more policies, and that number is growing, many of the insurers' business activity and -- particularly measured in their revenue, which we place the policies off of, is down as a result of this economic activity in the industry.
So when we look at the situation, here's sort of the short version. Policy count is up a little bit, rate is up, but the number -- the amount of revenue or number of widgets, if you will, that our insurers are producing is down. So what does that mean? That means that we are reasonably well positioned for growth when the economy starts to open back up, and you will see in all likelihood, from my perspective, a notable catch-up in audit premiums as the revenue begins to pick up even with those policies that we've already issued because, again, there is a catch-up in our audit activities.
Just a couple of other things quickly on the expense ratio. Again, Rich covered this pretty thoroughly. I would just offer a couple of quick [indiscernible]. One, the 15 basis point benefit, if you will, that the expense ratio is getting as a result of the reduction of activity on our end with travel and entertainment and so on that will one of these days come back. But we are actively looking at what does return to work look like for us. We certainly expect that people will be back in the office, but will the travel be the same, or were there opportunities to learn through this period of time where maybe travel will not have to return to what it once was? That all being said, the reality is that we envision the business growing considerably more and as the economy opens back up, and in addition to that, these higher rates, which will also contribute to the higher earned premium coming through will help out on that front.
On the loss ratio front, obviously, there was some improvement there. We also have heard some commentary from some really asking, ""Given all the rate increases why are we not seeing more improvement in the loss ratio?"" Short answer is that we're trying to be, as always, very measured and not declaring victory prematurely. As we've shared with some in the past, the simple reality is we do not know what the legal system is going to look like and what that is going to mean for loss cost activity once the economy opens back up and we see the legal system, particularly the courts, operating at more of a traditional level.
Having said all this, let me share with you just a quick observation. If one were hypothetically to look at our loss ratio that we had in 2020, and one were to apply a healthy level of trend, just to pick a number arbitrarily, a handful of points, and then one were to apply the type of rate increases earning through that we have been achieving, I think that gives you a reasonable indication as to what the math may look like.
One other piece that one could factor in, hypothetically speaking, would be it is perhaps reasonable to, a reasonable assumption I should say, that a pandemic will not happen every year, and obviously, there is significant loss associated with the pandemic in our 2020 numbers. So some might suggest that we're being a little bit optimistic, but quite frankly, when the day is all done, it's pretty simple, straightforward math.
Just on the investment portfolio, again, I'm not going to repeat what you already heard from Rich, but again, it was a strong quarter, both as far as the gains we have shared with people in the past that on the realized gain front, it's going to be lumpy. And quite frankly, our alternative returns are going to be lumpy. 
Hence, going in, on average, give or take, $25 million a quarter is what we've suggested to people in the past. We still think that's appropriate, and there are going to be moments in time where it may feel like there's a bit of a drought, and there are going to be moments in time where it feels like it's raining money. But on average, we think we get great risk-adjusted returns. 
And again, the same thing applies to the funds. As we have suggested to people, there are going to be moments when the funds do great. They're going to be moments where the funds are lagging a little bit. But on average, we've suggested that pencil in high teen probably $20 million a quarter. 
Rich mentioned, and I know we talked about this last quarter, how the duration is sitting there at about 2.4 years. We continue to have a view that one does not get rewarded for taking the duration out or going out on the yield curve. When we look at -- when we do the math, when we look at the numbers, yes, we could take it -- the duration back out a bit, but the simple fact is that if you move rate up, call it, or model in 100 basis points or so, the impact on a quarterly basis, we will pick up after tax, give or take, maybe $5 million. But if you move rate up 100 basis points, the impact on book value will be approximately $160 million. So we are, at this stage, prepared to live with the slightly lower book yield and maintain the flexibility, the high quality and the liquidity, and we think that makes sense.
One last topic for me is Lifson Re. You may have picked up the announcement we made just in time for the [indiscernible]. This is a vehicle that we created to sit side by side with our traditional reinsurance partners. We remain very committed to traditional reinsurance, but we felt as though that this was a good platform to sit side by side. 
We're very fortunate to have 2 outstanding partners in Lifson Re. And while there certainly are plenty of people to partner with, these 2 institutions, not only are financially well healed, but they are 2 organizations that are both thoughtful, sophisticated with tremendous expertise in the insurance industry, and they are truly partners. 
In addition to that, it was very important to us that there is a shared view around the topic of risk-adjusted return and a shared sense of obligation and duty to capital. 
So since people tend to unplug right after the Q&A, I'll just tuck-in my parting comments now. And that is while some might suggest that I sound a bit -- excuse me, optimistic. And some might even suggest that it is a genetic flaw of being overly optimistic. I think the simple reality of the situation is all you need to do is look at the facts and do the math. And if one were to go down that path and look at the facts and do the math, I think it paints a pretty clear picture for what the next several years look like for this organization. 
So I'm going to pause there. And Christine, at this time, we would like to open it up for questions."

But what I can tell you is this: For policies that were written during '19 that were providing coverage during 2020 or policies that were written early in '20, obviously, the expectation that many of those insurers had was that their revenue in all likelihood would be significantly above what it turned out to be when much of the economy shut down. And obviously, that had an impact on their revenue. 
So what I'm suggesting is if you assume that at some point during 2021, the economy begins to more meaningfully open up in this country and other economies around the world, I think what you will see is when people go out to do audits, the economic activity was more than they had estimated for 2021, and there will be a lot of premium catch-up through the audit process. I.e., if I own a store and I buy a policy today, I'm probably estimating that my revenue is going to be considerably less perhaps than it was in 2019. But if the economy opens back up, my revenue, in all likelihood, will open -- will pick up considerably. And when the insurance company goes out and does an audit to see what your revenues were, you will owe the insurance company considerable premium. And there will be a catch-up."

Good evening, everyone. The company reported record quarterly net income of $312 million or $1.67 per share.

The company reported record quarterly net income of $312 million or $1.67 per share. Despite the heightened catastrophes experienced by the industry and slowdown in the economic environment due to global pandemic, our financials significantly improved in the quarter. This improvement was evidenced in our current accident year combined ratio ex cats of 88.8% and strong investment income and net investment gains, which contributed to an annualized quarterly return on equity of 20.6%. 
Starting first with our top line. Growth in our gross premiums written accelerated through the year with fourth quarter representing growth of 9.3%. Similarly, net premiums written grew by 8.2% to approximately $1.8 billion in the quarter. All lines of business grew in the insurance segment with the exception of workers' compensation, increasing net premiums written by 7.2% to approximately $1.6 billion.
Professional liability led this growth with 29.6%, followed by commercial auto of 20.6%, other liability of 10.6% and short-tail lines of 2%. 
Growth in the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment was 16.8%, bringing net premiums written to $205 million. Casualty reinsurance led this growth with 21.2%, followed by 9.3% in property reinsurance and 6% in monoline excess. Rate improvement, along with lower claims frequency and noncat property losses contributed to our improvement in underwriting income of 44.2% to $165 million. Offsetting this improvement were higher catastrophe losses resulting from natural cats and COVID-19-related losses. We recognized $42 million of total catastrophe losses in the quarter or 2.3 loss ratio points, of which, 1.5 loss ratio points relates to COVID-19. You will see in our earnings release supplemental information that the cat losses for the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment is negative due to a reclass of COVID-19 IBNR to the insurance segment. 
The current quarter's natural cat losses compare favorably with the prior year quarter of $20 million or 1.2 loss ratio points. The reported loss ratio was 61.3% in the current quarter compared with 62.4% in 2019. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $4 million or 0.2 loss ratio points in the current quarter. Accordingly, our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 59.2% compared with 61.4% a year ago. Rounding out the combined ratio, we benefited from an improving expense ratio of 1.3 points to 29.6%. We continue to benefit from growth in net premiums earned at 5.6%, which outpaced an increase in underwriting expenses of 1.2%.
In addition, the expense ratio is benefiting from reduced costs impacted by the global pandemic, including travel and entertainment. This contributes a benefit of more than 50 basis points to the expense ratio.
Touching on investments. Net investment income for the quarter increased 32% to approximately $181 million. The increase was driven by investment fund income of $53 million due to market value adjustments and arbitrage trading income of $26 million, in large part coming from investments in special purpose acquisition companies. Investment income from the fixed maturity portfolio declined due to lower reinvestment yields compared with the roll-off of securities due to maturities, calls and pay downs. In addition, we continue to maintain a cash and cash equivalent position of approximately $2.4 billion, enabling us to maintain a relatively short duration of 2.4 years and significant liquidity. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $163 million is primarily attributable to realized gains of $127 million and changes in unrealized gains on equity securities of $36 million.
As previously announced, the realized gain was largely driven by the sale of a real estate investment in New York City, which resulted in a gain of $105 million. Foreign currency losses in the quarter were driven by the weakening U.S. dollar. Two items of note: first, you'll see that on a year-to-date basis, we were about breakeven; second, the loss in the quarterly income statement is offset considerably by the increase in stockholders' equity. 
In the quarter, our unrealized currency translation loss improved by $66 million, resulting in a net equity pickup of approximately $47 million. As a reminder, expenses included a nonrecurring cost of $8.4 million relating to the redemption of our $350 million subordinated debentures in the quarter. Stockholders' equity increased 5.3% in the quarter, and book value per share before share repurchases and dividends increased 6.1%. We ended the year with more than $6.3 billion in stockholders' equity after share repurchases of approximately 6.4 million shares for $346 million at an average price per share of $54.43 and ordinary dividends totaling $84 million. That brings total return to shareholders of $430 million in the year.
Finally, the company had strong cash flow from operations in the quarter of $480 million, and more than $1.6 billion for the full year, an increase of more than 41%.
With that, I'll turn it back to Rob. Thank you."

Very complete, you leave me nothing to say, but I'll come up with something to babble on about for a relatively brief amount of time. So from my perspective, and I believe from our perspective, the market is clearly in the",2097,"Okay. Rich, thank you very much. Very complete, you leave me nothing to say, but I'll come up with something to babble on about for a relatively brief amount of time. So from my perspective, and I believe from our perspective, the market is clearly in the throes of firming. When we look at the marketplace, is it what we saw, at least at this stage, in '86? No, clearly not. There is not a vacuum when it comes to capacity. But clearly, there is a recognition within the industry amongst carriers that capacity is not going to be built out in such a casual manner as it has been done in the past. And when it is provided, it will be with a lens towards a more appropriate rate associated with that. When we look at the marketplace over all, we think this is very appropriate. And whether it will prove to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and into 2002 and '03, we'll only see with time, but the reality is no cycle looks like any other cycle.
All that being said, when we look at Q4 and when we think about our own business, every product line at this stage with the exception of workers' compensation, we believe, is achieving rate in excess of loss costs And quite frankly, that is appropriate and necessary. When you think about where trend is and in addition to that, when you think about the realities of what one can expect from the investment income portfolio, particularly around the fixed income, we do need to be pushing full rate and driving down the combined ratio further in order to achieve a sensible risk-adjusted return.
[indiscernible] different product lines to go. At this stage, we are seeing meaningful firming continuing in the much of PL market, also, the excess and umbrella market is quite firm as well. Property continues to be notably hard, and auto, I would suggest, is also quite firm. One of the laggards has been primary GL, and we've been pleased to see over the past couple of quarters, it seems to be building some momentum. And we think that's really important given what's going on, on the social inflation front and again as well as the realities of investment income. And as mentioned in prior calls and just a couple of moments ago, workers' comp does continue to be the outlier. Having said that, we continue to believe that's in the early stages of bottoming out and would expect that to be reversing direction by the end of -- or later part or end of -- '21, excuse me.
Just on the topic of rate. From our perspective, we think that there are many market participants that have a good deal of catching up to do. When we think about the past several years, there have been moments where, quite frankly, it's been a little bit lonely when we've been pushing for rate. As you may have picked up in the release, ex-comp, we got 15.5-ish points of rate in the quarter. If you go back a year earlier to Q4 '19, we were getting just shy of 9 points of rate; Q4 '18, 4 points of rate; Q4 '17, 2.3; Q4 '16, we got one point of rate. We think that there are many parts -- market participants that have not been pushing for rate for an extended period of time. And again, we are going to see them needing to catch up, and they are going to need to catch a moving target. 
One other comment that I would just make on this front related to rate and loss costs and how people think about rate adequacy. It would appear as though there are some market participants that may be thinking about loss costs slightly differently than how we think about loss costs. When we look at the current circumstance, I think it's very clear that severity is on the rise for much of the liability market.
And recently, as a result of COVID-19, there are certainly many parts of the market that have experienced somewhat of a benign period when it comes to frequency. And our observation is that some may be in for a little bit of a rude awakening hopefully, sooner rather than later when COVID is somewhat behind us, we see frequency return to a more traditional normal, and that severity trend continues to take off like a rocket ship for the foreseeable future as we've been discussing.
Turning to our quarter. As Rich referenced, pretty healthy growth on the top line, the gross was up about 9%, the net was up about 8%. And obviously, the rate increase that we mentioned earlier is a big contributor to that. We've gotten the question from time to time, from our folks just saying, ""Hey, help me do the math. So you're getting 15 points of rate in this quarter or so, but you're only growing a smaller amount. What's going on? Are you shrinking your business from an exposure perspective?"" And the answer to the question is yes and no. What I mean by that is our policy count is actually up a bit. But what's actually going on is that our insurers, while we may be selling more policies, and that number is growing, many of the insurers' business activity and -- particularly measured in their revenue, which we place the policies off of, is down as a result of this economic activity in the industry.
So when we look at the situation, here's sort of the short version. Policy count is up a little bit, rate is up, but the number -- the amount of revenue or number of widgets, if you will, that our insurers are producing is down. So what does that mean? That means that we are reasonably well positioned for growth when the economy starts to open back up, and you will see in all likelihood, from my perspective, a notable catch-up in audit premiums as the revenue begins to pick up even with those policies that we've already issued because, again, there is a catch-up in our audit activities.
Just a couple of other things quickly on the expense ratio. Again, Rich covered this pretty thoroughly. I would just offer a couple of quick [indiscernible]. One, the 15 basis point benefit, if you will, that the expense ratio is getting as a result of the reduction of activity on our end with travel and entertainment and so on that will one of these days come back. But we are actively looking at what does return to work look like for us. We certainly expect that people will be back in the office, but will the travel be the same, or were there opportunities to learn through this period of time where maybe travel will not have to return to what it once was? That all being said, the reality is that we envision the business growing considerably more and as the economy opens back up, and in addition to that, these higher rates, which will also contribute to the higher earned premium coming through will help out on that front.
On the loss ratio front, obviously, there was some improvement there. We also have heard some commentary from some really asking, ""Given all the rate increases why are we not seeing more improvement in the loss ratio?"" Short answer is that we're trying to be, as always, very measured and not declaring victory prematurely. As we've shared with some in the past, the simple reality is we do not know what the legal system is going to look like and what that is going to mean for loss cost activity once the economy opens back up and we see the legal system, particularly the courts, operating at more of a traditional level.
Having said all this, let me share with you just a quick observation. If one were hypothetically to look at our loss ratio that we had in 2020, and one were to apply a healthy level of trend, just to pick a number arbitrarily, a handful of points, and then one were to apply the type of rate increases earning through that we have been achieving, I think that gives you a reasonable indication as to what the math may look like.
One other piece that one could factor in, hypothetically speaking, would be it is perhaps reasonable to, a reasonable assumption I should say, that a pandemic will not happen every year, and obviously, there is significant loss associated with the pandemic in our 2020 numbers. So some might suggest that we're being a little bit optimistic, but quite frankly, when the day is all done, it's pretty simple, straightforward math.
Just on the investment portfolio, again, I'm not going to repeat what you already heard from Rich, but again, it was a strong quarter, both as far as the gains we have shared with people in the past that on the realized gain front, it's going to be lumpy. And quite frankly, our alternative returns are going to be lumpy. 
Hence, going in, on average, give or take, $25 million a quarter is what we've suggested to people in the past. We still think that's appropriate, and there are going to be moments in time where it may feel like there's a bit of a drought, and there are going to be moments in time where it feels like it's raining money. But on average, we think we get great risk-adjusted returns. 
And again, the same thing applies to the funds. As we have suggested to people, there are going to be moments when the funds do great. They're going to be moments where the funds are lagging a little bit. But on average, we've suggested that pencil in high teen probably $20 million a quarter. 
Rich mentioned, and I know we talked about this last quarter, how the duration is sitting there at about 2.4 years. We continue to have a view that one does not get rewarded for taking the duration out or going out on the yield curve. When we look at -- when we do the math, when we look at the numbers, yes, we could take it -- the duration back out a bit, but the simple fact is that if you move rate up, call it, or model in 100 basis points or so, the impact on a quarterly basis, we will pick up after tax, give or take, maybe $5 million. But if you move rate up 100 basis points, the impact on book value will be approximately $160 million. So we are, at this stage, prepared to live with the slightly lower book yield and maintain the flexibility, the high quality and the liquidity, and we think that makes sense.
One last topic for me is Lifson Re. You may have picked up the announcement we made just in time for the [indiscernible]. This is a vehicle that we created to sit side by side with our traditional reinsurance partners. We remain very committed to traditional reinsurance, but we felt as though that this was a good platform to sit side by side. 
We're very fortunate to have 2 outstanding partners in Lifson Re. And while there certainly are plenty of people to partner with, these 2 institutions, not only are financially well healed, but they are 2 organizations that are both thoughtful, sophisticated with tremendous expertise in the insurance industry, and they are truly partners. 
In addition to that, it was very important to us that there is a shared view around the topic of risk-adjusted return and a shared sense of obligation and duty to capital. 
So since people tend to unplug right after the Q&A, I'll just tuck-in my parting comments now. And that is while some might suggest that I sound a bit -- excuse me, optimistic. And some might even suggest that it is a genetic flaw of being overly optimistic. I think the simple reality of the situation is all you need to do is look at the facts and do the math. And if one were to go down that path and look at the facts and do the math, I think it paints a pretty clear picture for what the next several years look like for this organization. 
So I'm going to pause there. And Christine, at this time, we would like to open it up for questions."

But what I can tell you is this: For policies that were written during '19 that were providing coverage during 2020 or policies that were written early in '20, obviously, the expectation that many of those insurers had was that their revenue in all likelihood would be significantly above what it turned out to be when much of the economy shut down. And obviously, that had an impact on their revenue. 
So what I'm suggesting is if you assume that at some point during 2021, the economy begins to more meaningfully open up in this country and other economies around the world, I think what you will see is when people go out to do audits, the economic activity was more than they had estimated for 2021, and there will be a lot of premium catch-up through the audit process. I.e., if I own a store and I buy a policy today, I'm probably estimating that my revenue is going to be considerably less perhaps than it was in 2019. But if the economy opens back up, my revenue, in all likelihood, will open -- will pick up considerably. And when the insurance company goes out and does an audit to see what your revenues were, you will owe the insurance company considerable premium. And there will be a catch-up."

In the current quarter compared with 65.5% in 2020. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $3 million or 0.2 loss ratio points in the current quarter. Accordingly, Our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 58.9% compared with 61% a year ago. The expense ratio was 29.5%, and reflecting an improvement of 1.9 points over the prior year quarter. 
The growth in net premiums earned continues to outpace underwriting expenses by a margin of almost 7%, significantly benefiting the expense ratio. Although we continue to benefit from reduced costs associated with travel and entertainment due to the pandemic, we are implementing initiatives that will enable us to operate more efficiently in the future. 
Summing this up, our accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 88.4%, representing an improvement of 4 points over the prior year quarter. 
Shifting gears to investments. Net investment income for the quarter was approximately $159 million. The alternative investment portfolio, including investment funds and arbitrage trading account provided strong results. The 6 maturity portfolio declined due to the lower interest rate environment and the higher cash and cash equivalent position we've maintained over the past few quarters. 
We did begin to reinvest cash as interest rates rose in the quarter, however, continue to maintain a defensive position with more than $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Our duration remains relatively short at 2.4 years, enabling us to further benefit from future increases in interest rates. And at the same time, our credit quality remains strong at a AA-. 
Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $35 million is primarily made up of realized gains on investments of $76 million partially offset by a reduction in unrealized gains on equity securities of $24 million and an increase in the allowance for expected credit losses of $17 million. The realized gain was primarily attributable to the sale of a private equity investment and real estate assets. 
Corporate expense partially increased due to debt extinguishment costs of $3.6 million relating to the redemption of hybrid securities on March 1. In line with our plans to benefit from the low interest rate environment, we've prefunded for a redemption in a couple of maturities in early 2022. To this end, you will have seen that we announced the redemption of our hybrid securities for June 1, which will result in debt extinguishment costs in the second quarter of approximately $8 million pretax. 
Stockholders' equity increased more than $100 million to approximately $6.4 billion after share repurchases and dividends of $51 million in the quarter. The company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares for $30 million in 2021 at an average price per share of $63.82. Our net unrealized gain position in stockholders' equity declined by $90 million due to the rise in interest rates in the quarter. However, this was partially mitigated by our decision to maintain a relatively short duration. Book value per share grew 2.4% before share repurchases and dividends. And finally, cash flow from operations more than doubled quarter-over-quarter to over $300 million. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob."

I noticed that there's a correlation here that the better the quarter, the less you leave for me to comment on. So I guess I should be pleased and grateful that there's not much left for me. Having said that, let me offer a co",1845,"Rich, thank you very much. I noticed that there's a correlation here that the better the quarter, the less you leave for me to comment on. So I guess I should be pleased and grateful that there's not much left for me. 
Having said that, let me offer a couple of comments. I'll try not to be too repetitive on the heels of Rich's comments, but I would like to flag a couple of things. 
First off, there is no doubt that there is a meaningful tailwind that exists in the Commercial Lines marketplace. And certainly, this organization is benefiting from that. And to that end, our top line, I think this is the highest growth rate we have seen since -- which I think you have to go back to 2013, you had mentioned to me when you look back in the history books. 
And not only is the growth and market conditions attractive, I think what's even more encouraging is that there is a growing amount of evidence that the momentum is going to grow from here and that there is a fair amount of runway still before us. So again, I think that bodes well for not just how we see the coming quarters unfold, but quite frankly, the next several years. 
To that end, clearly, the domestic economy and certainly parts of the global economy are improving. And that, without a doubt, is going to benefit our top line. We were seeing the health and wellness of our insurers continuing to improve. In addition to that, for the comment a moment ago, we continue to see the opportunity to push rate further. You may have noticed that we got approaching 13 points of rate in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation. We did have a little bit of a discussion internally, and we dug into it as to how do you compare this approaching 13 points of rate with what we saw in the fourth quarter. And after digging into it, really what this is a reflection of is, there are parts of the portfolio where rate adequacy has gotten to the point where we are so encouraged by the available margin that we are more interested in pushing harder on the exposure growth and not as preoccupied and pushing harder on the rate front. And again, we view that as a real plus. 
This is -- we are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting meaningful rate increases. And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in many product lines where we have been getting rate on rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we think that is very encouraging for what that means for margin. 
Before I offer a couple of thoughts on the loss ratio, couple of other quick data points that I've referenced on occasion in the past. Renewal retention ratio in spite of what we're pushing on with rates and all of the other underwriting actions that we are taking is still hanging in there at approximately 80%. And our new business relativity metric, which is another data point we've shared with many of you in the past, came in at 1.024%, which effectively what that means is on as much of an apples-to-apples basis as we are able to create in comparing a new account versus a renewal account, we are effectively surcharging a new account by 2.4% more. Why? 
Because a new piece of business, you know less about, then obviously, it's part of your portfolio that you've been on for some period of time. And I think it's important because people need to understand when you look at the growth, yes, it is rate, but it's also exposure growth, but we are not compromising in that growth in the quality of the portfolio. 
Rich gave you some detail, which complemented the release on the loss ratio. Clearly, as you suggested, we're benefiting from the higher rates. A couple of other data points I would suggest. We are not taking a lot of credit for shift in terms and conditions when we come up with many of our loss picks. We will take some oftentimes, but certainly, we are never taking full credit for it. We want to see how that comes into focus. So more to come on that front. 
The other piece, and I suspect that there has been some other discussion around the impact on frequency due to COVID. Again, that is something that we have been reluctant to declare victory on. There certainly are some lines of business where you have more immediate visibility as to what the impact of that reduction in frequency. There are other product lines where there is less visibility. 
On that topic, I did want to offer a couple of quick comments on workers' compensation, which is the one outlier as we've discussed in the past couple of quarters as far as the marketplace and where things are going. 
Clearly, workers' compensation has been a product line where competition has been on the rise. We have seen the action of state rating bureaus. And ultimately, we'll have to see how that unfolds over time. 
Two comments there. One is from our perspective, it is likely that the pendulum will swing too far in a certain direction. And as a result of that, as we have shared with people in the past, it continues to be our view that we expect the workers' comp market to likely begin to bottom out more visibly by the end of this year or perhaps the first half of next year. Could it be a quarter or 2 later? Yes. But generally speaking, that's how we see things coming into focus. 
The other comment on workers' comp that I would like to flag because there has been an observation or 2 shared around the loss picks that we are carrying for the 2020 year. And given how benign the frequency has been in 2020, why have we not done anything with that pick? And it's very simple. We do not want to declare victory prematurely. 
We -- as we have in the past, start out with what we believe is a measured pick. And as that seasons, we will adjust as we see fit and appropriate. 
So the last comment on comp, which I will offer, and I think I've made the comment in the past is that I think that the lack of frequency that has existed recently in the comp line due to COVID as to a certain extent, perhaps subsidized a severity trend, which looks pretty ugly in the comp line. And certainly, it is possible that the marketplace is setting itself up for a disappointment if there is not an appropriate level of attention paid to loss cost trend and really unpacking what is going on with severity, what is going on with frequency and what one should expect as frequency returns to a more traditional norm. 
I will leave it there as far as comp that's perhaps more than people were looking for. Expense ratio. Again, Rich touched on, as we've mentioned in the past, COVID is offering effectively a benefit of about 50 basis points to the expense ratio. So when he and I sort of do the back-of-the-envelope math, that's what we're back into the expense ratio. 
Having said that, it's also worth noting that we have some meaningful investments that are going on in the business, in particular, on the technology as well as the data analytics front. And these are our big lifts, which we think are clearly going to make us a better business, more efficient and will allow us to be able to be making better, more insightful decisions. 
And let me just move on briefly to the investment portfolio. I'm not going to get into much detail here because Rich really covered it. I would just say that our approach to a focus on total return, our emphasis on alternatives continues to pay off. And quite frankly, It is helping to compensate and then some the discipline that we are exercising with how we are managing the fixed income portfolio. 
As Rich mentioned, we continue to maintain the duration on the shorter end at 2.4 years, and the quality is not something that we have or will be compromising on sitting there at a AA-. That being said, We are being rewarded for that discipline, as you can see, where book value ended up at the end of the quarter. And while we were not completely insulated, we were far less impacted than those that have decided to take duration out further. 
I just want to offer a couple of quick comments on what I'll refer to as cycle management. From our perspective, cycle management is the name of the game, knowing when to grow, knowing when to shrink. We as a team are very conscious of the fact that we cannot control the market We are very conscious of the fact that this is a cyclical industry. And we are very aware of the reality that what we are able to control is what we do. 
Oftentimes, people will ask the Chairman or Rich or myself, where are the best opportunities? And the answer we give because we do not want to get into the details is look at our business, look at our public information, look at where we are growing. 
We grow where the margins are, we grow where the opportunity is, and we are not shy or scared or intimidated to let the business go when we don't think it is a good use of capital. You can see that very clearly in our numbers. Right now, you can see the discipline that our colleagues are exercising in the workers' comp line. 
You can see in other parts of the business, whether it'd be the primary insurance professional liability line or what's happening in parts of our reinsurance portfolio. We are in the business of managing capital, and we are going to deploy it where we think it makes sense. And again, we have our eyes wide open. 
Final comment from me before we open it up for questions, and that is a bit of recognition for where we are. This business, from my perspective, is particularly well positioned for the market conditions we are in and likely what the market conditions will be tomorrow. We are here because we have a fabulous team. We have 6, 543 people that work together as a team in the interest of all stakeholders. And we were able to achieve this quarter because of their efforts in spite of the challenges that exist in the world, particularly over the past 12 years, and we thank them for what they have done. 
So Mike, I will pause there, and we'd be very pleased to open it up for questions."

There are many components of it, as you can see, given the rate that we continue to achieve, where we think there is opportunity, and quite frankly, need to be getting more rate.

Our submission flow is gaining momentum, partly because of the economy, but partly because I think the standard market continues to revisit their appetite. I think you can see that in part how they're pushing more for rate. But simultaneously, they are weeding out the portfolio where I think they're revisiting what that appetite should be, and that is creating opportunity for the specialty market, in particular, the E&S carriers, and we're certainly in the middle of that."

So first off, I would encourage people not to get overly consumed on the fact that our rate increase was only 13%, which I think by most measures, is reasonably robust, but maybe that view is not shared by all. 
That having been said, I also think that it's generally understood at this stage, and hopefully, it continues. that we have [Audio Gap] a standard market revisiting its appetite and pushing business into the specialty, in particular, the E&S market, which is very much our strike zone, which is why, historically, we have done particularly well in these type of market conditions. And we think there's early evidence to support that, that will continue to be the case, and we have no reason to believe that it won't. 
So we -- and I guess lastly, I should have that on the topic of specialty and E&S, there are a lot of small businesses that went out of business, you're going to see them coming -- getting back on their feet, whether they're starting up again or starting something new. And new businesses tend to find their insurance coverage in the specialty, in particular, the E&S market. 
So -- and lastly, I think I should add that I think there's a reasonable chance that there is going to be later this year and next year, a meaningful catch-up on the audit premium front. So when you put all of those pieces together, in my opinion, while rate is and continues to be an important part of the story, and certainly, for the past many quarters, it has been a rate-centric discussion because of the need that the industry has for rate.

And so with that, we would anticipate that some of the results coming out of that would be an extended average maturity of about 10 years that we would be reducing our cost of capital by nearly 100 basis points. And if you were to look at the interest expense, probably in 2021, we'd see a reduction of a few million dollars in interest expense. And then going into 2022, we'd see an additional $20-plus million of interest expense reduction building off of the 2021 number. So definitely some good opportunity to take advantage of the low interest rate environment that we're seeing."

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. The headline this quarter is a record underwriting profit with premium growth of more than 11% and solid net investment income and gains, which resulted in a return on beginning of your equity of 14.5%.",862,"Sure, Rob. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. The headline this quarter is a record underwriting profit with premium growth of more than 11% and solid net investment income and gains, which resulted in a return on beginning of your equity of 14.5%. The company reported net income of $230 million or $1.23 per share. The breakdown is operating income of $202 million or $1.08 per share and after-tax net investment gains of $28 million or $0.15 per share. 
Beginning with underwriting income and the components thereof, gross premiums written grew by more than $250 million or 11.4% to almost $2.5 billion. Net premiums written grew 11.1% to more than $2 billion, reflecting an increase in both segments. The Insurance segment grew approximately 10% to almost $1.75 billion in the quarter, with an increase in all lines of business, with the exception of workers' compensation. Professional liability led this growth with 37.6%, followed by commercial auto of 21%, other liability of 13.1% and short-tail lines of 5.6%. 
All lines of business grew in the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment, increasing net premiums written by 18.2% to more than $300 million. Casualty reinsurance led this growth with 21.9%, followed by 13.8% in property reinsurance and 13.6% in monoline excess. The compounding rate improvement in excess of loss cost trends has partially contributed to the expansion of underwriting income. Other contributors have included lower claims frequency and non-cat property losses, along with growth in lines of business that are generating the best risk-adjusted returns. 
Underwriting income increased approximately 250% to $183 million. The industry continued to experience above-average catastrophe losses in the quarter, including the winter storms in Texas, and we have again been able to demonstrate our disciplined management to cat exposure. Our current accident year catastrophe losses were approximately $36 million or 1.9 loss ratio points, including 0.8 loss ratio points for COVID-19-related losses. This compares with the prior year cat losses of $79 million or 4.7 loss ratio points, which included 3 loss ratio points for COVID-19-related losses. The reported loss ratio was 60.6% in the current quarter compared with 65.5% in 2020. 
Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $3 million or 0.2 loss ratio points in the current quarter. Accordingly, Our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 58.9% compared with 61% a year ago. The expense ratio was 29.5%, reflecting an improvement of 1.9 points over the prior year quarter.  
The growth in net premiums earned continues to outpace underwriting expenses by a margin of almost 7%, significantly benefiting the expense ratio. Although we continue to benefit from reduced costs associated with travel and entertainment due to the pandemic, we are implementing initiatives that will enable us to operate more efficiently in the future.  Summing this up, our accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 88.4%, representing an improvement of 4 points over the prior year quarter.  
Shifting gears to investments. Net investment income for the quarter was approximately $159 million. The alternative investment portfolio, including investment funds and arbitrage trading account provided strong results. The fixed maturity portfolio declined due to the lower interest rate environment and the higher cash and cash equivalent position we've maintained over the past few quarters.  
We did begin to reinvest cash as interest rates rose in the quarter, however, continue to maintain a defensive position with more than $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Our duration remains relatively short at 2.4 years, enabling us to further benefit from future increases in interest rates. And at the same time, our credit quality remains strong at a AA-.  
Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $35 million is primarily made up of realized gains on investments of $76 million, partially offset by a reduction in unrealized gains on equity securities of $24 million and an increase in the allowance for expected credit losses of $17 million. The realized gain was primarily attributable to the sale of a private equity investment and real estate assets.  
Corporate expense partially increased due to debt extinguishment costs of $3.6 million relating to the redemption of hybrid securities on March 1. In line with our plans to benefit from the low interest rate environment, we've prefunded for a redemption in a couple of maturities in early 2022. To this end, you will have seen that we announced the redemption of our hybrid securities for June 1, which will result in debt extinguishment costs in the second quarter of approximately $8 million pretax.  
Stockholders' equity increased more than $100 million to approximately $6.4 billion after share repurchases and dividends of $51 million in the quarter. The company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares for $30 million in 2021 at an average price per share of $63.82. Our net unrealized gain position in stockholders' equity declined by $90 million due to the rise in interest rates in the quarter. However, this was partially mitigated by our decision to maintain a relatively short duration. Book value per share grew 2.4% before share repurchases and dividends. And finally, cash flow from operations more than doubled quarter-over-quarter to over $300 million. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob."

I noticed that there's a correlation here that the better the quarter, the less you leave for me to comment on. So I guess I should be pleased and grateful that there's not much left for me. Having said that, let me offer a coup",1847,"Rich, thank you very much. I noticed that there's a correlation here that the better the quarter, the less you leave for me to comment on. So I guess I should be pleased and grateful that there's not much left for me. Having said that, let me offer a couple of comments. I'll try not to be too repetitive on the heels of Rich's comments, but I would like to flag a couple of things.  
First off, there is no doubt that there is a meaningful tailwind that exists in the commercial lines marketplace. And certainly, this organization is benefiting from that. And to that end, our top line, I think this is the highest growth rate we have seen since -- which I think you have to go back to 2013, you had mentioned to me when you look back in the history books.  
And not only is the growth and market conditions attractive, I think what's even more encouraging is that there is a growing amount of evidence that the momentum is going to grow from here and that there is a fair amount of runway still before us. So again, I think that bodes well for not just how we see the coming quarters unfold, but quite frankly, the next several years.  
To that end, clearly, the domestic economy and certainly parts of the global economy are improving. And that, without a doubt, is going to benefit our top line. We were seeing the health and wellness of our insurers continuing to improve. In addition to that, for the comment a moment ago, we continue to see the opportunity to push rate further. You may have noticed that we got approaching 13 points of rate in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation. We did have a little bit of a discussion internally, and we dug into it as to how do you compare this approaching 13 points of rate with what we saw in the fourth quarter. And after digging into it, really what this is a reflection of is, there are parts of the portfolio where rate adequacy has gotten to the point where we are so encouraged by the available margins that we are more interested in pushing harder on the exposure growth and not as preoccupied and pushing harder on the rate front. And again, we view that as a real plus.  
This is -- we are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting meaningful rate increases. And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate. And in many product lines where we have been getting rate on rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we think that is very encouraging for what that means for margin.  
Before I offer a couple of thoughts on the loss ratio, a couple of other quick data points that I've referenced on occasion in the past. Renewal retention ratio, in spite of what we're pushing on with rates and all of the other underwriting actions that we are taking, is still hanging in there at approximately 80%. And our new business relativity metric, which is another data point we've shared with many of you in the past, came in at 1.024%, which effectively what that means is on as much as an apples-to-apples basis as we are able to create in comparing a new account versus a renewal account, we are effectively surcharging a new account by 2.4% more. Why? Because a new piece of business you know less about, then obviously it's part of your portfolio that you've been on for some period of time. And I think it's important because people need to understand when you look at the growth, yes, it is rate, but it's also exposure growth, but we are not compromising in that growth in the quality of the portfolio.  
Rich gave you some detail, which complemented the release on the loss ratio. Clearly, as he suggested, we're benefiting from the higher rates. A couple of other data points I would suggest. We are not taking a lot of credit for shift in terms and conditions when we come up with many of our loss picks. We will take some oftentimes, but certainly, we are never taking full credit for it. We want to see how that comes into focus. So more to come on that front.  
The other piece, and I suspect that there has been some other discussion around the impact on frequency due to COVID. Again, that is something that we have been reluctant to declare victory on. There certainly are some lines of business where you have more immediate visibility as to what the impact of that reduction in frequency. There are other product lines where there is less visibility. 
On that topic, I did want to offer a couple of quick comments on workers' compensation, which is the one outlier as we've discussed in the past couple of quarters as far as the marketplace and where things are going. Clearly, workers' compensation has been a product line where competition has been on the rise. We have seen the action of state rating bureaus. And ultimately, we'll have to see how that unfolds over time. 
Two comments there. One is from our perspective, it is likely that the pendulum will swing too far in a certain direction. And as a result of that, as we have shared with people in the past, it continues to be our view that we expect the workers' comp market to likely begin to bottom out more visibly by the end of this year or perhaps the first half of next year. Could it be a quarter or 2 later? Yes. But generally speaking, that's how we see things coming into focus.  
The other comment on workers' comp that I would like to flag because there has been an observation or 2 shared around the loss picks that we are carrying for the 2020 year. And given how benign the frequency has been in 2020, why have we not done anything with that pick? And it's very simple. We do not want to declare victory prematurely. We, as we have in the past, start out with what we believe is a measured pick. And as that seasons, we will adjust as we see fit and appropriate. 
So the last comment on comp, which I will offer, and I think I've made the comment in the past is that I think that the lack of frequency that has existed recently in the comp line due to COVID has, to a certain extent, perhaps subsidized a severity trend, which looks pretty ugly in the comp line. And certainly, it is possible that the marketplace is setting itself up for a disappointment if there is not an appropriate level of attention paid to loss cost trend and really unpacking what is going on with severity, what is going on with frequency and what one should expect as frequency returns to a more traditional norm. I will leave it there as far as comp. That's perhaps more than people were looking for. 
Expense ratio. Again, Rich touched on, as we've mentioned in the past, COVID is offering effectively a benefit of about 50 basis points to the expense ratio. So when he and I sort of do the back-of-the-envelope math, that's what we're [ baking ] back into the expense ratio. Having said that, it's also worth noting that we have some meaningful investments that are going on in the business, in particular, on the technology as well as the data analytics front. And these are our big lifts, which we think are clearly going to make us a better business, more efficient and will allow us to be able to be making better, more insightful decisions.  
And let me just move on briefly to the investment portfolio. I'm not going to get into much detail here because Rich really covered it. I would just say that our approach to a focus on total return, our emphasis on alternatives continues to pay off. And quite frankly, it is helping to compensate and then some, the discipline that we are exercising with how we are managing the fixed income portfolio.  
As Rich mentioned, we continue to maintain the duration on the shorter end at 2.4 years, and the quality is not something that we have or will be compromising on sitting there at a AA-. That being said, we are being rewarded for that discipline, as you can see where book value ended up at the end of the quarter. And while we were not completely insulated, we were far less impacted than those that have decided to take duration out further.  
I just want to offer a couple of quick comments on what I'll refer to as cycle management. From our perspective, cycle management is the name of the game, knowing when to grow, knowing when to shrink. We as a team are very conscious of the fact that we cannot control the market. We are very conscious of the fact that this is a cyclical industry. And we are very aware of the reality that what we are able to control is what we do.  
Oftentimes, people will ask the Chairman or Rich or myself where are the best opportunities. And the answer we give, because we do not want to get into the details, is look at our business, look at our public information, look at where we are growing.  We grow where the margins are, we grow where the opportunity is, and we are not shy or scared or intimidated to let the business go when we don't think it is a good use of capital. You can see that very clearly in our numbers. Right now, you can see the discipline that our colleagues are exercising in the workers' comp line. You can see in other parts of the business, whether it'd be the primary insurance professional liability line or what's happening in parts of our reinsurance portfolio. We are in the business of managing capital, and we are going to deploy it where we think it makes sense. And again, we have our eyes wide open.  
Final comment from me before we open it up for questions, and that is a bit of recognition for where we are. This business, from my perspective, is particularly well positioned for the market conditions we are in and likely what the market conditions will be tomorrow. We are here because we have a fabulous team. We have 6,543 people that work together as a team in the interest of all stakeholders. And we were able to achieve this quarter because of their efforts in spite of the challenges that exist in the world, particularly over the past 12 years, and we thank them for what they have done.  
So Mike, I will pause there, and we'd be very pleased to open it up for questions."

And depending on where we are vis-a-vis that return will guide us towards how much of a priority rate is versus once we get to a certain point, while rate will remain a priority, to what extent are we focused on actually growing the portfolio from an exposure perspective. 
So as far as the 13% goes from -- I don't know for sure what tomorrow will bring. We continue to dissect the book and try to evaluate it. Could it go down a little bit? Could it go up a little bit? I would caution you not to read too much into one quarter, one way or another. But we are very encouraged directionally with where things are going. And again, the margin that we are seeing come through in the book itself."

So first off, I would encourage people not to get overly consumed on the fact that our rate increase was only 13%, which I think by most measures, is reasonably robust. But maybe that view is not shared by all. 
That having been said, I also think that it's generally understood at this stage, and hopefully, it continues that we have an economy that is getting back on its feet and building momentum. As a result of that, we think that you're going to see payrolls going up. We think that you're going to see -- just the amount of commerce, you're going to see receipts going up. You're going to see more economic activity. Much of what we do is priced off of payrolls, receipts or economic activity. And I think that, that bodes well for the growth. 
In addition to that, you continue to see, as I referenced a moment ago, a standard market revisiting its appetite and pushing business into the specialty, in particular, the E&S market, which is very much our strike zone, which is why, historically, we have done particularly well in these type of market conditions. And we think there's early evidence to support that, that will continue to be the case, and we have no reason to believe that it won't. 
So we -- and I guess, lastly, I should add that on the topic of specialty and E&S, there are a lot of small businesses that went out of business. You're going to see them coming -- getting back on their feet, whether they're starting up again or starting something new. And new businesses tend to find their insurance coverage in the specialty, in particular, the E&S market. 
So -- and lastly, I think I should add that I think there's a reasonable chance that there is going to be, later this year and next year, a meaningful catch-up on the auto premium front. So when you put all of those pieces together, in my opinion, while rate is and continues to be an important part of the story, and certainly for the past many quarters, it has been a rate-centric discussion because of the need that the industry has for rate. At this stage, with an economy that is opening back up and cooperating, I think that you're going to see great opportunity in the top line."

Just on the -- well, it's not in the expense ratio per se, but as it relates to expenses. One thing that I didn't mention, I don't believe Rich mentioned.

We've raised about $1.75 billion of senior debt and hybrid capital with the intended use of proceeds to basically take out certain hybrid securities that were at higher costs and fund maturities that we had up through March of 2022. And so with that, we would anticipate that some of the results coming out of that would be an extended average maturity of about 10 years that we would be reducing our cost of capital by nearly 100 basis points. And if you were to look at the interest expense, probably in 2021, we'd see a reduction of a few million dollars in interest expense. And then going into 2022, we'd see an additional $20-plus million of interest expense reduction building off of the 2021 number.

We'v",806,"The positive momentum continues to build in our business as evident by our growth in premium and expansion in underwriting profits as rate improvements and additional premium associated with increase in exposure earned through the income statement. 
We've reported a consecutive quarterly record underwriting profit in the second quarter of 2021, along with strong net investment income, resulting in an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 15%. The company reported net income of $237 million or $1.27 per share. The components include operating income of $219 million or $1.17 per share and after-tax net investment gains of $18 million or $0.10 per share. 
Drilling down to our quarterly underwriting performance. You will note that gross premiums written grew by $529 million or 24.8% to almost $2.7 billion. Net premiums written grew $472 million or 27.2% to more than $2.2 billion, recognizing an increase in both segments. 
Our overall session rate decreased in the quarter due to changes in certain underlying outward reinsurance arrangements, lower reinstatement premium and business mix. Moving into segment production of net premiums written. The insurance segment grew 29.2% to almost $2 billion with an increase in all lines of business. Professional liability led this growth with 64.8% followed by commercial auto of 31%, other liability of 28.7%, short tail lines of 21.2% and workers' compensation of 15.6%. 
The reinsurance and Monoline Excess segment grew about 11% to $218 million with an increase in monoline excess of 20.9% and casualty reinsurance of 17.5%, partially offset by a decrease in property reinsurance of 13.8%. Underwriting income benefited from the compounding rate improvement above loss cost trends, along with growth and exposure and lower claims frequency in certain lines of business. 
We did experience an above-average level of nonweather-related property losses in the quarter that partially offset these benefits. In addition, our current accident year catastrophe losses decreased significantly quarter-over-quarter from $146 million or 8.7 loss ratio points in the prior year to $44 million or 2.2 loss ratio points in the current quarter. 
As a result, quarterly underwriting income increased almost 800% to a record $202 million. The reported loss ratio was 61% in the current quarter compared with 67.7% in 2020. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by about $0.5 million in the current quarter. Accordingly, our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 58.8% compared with 59.2% for the prior year's quarter. 
The continued growth in net premiums earned has benefited the expense ratio, which was 28.7% in the current quarter compared with 31% a year ago. Net premiums earned outpaced underwriting expenses by a margin of more than 8.5%. We also continue to benefit from reduced costs associated with travel and entertainment but do anticipate some of this will be given back as the economy more fully reopens. 
Wrapping up the full picture. On the underwriting side, our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 87.5% for the quarter compared with 90.2% for the prior year quarter. On the investment front, net investment income increased 96.9% to $168 million, driven by strong results in investment funds. The fixed maturity portfolio reflected a decline quarter-over-quarter due to the lower interest rate environment, although the quarterly gap is closing. 
We also continue to maintain an above-average level of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2021, which has been decreasing over the past few quarters where we see opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our duration remains flat at 2.4 years while maintaining a high credit quality of AA-. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $24 million is primarily comprised of realized gains on investments of $39 million, a reduction in unrealized gains on equity securities of $18 million and a decrease in the allowance for expected credit losses of $3 million. 
The realized gain was largely driven by the sale of 2 real estate properties which also resulted in the reduction in our debt that was supporting 1 of the real estate properties of approximately $102 million. Corporate expenses increased approximately $13 million due to debt extinguishment costs of $8 million relating to the redemption of hybrid securities on June 1, and higher incentive compensation costs as well. 
In addition, we announced the formation of a new operating unit in the second quarter, which you may recall that such expenses are reflected in corporate until the operation begins writing business and has then moved into the underwriting expense. 
Stockholders' equity increased by $164 million to approximately $6.6 billion in the quarter after regular and special dividends of $112 million. Book value per share increased 2.5% in the quarter and book value per share before dividends increased 4.3%. 
And finally, cash flow from operations continued to be strong with approximately $700 million on a year-to-date basis. And with that, I'll pass it back to Rob."

So let me just offer a couple of quick observations and then we'll get to your Q&A and take the dialogue anywhere participants would like to. 
I think by virtually any measure, it was a great quarter for the company. And from my perspective, it's been the making for some period of time. In addition to that, I think there is a growing amount of evidence that would support the idea that there is more to come, and it's just, again, quite encouraging. 
As far as drilling down into the market a little bit more when we look at the major product lines with the exception of workers' compensation, all of them continue to get rate increases that outpaced our view of loss trend. And that is even as we have been factoring in a bit more for financial inflation. Regarding workers' compensation, there are, again, growing but early signs that the level of erosion there is slowing. That having been said, we also are paying close attention wage inflation and what that may mean for the comp economic model. Rich walked you through the top line. Obviously, the 27% growth plus is pretty healthy, observations there, though. One, please keep in mind, if you go back and you look at 2020, we were not an organization where in Q2 of '20, our top line fell off a cliff. We were, give or take, flat. So this was not just a bounce back to a normal run rate. This was a meaningful growth. 
In addition to that, Richard commented around the Excess and Reinsurance segment. You would have noted possibly in the release and also, again, in Rich's comments, that it was the reinsurance segment where particularly our domestic treaty business where we backed away from a couple of deals where we just felt as though while the rates were good, they weren't good enough for us to participate. 
If you unpack the 27% growth overall, give or take, about 1/3 of it is coming from rate. The balance of it is coming from exposure, as you would have gathered from the rate increase coming in ex comp at this shy of 10%. 
I think it's important that people not read too deeply into, as I suspect some might as to the rate increase and what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or at the same time in the prior year. The simple fact is that when we think about our economic model, it is multidimensional. We look at the margins that are available in the business and as we become pleased with available margins, we start to think about possibly how we reprioritize exposure growth versus pushing further on rate. 
And again, as we have seen the margins in a meaningful part of our portfolio become particularly attractive. We're still pushing for rate. We are still getting great by and large, ex comp, that outpace this trend. But again, growing exposure becomes even more of an opportunity that we are capitalizing on. 
A couple of other comments just as it relates to the top line, I think it's a helpful data point, particularly our specialty businesses are getting flooded with submissions, it's -- and in particular, is our E&S businesses. What's driving it? Two things: an opening economy, which clearly we are benefiting from across the board; and, of course, a standard market that continues to revisit its appetite. 
As far as the opening economy just bouncing back to workers' compensation, as we have expressed in the past, we are concerned with that product line and where rates have gone, but you would have seen that product line growing in our release, and that is really driven by payroll growth. And again, I think it just speaks to the health and well-being of the U.S. economy as it continues to recover. 
Maybe pivoting over to the combined ratio. Rich got through a lot of this, just a couple of observations from my perspective. On the expense front, coming in at [ 28.7 ] from our perspective, is a pretty good place with opportunity to improve from here. As Rich suggested, as our travel and entertainment picks back up certainly some, if not all, of the approximately 50 basis point benefit that we've been getting as far as expenses due to COVID. That is likely to erode and disappear. 
That having been said, if you look at the power of the earned premium coming through and how it is likely to build from here, and you can see that given the written leads the earned there is likely more benefit to be had over time. 
Loss ratio pretty good at 61%. The ex cap accident year, as Rich mentioned, was [ $588 million ]. He talked about non-cap property and loss activity. That added relative to where it was running last year about a little over 2 points. So this was, quite frankly, we had a rash of fires. Some would suggest it's bad luck. We tend to believe that oftentimes, you make your own luck. So we're digging into that to make sure that this is not a new normal, and it was more of a onetime unfortunate series of events. 
Another data point on the loss ratio from the paid loss ratio came in at a very attractive $44.3 million. 
A couple of comments on the investment portfolio. Again, Rich commented on the duration of the 2.4 years. The book yield is running coincidently at about 2.4 as well. 
We continue to be very focused on inflation. From our perspective, inflation is very much here. There are some people that talked about it being this transient. That may be true. I'm not quite sure when people talk about transient well, how long is transient regardless the cost of things are up today. But even if you saw inflation return to a 2.5% or 3% level, we continue to believe that a 10-year [ 130 ] or less doesn't make a whole lot of sense for the long run. [Audio Gap]

Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. The positive momentum continues to build in our business, as evident by our growth in premium and expansion in underwriting profits as rate improvements and additional premium associated with increase in exposure earned through the income statement.
We reported a consecutive quarterly record underwriting profit in the second quarter of 2021, along with strong net investment income, resulting in an annualized return on beginning-of-year equity of 15%. The company reported net income of $237 million or $1.27 per share. The components include operating income of $219 million or $1.17 per share and after-tax net investment gains of $18 million or $0.10 per share.
Drilling down into our quarterly underwriting performance, you will note that gross premiums written grew by $529 million or 24.8% to almost $2.7 billion. Net premiums written grew $472 million or 27.2% to more than $2.2 billion, recognizing an increase in both segments. Our overall session rate decreased in the quarter due to changes in certain underlying outward reinsurance arrangements, lower reinstatement premium and business mix.
Moving into segment production of net premiums written. The Insurance segment grew 29.2% to almost $2 billion with an increase in all lines of business. Professional liability led this growth with 64.8%, followed by commercial auto of 31%, other liability of 28.7%, short tail lines of 21.2% and workers' compensation of 15.6%.
The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment grew about 11% to $218 million with an increase in monoline excess of 20.9% and casualty reinsurance of 17.5%, partially offset by a decrease in property reinsurance of 13.8%. Underwriting income benefited from the compounding rate improvement above loss cost trends, along with growth in exposure and lower claims frequency in certain lines of business.
We did experience an above-average level of non-weather-related property losses in the quarter that partially offset these benefits. In addition, our current accident year catastrophe losses decreased significantly quarter-over-quarter from $146 million or 8.7 loss ratio points in the prior year to $44 million or 2.2 loss ratio points in the current quarter.
As a result, quarterly underwriting income increased almost 800% to a record $202 million. The reported loss ratio was 61% in the current quarter compared with 67.7% in 2020. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by about $0.5 million in the current quarter. Accordingly, our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 58.8% compared with 59.2% for the prior year's quarter.
The continued growth in net premiums earned has benefited the expense ratio, which was 28.7% in the current quarter compared with 31% a year ago. Net premiums earned outpaced underwriting expenses by a margin of more than 8.5%. We also continue to benefit from reduced costs associated with travel and entertainment but do anticipate some of this will be given back as the economy more fully reopens.
Wrapping up the full picture. On the underwriting side, our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 87.5% for the quarter compared with 90.2% for the prior year quarter. On the investment front, net investment income increased 96.9% to $168 million, driven by strong results in investment funds. The fixed maturity portfolio reflected a decline quarter-over-quarter due to the lower interest rate environment, although the quarterly gap is closing.
We also continue to maintain an above-average level of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2021, which has been decreasing over the past few quarters where we see opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our duration remains flat at 2.4 years while maintaining a high credit quality of AA-. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $24 million is primarily comprised of realized gains on investments of $39 million, a reduction in unrealized gains on equity securities of $18 million and a decrease in the allowance for expected credit losses of $3 million.
The realized gain was largely driven by the sale of 2 real estate properties, which also resulted in the reduction in our debt that was supporting 1 of the real estate properties of approximately $102 million. Corporate expenses increased approximately $13 million due to debt extinguishment costs of $8 million relating to the redemption of hybrid securities on June 1, and higher incentive compensation costs as well.
In addition, we announced the formation of a new operating unit in the second quarter, which you may recall that such expenses are reflected in corporate until the operation begins writing business and has then moved into the underwriting expense.
Stockholders' equity increased by $164 million to approximately $6.6 billion in the quarter after regular and special dividends of $112 million. Book value per share increased 2.5% in the quarter and book value per share before dividends increased 4.3%. And finally, cash flow from operations continued to be strong with approximately $700 million on a year-to-date basis.
And with that, I'll pass it back to Rob."

I think by virtually any measure, it was a great quarter for the company. And from my perspective, it's been in the making for some period of time. In addition to that, I think there is a growing amount of evidence that would support the idea that there is more to come, and it's just, again, quite encouraging.
As far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines with the exception of workers' compensation, all of them continued to get rate increases that outpaced our view of loss trend. And that is even as we have been factoring in a bit more for financial inflation.
Regarding workers' compensation, there are, again, growing but early signs that the level of erosion there is slowing. That having been said, we also are paying close attention wage inflation and what that may mean for the comp economic model.
Rich walked you through the top line. Obviously, the 27% growth plus is pretty healthy. A couple of observations there, though. One, please keep in mind, if you go back and you look at 2020, we were not an organization where in Q2 of '20, our top line fell off a cliff. We were, give or take, flat. So this was not just a bounce back to a normal run rate. This was a meaningful growth.
In addition to that, Richard commented around the Excess & Reinsurance segment. You would have noted possibly in the release and also, again, in Rich's comments that it was the reinsurance segment where -- particularly our domestic treaty business where we backed away from a couple of deals where we just felt as though while the rates were good, they weren't good enough for us to participate.
If you unpack the 27% growth overall, give or take, about 1/3 of it is coming from rate. The balance of it is coming from exposure, as you would have gathered from the rate increase coming in ex comp at just shy of 10%.
I think it's important that people not read too deeply into, as I suspect some might, as to the rate increase and what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or at the same time in the prior year. The simple fact is that when we think about our economic model, it is multidimensional. We look at the margins that are available in the business and as we become pleased with available margins, we start to think about possibly how we reprioritize exposure growth versus pushing further on rate.
And again, as we have seen, the margins in a meaningful part of our portfolio become particularly attractive. We're still pushing for rate. We are still getting rate, by and large, ex comp, that outpace this trend. But again, growing exposure becomes even more of an opportunity that we are capitalizing on.
A couple of other comments just as it relates to the top line, I think it's a helpful data point, particularly our specialty businesses are getting flooded with submissions. It's a -- and in particular is our E&S businesses. What's driving it? Two things: an opening economy, which clearly we are benefiting from across the board; and, of course, a standard market that continues to revisit its appetite.
As far as the opening economy, just bouncing back to workers' compensation, as we have expressed in the past, we are concerned with that product line and where rates have gone, but you would have seen that product line growing in our release, and that is really driven by payroll growth. And again, I think it just speaks to the health and well-being of the U.S. economy as it continues to recover.
Maybe pivoting over to the combined ratio. Rich got through a lot of this, just a couple of observations from my perspective. On the expense front coming in at 28.7%, from our perspective, is a pretty good place with opportunity to improve from here. As Rich suggested, as our travel and entertainment picks back up, certainly some, if not all, of the approximately 50 basis point benefit that we've been getting as far as expenses due to COVID. That is likely to erode and disappear.
That having been said, if you look at the power of the earned premium coming through and how it is likely to build from here, and you can see that, given the written leads they earned, there is likely more benefit to be had over time.
Loss ratio, pretty good at 61%. The ex cat accident year, as Rich mentioned, was 58.8%. He talked about non-cap property and loss activity. That added relative to where it was running last year about a little over 2 points. So this was, quite frankly, we had a rash of fires. Some would suggest it's bad luck. We tend to believe that, oftentimes, you make your own luck. So we're digging into that to make sure that this is not a new normal, and it was more of a onetime unfortunate series of events. Another data point on the loss ratio from the paid loss ratio came in at a very attractive 44.3%.
A couple of comments on the investment portfolio. Again, Rich commented on the duration of the 2.4 years. The book yield is running, coincidently, at about 2.4 as well.
We continue to be very focused on inflation. From our perspective, inflation is very much here. There are some people that talked about it being this transient. That may be true. I'm not quite sure when people talk about transient, well, how long is transient. Regardless, the cost of things are up today. But even if you saw inflation return to a 2.5% or 3% level, we continue to believe that a 10-year 1.30% or less doesn't make a whole lot of sense for the long run.
One other comment just related to the balance sheet and the capital structure, and we can get into this during the Q&A if people are interested. We've done a fair amount of work in restructuring certain things per one of Rich's comments around the prepayment or the calling of certain securities and the costs associated with that. But as you think about, again, the earnings power of the business later this year, but even more so for '22 and '23, there's very meaningful benefit that will be coming through, again, savings around capital costs.
So long story short, very good quarter. And I think what's more encouraging than even just the results is if you look at how the table is set for what is likely not just to be the next couple of quarters, but quite frankly, the next couple of years, this is an organization that is going to benefit greatly from the broader macro conditions.
So let me pause there. And Suzanne, we'd like to open it up for questions now if we could, please."

When you come up with a loss pick for workers' comp, obviously, there are a variety of components. One of the components is the medical trend assumption that you are using. So when you think about the exposure, you make certain assumptions around payrolls. And to the extent that payroll or wage inflation is driving payrolls up more and perhaps medical inflation is going up but not going up by as -- or is not keeping up with the wage inflation, that could then err to the benefit of the margin."

So in addition to me on this end of the phone, you also have Bill Berkley, our Executive Chair; as well as Rich Baio, Executive Vice President and Chie",809,"Emma, thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining for our third quarter call. So in addition to me on this end of the phone, you also have Bill Berkley, our Executive Chair; as well as Rich Baio, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
We are going to follow our typical agenda, where in a couple of moments, I'm going to hand it over to Rich. He's going to walk us through the highlights from the quarter. I will follow him with a couple of brief soundbites or reflections. And then in pretty short order, we will open it up for Q&A, and happy to take the conversation in any direction where people would like to. 
But before I hand the mic to Rich, I did want to flag with folks, one sort of macro observation. We were chatting internally earlier and how it seems like the quarterly calls oftentimes turn into an every 90-day session talking about certain numbers, which oftentimes go out a certain number of basis points. And while those discussions are worthwhile and productive from our perspective, it's also important that people not lose sight of the macro. And it is something that we spend a lot of time every day thinking about. And that is what is the goal of the exercise what we are trying to do? 
And clearly, one of the cornerstone goals is building book value. Building book value is an important thing for a whole host of reasons, including building book value allows the organization to live up or meet the needs of the various stakeholders. When we think about building book value, we approach it with an idea that we'll refer to as risk-adjusted return that many of you have heard us talk about in the past. 
We take this approach and apply it to both our investing as well as our underwriting activities. And while you probably hear more companies than not in their own words talk about these concepts, I think one of the differentiating, excuse me, ways that we approach this idea is how we think about volatility as a component of risk. 
And again, this is something that we've discussed in the past, but I think it's particularly timely particularly relevant when we have a quarter for the industry, for society, like we saw in Q3. This idea of volatility as a component of risk-adjusted return, we certainly grapple with on both the investing and underwriting side of the business. You can see it on the investment side, for example, and how we have thought about duration and how we have been willing to keep our duration short. And even though that comes at a cost, we do not think the risk-adjusted return is there to justify going out on the curve and extending that duration. We do not believe you get paid enough for that potential risk. 
In addition to that, again, as it once again crystallized in the third quarter when we think about underwriting activities, and we think about volatility as a component of risk. Clearly, the industry is feeling the challenges that come along with cat activity. From our perspective, cat activity is there on a regular basis. And why people choose to back it out on a regular basis, doesn't make a whole lot of sense to us. Our view is that volatility is real. It is a real component of risk. When we think about running the business, it is a great priority to us and how we think about deploying capital. 
So I'm going to pause there. But before I do, I guess, one last comment. I know that there are a lot of people that will look at our numbers, and Rich will walk you through it and you'll do the math, and you'll come up with an ex-cat accident year loss ratio, and what does that mean it is on a combined ratio. And that will probably get you to approximately an 86.9%. But from our perspective, if 1 chooses to slip off the rose-colored glasses for a moment, we generated at 90.4%. That is reality from our perspective. But in spite of the cats and the impact, we did achieve a very healthy underwriting result. And in the process, we achieved a 16.6% return on equity. 
Ultimately, when one thinks about building book value, you can't just think about the steps forward that you take, you need to think about how you avoid the steps backwards. And when you think about compounding book value over an extended period of time, when you think about value creation for shareholders amongst other stakeholders, not taking those steps backwards, is a big part of the puzzle. 
So with that, Rich, I will hand it over to you. If you would please walk us through."

Thanks very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Operating income increased by more than 100% to $247 million or $1.32 per share, which is compared with $121 million or $0.65 per share.

Operating income increased by more than 100% to $247 million or $1.32 per share, which is compared with $121 million or $0.65 per share. The increase is primarily attributable to strong underwriting results, net investment income and foreign currency gains. 
The company built upon the strong first half of the year with continued growth in premium and expansion in underwriting profits. From a production perspective, gross premiums written grew by $525 million or 23.2% to a record of almost $2.8 billion. Net premiums written grew by $446 million or 23.7% to another record of more than $2.3 billion. The session rate was fairly consistent at 16.6% in the current quarter. 
Breaking down the results further, the Insurance segment grew net premiums written by 23.3% to more than $2 billion, reflecting increases in all lines of business. Professional liability led this growth with 58.7%, followed by commercial auto of 28.1%, other liability of 25.3%, short tail lines of 8.6% and workers' compensation of 7.7%. 
The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment grew 26.7% to $318 million, with an increase in casualty reinsurance of 36% and monoline excess of 27.4%, partially offset by a small decline in property reinsurance of 1.4%. The increase in net premiums written on a year-to-date basis was more than 20%, resulting from growth in exposure and compounding rate improvements that will continue to earn through in the coming quarters. This was evident by the increase in net premiums earned of 19% in the current quarter. 
Included in the quarter were current accident year catastrophe losses of $74 million or 3.5 loss ratio points compared with $73 million or 4.2 loss ratio points in the prior year. As a result, quarterly underwriting profits increased 80% to $200 million, slightly off the record quarterly underwriting results in the second quarter of this year. The reported loss ratio improved 1.3 loss ratio points to 62.4% from the prior year, primarily driven by rate improvement and business mix. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by approximately $1.5 million in the current quarter. 
The expense ratio improved 2 points to 28%, in large part due to the growth in net premiums earned, which is outpacing underwriting expenses by approximately 7.5%. This improvement is evident from an operating cost as well as acquisition cost perspective. We continue to highlight the partial benefit from reduced travel and entertainment, which is slowly coming back. 
Closing out the underwriting performance, our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.9% for the quarter compared with 89.8% for the prior year quarter. 
Turning to investments. Net investment income increased 26.1% to $180 million, driven by strong results in investment funds. The significant contribution in investment funds represents 3 consecutive quarters of outperformance. And we feel it's important to highlight that the investment fund results are not necessarily representative of future earnings. 
Despite the ongoing growth in invested assets, the fixed maturity portfolio represents 69% of the total invested assets, and the associated investment income declined quarter-over-quarter due to the persistent low interest rate environment. Strong operating cash flows of more than $825 million in the quarter contributed to the increased cash and cash equivalents as of September 30. This resulted in a slightly shorter duration of 2.3 years in the current quarter compared with 2.4 years in the second quarter. 
The credit quality of the fixed maturity portfolio remains high at AA-. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $20 million is primarily comprised of realized gains on investments of $36 million, partially offset by a reduction in unrealized gains on equity securities of $19 million. The realized gains was largely driven by the sale of real estate properties in the Southeast. The effective tax rate was 19.6% in the quarter, which largely benefited from equity-based compensation that predominantly vests in August of each year. Overall strong performance resulted in an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 16.6%, as Rob alluded to. 
Stockholders' equity increased by $70 million to approximately $6.6 billion in the quarter after regular dividends of $23 million and share repurchases of $93 million. The company repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares at an average price of $72.03 per share in the quarter. Book value per share increased 1.5% in the quarter, and book value per share before dividends and share repurchases increased 2.5%. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Rob."

So a couple of quick thoughts from me, just following on Richard's comments. Well, for starters, by virtually any measure, a pretty attractive and healthy quarter. top line, bottom line and pretty much everything in between the 2 book ends. As far as the top line goes, obviously, the growth is shy of the 24%. Rich and I were doing a little bit of mass together earlier. When you think about that growth, Sort of this shy of 40% of the growth is coming from rate, about 59% is coming in some form of exposure, whether it's new policies or audit premiums or whatever. And then there's a de minimis amount coming from some other stuff. 
It's just -- it's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which continues to feel a bit of a growing headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just general market conditions are reasonably attractive. And we don't see that trend changing. More specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-related specialty writers and even more so the E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty and even more so in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse anytime soon. So that's definitely encouraging. 
On the loss side, we're trying to be thoughtful and measured as we've discussed in the past. Clearly, there is inflation out there. We spent years talking about social inflation. It's still there from -- at least through our lens. And in addition to that, the realities of financial inflation clearly are having an impact on loss costs. And those are 2 very leveraged assumptions. 
So when we look at our book, we believe the rate increases that we are getting in virtually all P&C lines with the exception of workers' comp are outpacing trend, we are paying close attention to trend and as suggested a moment or 2 ago, trying to be very thoughtful and measured around that. 
On the expense side, Rich, pretty much covered it. I would just sort of take a half a pace back for those that have followed the company for some period of time. This is an organization where we have not made many acquisitions. We have been much more of a subscriber to the de novo model. We have started 47 of the 54 operating units from scratch. Some of those businesses have not gotten to critical mass and -- but they're on their way to getting to critical mass. And a tailwind as far as market conditions is allowing that to happen. 
So when you look at the leverage that we're getting on the expense ratio as that earned premium continues to build, a lot of that is, yes, market conditions, which is allowing some of our more mature businesses to scale, but it's also some of our smaller operations that are now seeing the window of opportunity to put more meat on the bones. 
Not much to add on the investment portfolio. Obviously, the duration, as I had referenced and Rich covered, is sitting there at 2.3. Book yield is about 2.3. It comes at a cost to have that discipline and to have that optionality going forward. From our perspective, inflation is here, it's real. And there's likely for it to be around for some period of time. 
I think I am going to pause there, and I will save a couple of comments for the tail end. But actually, before I do that, since most people after the Q&A does hang up, I will just, again, make the comment that when we not just look at our results, but when we look at the front windshield, there is really nothing that we see in front of us that is going to derail the momentum that we are enjoying today. It's a cyclical business. This will not go on forever, but for the moment, the momentum continues. 
So Emma, why don't I finally stop there and let's see what the participants would like to talk about."

And that will probably, over time, reduce from here. 
But the earned premium continues to grow. So what do we think the expense ratio is going to be going forward? Will we be able to sustain a 28? Look, it's a cyclical business, and we continue to try and operate and maximize the opportunity that's in front of us. At the same time, at some point, the wind will shift direction and being the disciplined underwriting operation that we are that our top line may at some point start to shrink and the expense ratio will go the other way. 
So do I think that you should -- I'm not going to tell you what number to pencil in. But I would tell you that if you look at our written premium, you should be able to extrapolate where our earned premium is going, and that should give you a good sense as to how you might want to think about expenses."

And as a result of that, your -- people were not getting the care. 
I think it is certainly possible you're going to see an uptick. So if you forget about the insurance industry for a moment and you look at the parts of the health care industry, for example, the hospital industry, you will see that there are a huge surge in patients in hospitals, and they are coming in and worse condition than they were pre-COVID. And a lot of that is not COVID-related directly per se, it's because people were not getting care or they were postponing the care and they are sicker. 
So I would suggest to you, whether it's comp or health care in general, you saw, I think, there is medical inflation. I think pharma prices continue to climb. I think costs in general continue to climb, but you need to separate out actually the cost of care versus the volume."

So in addition to me on this end of the phone, you also have Bill Berkley, our Executive Chair; as well as Rich Baio, Executive Vice President and Chie",810,"Emma, thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining for our third quarter call. So in addition to me on this end of the phone, you also have Bill Berkley, our Executive Chair; as well as Rich Baio, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We are going to follow our typical agenda, where in a couple of moments, I'm going to hand it over to Rich. He's going to walk us through the highlights from the quarter. I will follow him with a couple of brief soundbites or reflections. And then in pretty short order, we will open it up for Q&A, and happy to take the conversation in any direction where people would like to.
But before I hand the mic to Rich, I did want to flag with folks one sort of macro observation. We were chatting internally earlier and how it seems like the quarterly calls oftentimes turn into an every 90-day session talking about certain numbers, which oftentimes go out a certain number of basis points. And while those discussions are worthwhile and productive from our perspective, it's also important that people not lose sight of the macro. And it is something that we spend a lot of time every day thinking about. And that is, what is the goal of the exercise what we are trying to do?
And clearly, one of the cornerstone goals is building book value. Building book value is an important thing for a whole host of reasons, including building book value allows the organization to live up or meet the needs of the various stakeholders. When we think about building book value, we approach it with an idea that we'll refer to as risk-adjusted return that many of you have heard us talk about in the past.
We take this approach and apply it to both our investing as well as our underwriting activities. And while you'd probably hear more companies than not in their own words talk about these concepts, I think one of the differentiating -- excuse me, ways that we approach this idea is how we think about volatility as a component of risk.
And again, this is something that we've discussed in the past, but I think it's particularly timely, particularly relevant when we have a quarter for the industry, for society like we saw in Q3. This idea of volatility as a component of risk-adjusted return, we certainly grapple with on both the investing and underwriting side of the business. You can see it on the investment side, for example, and how we have thought about duration and how we have been willing to keep our duration short. And even though that comes at a cost, we do not think the risk-adjusted return is there to justify going out on the curve and extending that duration. We do not believe you get paid enough for that potential risk.
In addition to that, again, as it once again crystallized in the third quarter when we think about underwriting activities, and we think about volatility as a component of risk. Clearly, the industry is feeling the challenges that come along with cat activity. From our perspective, cat activity is there on a regular basis. And why people choose to back it out on a regular basis doesn't make a whole lot of sense to us. Our view is that volatility is real. It is a real component of risk. When we think about running the business, it is of great priority to us and how we think about deploying capital.
So I'm going to pause there. But before I do, I guess, one last comment. I know that there are a lot of people that will look at our numbers, and Rich will walk you through it, and you'll do the math, and you'll come up with an ex-cat accident year loss ratio, and what does that mean it is on a combined ratio. And that will probably get you to approximately an 86.9%. But from our perspective, if one chooses to slip off the rose-colored glasses for a moment, we generated a 90.4%. That is reality from our perspective. But in spite of the cats and the impact, we did achieve a very healthy underwriting result. And in the process, we achieved a 16.6% return on equity.
Ultimately, when one thinks about building book value, you can't just think about the steps forward that you take, you need to think about how you avoid the steps backwards. And when you think about compounding book value over an extended period of time, when you think about value creation for shareholders amongst other stakeholders, not taking those steps backwards is a big part of the puzzle.
So with that, Rich, I will hand it over to you. If you would please walk us through."

Thanks very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Operating income increased by more than 100% to $247 million or $1.32 per share, which is compared with $121 million or $0.65 per share. The increase is primarily attributable to strong underw",739,"Terrific, Rob. Thanks very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Operating income increased by more than 100% to $247 million or $1.32 per share, which is compared with $121 million or $0.65 per share. The increase is primarily attributable to strong underwriting results, net investment income and foreign currency gains.
The company built upon the strong first half of the year with continued growth in premium and expansion in underwriting profits. From a production perspective, gross premiums written grew by $525 million or 23.2% to a record of almost $2.8 billion. Net premiums written grew by $446 million or 23.7% to another record of more than $2.3 billion. The session rate was fairly consistent at 16.6% in the current quarter.
Breaking down the results further, the Insurance segment grew net premiums written by 23.3% to more than $2 billion, reflecting increases in all lines of business. Professional liability led this growth with 58.7%, followed by commercial auto of 28.1%, other liability of 25.3%, short tail lines of 8.6% and workers' compensation of 7.7%.
The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment grew 26.7% to $318 million, with an increase in casualty reinsurance of 36% and monoline excess of 27.4%, partially offset by a small decline in property reinsurance of 1.4%. The increase in net premiums written on a year-to-date basis was more than 20%, resulting from growth in exposure and compounding rate improvements that will continue to earn through in the coming quarters. This was evident by the increase in net premiums earned of 19% in the current quarter.
Included in the quarter were current accident year catastrophe losses of $74 million or 3.5 loss ratio points compared with $73 million or 4.2 loss ratio points in the prior year. As a result, quarterly underwriting profits increased 80% to $200 million, slightly off the record quarterly underwriting results in the second quarter of this year. The reported loss ratio improved 1.3 loss ratio points to 62.4% from the prior year, primarily driven by rate improvement and business mix. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by approximately $1.5 million in the current quarter.
The expense ratio improved 2 points to 28%, in large part due to the growth in net premiums earned, which is outpacing underwriting expenses by approximately 7.5%. This improvement is evident from an operating cost as well as acquisition cost perspective. We continue to highlight the partial benefit from reduced travel and entertainment, which is slowly coming back.
Closing out the underwriting performance, our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.9% for the quarter compared with 89.8% for the prior year quarter.
Turning to investments. Net investment income increased 26.1% to $180 million, driven by strong results in investment funds. This significant contribution in investment funds represents 3 consecutive quarters of outperformance, and we feel it's important to highlight that the investment fund results are not necessarily representative of future earnings.
Despite the ongoing growth in invested assets, the fixed maturity portfolio represents 69% of the total invested assets, and the associated investment income declined quarter-over-quarter due to the persistent low interest rate environment. Strong operating cash flows of more than $825 million in the quarter contributed to the increased cash and cash equivalents as of September 30. This resulted in a slightly shorter duration of 2.3 years in the current quarter compared with 2.4 years in the second quarter.
The credit quality of the fixed maturity portfolio remains high at AA-. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $20 million is primarily comprised of realized gains on investments of $36 million, partially offset by a reduction in unrealized gains on equity securities of $19 million. The realized gains was largely driven by the sale of real estate properties in the Southeast. The effective tax rate was 19.6% in the quarter, which largely benefited from equity-based compensation that predominantly vests in August of each year. Overall strong performance resulted in an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 16.6%, as Rob alluded to.
Stockholders' equity increased by $70 million to approximately $6.6 billion in the quarter after regular dividends of $23 million and share repurchases of $93 million. The company repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares at an average price of $72.03 per share in the quarter. Book value per share increased 1.5% in the quarter, and book value per share before dividends and share repurchases increased 2.5%.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Rob."

Very clear, very helpful. So a couple of quick thoughts from me, just following on Rich's comments. Well, for starters, by virtually any measure, a pretty attractive and healthy quarter, top line, bottom line and pretty much eve",706,"Rich, thank you very much. Very clear, very helpful. So a couple of quick thoughts from me, just following on Rich's comments. Well, for starters, by virtually any measure, a pretty attractive and healthy quarter, top line, bottom line and pretty much everything in between the 2 book ends. As far as the top line goes, obviously, the growth is shy of the 24%. Rich and I were doing a little bit of mass together earlier. When you think about that growth, sort of just shy of 40% of the growth is coming from rate, about 59% is coming in some form of exposure, whether it's new policies or auto premiums or whatever. And then there's a de minimis amount coming from some other stuff.
It's just it's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, ex most of the workers' comp market, which continues to feel a bit of a growing headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just general market conditions are reasonably attractive. And we don't see that trend changing. More specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-related specialty writers and even more so the E&S market.
We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty and even more so in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse anytime soon. So that's definitely encouraging.
On the loss side, we're trying to be thoughtful and measured as we've discussed in the past. Clearly, there is inflation out there. We spent years talking about social inflation. It's still there from -- at least through our lens. And in addition to that, the realities of financial inflation, clearly, are having an impact on loss costs. And those are 2 very leveraged assumptions.
So when we look at our book, we believe the rate increases that we are getting in virtually all P&C lines, with the exception of workers' comp, are outpacing trend. We are paying close attention to trend and as suggested a moment or 2 ago, trying to be very thoughtful and measured around that.
On the expense side, Rich, pretty much covered it. I would just sort of take a half a pace back for those that have followed the company for some period of time. This is an organization where we have not made many acquisitions. We have been much more of a subscriber to the de novo model. We have started 47 of the 54 operating units from scratch. Some of those businesses have not gotten to a critical mass and -- but they're on their way to getting to critical mass. And a tailwind as far as market conditions is allowing that to happen.
So when you look at the leverage that we're getting on the expense ratio as that earned premium continues to build, a lot of that is, yes, market conditions, which is allowing some of our more mature businesses to scale, but it's also some of our smaller operations that are now seeing the window of opportunity to put more meat on the bones.
Not much to add on the investment portfolio. Obviously, the duration, as I had referenced and Rich covered, is sitting there at 2.3 years. Book yield is about 2.3%. It comes at a cost to have that discipline and to have that optionality going forward. From our perspective, inflation is here, it's real. And there's likely for it to be around for some period of time.
I think I am going to pause there, and I will save a couple of comments for the tail end. But actually, before I do that, since most people after the Q&A does hang up, I will just, again, make the comment that when we not just look at our results, but when we look at the front windshield, there is really nothing that we see in front of us that is going to derail the momentum that we are enjoying today. It's a cyclical business. This will not go on forever, but for the moment, the momentum continues.
So Emma, why don't I finally stop there, and let's see what the participants would like to talk about."

Things are starting to open back up. People are starting to travel, and the 40 or 50 basis points that we saw early this year and last year is probably now down to, I don't know, call it, 30 basis points or so. And that will probably, over time, reduce from here.
But the earned premium continues to grow. So what do we think the expense ratio is going to be going forward? Will we be able to sustain a 28%? Look, it's a cyclical business, and we continue to try and operate and maximize the opportunity that's in front of us. At the same time, at some point, the wind will shift direction and being the disciplined underwriting operation that we are that our top line may at some point start to shrink and the expense ratio will go the other way.
So do I think that you should -- I'm not going to tell you what number to pencil in. But I would tell you that if you look at our written premium, you should be able to extrapolate where our earned premium is going, and that should give you a good sense as to how you might want to think about expenses."

I think that there is maybe -- perhaps among some a false sense of comfort. I think one of the things that happened during COVID is that people, in general, whether it be related to comp or other health needs, people were reluctant to go into health-related or medical-related venues. And as a result of that, your -- people were not getting the care.
I think it is certainly possible you're going to see an uptick. So if you forget about the insurance industry for a moment and you look at the parts of the health care industry, for example, the hospital industry, you will see that there are a huge surge in patients in hospitals, and they are coming in in worse condition than they were pre-COVID. And a lot of that is not COVID-related directly per se, it's because people were not getting care or they were postponing the care and they are sicker.
So I would suggest to you, whether it's comp or health care in general, you saw, I think, there is medical inflation. I think pharma prices continue to climb. I think costs in general continue to climb, but you need to separate out actually the cost of care versus the volume."
