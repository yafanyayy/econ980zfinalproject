Thank you for joining us today for our 2020 fourth quarter call and a wrap up of what's been a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. I hope that you and your families are staying healthy as we all work to get beyond the pandemic. 
Before I cover many of the highlights from the quarter and the year, I want to share some news about our Investor Relations team. This will be Ken's last earnings call as he plans to retire at the end of March. You've all come to know Ken very well over the years. He's been leading the IR function since 2005 and is concluding a remarkable 25-year career at Thermo Fisher. Ken has been the voice of our company to The Street, and he excels in that role. He conveys his extensive knowledge of our company, our markets and our opportunities in a way that's informative and engaging. In fact, you voted Ken the best IR professional in our industry multiple times over the year. And I couldn't agree more, he's been a terrific partner to me and Stephen. Ken, thank you for a truly stellar contribution to Thermo Fisher. 
Looking ahead, we're very fortunate to have Raf Tejada here to take the reins in March. Rap has been a part of the Thermo Investor Relations team for 5 years, and many of you knew him during his time on Wall Street, most recently at Bank of America as an analyst supporting [ Derek ] Brown. I know Raf and the team will carry forward Ken's legacy of excellence and Investor Relations. Please join me in congratulating Raf on his new role and in wishing Ken all the best in his well-deserved retirement. 
So moving on to our results for 2020, an unprecedented year by any measure. I'm pleased to report that we delivered the strongest year in our company's history. This speaks to the incredible work of our 80,000 colleagues around the world. Through their tireless efforts, we led the industry in supporting our customers globally, enabling the societal response to the pandemic. We delivered outstanding results by working with speed at scale to meet our customers' evolving needs. This included generating $6.6 billion of COVID-19 response revenue and quickly returning the base business to growth after the disruption seen across the globe earlier in 2020. The strength of our response activities allowed us to significantly accelerate investments in our company to create an even brighter future with a focus on talent, R&D and new capabilities and capacity. 
We also generated significant free cash flow during 2020, and we're good stewards of capital, creating shareholder value through share buybacks and dividends, building a strong M&A pipeline and reducing our net debt. I'll share some of the many highlights from the quarter and the year later in my remarks, but first, I'll cover the financials at a high level. 
Starting with the quarter. Our revenue grew 54% in Q4 year-over-year to $10.55 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 107% to $3.51 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 840 basis points in Q4 to 33.3%. Finally, adjusted EPS increased 100% to $7.09 per share in the quarter. 
Turning to our results for the full year. We grew revenue by 26% to $32.22 billion in 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 60% to $9.56 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 630 basis points to 29.7%. And we delivered a 58% increase in adjusted EPS to $19.55 per share. Both our fourth quarter and full year financial performance were truly exceptional on all metrics and demonstrated the strength of our growth strategy and our ability to move with speed at scale in responding to rapidly evolving customer needs. 
Let me now turn to our end markets and give you some color on our performance for the quarter and the year. Starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance again in this end market, delivering approximately 25% growth during Q4. We saw very robust growth across all businesses serving these customers, particularly bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences and our research and safety market channel. Our Q4 results capped off an excellent year of growth in the mid-teens. Our strong performance is being driven by our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. 
In academic and government, we grew in the high single digits in the quarter as customers across the globe ramped up activity. We saw good growth across a range of our businesses, particularly chromatography and mass spectrometry and our research and safety market channel. Similarly, in industrial and applied, the team's strong execution helped us return this end market to growth in Q4. We grew in the low single digits during the quarter, and it was good to see our electro microscopy business return to growth. Given the significant impact of the pandemic on customer activity earlier in 2020, both the academic and government and the industrial applied end markets declined in the mid-single-digit growth for the full year. 
Finally, in diagnostics and health care, we had another incredible quarter, delivering more than 200% growth. Our COVID-19 testing revenue continued to accelerate in the quarter as customer demand for our sample preparation, PCR solutions and viral transport media remained very robust. For the full year, diagnostics and healthcare grew by more than 100%, driven by our leading role in supporting COVID-19 testing around the world. Our outstanding performance was the result of having the right technologies and the ability to rapidly scale up manufacturing, which was enabled by our PPI Business System. 
As I think back to this call a year ago, and how quickly conditions evolve during the year, I'm humbled by the incredible impact our team had in navigating the environment while supporting so many aspects of the pandemic response. As a reminder, very early in the year, our cryo-electron microscopes were used by researchers to create the first 3D image of the virus. We were a critical supplier of PPE, leveraging our strong channel relationships to secure these products when supplies were scarce. We enabled COVID-19 testing at an unprecedented level, creating a market-leading molecular diagnostics business in just a few months to support hundreds of millions of PCR tests around the world. And as you know, we've built trusted relationships with the pharma and biotech industry over many years and have provided them with the right set of products and services. As a result, these customers engage with us on a significant number of projects to help develop and produce vaccines and therapies. 
In 2020, this led to $500 million in COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue, and we expect that to increase to $1 billion in 2021. Our comprehensive response to the pandemic demonstrates the unique capabilities of Thermo Fisher Scientific. 
Now let me turn to a business update framed by our growth strategy and highlight just a few of our many achievements. As a reminder, there are 3 pillars to our growth strategy. First, we're committed to high-impact innovation; second, we leverage our scale in the high-growth in emerging markets; and third, we deliver a unique value proposition to our customers. 
Starting with the first pillar, it was an extraordinary year of high-impact innovation. In response to the pandemic, we established worldwide leadership in COVID-19 testing. We quickly developed and gained regulatory approval to launch the TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit in March, providing gold standard PCR-based test for our customers at a scale our industry has never seen before. We also significantly expanded our portfolio of COVID-19-related products, including our [indiscernible] amplitude solution for high-throughput PCR-based testing and our Taq Check PCR test for asymptomatic health surveillance. In addition, we launched a number of highly innovative products across our base business to strengthen our leading positions in analytical instruments, biosciences and bioproduction. 
For example, in mass spectrometry, we extended our industry-leading Orbitrap franchise with 2 new generation explores mass spectrometers. In our electron microscopy business, we launched 2 [ Cellectis ] imaging filters for our cryo-electron microscopes. And in Q4, we introduced the Tundra cryo-electron microscope. And these are just some of the examples of how we're continuing to expand the benefits of this groundbreaking technology and democratize its use. 
The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets. Our actions in the region are a great example of how our ongoing investments and the differentiated customer experience we've created sets us up to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities there. 
In China, we further accelerated from our strong Q3 results, growing 30% in Q4. To continue to strengthen our presence in China and support the local biotech industry, during the year, we localize the manufacturing of single-use bioproduction technologies at our Center of Excellence in Suzhou. And in the quarter, we announced the formation of a joint venture to establish a biological drug development and manufacturing facility in Hangzhou. 
Last, I want to touch on the third pillar of our strategy, our unique customer value proposition. Entering 2021, our relationships with customers and governments around the world have never been stronger. Let me give you some examples. 
When the pandemic hit, we were uniquely positioned to help our pharma and biotech customers develop and eventually produce COVID-19 vaccine -- related therapies and vaccines because of the trusted relationships we've built over many years. We moved quickly and invested significantly in our infrastructure, scaling up to support the volumes needed as well as adding capabilities for new modalities such as mRNA. The broad and fast response helped deepen our already strong customer relationships, and this positions us incredibly well to help them with their near-term COVID-19 needs as well as the longer-term needs for future vaccines and therapies for other diseases. And through our extensive work in molecular diagnostics, clinical labs now have an even greater appreciation of our leading offering in specialty diagnostics. We've dramatically increased our PCR and sample preparation instrument installed base, and our customers have seen how strong a partner we are in addressing this -- their needs. 
Bringing this all together, we execute our proven growth strategy using our PPI business system that enables our teams to operate with speed at scale and was a key differentiator in our success last year. PPI is our operational discipline and enables us to translate the top line growth into strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We entered 2020 with excellent long-term growth prospects as a company. The way we executed for our customers throughout the year further unlocked our growth potential, which will benefit us in 2021 and beyond. Let me give you some color on the increased investments we were able to make because of our strong performance. 
In innovation, we ramped up our R&D investment by approximately 20% to $1.2 billion. In emerging markets, we expanded our localized capacity and capabilities to further advance our leadership. And to enhance our unique customer value proposition, we invested significant CapEx in our high-growth bioproduction, pharma services and biosciences businesses as well as in commercial capabilities to further differentiate the customer experience. 
In total, last year, we invested an additional $1 billion to accelerate our long-term growth, roughly half in CapEx and half in P&L investments. These actions, combined with the substantial investments planned for 2021, will position our company for a very bright future. 
Turning now to capital deployment. We have a strong track record of creating value for our shareholders, and we continued to execute our strategy in 2020. During the year, we returned a total of $1.8 billion in capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and a growing dividend. As you know, we announced several strategic bolt-on acquisitions. In our Pharma Services business, we entered into a strategic partnership with CSL to expand our biologics capacity for this rapidly growing market. We acquired Phitonex to enhance our flow cytometry offering for cell analysis. Shortly after year-end, we acquired the European viral vector manufacturing business from Novasep. And we signed an agreement to acquire Mesa Biotech to enhance our PCR-based diagnostics, adding gold standard technology in a rapid point-of-care testing format. We ended '21 -- 2021 with a very strong balance sheet, active and inactive deal pipeline. As always, we'll continue to apply our disciplined approach to opportunities and continue to be good stewards of our capital. 
Before I turn to guidance, 2020 year -- 2020 was also a significant year of progress in terms of environmental, social and governance priorities. We've always been a company that's focused on having a positive impact on the world. That's the true embodiment of our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I'll highlight a couple of the initiatives that are having a big social impact. 
One is that we launched and significantly funded the Thermo Fisher Foundation for science, expanding our STEM education programs to benefit underserved communities. Another is that we established the Just Project, a collaboration with historically by colleges and universities where we've invested in a COVID-19 testing program, allowing students and faculty to safely return to campus. I'm proud of these and the many steps our teams are taking to make a difference in our communities around the world. Taking a step back and reflecting on the year as a whole, by all measures, we delivered an outstanding year. 
Now looking ahead to 2021. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. In terms of our revenue guidance, we expect to deliver $35.1 billion in 2021, which would result in reported revenue growth of 9%. We're initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $21.62 per share for the full year. That's 11% growth year-over-year and a continuation of our outstanding track record. 
Before I hand the call over to Stephen, I'll leave you with my key takeaways for the year. The success of our growth strategy clearly sets us apart as the unrivaled leader in our industry. 2020 truly demonstrated the power of who and what we are as a company. During a unique time of need, we stepped up for our customers, enabling their important contributions to society and helping them navigate the recessionary impact of the pandemic. As a result, we were able to gain significant market share and solidify Thermo Fisher as their partner of choice. At the same time, we stay focused on driving strong returns from existing investments and made additional investments to accelerate our future growth. While I'm very proud of our accomplishments during the past year, as I look ahead, I couldn't be more excited about our opportunities in 2021 and beyond. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q4 performance and full year results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with comments around our initial 2021 guidance.",2945,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q4 performance and full year results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with comments around our initial 2021 guidance. 
As you saw in our press release, we achieved an exceptional quarter and grew organically 51% in Q4. This resulted in full year organic growth of 25%. Similar to previous quarters, I'll break down the organic growth into 2 elements. The first is the performance of the base business and the second is the scale of the COVID-19 response revenue. 
In Q4, the base business grew 5% organically, another quarter of sequential improvement. For the full year, the base business was essentially flat as a result of slower economic activity earlier in the year due to the pandemic, partially offset by great commercial execution. Our COVID-19 response revenue also increased significantly in the fourth quarter to $3.2 billion, bringing the full year impact for our customers to $6.6 billion. This was largely driven by testing-related products and instruments. It is also worth noting that we generated $500 million of revenue in 2020 from support for COVID-19-related vaccines and therapies. 
Once again, our PPI Business System enabled excellent pull-through, and we delivered 100% growth in adjusted earnings per share in Q4 and 58% for the full year. Our PPI Business System also enabled us to generate extremely strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the year was $6.8 billion, up 67% versus the prior year. Overall exceptional financial results in 2020. 
Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Starting with our Q4 earnings results. As I mentioned, we grew EPS -- adjusted EPS by 100% to $7.09. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $19.55, up 58% compared to last year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $6.24, up 151% from Q4 last year. And 2020 full year GAAP EPS was $15.96, up 74% versus prior year. 
On the top line, our Q4 reported revenue grew 54% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increase included 51% organic growth and a 3% benefit from foreign exchange. For the full year 2020, reported revenue increased 26%. This includes a 25% contribution from organic growth and a 1% tailwind in foreign exchange. 
Turning to our growth by geographies. During the quarter, all regions delivered very strong growth. North America grew just over 65%; Europe grew approximately 50%; Asia Pacific grew approximately 20%, including China, which grew 30%; and rest of the world grew approximately 50%. For the full year, North America grew just over 30%, Europe grew over 25%, Asia Pacific grew 5% and rest of the world grew approximately 45%. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income increased 107%; and adjusted operating margin was 33.3%, 840 basis points higher than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 60% and adjusted operating margin was 29.7%, which is 630 basis points higher than 2019. In the quarter and for the full year, our PPI business system enabled us to drive exceptional volume leverage, and we also had favorable business mix. This was partially offset by strategic investments across all of our businesses to support our near- and long-term growth. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 53.9%, up 760 basis points from Q4 of the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 51.2%, up 480 basis points versus prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, the increase in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. 
Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17% of revenue, a decrease of 60 basis points versus Q4 2019 due to the strong volume leverage. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 17.9% of revenue, an improvement of 120 basis points compared to 2019. Total R&D expense was $376 million for Q4 and $1.2 billion for the full year, representing growth of 44% and 18%, respectively, reflecting our increased investments in high-impact innovation. 
Looking at our results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $134 million, $37 million higher than Q4 last year, primarily due to higher level of debt. Net interest expense for the full year was $488 million, an increase of $37 million from 2019. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of approximately $3 million, $19 million lower than Q4 2019, mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $40 million, which was $32 million lower than the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16%, up 430 basis points versus Q4 last year. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 14.3% or 320 basis points higher than 2019. The increase in the tax rate was due to the substantial increase in pretax profit year-over-year coming in at our marginal tax rate. Average diluted shares were 400 million in Q4, about 2 million lower year-over-year, driven by the net impact of option dilution and share repurchases. For the full year, the average diluted shares were 399 million. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another great highlight for the year. We significantly increased net capital expenditure to accelerate the execution of our growth strategy while delivering a 67% increase in free cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations was $8.3 billion, net capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $6.8 billion. During 2020, we returned approximately $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, and we ended Q4 with approximately $10.3 billion in cash and $21.7 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 1.1x on a net debt basis. 
And concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 17.9%, up 610 basis points from Q4 last year as we generated exceptional returns in 2020. 
Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. And similar to last quarter, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impacts that our COVID-19 response had on our segment results. From a revenue standpoint, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in Life Science Solutions. There's revenue -- this is revenue from testing kits, instruments, sample preparation and reagents for lab-developed tests recognized in the genetic sciences and biosciences businesses. This segment also includes revenue from vaccine and therapy production supplies recognized in the bioproduction and biosciences businesses. 
The Specialty Diagnostics segment includes revenue in the clinical diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits. We also recognized revenue for viral transport media in the microbiology business and for test and PPE in the health care market channel. 
Laboratory Products and Services segment includes revenue from vaccine and therapy services for our -- from our Pharma Services business. This segment also includes revenue for PPE in the research and safety market channel as well as plastics used in testing workflows and cold storage equipment manufactured by our lab products business. 
From a margin standpoint, the impact of the COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. This included investments in our colleagues in terms of incentive compensation and recognition as well as commercial, R&D and production capability investments. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment, and so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. So a lot of moving parts from a segment margin standpoint reflects the very active management of the company, successfully navigating the current environment and position the company for an even brighter future. 
Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions. In Q4, reported revenue increased 138% and organic revenue growth was 134%. In the quarter, we saw exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences business and biosciences and bioproduction businesses. For the full year, reported and organic revenue growth was 77%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 236%, and adjusted operating margin was 53.1%, up 16 percentage points year-over-year. 
In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and positive business mix, and we continued to make strategic investments across all businesses in this segment. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX. 
For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 150% and adjusted operating margin was 50.2%, an increase of 15 percentage points over 2019. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4 and organic revenue growth was 5%. End markets for chemical analysis remain muted, but this was more than offset by strong growth in both chromatography and mass spectrometry and the materials and structural analysis businesses. We continued to see increased levels of customer activity in these businesses and drove strong commercial execution. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment declined 7% and organic revenue decreased 8%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 20.2%, down 580 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong productivity that was more than offset by the strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. We also had a headwind to margins from FX in this segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 37% and adjusted operating margin was 15.8%, a decline of 730 basis points versus prior year. 
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue increased by 109%. Organic revenue growth was 107%. Our COVID-19 response revenue was significant in the quarter, enabling us to deliver very strong growth in our microbiology, health care market channel and clinical diagnostics businesses. The level of routine diagnostics testing activity was higher in Q4 than Q3, but still remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly for our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. For the full year, reported revenue was 44% higher than the prior year and organic revenue growth was 48%. Adjusted operating income increased 134% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 26.4%, up 270 basis points from the prior year. In Q4, we drove very strong volume leverage, which was partially offset by negative business mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 47% and adjusted operating margin was 25.6%, an improvement of 60 basis points versus prior year. 
And finally, in Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 28%. Organic revenue growth was 25%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in all our businesses in this segment, the research and safety market channel, laboratory products and pharma services. For the full year, reported revenue was 16% higher than 2019 and organic revenue growth was 13%. In Q4, adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 9.4%, which is 440 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, strong productivity and volume leverage was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 10.4%, 210 basis points lower than the prior year. 
With that, I'll turn to our initial 2021 guidance. We're starting the year with annual guidance of 7% organic growth and adjusted EPS of $21.62, which will result in 11% growth over 2020. So another year of very strong financial performance. The dynamics around the pandemic continued to be fluid, but we thought it was important to give you our initial view of the full year, along with the associated assumptions to help frame how we're positioning the company for another successful year. We've chosen to go with a point outlook rather than a range because there are a multitude of different potential customer demand outcomes for the year, especially around testing. We remain incredibly well positioned to operate with speed at scale to uniquely serve our customers under any demand scenario that actually plays out this year. And at the same time, we'll continue to invest aggressively for very exciting near- and long-term growth opportunities while delivering exceptional financial performance for shareholders. So just as we did in 2020, in 2021, we will maximize the opportunity to drive short- and long-term value for all our stakeholders. 
Let me now provide you with the assumptions behind our initial guidance. In terms of revenue, our guidance is $35.1 billion, which represents approximately 9% reported growth over 2020, including 7% organic growth. There are 2 key elements to the organic growth assumption. First, the base business. Here, we're assuming 7% organic growth in 2021. The second element is the COVID-19 response. Here, we're starting the year with an assumption of $7.1 billion of revenue for 2021. This reflects testing-related revenue that's roughly the same as we delivered in 2020; plus approximately $1 billion of vaccine therapy-related revenue in 2021, which is double the level we generated last year. 
Let me give you some color on the phasing of the COVID-19 response revenue. We're assuming that vaccine and therapy revenue is fairly linear in 2021. The testing-related revenue is assumed to be very front-end loaded with Q1 levels similar to Q4 2020. Our guidance then assumes testing demand may begin to moderate in Q2 and potentially moderate further as the year progresses. Should the pandemic be longer lasting and the need for testing maintained, then this sizable upside to the $7.1 billion, particularly in the second half of the year. We're really well positioned to support our customers, should demand levels be higher than this initial guidance assumption. We'll have more clarity on the actual second half demand levels later in the year. 
With regards to FX, we're assuming a year-over-year tailwind of approximately $400 million of revenue or 1.2% and $0.14 of adjusted EPS or 1%. We're [ assuming ] that acquisitions will contribute approximately $125 million to our reported revenue growth in 2021. The initial guidance assumes an adjusted operating margin of 29.8%, 10 basis points higher than last year. Our PPI Business System will continue to drive strong volume pull-through and productivity benefits, will be partially offset by significant strategic investments adding to those made in 2020 that Marc outlined earlier. 
Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $470 million. This is $20 million lower than 2020 due to lower average net debt. It includes the impact of the $2.6 billion debt paydown that we completed in January. We're assuming adjusted other net income will be about $8 million, lower by $32 million from 2020, mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. The improvement from our 14.3% prior year tax rate is primarily driven by the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. The midpoint represents an increased investment of $800 million over 2020, driven by capacity and capability expansions in our pharma services, bioproduction, biosciences and Laboratory Products businesses. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $7 billion in 2021. The increase over 2020 is primarily driven by expected earnings growth, partially offset by the increase in capital expenditure investments. 
Our guidance includes $2.8 billion of capital deployment. This consists of $1.5 billion of share buybacks, which we completed in January; $880 million for the recently completed acquisition of NovaSep's European viral vector business; and It assumes approximately $400 million of capital returned to shareholders this year through dividends. We estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 398 million shares, and our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. So it does not include the acquisition of Mesa Biotech, which is expected to close later in Q1. 
And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are several factors to consider. First, note that we have 3 extra selling days in Q1 and 4 fewer days in Q4 in 2021, resulting in 1 less day for the full year. Then as I mentioned earlier, the COVID-19 response revenue included in the initial guidance is more significantly weighted to the first half of the year. And as a reminder, the 2020 comparisons are significantly easier in the first half of the year. So a lot of dynamics impacting the top line growth by quarter, with very strong growth expected in the beginning of the year. 
From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we're expecting approximately 54% of the year's total in the first half of the year and 46% in the second half, reflecting very strong operational execution throughout the year. And then from a near-term standpoint, taking into account all of these factors, we're expecting Q1 organic growth and operating margin, the profile of those to be similar to Q4 2020. So at a high level, we're starting the year with guidance of 7% organic revenue growth and 11% adjusted EPS growth, a continuation of our excellent long-term financial performance track record. As always, we'll strive to deliver for the best possible results, and I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

Yes, I'm much more optimistic than the way you frame the question, right? So if I think about our PCR installed base and the assumptions, we have really strong line of sight to the first quarter, reasonable line of sight to the second quarter. And after that, our customers just don't know, right? So we made an assumption base that we're going to see incredibly strong demand in the first quarter. And that is going to drop off somewhat in Q2. And then we made a much more conservative assumption. But the way the pandemic has played out, there are many scenarios where I see testing demand being very robust for a long period of time. The truth is this pandemic is going to be around in some form around the world, and doctors are going to want to know whether or not a patient or a person has COVID, right? So I think you'll see as the year plays out, there's scenarios well above the testing assumption. Amplitude demand has been extraordinarily robust. Our installed base is growing, and that's been a nice adder to the growth that you saw in Q4 and the strong momentum we expect. 
Mesa is very exciting, right? When you think about what we've learned throughout the pandemic is that PCR testing is truly the gold standard. And the accuracy that you get is super relevant and Mesa's technology gets you a result in 30 minutes with PCR capability, and it gives you that confidence in the accuracy. And the way we think about it is there are a number of applications that are very relevant to have that rapid thing. Pharmacies would be an obvious example. The sports leagues have been using this technology. So those will be examples of where it is, and that obviously will be additive to our capabilities. It's not assumed in our guidance at this point. So thank you, Tycho."

I've never been at the next year's guidance on the opening one, but it's a great question and it's one that is a very fair one as well. So the way I think about it is the following: First, think about the way we've managed the company throughout 2020, right, which was drive very substantial growth in our financial performance, earnings cash flow while dramatically accelerating the reinvestment rate in the business, right? New opportunities were opened during the course of the year because of the pandemic, because of how we responded, because of the relationships we solidified and build. And we were able to put $1 billion of additional reinvestment in the business above the normal increases that we have every year. And we're stepping that up again in 2021. 
So what does that mean for the future? It means that the company is positioned to grow more rapidly. And that obviously will drive good earnings off of that increased kind of base business activity. And much of the investments that we made that are supporting COVID are going to be applied to other applications. So obviously, vaccines and therapies we expect will continue to be very relevant in 2022. But at some point, they'll be less relevant. And that capacity, that all converts over to non-COVID-related activities. 
On the molecular diagnostics side, the installed base increase in sample prep and the installed increase in QPCR creates the opportunity to build out an even larger molecular diagnostic business. We increased our installed base hugely during the course of the year. And more importantly, we satisfy customers. The reason that some of the others in this industry have relatively flat straight-through the year results for COVID is because they couldn't get manufacturing capacity up, right? We were able to do that in months. Others are talking about level-loaded demand that's because the supply has been so constrained with others. So we're excited about our prospects. And obviously, we'll see what the economy is, what the growth is, all of those things. And as it gets much closer to 2022, we'll figure it out. But I'm extremely bullish about the long-term prospects of the company."

And yes, you've heard us talk about really starting in the Q3 call and the Analyst Meeting in September about how we're thinking about the longer term, right. And -- which goes back to the guiding principle that we have through the pandemic, which is make the decisions, investments and run the company to set ourselves up for a brighter future. We created new opportunities and new opportunities were created just in the market as well because of the pandemic. And when I think about that, we're positioning the company to exit the pandemic phase as a faster-growing company than what we grew, and the exact numbers will figure out over time. But the way I think about it is our -- the percent of our business in pharma and biotech continues to increase. That's our fastest-growing end market. So that's a market-driven weighted average type growth. But our value proposition, the increased investments in our innovation, the investments we're making in emerging markets, those things will all help us drive very strong growth going forward. So I'm very bullish about the long-term prospects for accelerated share gain into the long term."

So when I think about vaccines and therapies, as you know, kind of our philosophy, which is articulate the numbers and the outlook on what you can see and don't create a lot of hype around things. So when we started out some months ago, we talked about $1 billion opportunity in total, right? That was contracted revenue that we saw. Obviously, as the pandemic continued, as our position continued, as we won more and more parts of the business, even what we committed to, if it all went to 0 at the end of this upcoming year, it would be $1.5 billion because we did $0.5 billion last year, $1 billion this year. And based on what we see with the pandemic and what our customers are telling us, we would expect demand for COVID-19 therapies and vaccines to be very substantial in '22 and likely to have some level of revenue going into '23 and maybe even longer. So it's going to be a large contribution based on the strength of our bioproduction business and our pharma services capability. 
So thank you for the question. Let me wrap here with a few things. First, as all of our analysts expressed and on behalf of all 80,000 colleagues, Ken, thank you for a job incredibly well done and wishing you the happiest of retirements. It's been awesome.

Thank you for joining us today for our 2020 fourth quarter call and a wrap-up of what's been a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. I hope that you and your families are staying healthy as we all work to get beyond the pandemic.  
Before I cover many of the highlights from the quarter and the year, I want to share some news about our Investor Relations team. This will be Ken's last earnings call as he plans to retire at the end of March. You've all come to know Ken very well over the years. He's been leading the IR function since 2005 and is concluding a remarkable 25-year career at Thermo Fisher. 
Ken has been the voice of our company to The Street, and he excels in that role. He conveys his extensive knowledge of our company, our markets and our opportunities in a way that's informative and engaging. In fact, you voted Ken the best IR professional in our industry multiple times over the years. 
And I couldn't agree more, he's been a terrific partner to me and Stephen. Ken, thank you for a truly stellar contribution to Thermo Fisher.  
Looking ahead, we're very fortunate to have Raf Tejada here to take the reins in March. Raf has been a part of the Thermo Fisher Investor Relations team for 5 years, and many of you knew him during his time on Wall Street, most recently at Bank of America as an analyst supporting Derik De Bruin. I know Raf and the team will carry forward Ken's legacy of excellence in Investor Relations. Please join me in congratulating Raf on his new role and in wishing Ken all the best in his well-deserved retirement.  
So moving on to our results for 2020, an unprecedented year by any measure. I'm pleased to report that we delivered the strongest year in our company's history. This speaks to the incredible work of our 80,000 colleagues around the world. Through their tireless efforts, we led the industry in supporting our customers globally, enabling the societal response to the pandemic. 
We delivered outstanding results by working with speed at scale to meet our customers' evolving needs. This included generating $6.6 billion of COVID-19 response revenue and quickly returning the base business to growth after the disruption seen across the globe earlier in 2020. The strength of our response activities allowed us to significantly accelerate investments in our company to create an even brighter future with a focus on talent, R&D and new capabilities and capacity. We also generated significant free cash flow during 2020, and we're good stewards of capital, creating shareholder value through share buybacks and dividends, building a strong M&A pipeline and reducing our net debt. 
I'll share some of the many highlights from the quarter and the year later in my remarks, but first, I'll cover the financials at a high level. Starting with the quarter. Our revenue grew 54% in Q4 year-over-year to $10.55 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 107% to $3.51 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 840 basis points in Q4 to 33.3%. Finally, adjusted EPS increased 100% to $7.09 per share in the quarter.  
Turning to our results for the full year. We grew revenue by 26% to $32.22 billion in 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 60% to $9.56 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 630 basis points to 29.7%, and we delivered a 58% increase in adjusted EPS to $19.55 per share. Both our fourth quarter and full year financial performance were truly exceptional on all metrics and demonstrated the strength of our growth strategy and our ability to move with speed at scale in responding to rapidly evolving customer needs.  
Let me now turn to our end markets and give you some color on our performance for the quarter and the year. Starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance again in this end market, delivering approximately 25% growth during Q4. 
We saw very robust growth across all businesses serving these customers, particularly bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences and our research and safety market channel. Our Q4 results capped off an excellent year of growth in the mid-teens. Our strong performance is being driven by our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.  
In academic and government, we grew in the high single digits in the quarter as customers across the globe ramped up activity. We saw good growth across a range of our businesses, particularly chromatography and mass spectrometry and our research and safety market channel. 
Similarly, in industrial and applied, the team's strong execution helped us return this end market to growth in Q4. We grew in the low single digits during the quarter, and it was good to see our electron microscopy business return to growth. Given the significant impact of the pandemic on customer activity earlier in 2020, both the academic and government and the industrial applied end markets declined into mid-single-digit growth for the full year.  
Finally, in diagnostics and health care, we had another incredible quarter, delivering more than 200% growth. Our COVID-19 testing revenue continued to accelerate in the quarter as customer demand for our sample preparation, PCR solutions and viral transport media remained very robust. For the full year, diagnostics and healthcare grew by more than 100%, driven by our leading role in supporting COVID-19 testing around the world. Our outstanding performance was the result of having the right technologies and the ability to rapidly scale up manufacturing, which was enabled by our PPI Business System.  
As I think back to this call a year ago and how quickly conditions evolved during the year, I'm humbled by the incredible impact our team had in navigating the environment while supporting so many aspects of the pandemic response. As a reminder, very early in the year, our cryo-electron microscopes were used by researchers to create the first 3D image of the virus. We were a critical supplier of PPE, leveraging our strong channel relationships to secure these products when supplies were scarce. 
We enabled COVID-19 testing at an unprecedented level, creating a market-leading molecular diagnostics business in just a few months to support hundreds of millions of PCR tests around the world. And as you know, we've built trusted relationships with the pharma and biotech industry over many years and have provided them with the right set of products and services. As a result, these customers engage with us on a significant number of projects to help develop and produce vaccines and therapies.  
In 2020, this led to $500 million in COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue, and we expect that to increase to $1 billion in 2021. Our comprehensive response to the pandemic demonstrates the unique capabilities of Thermo Fisher Scientific.  
Now let me turn to a business update framed by our growth strategy and highlight just a few of our many achievements. As a reminder, there are 3 pillars to our growth strategy. First, we're committed to high-impact innovation. Second, we leverage our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets. And third, we deliver a unique value proposition to our customers.  
Starting with the first pillar. It was an extraordinary year of high-impact innovation. In response to the pandemic, we established worldwide leadership in COVID-19 testing. We quickly developed and gained regulatory approval to launch the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit in March, providing gold standard PCR-based test for our customers at a scale our industry has never seen before. We also significantly expanded our portfolio of COVID-19-related products, including our Amplitude Solution for high-throughput PCR-based testing and our TaqCheck PCR test for asymptomatic health surveillance. 
In addition, we launched a number of highly innovative products across our base business to strengthen our leading positions in analytical instruments, biosciences and bioproduction. For example, in mass spectrometry, we extended our industry-leading Orbitrap franchise with 2 new-generation Exploris mass spectrometers. In our electron microscopy business, we launched 2 Selectris imaging filters for our cryo-electron microscopes. And in Q4, we introduced the Tundra  cryo-electron microscope. And these are just some of the examples of how we're continuing to expand the benefits of this groundbreaking technology and democratize its use.  
The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets. Our actions in the region are a great example of how our ongoing investments and the differentiated customer experience we've created sets us up to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities there.  
In China, we further accelerated from our strong Q3 results, growing 30% in Q4. To continue to strengthen our presence in China and support the local biotech industry, during the year, we localized the manufacturing of single-use bioproduction technologies at our Center of Excellence in Suzhou. And in the quarter, we announced the formation of a joint venture to establish a biological drug development and manufacturing facility in Hangzhou.  
Last, I want to touch on the third pillar of our strategy, our unique customer value proposition. Entering 2021, our relationships with customers and governments around the world have never been stronger. Let me give you some examples.  
When the pandemic hit, we were uniquely positioned to help our pharma and biotech customers develop and eventually produce COVID-19 vaccine -- related therapies and vaccines because of the trusted relationships we've built over many years. We moved quickly and invested significantly in our infrastructure, scaling up to support the volumes needed as well as adding capabilities for new modalities such as mRNA. The broad and fast response helped deepen our already strong customer relationships, and this positions us incredibly well to help them with their near-term COVID-19 needs as well as the longer-term needs for future vaccines and therapies for other diseases. 
And through our extensive work in molecular diagnostics, clinical labs now have an even greater appreciation of our leading offering in Specialty Diagnostics. We've dramatically increased our PCR and sample preparation instrument installed base, and our customers have seen how strong a partner we are in addressing this -- their needs.  
Bringing this all together, we execute our proven growth strategy using our PPI Business System that enables our teams to operate with speed at scale and was a key differentiator in our success last year. PPI is our operational discipline and enables us to translate the top line growth into strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. 
We entered 2020 with excellent long-term growth prospects as a company. The way we executed for our customers throughout the year further unlocked our growth potential, which will benefit us in 2021 and beyond. Let me give you some color on the increased investments we were able to make because of our strong performance.  
In innovation, we ramped up our R&D investment by approximately 20% to $1.2 billion. In emerging markets, we expanded our localized capacity and capabilities to further advance our leadership. And to enhance our unique customer value proposition, we invested significant CapEx in our high-growth bioproduction, pharma services and biosciences businesses as well as in commercial capabilities to further differentiate the customer experience.  
In total, last year, we invested an additional $1 billion to accelerate our long-term growth, roughly half in CapEx and half in P&L investments. These actions, combined with the substantial investments planned for 2021, will position our company for a very bright future.  
Turning now to capital deployment. We have a strong track record of creating value for our shareholders, and we continued to execute our strategy in 2020. During the year, we returned a total of $1.8 billion in capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and a growing dividend. 
As you know, we announced several strategic bolt-on acquisitions. In our pharma services business, we entered into a strategic partnership with CSL to expand our biologics capacity for this rapidly growing market. We acquired Phitonex to enhance our flow cytometry offering for cell analysis. Shortly after year-end, we acquired the European viral vector manufacturing business from Novasep. And we signed an agreement to acquire Mesa Biotech to enhance our PCR-based diagnostics, adding gold standard technology in a rapid point-of-care testing format. 
We entered '21 -- 2021 with a very strong balance sheet, active and inactive deal pipeline. As always, we'll continue to apply our disciplined approach to opportunities and continue to be good stewards of our capital.  
Before I turn to guidance, 2020 was also a significant year of progress in terms of our environmental, social and governance priorities. We've always been a company that's focused on having a positive impact on the world. That's the true embodiment of our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I'll highlight a couple of the initiatives that are having a big social impact.  
One is that we launched and significantly funded the Thermo Fisher Foundation for Science, expanding our STEM education programs to benefit underserved communities. Another is that we established the Just Project, a collaboration with historically black colleges and universities where we've invested in a COVID-19 testing program, allowing students and faculty to safely return to campus. I'm proud of these and the many steps our teams are taking to make a difference in our communities around the world. Taking a step back and reflecting on the year as a whole, by all measures, we delivered an outstanding year.  
Now looking ahead to 2021. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. In terms of our revenue guidance, we expect to deliver $35.1 billion in 2021, which would result in reported revenue growth of 9%. We're initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $21.62 per share for the full year. That's 11% growth year-over-year and a continuation of our outstanding track record.  
Before I hand the call over to Stephen, I'll leave you with my key takeaways for the year. The success of our growth strategy clearly sets us apart as the unrivaled leader in our industry. 2020 truly demonstrated the power of who and what we are as a company. During a unique time of need, we stepped up for our customers, enabling their important contributions to society and helping them navigate the recessionary impact of the pandemic. As a result, we were able to gain significant market share and solidified Thermo Fisher as their partner of choice. 
At the same time, we stay focused on driving strong returns from existing investments and made additional investments to accelerate our future growth. While I'm very proud of our accomplishments during the past year, as I look ahead, I couldn't be more excited about our opportunities in 2021 and beyond.  
With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q4 performance and full year results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with comments around our initial 2021 guidance.",2942,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q4 performance and full year results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with comments around our initial 2021 guidance.  
As you saw in our press release, we achieved an exceptional quarter and grew organically 51% in Q4. This resulted in full year organic growth of 25%. Similar to previous quarters, I'll break down the organic growth into 2 elements. The first is the performance of the base business, and the second is the scale of the COVID-19 response revenue.  
In Q4, the base business grew 5% organically, another quarter of sequential improvement. For the full year, the base business was essentially flat as a result of slower economic activity earlier in the year due to the pandemic, partially offset by great commercial execution. 
Our COVID-19 response revenue also increased significantly in the fourth quarter to $3.2 billion, bringing the full year impact for our customers to $6.6 billion. This was largely driven by testing-related products and instruments. It is also worth noting that we generated $500 million of revenue in 2020 from support for COVID-19-related vaccines and therapies.  
Once again, our PPI Business System enabled excellent pull-through, and we delivered 100% growth in adjusted earnings per share in Q4 and 58% for the full year. Our PPI Business System also enabled us to generate extremely strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the year was $6.8 billion, up 67% versus the prior year. Overall, exceptional financial results in 2020.  
Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Starting with our Q4 earnings results. As Marc mentioned, we grew EPS -- adjusted EPS by 100% to $7.09. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $19.55, up 58% compared to last year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $6.24, up 151% from Q4 last year, and 2020 full year GAAP EPS was $15.96, up 74% versus prior year.  
On the top line, our Q4 reported revenue grew 54% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increase included 51% organic growth and a 3% benefit from foreign exchange. For the full year 2020, reported revenue increased 26%. This includes a 25% contribution from organic growth and a 1% tailwind in foreign exchange.  
Turning to our growth by geographies. During the quarter, all regions delivered very strong growth. North America grew just over 65%. Europe grew approximately 50%. Asia Pacific grew approximately 20%, including China, which grew 30%. And rest of the world grew approximately 50%. For the full year, North America grew just over 30%, Europe grew over 25%, Asia Pacific grew 5% and rest of the world grew approximately 45%.  
Turning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income increased 107%, and adjusted operating margin was 33.3%, 840 basis points higher than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 60% and adjusted operating margin was 29.7%, which is 630 basis points higher than 2019. 
In the quarter and for the full year, our PPI Business System enabled us to drive exceptional volume leverage, and we also had favorable business mix. This was partially offset by strategic investments across all of our businesses to support our near- and long-term growth. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 53.9%, up 760 basis points from Q4 of the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 51.2%, up 480 basis points versus prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, the increase in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin.  
Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17% of revenue, a decrease of 60 basis points versus Q4 2019 due to the strong volume leverage. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 17.9% of revenue, an improvement of 120 basis points compared to 2019. Total R&D expense was $376 million for Q4 and $1.2 billion for the full year, representing growth of 44% and 18%, respectively, reflecting our increased investments in high-impact innovation.  
Looking at our results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $134 million, $37 million higher than Q4 last year, primarily due to higher level of debt. Net interest expense for the full year was $488 million, an increase of $37 million from 2019. 
Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of approximately $3 million, $19 million lower than Q4 2019, mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $40 million, which was $32 million lower than the prior year. 
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16%, up 430 basis points versus Q4 last year. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 14.3% or 320 basis points higher than 2019. The increase in the tax rate was due to the substantial increase in pretax profit year-over-year coming in at a marginal tax rate. 
Average diluted shares were 400 million in Q4, about 2 million lower year-over-year, driven by the net impact of option dilution and share repurchases. For the full year, the average diluted shares were 399 million.  
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another great highlight for the year. We significantly increased net capital expenditure to accelerate the execution of our growth strategy while delivering a 67% increase in free cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations was $8.3 billion, net capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $6.8 billion. 
During 2020, we returned approximately $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, and we ended Q4 with approximately $10.3 billion in cash and $21.7 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 1.1x on a net debt basis. And concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 17.9%, up 610 basis points from Q4 last year as we generated exceptional returns in 2020.  
Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments, and similar to last quarter, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impacts that our COVID-19 response had on our segment results. From a revenue standpoint, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in Life Science Solutions. There's revenue -- this is revenue from testing kits, instruments, sample preparation and reagents for lab-developed tests recognized in the genetic sciences and biosciences businesses. This segment also includes revenue from vaccine and therapy production supplies recognized in the bioproduction and biosciences businesses.  
The Specialty Diagnostics segment includes revenue in the clinical diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits. We also recognized revenue for viral transport media in the microbiology business and for test and PPE in the health care market channel.  
Laboratory Products and Services segment includes revenue from vaccine and therapy services for our -- from our pharma services business. This segment also includes revenue for PPE in the research and safety market channel as well as plastics used in testing workflows and cold storage equipment manufactured by our lab products businesses. 
From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. This included investments in our colleagues in terms of incentive compensation and recognition as well as commercial, R&D and production capability investments. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. So a lot of moving parts from a segment margin standpoint reflects the very active management of the company, successfully navigating the current environment and positioning the company for an even brighter future.  
Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions. In Q4, reported revenue increased 138% and organic revenue growth was 134%. In the quarter, we saw exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences business and biosciences and bioproduction businesses. For the full year, reported and organic revenue growth was 77%. 
Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 236%, and adjusted operating margin was 53.1%, up 16 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and positive business mix, and we continued to make strategic investments across all businesses in this segment. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 150% and adjusted operating margin was 50.2%, an increase of 15 percentage points over 2019.  
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4 and organic revenue growth was 5%. End markets for chemical analysis remain muted, but this was more than offset by strong growth in both chromatography and mass spectrometry and the materials and structural analysis businesses. We continued to see increased levels of customer activity in these businesses and drove strong commercial execution. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment declined 7% and organic revenue decreased 8%. 
Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 20.2%, down 580 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong productivity that was more than offset by the strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. We also had a headwind to margins from FX in this segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 37% and adjusted operating margin was 15.8%, a decline of 730 basis points versus prior year.  
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue increased by 109%. Organic revenue growth was 107%. 
Our COVID-19 response revenue was significant in the quarter, enabling us to deliver very strong growth in our microbiology, health care market channel and clinical diagnostics businesses. The level of routine diagnostics testing activity was higher in Q4 than Q3 but still remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly for our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. For the full year, reported revenue was 44% higher than the prior year and organic revenue growth was 48%. 
Adjusted operating income increased 134% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 26.4%, up 270 basis points from the prior year. In Q4, we drove very strong volume leverage, which was partially offset by negative business mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 47% and adjusted operating margin was 25.6%, an improvement of 60 
basis points versus prior year.  
And finally, in Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 28%. Organic revenue growth was 25%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in all our businesses in this segment, the research and safety market channel, laboratory products and pharma services. For the full year, reported revenue was 16% higher than 2019 and organic revenue growth was 13%. 
In Q4, adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 9.4%, which is 440 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, strong productivity and volume leverage was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 10.4%, 210 basis points lower than the prior year.  
With that, I'll turn to our initial 2021 guidance. We're starting the year with annual guidance of 7% organic growth and adjusted EPS of $21.62, which will result in 11% growth over 2020, so another year of very strong financial performance. 
The dynamics around the pandemic continued to be fluid, but we thought it was important to give you our initial view of the full year, along with the associated assumptions to help frame how we're positioning the company for another successful year. We've chosen to go with a point outlook rather than 
a range because there are a multitude of different potential customer demand outcomes for the year, especially around testing. 
We remain incredibly well positioned to operate with speed at scale to uniquely serve our customers under any demand scenario that actually plays out this year. And at the same time, we'll continue to invest aggressively for very exciting near- and long-term growth opportunities while delivering exceptional financial performance for shareholders. So just as we did in 2020, in 2021, we will maximize the opportunity to drive short- and long-term value for all our stakeholders.  
Let me now provide you with the assumptions behind our initial guidance. In terms of revenue, our guidance is $35.1 billion, which represents approximately 9% reported growth over 2020, including 7% organic growth. 
There are 2 key elements to the organic growth assumption. First, the base business. Here, we're assuming 7% organic growth in 2021. 
The second element is the COVID-19 response. Here, we're starting the year with an assumption of $7.1 billion of revenue for 2021. This reflects testing-related revenue that's roughly the same as we delivered in 2020 plus approximately $1 billion of vaccine and therapy-related revenue in 2021, which is double the level we generated last year.  
Let me give you some color on the phasing of the COVID-19 response revenue. We're assuming that vaccine and therapy revenue is fairly linear in 2021. The testing-related revenue is assumed to be very front-end loaded with Q1 levels similar to Q4 2020. Our guidance then assumes testing demand may begin to moderate in Q2 and potentially moderate further as the year progresses. 
Should the pandemic be longer lasting and the need for testing maintained, then there's sizable upside to the $7.1 billion, particularly in the second half of the year. We're really well positioned to support our customers should demand levels be higher than this initial guidance assumption. We'll have more clarity on the actual second half demand levels later in the year.  
With regards to FX, we're assuming a year-over-year tailwind of approximately $400 million of revenue or 1.2% and $0.14 of adjusted EPS or 1%. We're  assuming that acquisitions will contribute approximately $125 million to our reported revenue growth in 2021. 
The initial guidance assumes an adjusted operating margin of 29.8%, 10 basis points higher than last year. Our PPI Business System will continue to drive strong volume pull-through, and productivity benefits will be partially offset by significant strategic investments, adding to those made in 2020 that Marc outlined earlier.  
Moving below the line. We expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $470 million. This is $20 million lower than 2020 due to lower average net debt. It includes the impact of the $2.6 billion debt paydown that we completed in January. 
We're assuming adjusted other net income will be about $8 million, lower by $32 million from 2020, mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. The improvement from our 14.3% prior year tax rate is primarily driven by the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. 
We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. The midpoint represents an increased investment of $800 million over 2020, driven by capacity and capability expansions in our pharma services, bioproduction, biosciences and Laboratory Products businesses. 
Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $7 billion in 2021. The increase over 2020 is primarily driven by expected earnings growth, partially offset by the increase in capital expenditure investments.  
Our guidance includes $2.8 billion of capital deployment. This consists of $1.5 billion of share buybacks, which we completed in January; $880 million for the recently completed acquisition of Novasep's European viral vector business. And it assumes approximately $400 million of capital return to shareholders this year through dividends. We estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 398 million shares. And our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures, so it does not include the acquisition of Mesa Biotech, which is expected to close later in Q1.  
And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are several factors to consider. First, note that we have 3 extra selling days in Q1 and 4 fewer days in Q4 in 2021, resulting in 1 less day for the full year. Then as, I mentioned earlier, the COVID-19 response revenue included in the initial guidance is more significantly weighted to the first half of the year. And as a reminder, the 2020 comparisons are significantly easier in the first half of the year. So a lot of dynamics impacting the top line growth by quarter, with very strong growth expected in the beginning of the year.  
From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we're expecting approximately 54% of the year's total in the first half of the year and 46% in the second half, reflecting very strong operational execution throughout the year. And then from a near-term standpoint, taking into account all of these factors, we're expecting Q1 organic growth and operating margin, the profile of those to be similar to Q4 2020. 
So at a high level, we're starting the year with guidance of 7% organic revenue growth and 11% adjusted EPS growth, a continuation of our excellent long-term financial performance track record. As always, we'll strive to deliver for the best possible results, and I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year.  
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

Marc, your implied testing dropoff is steeper than we've heard from others like Hologic and Abbott. But I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about that dynamic in particular. Is that just a function of the nonautomated PCR testing and maybe a lower installed base of Amplitude? 
And then I'm curious about Mesa Bio, thoughts on increase -- entering an increasingly crowded point of care market. And are you planning to materially scale the antigen test? And then how could that factor into the outlook?"

Yes, I'm much more optimistic than the way you frame the question, right? So if I think about our PCR installed base and the assumptions, we have really strong line of sight to the first quarter, reasonable line of sight to the second quarter. And after that, our customers just don't know, right? 
So we made an assumption base that we're going to see incredibly strong demand in the first quarter. And that is going to drop off somewhat in Q2, and then we made a much more conservative assumption. But the way the pandemic has played out, there are many scenarios where I see testing demand being very robust for a long period of time. 
The truth is this pandemic is going to be around in some form around the world, and doctors are going to want to know whether or not a patient or a person has COVID, right? So I think you'll see, as the year plays out, there's scenarios well above the testing assumption. 
Amplitude demand has been extraordinarily robust. Our installed base is growing, and that's been a nice adder to the growth that you saw in Q4 and the strong momentum we expect. 
Mesa is very exciting, right? When you think about what we've learned throughout the pandemic, is that PCR testing is truly the gold standard, and the accuracy that you get is super relevant. And Mesa's technology gets you a result in 30 minutes with PCR capability, and it gives you that confidence in the accuracy. 
And the way we think about it is there are a number of applications that are very relevant to have that rapid thing. Pharmacies would be an obvious example. The sports leagues have been using this technology. So those will be examples of where it is, and that obviously will be additive to our capabilities. It's not assumed in our guidance at this point. So thank you, Tycho."

I've never been asked next year's guidance on the opening one, but it's a great question and it's one that is a very fair one as well. So the way I think about it is the following. 
First, think about the way we've managed the company throughout 2020, right, which was drive very substantial growth in our financial performance, earnings cash flow while dramatically accelerating the reinvestment rate in the business, right? New opportunities were opened during the course of the year because of the pandemic, because of how we responded, because of the relationships we solidified and built. And we were able to put $1 billion of additional reinvestment in the business above the normal increases that we have every year. And we're stepping that up again in 2021. 
So what does that mean for the future? It means that the company is positioned to grow more rapidly. And that obviously will drive good earnings off of that increased kind of base business activity. And much of the investments that we made that are supporting COVID are going to be applied to other applications. 
So obviously, vaccines and therapies we expect will continue to be very relevant in 2022. But at some point, they'll be less relevant. And that capacity, that all converts over to non-COVID-related activities. 
On the molecular diagnostics side, the installed base increase in sample prep and the installed increase in qPCR creates the opportunity to build out an even larger molecular diagnostic business. We increased our installed base hugely during the course of the year, and more importantly, we satisfied customers. 
The reason that some of the others in this industry have relatively flat straight-through-the-year results for COVID is because they couldn't get manufacturing capacity up, right? We were able to do that in months. Others are talking about level-loaded demand. That's because the supply has been so constrained with others. 
So we're excited about our prospects. And obviously, we'll see what the economy is, what the growth is, all of those things. And as it gets much closer to 2022, we'll figure it out. But I'm extremely bullish about the long-term prospects of the company."

So in terms of the demand profile, obviously, there was very substantial disruptions both in customers' ability to order or even receive an instrument during the first part of the year and obviously, all of the other challenges that the pandemic brought. We saw activity start to pick up at a much stronger level, particularly in material and structural analysis, which is largely our electron microscopy business and our chrome and mass spec business. So in Q4, we're strong in those regards. 
Chemical analysis is still soft, though the bookings did improve. So what I would expect is that you'll see continued strengthening this year, and that analytical instruments would grow above the company average. That's how I would think about it."

Our Specialty Diagnostics business, routine doctor businesses are still well down, right? So there's parts of the business where you don't see that recovery for a while. But we still feel confident in growing at a good rate, and I see scenarios that are above the 7%, right? So it's not as if that's the only scenario that plays out. 
So I don't know if -- I think it's an appropriate start. I don't know if it's conservative or not, but we measure ourselves at the end of the year, ""Did we do a great job?"" So we're going to look at how did everybody else in the industry report, and we need to make sure that we're gaining market share. And if the 7% reflects market share gains, then we're going to be satisfied. And if there's more opportunity to go faster than that, then you're going to see us deliver it."

There was definitely some catch-up spend, right? I mean obviously, customers getting back to work and all those things. So there was some of that in there. And that's pretty much impossible to quantify exactly what that is. 
But bookings were stronger than revenue growth, right? So we're excited about the growth prospects for China for this year, right? So China should be one of our fastest growing geographies in 2021. So that would be the expectation. 
In terms of biologics and large molecule, we've talked about a lot on these calls over the years, the emergence of a local biotech industry for the Chinese market has become larger and larger over time. We've done a good job serving that customer base. I'm excited that we were able to localize our capacity for single-use technologies to support the local customer base and give them assurance of supply. And at the same point, we're very excited about the partnership and the joint venture we're forming in Hangzhou to actually produce biologic drug substance and drug products. So we're well positioned there, and biotech is a nice driver of our growth. 
We also saw nice growth in other segments. Academic and government was quite strong in the quarter as well. So I hope that gives you a little bit of a flavor for what happened in China and what the strong outlook looks like."

But the way I think about it is our -- the percent of our business in pharma and biotech continues to increase. That's our fastest-growing end market. So that's a market-driven weighted average type growth.

Obviously, as the pandemic continued, as our position continued, as we won more and more parts of the business, even what we committed to, if it all went to 0 at the end of this upcoming year, it would be $1.5 billion because we did $0.5 billion last year, $1 billion this year. And based on what we see with the pandemic and what our customers are telling us, we would expect demand for COVID-19 therapies and vaccines to be very substantial in '22 and likely to have some level of revenue going into '23 and maybe even longer.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Q1 call. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year.

As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of outstanding financial performance with excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. 
As you know, we're playing a significant role in enabling society's response to the pandemic, including a rapidly expanding role in supporting vaccine production. In our base business, we meaningfully accelerated growth across all our businesses in the first quarter. We had very strong execution of our growth strategy, including launching a number of innovative new products, capitalizing on our leadership in the high-growth and emerging markets, strengthening our unique customer value proposition. And we're already starting to see the benefits of the accelerated investments we initiated in 2020. 
We continue to execute our capital deployment strategy, completing our acquisition of a European viral vector business and Mesa Biotech, a rapid point-of-care molecular diagnostics company. We also returned capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. As I'm sure you saw shortly after the quarter closed, we announced our agreement to acquire PPD, a leading provider of clinical research services, serving pharma and biotech customers, our fastest-growing end market. 
So another great quarter of delivering for our stakeholders in the near term while investing organically and inorganically for a great future. I'll cover each of these topics in more depth in my remarks, but first, let me recap the financials. 
Our revenue in Q1 grew 59% year-over-year to $9.91 billion. Our adjusted operating income for the first quarter increased 155% to $3.51 billion. And our adjusted operating margin expanded 13 percentage points in Q1 to 35.4%. Finally, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving 145% increase to $7.21 per share. 
Turning to our end markets. Conditions were very robust driven by 3 factors: the strong fundamentals in life sciences, ramping of economic activity globally and the role our industry is playing in the pandemic response. Our unique competitive position has allowed us to deliver another fantastic quarter. 
So starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance with growth of approximately 35% driven by strong underlying market dynamics, the benefits of our unique customer value proposition and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, including bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry and in our research and safety market channel. We're clearly benefiting from our trusted partner status that we've earned over many years with these customers. 
In academic and government, we had very strong performance and grew 20% driven by robust customer activity globally. In Q1, we saw strong growth across a number of our businesses supporting this customer base, particularly in biosciences, chromatography and mass cytometry and electron microscopy. 
Turning to industrial and applied. We grew in the low double digits in the first quarter. The team continues to execute at a very high level to capture opportunities as more customers increase their activity level. During the quarter, it was good to see strong growth across all of our instruments businesses. 
And finally, diagnostics and health care. We had another outstanding quarter, delivering approximately 150% growth. Demand for our COVID-19 testing solutions was very strong. In our base business, while demand is still below prepandemic levels, it was encouraging to see our immunodiagnostics business returned to strong growth in the quarter. 
To summarize our performance, our teams capitalized on improving conditions in our end markets. And we continue to gain market share. 
Now let me give you an update on our role in supporting the pandemic response. Once again, this quarter, Thermo Fisher played a very meaningful role in fighting COVID-19 globally. We generated $2.9 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in Q1. Demand for our PCR testing solutions was strong. And our role in the development and production of vaccines and therapies continues to ramp even faster than we expected. Coming into the year, we expected our role in supporting vaccines and therapies to represent $1 billion in revenue. Based on our orders and at the speed at which our capacity expansions are coming online, we now expect to deliver $1.5 billion in vaccine and therapy revenue in 2021. 
We also continue to leverage our expertise to bring new solutions to the fight against COVID. One example in the quarter was our launch of the Thermo Scientific AerosolSense Sampler, a new air monitoring system to help facilities, such as hospitals, schools and businesses, identify the presence of in-air pathogens, including the virus that causes COVID-19. As more people return to public spaces, the AerosolSense Sampler will complement other safety protocols. 
We also acquired Mesa Biotech, which adds simple and rapid PCR testing to decentralized testing -- to decentralized settings, including doctors' offices, pharmacies and to support a number of back-to-life applications. Customer interest is very high, and we're using our PPI Business System to scale the manufacturing of the rapid diagnostic cartridges used by Mesa. We expect to generate $200 million this year from these capabilities and are very excited about the potential for this molecular diagnostic technology postpandemic. 
The other point I would like to make is that because of our leading role that we played in the pandemic response during 2020 and our outstanding financial performance, we were able to significantly accelerate our investment programs last year in R&D, commercial enablement as well as capability and capacity expansions. These accelerated investments are really positioning Thermo Fisher for an even brighter future. 
For a glimpse into the early momentum building from these investments, let me turn to the great progress we made in Q1 on our growth strategy, which is based on 3 pillars: launching high-impact, innovative new products; leveraging our scale and high growth in emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition for our customers. I'll now share a few examples that demonstrate how we use this strategy to continue to build on our success and create value for our customers. 
Starting with innovation. During the quarter, we launched a number of new products across our businesses to strengthen our leading position and to enable our customers to break new ground and achieve their goals. Let me highlight just a few. 
In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched 2 new Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris GC Mass Spectrometers, which further extend the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap franchise to bring high-resolution analysis to a range of applications, including toxicology and metabolomics. In materials and structural analysis, we launched the Thermo Scientific Spectra Ultra, a new-generation scanning transmission electron microscope for material science applications, which provides insights at atomic scale resolution to accelerate research and improve manufacturing productivity. And in our biosciences business, we launched the Kingfisher Apex Purification System for high throughput sample preparation. 
Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy. We're leveraging our scale to create an outstanding experience for our customers in the high-growth and emerging markets. We're seeing excellent growth, particularly in China, where customer activity has returned to prepandemic levels, and we grew more than 60%. And we continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets. 
As an example, in the quarter, we started shipping product from our new single-use facility in Suzhou, which localized the bioproduction manufacturing for biotech customers in China. And our investment in our bioproduction capabilities in Singapore had single-use capacity for pharma and biotech customers globally. So we have strong momentum in high-growth and emerging markets, and we continue to strengthen our position. 
Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy, our customer value proposition. We continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals. Let me update you on our progress in serving our pharma and biotech customers. 
Our upcoming acquisition of PPD, a leader in clinical trial management services is a great complement to the role we play in supporting research and development clinical trials and production. These combined capabilities, along with a complementary reputation for excellent quality and service, will further enhance Thermo Fisher's value proposition for pharma and biotech customers. 
Importantly, our customers will be able to more efficiently access these services, which are key enablers of their success. I've interacted with a number of our customers since the announcement, and we're excited about the new capabilities that PPD will bring to Thermo Fisher Scientific. By adding these highly complementary services to our portfolio, we'll be able to further advance our strategic partnership as our customers work to bring a scientific idea to an improved medicine. It will also provide terrific career opportunities for our colleagues and will create significant shareholder value. 
Our organic investments are also building capability and capacity for our pharma and biotech customers. One lens which highlights this is the support of a scale-up of mRNA vaccines, which are in high demand globally for COVID-19 today, but also for many other diseases going forward. As you know, we're an important supplier in this area, and we have continued to invest to scale our capacity, including in our biosciences business. We're building additional capacity for our central raw materials in different regions of the world. We're also expanding our bioproduction purification [ resin ] capacity, which is used in the mRNA manufacturing process. 
And finally, we're ensuring expanded and regionally available sterile full finish capacity to produce final drug product. As always, our PPI Business System helped to drive our success during the quarter, enabling us to find solutions and better ways to serve our customers, work more efficiently and effectively and create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. 
Now I'll give you a quick summary of our capital deployment activities so far this year. We've had a very active start, closing $1.4 billion in acquisitions in the quarter and as I just mentioned, entering into an agreement to acquire PPD for $17.4 billion plus the assumption of approximately $3.5 billion of net debt. 
We also returned significant capital to our shareholders during the quarter, repurchasing $2 billion of our shares and increasing our dividend by 18%. So we've had a great start to the year on capital deployment front, and our M&A pipeline remains very active. 
Turning to a brief update on the progress of our ESG initiatives. Our mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer has never been more relevant. And in addition, we want to make a very positive impact on the communities in which we live and work. 
I'm very proud that over the past year, we've significantly increased our social impact. And in the first quarter, we committed to an impact investment of $25 million to support financial institutions serving black and minority communities and businesses. Just like the Just Project and our Foundation for Science, which we launched last year, this more recent investment is meant to help create opportunities for all. 
Turning to our guidance for 2021. Driven by our very strong start to the year and our confidence in the full year outlook, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. Stephen will get into the assumptions behind our guidance, and I'll cover the highlights. 
We're raising our revenue guidance by $550 million to $35.6 billion, which represents 10% reported growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by $0.35 to $21.97, which will represent 12% growth over 2020. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q1. We delivered another excellent quarter of financial performance on both the top and bottom line. The end markets are strong. We committed to execute -- we'll continue to execute our proven growth strategy to be an even stronger partner for our customers. We effectively deployed capital to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders, and we couldn't be more excited about our plans to acquire PPD. I'm very much looking forward to welcoming PPD's 27,000 colleagues to Thermo Fisher, which we expect to do later this year. 
Finally, I'd like to thank my 80,000 colleagues at Thermo Fisher for their dedication to our company, our customers and for once again delivering another fantastic quarter. And now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q1 performance. As Marc mentioned, we had another exceptional quarter and grew our revenue 59%, including 53% organic growth.

As Marc mentioned, we had another exceptional quarter and grew our revenue 59%, including 53% organic growth. We delivered $2.9 billion of COVID-19 response revenue and accelerated the growth of our base business of 13%. So a great start to the year on the top line. 
We also had an excellent start to the year on adjusted EPS, growing 145% in Q1 to $7.21. This was $0.70 higher than our expectations for Q1 at the time of our last earnings call driven by great operational execution, the timing of expenses within the year and a higher tailwind from FX. Overall, exceptional financial results in Q1, continuing our momentum from 2020. 
Let me now provide you with some additional details on our Q1 performance. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $5.88, up 198% from Q1 last year. On the top line, our Q1 reported revenue grew 59% year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue increase included 53% organic growth, a 4% tailwind from foreign exchange and 2% from acquisitions. As a reminder, we had 3 extra selling days in Q1, which represents a tailwind of approximately 3%. Looking ahead, we have 4 fewer days in Q4. 
Turning to our performance by geography during the quarter. All regions delivered very strong growth. North America, Europe and Asia Pacific all grew approximately 50%. China grew 60%, and the rest of the world grew over 80%. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q1 adjusted operating income increased 155%, and adjusted operating margin was 35.4%, 13 percentage points higher than Q1 last year. 
In the quarter, our PPI Business System enabled us to drive exceptional volume leverage and strong productivity. We also had favorable business mix and a tailwind from FX. This was partially offset by strategic investments across our businesses to support our near- and long-term growth. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 54.1%, up 810 basis points from Q1 of the prior year. The increase in gross margin had very similar drivers as those of our adjusted operating margins. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.4% of revenue, a decrease of 460 basis points versus Q1 2020, reflecting strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was $320 million, representing growth of 31% over Q1 2020, reflecting our increased investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. 
Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $113 million, $23 million higher than Q1 last year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of approximately $14 million, $11 million lower than Q1 2020 mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. 
I in line with our expectations, our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16%, up 550 basis points versus Q1 last year due to the substantial increase in pretax profit. Average diluted shares were 397 million in Q1, about 2.5 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another strong highlight for the quarter. Our PPI Business System enabled us to deliver significant cash flow from the very strong top line performance. The cash flow from continuing operations was $2 billion, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Our capacity and capability investments are proceeding very well. And this quarter, net capital expenditures were $620 million. 
In the quarter, we returned $2 billion of capital to shareholders through buybacks, $1.5 billion in January and a further $500 million in March. During the quarter, we also increased our dividend by 18%. We deployed $1.4 billion in acquisitions in Q1, including Mesa Biotech and the acquisition of a European-based viral vector business. Shortly after the quarter end, we also announced an agreement to acquire PPD. 
Early in the quarter, we completed the redemption of $2.6 billion of senior notes, and we ended Q1 with approximately $5.6 billion in cash and $18.6 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.5x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 1.1x on a net debt basis. And concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 21.4%, up 960 basis points from Q1 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns. 
Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Similar to the last few quarters, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impact of the COVID-19 response on our segment results. From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the last 2 quarters, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in Life Science Solutions, with the remainder recognized in Specialty Diagnostics and the Laboratory Products and Services segment. 
From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. That included investments in commercial, R&D and production capacity. 
The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment. And so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. So a lot of moving parts from a segment margin standpoint, but it reflects a very active management of the company successfully navigating the current environment and position the company for an even brighter future. 
So moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. In Q1, reported revenue in this segment increased 137%, and organic growth was 129%. In the quarter, we saw exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences, biosciences and bioproduction businesses. 
Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 238%, and adjusted operating margin was 54.2%, up 16 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and positive business mix. And we continue to make strategic investments across all businesses in this segment. We also had a tailwind on margin from FX in this segment in Q1. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 26% in Q1, and organic growth was 22%. During the quarter, we saw a strong growth in both the chromatography and mass spectrometry and the materials and structural analysis businesses. And it was good to see chemical analysis return to growth. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 59%, and adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, up 410 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume leverage and productivity, which more than offset strategic investments. 
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q1, reported revenue increased by 69%. Organic revenue growth was 65%. Our COVID-19 response enabled us to deliver very strong growth in our microbiology, health care market channel and clinical diagnostics businesses. In addition, it was good to see our immunodiagnostics business return to growth in Q1. Adjusted operating income increased 81% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, up 180 basis points from the prior year. In Q1, we drove very strong volume leverage, which was partially offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. 
Lastly, in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 32%. Organic growth was 26%. In the quarter, we saw very strong growth in all of our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 80%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.8%, which is 400 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through and productivity, partially offset by strategic investments. 
With that, let me now turn to our updated 2021 guidance. Consistent with the approach we took with our initial guidance, we're providing a point outlook rather than a range. We think this is the most helpful approach, given there are multitude of different potential customer demand outcomes for the year. As Mark mentioned, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. Let me walk you through the details. 
I'll begin with revenue. We're raising our revenue guidance by $550 million to $35.6 billion, which represents 10% reported growth over 2020, including 8% organic growth. This increase was driven by 3 factors. $250 million of the increase is due to an improved organic growth outlook for the base business. A strong start to the year, enabling us to increase base business organic growth from 7% to 8% for the full year. 
$225 million of the increase comes from the higher impact of acquisitions, reflecting the acquisition of Mesa Biotech, which was not included in our initial guidance and a good start to the year for our European viral vector business. And the final element is an increase of $75 million for the higher FX tailwind. 
Turning to adjusted earnings per share. We're increasing our annual adjusted EPS guidance by $0.35 to $21.97, which would result in 12% growth over 2020. The increase reflects $0.20 from improved operational outlook for the year, $0.10 for FX and $0.05 from capital deployment. To break down the $0.05 increase in the impact of capital deployment versus our initial guide, I'm now including $0.10 of additional interest cost in Q4 as a placeholder for prefinancing for the PPD acquisition. And this is more than offset by $0.06 benefit from a $500 million stock buyback undertaken in March and a $0.09 benefit from acquisitions. So after a great start in Q1, we're able to increase our outlook for the full year. 
Let me now provide you with some additional assumptions behind our updated guidance. We're now assuming that we'll deliver $7.3 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in 2021. This is $200 million higher than the initial guidance, reflecting the acquisition of Mesa Biotech. 
Within the $7.3 billion, we're now assuming vaccine and therapy-related revenue of approximately $1.5 billion for the year. This is $500 million higher than our initial guidance assumptions, reflecting strong customer demand and progress with our capacity expansion projects. There still remains a large range of outcomes for testing demand, and we remain well positioned to support our customers. 
With regard to FX, we're now assuming a year-over-year tailwind of $475 million or 1.5% of revenue and $0.24 or 1.2% of adjusted EPS. We're assuming that completed acquisitions contribute $350 million to our reported revenue growth in 2021 or 1.1%. The guidance does not include any operational benefit in 2021 from the acquisition of PPD. When we get more clarity on the actual close date, we'll provide an estimate of the likely 2021 impact. 
As mentioned earlier, I've included $40 million or $0.10 of adjusted EPS impact of higher interest costs in the guide as a placeholder for the prefinancing of the PPD transaction. We now expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $510 million. We continue to expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021, no change from prior guidance. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. This is $300 million higher than the initial guidance for the year as we continue to identify opportunities to support future customer demand with our capacity and capability expansions in our pharma services, bioproduction, biosciences and laboratory products businesses. 
Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $7 billion in 2021, no change from prior guidance. Our guidance now includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment; $2 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in Q1; $1.4 billion for completed M&A; and $400 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be 397 million shares. 
And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year and give a reminder of the factors that I outlined when I gave the initial guidance. First, as mentioned earlier, we had 3 extra selling days in Q1, and we'll have 4 fewer days in Q4. The COVID-19 response revenue in the guidance is more significantly weighted to the first half of the year, and the 2020 comparisons are significantly easier at the beginning of the year. That sets up for very strong growth in the first half of the year. And given the revenue phasing, the adjusted EPS is weighted more to the first half of the year. 
In summary, we started the year with an excellent Q1 and are in great position to achieve our goals for the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf."

We had good launches around our clinical sequencing business. 
And then one, to me, the societal need. Probably not a huge revenue opportunity, but an incredible need, which is how do you know if COVID is present in an indoor space? And because of our very deep scientific knowledge about air monitoring, we were able to launch a very relevant solution for that application, which will also have applications in the past and things that we learned from anthrax challenges of years in the past, we were able to deploy here.

On the $1.5 billion of vaccine and therapy revenue, it's -- the demand is very strong. It's probably not tied actually to the label. It's really a combination that orders are very large, and we've been able to get a manufacturing capacity to ramp up more quickly than we originally anticipated. It's really the benefits of the PPI Business System. So that means that for '21, we have a big increase in expectation. 
And my take on the discussions with our customers and certainly, what we understand from the medical side of things, the vaccine and therapy revenue is likely to be quite -- have quite a bit of duration well beyond '21. So as you get more indications, a potential need for boosters or even annual vaccinations, you could imagine that the demand for vaccine revenue to be well into '22 and beyond."

And then one follow-up, maybe a bigger picture question on the testing. There's been some chatter from your peers saying, look, as we get past the peak of the pandemic, perhaps testing is going to consolidate on more automated platforms. And I think the implication is perhaps your systems are not as automated. Maybe could you talk about that, Marc, on how does Thermo stack up versus peers in that space. And other piece is, I mean, I look at your guidance, it looks like testing, you guys are faring much better than competition. So it seems to be slightly confusing on the messaging versus what we're seeing on the numbers."

So when I think about our role in the response, right, we understand customer needs. We have an incredible team of people that respond to it. We had the largest COVID response revenue last year by a huge margin, right? And we've had these discussions in the past, where people in March bet that Thermo Fisher would have done the best job in supporting the industry, probably not on that particular dimension. Broadly, yes, but on molecular diagnostics, we didn't go in with the strongest hand, if you will, but we made a huge difference. 
And the demand in the first quarter, as you see in the $2.9 billion, was extremely good for us. And so we're assuming that will play a role in both symptomatic and asymptomatic testing. And remember, it's quite a global business, right? Our installed base is around the world. So that's the view. 
Now we expect that there'll be less testing, right, in Q2 and in the second half, exactly as we said back in January, right? That as more vaccinations happen, the testing will come down a bit. And that's embedded in our guidance for sure. So I'm very enthusiastic about the role we're playing. 
And to be honest, I'm looking forward to the world where we don't have so much testing because it means that we're going to sporting events and now we're traveling around the world and all the good things that come with it. And what happens when that happens is our base business really picks up as well. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we are."

When I think about postpandemic, right, I'm going to give a holistic answer, including the specifics around the question that you asked, right? One of the things that we said back a year ago was we've managed the company in such a way that we exited the pandemic with a meaningfully stronger industry leadership than when we went in. And obviously, we went in with a very strong position. 
And if I think about the actions that we've taken, we've accelerated our investments in operating expenses, R&D and CapEx to be a faster-growing company organically exiting the pandemic, right? So that's the overarching thing that we've done, right? So we didn't necessarily say let's put all of the money where the pandemic stuff was, but rather, where's the best opportunities to make a difference for our customers long term. 
So first thing we expect in -- whether it's '22 or '23, whatever the time frame is as the pandemic wanes is to expect that we will be a faster-growing company. At the same point, we've made very significant investments in our pharma services and bioproduction business. They're very strong performing in their normal activities across many therapeutic classes, but that capacity will easily shift from COVID-related demand to non-COVID-related therapy classes. So when you think about those investments, the capacity is usable for the different areas. So again, you see that -- those investments transitioning from one type of use to the other. 
When you think about the molecular diagnostics business, and you think about what's happened, we're obviously going to exit a much stronger player than where we were when we started. We have a much expanded installed base of PCR instruments. We also have a refreshed base of PCR instruments, and those instruments are very good for lab-developed tests, where customers are looking for excellent economics and to customize their work. And we're a major component supplier. And we'll also be adding regulated content on top of that as well. So you'll see respiratory panels and overtime and things of that sort. 
We've dramatically increased our installed base of sample preparation instrumentation. And we've gained very meaningful share, and we're well positioned to have a much stronger business going forward. 
The 2 other things that have changed is that our lab plastics business, lab plastics essentials, the pipette tips, the [ micro ], all the things you use for testing, we've expanded capacity. We have alleviated supply chain issues across the industry. And we put ourselves in a position to have a bigger business coming out of the pandemic. 
And then finally, we were a tiny player in specimen collection, and we'll have a nice business on things like viral transport media, obviously, at a much smaller level than the pandemic. I mean, it's been unprecedented the demand for viral transport media during the pandemic, but we built low-cost capacity in 2 countries to be able to serve the world. And that's going to be a nice -- smaller but nice profitable business that serves customer needs. 
So we will exit the pandemic period at some point in time with a stronger molecular diagnostic business than we had coming into it. And I feel great about it. The big numbers are going to come from the organic growth of the company and the repurposing of the capacity for our production and pharma services. And that's probably the way to think about the question."

But I am wondering if this is also a reflection of this change in EPS of the fact that you're seeing the base business trending a lot better than you expected coming into the year, and you are now taking a more conservative stance on COVID-19 revenue and given the latter is higher margin that this is going to have some impact on earnings.

And certainly, there was also back-to-life applications, which historically wouldn't have had any testing if you think about it. 
And we got inundated with technology companies coming to us for either distribution partnerships or acquisition opportunity. It's a huge number. And I stop counting, I think I got 50 or 60 different ones that we looked at extensively. And we were very impressed with the Mesa technology in terms of ease of use and accuracy and already having the 510(k) on the respiratory tests. We saw it as a really interesting addition to the portfolio and that actually its role in COVID on back-to-life applications with the 30 minutes PCR answer, very easy to use. We -- a lot of what COVID will do will pay for the acquisition, and then you get an option on the upside for its application as you build out a menu over time. That's how we thought about it. 
So it was probably less about a huge change in strategy or a huge move from a point-of-care standpoint other than a technology that we like.

Marc, I wanted to just ask you a question to start off with a question on COVID testing and then I just wanted to ask you just to give us a look around the world of what's happening with the reopening. But just on COVID testing, it's an important question that we get. I know Derik was pressing on '22. I'm even looking beyond '22 to '23. How do we just -- is it possible just to frame where Thermo's business could go as things normalize? Obviously, there's a ton of assumptions that going to -- we've had a lot of conversations with investors just trying to figure out where this could go. So versus the 6.1 billion that you did in 2020, any sense of -- as you look at [indiscernible] normal state of testing a couple of years out, what some level of that could be? And then the second question was just related to just you talked about the really strong rebound in China. Just could you give us a sense of kind of what's baked in within your new 2021 guidance kind of regionally?"

So in terms of geographic view, incredible strength across the world with all the regions growing greater than -- around 50% and rest of the world was 80%, and China was 60%, really broad-based strength. And we're seeing encouraging, obviously, encouraging outlook and that -- from a geographic perspective. From a testing perspective, we're going to play a larger role than what we would have played back in 2019 based on the comments around a larger specimen collection business, a larger installed base of PCR instruments, that's also refreshed as well as meaningfully higher share in sample prep and adding content to that installed base over time. Very hard to quantify what it is in '23 because you really have to make an assumption of what the pandemic looks like. Is it history? Or are we still fighting new variants and those things? And depending on that, you could have an incredibly wide link of outcome. So we'll keep updating you periodically over time. 
So thank you, Dan. Let me just wrap it up here with a quick comment, which is as I think about the quarter, market conditions are strong. We're off to an excellent start. And we're on track to deliver really another outstanding year. We look forward to updating you on our Q2 call, and please continue to stay safe, and as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Q1 call. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year.

As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of outstanding financial performance with excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. 
As you know, we're playing a significant role in enabling society's response to the pandemic, including a rapidly expanding role in supporting vaccine production. In our base business, we meaningfully accelerated growth across all our businesses in the first quarter. We had very strong execution of our growth strategy, including launching a number of innovative new products, capitalizing on our leadership in the high-growth and emerging markets, strengthening our unique customer value proposition. And we're already starting to see the benefits of the accelerated investments we initiated in 2020. 
We continue to execute our capital deployment strategy, completing our acquisition of a European viral vector business and Mesa Biotech, a rapid point-of-care molecular diagnostics company. We also returned capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. As I'm sure you saw shortly after the quarter closed, we announced our agreement to acquire PPD, a leading provider of clinical research services serving pharma and biotech customers, our fastest-growing end market. 
So another great quarter of delivering for our stakeholders in the near term, while investing organically and inorganically for a great future. I'll cover each of these topics in more depth in my remarks, but first, let me recap the financials. 
Our revenue in Q1 grew 59% year-over-year to $9.91 billion. Our adjusted operating income for the first quarter increased 155% to $3.51 billion. And our adjusted operating margin expanded 13 percentage points in Q1 to 35.4%. Finally, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving 145% increase to $7.21 per share. 
Turning to our end markets. Conditions were very robust driven by 3 factors: the strong fundamentals in life sciences, ramping of economic activity globally and the role our industry is playing in the pandemic response. Our unique competitive position has allowed us to deliver another fantastic quarter. 
So starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance with growth of approximately 35% driven by strong underlying market dynamics, the benefits of our unique customer value proposition and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. 
We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, including bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry and in our research and safety market channel. We're clearly benefiting from our trusted partner status that we've earned over many years with these customers. 
In academic and government, we had very strong performance and grew 20% driven by robust customer activity globally. In Q1, we saw strong growth across a number of our businesses supporting this customer base, particularly in biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry and electron microscopy. 
Turning to industrial and applied. We grew in the low double digits in the first quarter. The team continues to execute at a very high level to capture opportunities as more customers increase their activity level. During the quarter, it was good to see strong growth across all of our instruments businesses. 
And finally, diagnostics and health care. We had another outstanding quarter, delivering approximately 150% growth. Demand for our COVID-19 testing solutions was very strong. In our base business, while demand is still below pre-pandemic levels, it was encouraging to see our immunodiagnostics business returned to strong growth in the quarter. 
To summarize our performance, our teams capitalized on improving conditions in our end markets, and we continue to gain market share. 
Now let me give you an update on our role in supporting the pandemic response. Once again, this quarter, Thermo Fisher played a very meaningful role in fighting COVID-19 globally. We generated $2.9 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in Q1. Demand for our PCR testing solutions was strong. And our role in the development and production of vaccines and therapies continues to ramp even faster than we expected. 
Coming into the year, we expected our role in supporting vaccines and therapies to represent $1 billion in revenue. Based on our orders and at the speed at which our capacity expansions are coming online, we now expect to deliver $1.5 billion in vaccine and therapy revenue in 2021. 
We also continue to leverage our expertise to bring new solutions to the fight against COVID. One example in the quarter was our launch of the Thermo Scientific AerosolSense Sampler, a new air monitoring system to help facilities such as hospitals, schools and businesses identify the presence of in-air pathogens, including the virus that causes COVID-19. As more people return to public spaces, the AerosolSense Sampler will complement other safety protocols. 
We also acquired Mesa Biotech, which adds simple and rapid PCR testing to decentralized testing -- to decentralized settings, including doctors' offices, pharmacies and to support a number of back-to-life applications. Customer interest is very high, and we're using our PPI Business System to scale the manufacturing of the rapid diagnostic cartridges used by Mesa. We expect to generate $200 million this year from these capabilities and are very excited about the potential for this molecular diagnostic technology post-pandemic. 
The other point I would like to make is that because of our leading role that we played in the pandemic response during 2020 and our outstanding financial performance, we were able to significantly accelerate our investment programs last year in R&D, commercial enablement as well as capability and capacity expansions. These accelerated investments are really positioning Thermo Fisher for an even brighter future. 
For a glimpse into the early momentum building from these investments, let me turn to the great progress we made in Q1 on our growth strategy, which is based on 3 pillars: launching high-impact, innovative new products; leveraging our scale in high growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition for our customers. I'll now share a few examples that demonstrate how we use this strategy to continue to build on our success and create value for our customers. 
Starting with innovation. During the quarter, we launched a number of new products across our businesses to strengthen our leading position and to enable our customers to break new ground and achieve their goals. Let me highlight just a few. 
In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched 2 new Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris GC-Mass Spectrometers, which further extend the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap franchise to bring high-resolution analysis to a range of applications, including toxicology and metabolomics. 
In materials and structural analysis, we launched the Thermo Scientific Spectra Ultra, a new-generation scanning transmission electron microscope for material science applications, which provides insights at atomic scale resolution to accelerate research and improve manufacturing productivity. And in our biosciences business, we launched the Kingfisher Apex Purification System for high throughput sample preparation. 
Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy. We're leveraging our scale to create an outstanding experience for our customers in the high-growth and emerging markets. We're seeing excellent growth, particularly in China, where customer activity has returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we grew more than 60%. 
And we continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets. As an example, in the quarter, we started shipping product from our new single-use facility in Suzhou, which localized the bioproduction manufacturing for biotech customers in China. And our investment in our bioproduction capabilities in Singapore had single-use capacity for pharma and biotech customers globally. So we have strong momentum in high-growth and emerging markets, and we continue to strengthen our position. 
Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy, our customer value proposition. We continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals. Let me update you on our progress in serving our pharma and biotech customers. 
Our upcoming acquisition of PPD, a leader in clinical trial management services, is a great complement to the role we play in supporting research and development, clinical trials and production. These combined capabilities, along with a complementary reputation for excellent quality and service, will further enhance Thermo Fisher's value proposition for pharma and biotech customers. 
Importantly, our customers will be able to more efficiently access these services, which are key enablers of their success. I've interacted with a number of our customers since the announcement, and we're excited about the new capabilities that PPD will bring to Thermo Fisher Scientific. By adding these highly complementary services to our portfolio, we'll be able to further advance our strategic partnership as our customers work to bring a scientific idea to an improved medicine. It will also provide terrific career opportunities for our colleagues and will create significant shareholder value. 
Our organic investments are also building capability and capacity for our pharma and biotech customers. One lens which highlights this is the support of a scale-up of mRNA vaccines, which are in high demand globally for COVID-19 today, but also for many other diseases going forward. As you know, we're an important supplier in this area and we have continued to invest to scale our capacity, including in our biosciences business, we're building additional capacity for our central raw materials in different regions of the world. We're also expanding our bioproduction purification resin capacity, which is used in the mRNA manufacturing process. 
And finally, we're ensuring expanded and regionally available sterile fill finish capacity to produce final drug product. As always, our PPI Business System helped to drive our success during the quarter, enabling us to find solutions and better ways to serve our customers, work more efficiently and effectively and create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. 
Now I'll give you a quick summary of our capital deployment activities so far this year. We've had a very active start, closing $1.4 billion in acquisitions in the quarter, and as I just mentioned, entering into an agreement to acquire PPD for $17.4 billion plus the assumption of approximately $3.5 billion of net debt. 
We also returned significant capital to our shareholders during the quarter, repurchasing $2 billion of our shares and increasing our dividend by 18%. So we've had a great start to the year on capital deployment front, and our M&A pipeline remains very active. 
Turning to a brief update on the progress of our ESG initiatives. Our mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer has never been more relevant. And in addition, we want to make a very positive impact on the communities in which we live and work. 
I'm very proud that over the past year, we've significantly increased our social impact. And in the first quarter, we committed to an impact investment of $25 million to support financial institutions serving black and minority communities and businesses. Just like the Just Project and our Foundation for Science, which we launched last year, this more recent investment is meant to help create opportunities for all. 
Turning to our guidance for 2021. Driven by our very strong start to the year and our confidence in the full year outlook, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. Stephen will get into the assumptions behind our guidance, and I'll cover the highlights. 
We're raising our revenue guidance by $550 million to $35.6 billion, which represents 10% reported growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by $0.35 to $21.97, which will represent 12% growth over 2020. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q1. We delivered another excellent quarter of financial performance on both the top and bottom line. The end markets are strong. We committed to execute -- we'll continue to execute our proven growth strategy to be an even stronger partner for our customers. We effectively deployed capital to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders. And we couldn't be more excited about our plans to acquire PPD. I'm very much looking forward to welcoming PPD's 27,000 colleagues to Thermo Fisher, which we expect to do later this year. 
Finally, I'd like to thank my 80,000 colleagues at Thermo Fisher for their dedication to our company, our customers and for once again delivering another fantastic quarter. 
And now, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q1 performance. As Marc mentioned, we had another exceptional quarter and grew our revenue 59%, including 53% organic growth. We delivered $2.9 billion of COVID-19 respo",2094,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q1 performance. As Marc mentioned, we had another exceptional quarter and grew our revenue 59%, including 53% organic growth. We delivered $2.9 billion of COVID-19 response revenue and accelerated the growth of our base business 13%. So a great start to the year on the top line. 
We also had an excellent start to the year on adjusted EPS growing 145% in Q1 to $7.21. This was $0.70 higher than our expectations for Q1 at the time of our last earnings call driven by great operational execution, the timing of expenses within the year and a higher tailwind from FX. Overall, exceptional financial results in Q1, continuing our momentum from 2020. 
Let me now provide you with some additional details on our Q1 performance. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $5.88, up 198% from Q1 last year. On the top line, our Q1 reported revenue grew 59% year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue increase included 53% organic growth, a 4% tailwind from foreign exchange and 2% from acquisitions. As a reminder, we had 3 extra selling days in Q1, which represents a tailwind of approximately 3%. Looking ahead, we have 4 fewer days in Q4. 
Turning to our performance by geography during the quarter. All regions delivered very strong growth. North America, Europe and Asia Pacific all grew approximately 50%. China grew 60%, and the rest of the world grew over 80%. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q1 adjusted operating income increased 155%, and adjusted operating margin was 35.4%, 13 percentage points higher than Q1 last year. In the quarter, our PPI Business System enabled us to drive exceptional volume leverage and strong productivity. We also had favorable business mix and a tailwind from FX. This was partially offset by strategic investments across our businesses to support our near- and long-term growth. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 54.1%, up 810 basis points from Q1 of the prior year. The increase in gross margin had very similar drivers as those of our adjusted operating margins. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.4% of revenue, a decrease of 460 basis points versus Q1 2020, reflecting strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was $320 million, representing growth of 31% over Q1 2020, reflecting our increased investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. 
Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $113 million, $23 million higher than Q1 last year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of approximately $14 million, $11 million lower than Q1 2020, mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. 
In line with our expectations, our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16%, up 550 basis points versus Q1 last year due to the substantial increase in pretax profit. Average diluted shares were 397 million in Q1, about 2.5 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another strong highlight for the quarter. Our PPI Business System enabled us to deliver significant cash flow from the very strong top line performance. The cash flow from continuing operations was $2 billion and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Our capacity and capability investments are proceeding very well. And this quarter, net capital expenditures were $620 million. 
In the quarter, we returned $2 billion of capital to shareholders through buybacks, $1.5 billion in January and a further $500 million in March. During the quarter, we also increased our dividend by 18%. We deployed $1.4 billion in acquisitions in Q1, including Mesa Biotech and the acquisition of a European-based viral vector business. Shortly after the quarter end, we also announced an agreement to acquire PPD. 
Early in the quarter, we completed the redemption of $2.6 billion of senior notes, and we ended Q1 with approximately $5.6 billion in cash and $18.6 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.5x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 1.1x on a net debt basis. And concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 21.4%, up 960 basis points from Q1 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns. 
Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Similar to the last few quarters, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impact of the COVID-19 response on our segment results. From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the last 2 quarters, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in Life Science Solutions, with the remainder recognized in Specialty Diagnostics and the Laboratory Products and Services segment. 
From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. That included investments in commercial, R&D and production capacity. 
The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment and so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. So a lot of moving parts from a segment margin standpoint, but it reflects a very active management of the company successfully navigating the current environment and position the company for an even brighter future. 
So moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. In Q1, reported revenue in this segment increased 137% and organic growth was 129%. In the quarter, we saw exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences, biosciences and bioproduction businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 238%, and adjusted operating margin was 54.2%, up 16 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and positive business mix. And we continue to make strategic investments across all businesses in this segment. We also had a tailwind on margin from FX in this segment in Q1. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 26% in Q1 and organic growth was 22%. During the quarter, we saw a strong growth in both the chromatography and mass spectrometry and the materials and structural analysis businesses. And it was good to see chemical analysis return to growth. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 59% and adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, up 410 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume leverage and productivity, which more than offset strategic investments. 
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q1, reported revenue increased by 69%. Organic revenue growth was 65%. Our COVID-19 response enabled us to deliver very strong growth in our microbiology, health care market channel and clinical diagnostics businesses. In addition, it was good to see our immunodiagnostics business return to growth in Q1. Adjusted operating income increased 81% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, up 180 basis points from the prior year. And in Q1, we drove very strong volume leverage, which was partially offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. 
Lastly, in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 32%. Organic growth was 26%. In the quarter, we saw very strong growth in all of our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 80%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.8%, which is 400 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through and productivity, partially offset by strategic investments. 
With that, let me now turn to our updated 2021 guidance. Consistent with the approach we took with our initial guidance, we're providing a point outlook rather than a range. We think this is the most helpful approach, given a multitude of different potential customer demand outcomes for the year. As Marc mentioned, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. Let me walk you through the details. 
I'll begin with revenue. We're raising our revenue guidance by $550 million to $35.6 billion, which represents 10% reported growth over 2020, including 8% organic growth. This increase was driven by 3 factors. $250 million of the increase is due to an improved organic growth outlook for the base business, a strong start to the year, enabling us to increase base business organic growth from 7% to 8% for the full year. 
$225 million of the increase comes from the higher impact of acquisitions, reflecting the acquisition of Mesa Biotech, which was not included in our initial guidance and a good start to the year for our European viral vector business. And the final element is an increase of $75 million for the higher FX tailwind. 
Turning to adjusted earnings per share. We're increasing our annual adjusted EPS guidance by $0.35 to $21.97, which would result in 12% growth over 2020. The increase reflects $0.20 from improved operational outlook for the year, $0.10 for FX and $0.05 from capital deployment. 
To break down the $0.05 increase and the impact of capital deployment versus our initial guide, I'm now including $0.10 of additional interest cost in Q4 as a placeholder for prefinancing for the PPD acquisition. And this is more than offset by $0.06 benefit from a $500 million stock buyback undertaken in March and a $0.09 benefit from acquisitions. So after a great start in Q1, we're able to increase our outlook for the full year. 
Let me now provide you with some additional assumptions behind our updated guidance. We're now assuming that we'll deliver $7.3 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in 2021. This is $200 million higher than the initial guidance, reflecting the acquisition of Mesa Biotech. Within the $7.3 billion, we're now assuming vaccine and therapy-related revenue of approximately $1.5 billion for the year. This is $500 million higher than our initial guidance assumptions, reflecting strong customer demand and progress with our capacity expansion projects. There still remains a large range of outcomes for testing demand, and we remain well positioned to support our customers. 
With regard to FX, we're now assuming a year-over-year tailwind of $475 million or 1.5% of revenue and $0.24 or 1.2% of adjusted EPS. We're assuming that completed acquisitions contribute $350 million to our reported revenue growth in 2021 or 1.1%. The guidance does not include any operational benefit in 2021 from the acquisition of PPD. When we get more clarity on the actual close date, we'll provide an estimate of the likely 2021 impact. 
As mentioned earlier, I've included $40 million or $0.10 of adjusted EPS impact of higher interest costs in the guide as a placeholder for the prefinancing of the PPD transaction. We now expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $510 million. We continue to expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021, no change from prior guidance. 
We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. This is $300 million higher than the initial guidance for the year as we continue to identify opportunities to support future customer demand with our capacity and capability expansions in our pharma services, bioproduction, biosciences and laboratory products businesses. 
Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $7 billion in 2021, no change from prior guidance. Our guidance now includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment; $2 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in Q1; $1.4 billion for completed M&A; and $400 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be 397 million shares. 
And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year and give a reminder of the factors that I outlined when I gave the initial guidance. First, as mentioned earlier, we had 3 extra selling days in Q1 and we'll have 4 fewer days in Q4. The COVID-19 response revenue in the guidance is more significantly weighted to the first half of the year, and the 2020 comparisons are significantly easier at the beginning of the year. That sets up for very strong growth in the first half of the year. And given the revenue phasing, the adjusted EPS is weighted more to the first half of the year. 
In summary, we started the year with an excellent Q1 and are in great position to achieve our goals for the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf."

We're, as you know, very excited about the combination of PPD and our offering to our pharma and biotech customers. And as you know, the CRO market is very -- it's got very good characteristics of strong growth because of the relevance of that offering and the trend for more and more of the activity to go to the biotech area, where there's less of those capabilities in-house. So you've got good market and PPD off to a very good start to the year. Financial performance and authorizations backlog, very encouraging. It's a great business performing at a very high level. 
We're just starting that process of planning the combination. And we've had very good, collaborative dialogue with the leadership there. And over the coming months, we'll be working on that process. But for the colleagues there, we can't wait to welcome them. And it really is largely business as usual and bringing new ways to add more value to our customers. So very encouraging. 
And customers are very excited. The customers I've interacted with, they get it. They understand the logic and they like the fact that we're going to have more capabilities to help them navigate the important things that they're doing. In terms of therapeutic areas, PPD covers the full range of the therapy classes and as does Thermo Fisher. So we'll be able to support our customers and the important work that they're doing."

And then one, to me, the societal need. Probably not a huge revenue opportunity, but an incredible need, which is how do you know if COVID is present in an indoor space? And because of our very deep scientific knowledge about air monitoring, we were able to launch a very relevant solution for that application, which will also have applications in the past.

And as a reminder, the days are favorable in Q1, less favorable in Q4. But we raised our base business -- the $250 million organic raise is based on the base business performance. So the base business organic growth also goes up from 7% to 8% from that perspective. 
On the $1.5 billion of vaccine and therapy revenue, it's -- the demand is very strong. It's probably not tied actually to the label. It's really a combination that orders are very large and we've been able to get the manufacturing capacity to ramp up more quickly than we originally anticipated. It's really the benefits of the PPI Business System. So that means that for '21, we have a big increase in expectation. 
And my take on the discussions with our customers, and certainly what we understand from the medical side of things, the vaccine and therapy revenue is likely to be quite -- have quite a bit of duration well beyond '21. So as you get more indications, a potential need for boosters or even annual vaccinations, you could imagine that the demand for vaccine revenue to be well into '22 and beyond."

So when I think about our role in the response, right, we understand customer needs. We have an incredible team of people that respond to it. We have the largest COVID response revenue last year by a huge margin, right? And we've had these discussions in the past, where people in March bet that Thermo Fisher would have done the best job in supporting the industry, probably not on that particular dimension. Broadly, yes, but on molecular diagnostics, we didn't go in with the strongest hand, if you will, but we made a huge difference. 
And the demand in the first quarter, as you see, the $2.9 billion was extremely good for us. And so we're assuming that we'll play a role in both symptomatic and asymptomatic testing. And remember, it's quite a global business, right? Our installed base is around the world. So that's the view. 
Now we expect that there'll be less testing, right, in Q2 and in the second half, exactly as we said back in January, right? That as more vaccinations happen, the testing will come down a bit. And that's embedded in our guidance for sure. So I'm very enthusiastic about the role we're playing. And to be honest, I'm looking forward to the world where we don't have so much testing because it means that we're going to sporting events and now we're traveling around the world and all the good things that come with it. And what happens when that happens is our base business really picks up as well. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we are."

When I think about post-pandemic, right, I'm going to give a holistic answer, including the specifics around the question that you asked, right? One of the things that we said back a year ago was we've managed the company in such a way that we exited the pandemic with a meaningfully stronger industry leadership than when we went in. Obviously, we went in with a very strong position. 
And if I think about the actions that we've taken, we've accelerated our investments in operating expenses, R&D and CapEx to be a faster-growing company organically exiting the pandemic, right? So that's the overarching thing that we've done, right? So we didn't necessarily say let's put all of the money where the pandemic stuff was, but rather, where's the best opportunities to make a difference for our customers long term. So the first thing we expect in -- whether it's '22 or '23, whatever the time frame is, as the pandemic wanes, is to expect that we will be a faster-growing company. 
At the same point, we've made very significant investments in our pharma services and bioproduction business. They're very strong performing in their normal activities across many therapeutic classes, but that capacity will easily shift from COVID-related demand to non-COVID-related therapy classes. So when you think about those investments, the capacity is usable for the different areas. So again, you see that -- those investments transitioning from one type of use to the other. 
When you think about the molecular diagnostics business and you think about what's happened, we're obviously going to exit a much stronger player than where we were when we started. We have a much expanded installed base of PCR instruments. We also have a refreshed base of PCR instruments. And those instruments are very good for lab-developed tests, where customers are looking for excellent economics and to customize their work, and we're a major component supplier. And we'll also be adding regulated content on top of that as well. So you'll see respiratory panels and -- overtime and things of that sort. 
We've dramatically increased our installed base of sample preparation instrumentation. And we've gained very meaningful share, and we're well positioned to have a much stronger business going forward. The 2 other things that have changed is that our lab plastics business, lab plastics essentials, the pipette tips, the microtiter plates, all the things you use for testing. We've expanded capacity. We have alleviated supply chain issues across the industry. And we put ourselves in a position to have a bigger business coming out of the pandemic. 
And then finally, we were a tiny player in specimen collection, and we'll have a nice business on things like viral transport media, obviously, at a much smaller level than the pandemic. I mean it's been unprecedented, the demand for viral transport media during the pandemic, but we built low-cost capacity in 2 countries to be able to serve the world. And that's going to be a nice -- smaller but nice profitable business that serves customer needs. 
So we will exit the pandemic period at some point in time with a stronger molecular diagnostic business than we had coming into it and I feel great about it. The big numbers are going to come from the organic growth of the company and the repurposing of the capacity for -- of our production in pharma services. And that's probably the way to think about the question."

Can you give us some sense of are you seeing backlog build? And in turn, are you now expecting capital equipment demand to trend better than you might have a few months ago over the balance of 2021? So that's the first topic I'd love to talk about."

And when I think about our Analytical Instruments business, off to a very strong start. Obviously, it gets an easy comparison, right? But nonetheless, very good to see demand build excellent growth in the chroma mass spec business and very strong growth in electron microscopy and very good growth actually in chemical analysis. All 3 businesses did well, with chroma mass spec doing the best. 
Bookings, orders, were meaningfully ahead of the revenue. So part of the outlook -- we don't do segment-level outlook, part of our confidence in raising our organic outlook is that the instrument business is well positioned after the start of the year to have a strong 2021. It's hard to know whether that was activity that just didn't happen last year. It's hard to know exactly why. But activity is robust around the world and that's very encouraging."

But at a simple but important level, your Q1 revenue growth was better than your target. Q1 earnings was over $0.50 better than Street expectations. However, while you increased full year revenue targets by more than the magnitude of the Q1 revenue beat, you increased full year EPS targets by less than the magnitude of the Q1 beat. You did provide an EPS guidance change bridge in your prepared remarks, so thanks for that, Stephen. So this is maybe where I'm overthinking things. 
But I am wondering if this is also a reflection of this change in EPS, of the fact that you're seeing the base business trending a lot better than you expected coming into the year and you are now taking a more conservative stance on COVID-19 revenue. And given the latter is higher margin, that this is going to have some impact on earnings. Maybe that was intended to be clear or maybe I'm just wrong, but I'd love it if you could just talk about that a little bit."

In terms of Mesa, one of the things obviously that the pandemic drove was testing happening in totally different ways and in different locations than it was pre-pandemic, right? And certainly, there was also back-to-life applications, which historically wouldn't have had any testing, if you think about it. And we got inundated with technology companies coming to us for either distribution partnerships or acquisition opportunity. It's a huge number. And I stop counting, I think I got 50 or 60 different ones that we looked at extensively. 
And we were very impressed with the Mesa technology in terms of ease of use and accuracy. And already having the 510(k) on the respiratory tests, we saw it as a really interesting addition to the portfolio and that actually its role in COVID on back-to-life applications with the 30 minutes PCR answer, very easy to use. We -- a lot of what COVID will do will pay for the acquisition and then you get an option on the upside for its application as you build out a menu over time. That's how we thought about it. 
So it was probably less about a huge change in strategy or a huge move from a point-of-care standpoint other than a technology that we like. We're extremely capable in PCR and so this is a really natural extension of our offering. So -- and the business is off to a nice start, which is great. Thanks, Derik."

And we're seeing encouraging -- obviously, encouraging outlook and that -- from a geographic perspective. 
From a testing perspective, we're going to play a larger role than what we would have played back in 2019 based on the comments around a larger specimen collection business, the larger installed base of PCR instruments, that's also refreshed, as well as meaningfully higher share in sample prep and adding content to that installed base over time. 
Very hard to quantify what it is in '23 because you really have to make an assumption of what the pandemic looks like. Is it history? Or are we still fighting new variants and those things? And depending on that, you could have an incredibly wide range of outcome. So we'll keep updating you periodically over time. So thank you, Dan.

Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter call.

Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we executed on our growth strategy to deliver another fantastic quarter in Q2 with excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. 
As I reflect on the first half of the year, 3 things stand out to me: first, our team's exceptional execution, operating with speed and scale to deliver on our growth strategy and gain share; second, we're already seeing the benefit of the accelerated investments we initiated in 2020; and third, the power of our PPI Business System, which enables our performance. These 3 factors position us exceptionally well to deliver a fantastic 2021 and provide terrific momentum as we enter 2022. 
I'll cover each of these topics in more depth in my remarks. But first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in Q2 grew 34% year-over-year to $9.27 billion. Our adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased 44% to $2.69 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 29% for the quarter. Finally, we delivered another quarter of exceptional adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 44% increase to $5.60 per share. 
Turning to our end markets. We continue to see excellent conditions driven by 3 factors: robust fundamentals in the life sciences, strong economic activity globally and the role our industry is playing in the pandemic response. Our unique competitive position and excellent execution by our team have allowed us to gain share and deliver another outstanding quarter. 
Starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance with growth of over 30% driven by strong underlying market conditions, the benefit of our unique customer value proposition and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. 
We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, including bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry and in our research and safety market channel. We're clearly benefiting from our trusted partner status that we've earned over many years with these customers. 
In academic and government, we grew 35% this quarter. We saw very strong growth across our businesses supporting this customer base, especially in biosciences, electromicroscopy and the research and safety market channel. 
Turning to industrial and applied. We grew approximately 30% during the quarter as the team continues to execute at a high level to capture opportunities. In Q2, we had particularly strong growth in our electromicroscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry business. 
Finally, in diagnostics and health care, we grew in the high teens during the quarter, and we're seeing customer demand in our base business approach prepandemic levels. Our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses delivered outstanding growth. Also in diagnostics and health care, demand for COVID-19 testing-related products grew to approximately $1.4 billion. 
Let me wrap up the end market recap with a quick comment on our role in the pandemic response. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have played the largest role in the life science tools and diagnostics industry in supporting the societal response in delivering critical solutions for our customers and governments around the world. 
In the second quarter, we generated a total of $1.9 billion, bringing our first half COVID-19 response revenue to $4.7 billion. One of the benefits of our response activity is the ability it gives us to accelerate investments and position the company for a phenomenal future. 
You know about the additions to capacity, capabilities and new products that we are making. And we are also continuing to invest in our colleagues. Building on our investments last year, we are again providing all nonexecutive colleagues with a special recognition payment of 2 weeks additional pay to reflect the incredible contributions to our success. This is just one of the many measures we are taking to ensure we remain the employer of choice across the life sciences industry. 
Let me turn to the great progress we made in Q2 on our growth strategy, which is based on 3 pillars: launching high-impact, innovative new products; leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me give you a few examples. 
I'll start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Let me highlight a few. 
In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched the new Thermo Scientific Orbitrap IQ-X Tribrid Mass Spectrometer, which further extends the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to accelerate small molecule analysis from metabolites and other complex compounds. In our electromicroscopy business, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5EXL Wafer DualBeam scanning electromicroscope, a very important tool to help semiconductor customers more efficiently ramp up production of new, smaller and more complex microprocessors and memory devices. 
In our biosciences business, we launched several new products, including 2 instruments to advance cell analysis. The Invitrogen Bigfoot Spectral Sorter is a powerful self-sorter tool based on the technology we acquired from Propel Labs in Q1; and the Invitrogen Attune CytPix Flow Cytometer, which offers enhanced imaging capability to enable researchers and cell therapy developers to better understand cell biology. 
Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers in the high-growth and emerging markets. This has contributed to excellent growth and share gain we are delivering across Asia Pacific. Let me cover a couple of the highlights. 
In China, we delivered strong growth of just under 30% in the quarter. The team is ramping up our new single-use technology facility in Suzhou. 
In India, we demonstrated speed at scale at our genetic sciences facility in Bengalaru, which shipped millions of COVID-19 PCR tests to support the country's response to the pandemic. We also contributed $10 million in urgently needed products and donations to help India bring the crisis under control. Our performance across the region demonstrates that we've created a differentiated experience for our customers, and the significant investments that we've made in these markets are fueling growth. 
The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition, and we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals. Building on our significant investments last year, in 2021, we're executing on over $2.5 billion in CapEx to further expand our capacity and capabilities. It's exciting to see the continued progress of these investments. 
For example, during the quarter, we brought additional capacity online around the world to support customers' production of vaccines and therapies. These include sterile fill finish lines in Italy and Greenville, North Carolina; expanding our single-use technology capacity in our facility in Logan, Utah; and adding to our Lithuania site for the production of essential raw materials used in making mRNA vaccines. These investments in our value proposition demonstrate our commitment to our customers, which rely on us as an essential partner to their work. 
During the quarter, we announced a number of collaborations with leading academic medical centers. The combination of our innovation and our unique customer value proposition position us to move science forward. 
For example, we're collaborating with the Mayo Clinic to develop more precise and personalized diagnostics for blood-based cancers, allergy, autoimmunity and therapeutic drug monitoring. This work will leverage our insight and technology in clinical and next-gen sequencing, immunology and clinical mass spectrometry. 
In addition, we announced that we'll build and operate a state-of-the-art cell therapy development, manufacturing and collaboration center at the University of California, San Francisco to advance innovation with cell and gene therapy. These partnerships will lead to new capabilities for our customers and ultimately, better outcomes for patients. 
As always, our PPI Business System was a major factor in our success during Q2. This discipline and our mission-driven culture helps us to find a better way every day, so we can continue to bring more innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively operate with speed at scale and create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning to capital deployment. We announced the acquisition of PPD at the beginning of the quarter. This acquisition will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in the attractive and high-growth clinical research services industry and add highly complementary services for our fastest-growing end market. The integration planning is going extremely well. I've been very impressed with the world-class talent I've met during the integration planning process. We're looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher upon closing of the transaction. 
Before turning to guidance, let me update you on our progress on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in serving science, we know that our role goes beyond the work we do to enable our customers and the value we create for our shareholders. It extends to our responsibility to make the world a better place. 
To that end, we continue to advance our sustainability initiatives. Yesterday, we announced our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This builds on our existing goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our operations by 2030. We're moving forward on this front by making our facilities more energy efficient, increasing our use of renewable energy and reducing waste in our operations while also innovating across our portfolio to enable customers to meet their sustainability needs. This is aligned with our commitment to doing business the right way and to fulfilling our mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. 
Now let me turn to our guidance for 2021. Driven by our very strong start to the first half of the year and our confidence in the full year outlook, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. Stephen will [indiscernible] on the assumption behind our guidance. I'll cover the highlights. 
We're raising our revenue guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion, which represents 11% reported growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will represent 13% growth over 2020. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q2. Our team is doing an outstanding job of executing our proven growth strategy to strengthen our competitive position. Our PPI Business System is enabling our ability to operate with speed at scale. Our business is performing extremely well and gaining share. All of this enabled us to deliver excellent first half results, position us to deliver a fantastic 2021 and provides terrific momentum as we enter 2022. 
Finally, I'd like to thank my 80,000 colleagues for their dedication to our company, our customers, and for once again delivering another excellent quarter. And now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"
97023,1673288606,2352592,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q2 performance. We had another excellent quarter and grew our revenues 34%, including 28% organic growth.

We had another excellent quarter and grew our revenues 34%, including 28% organic growth. As Marc mentioned, our growth strategy is enabling us to take share on top of strong market conditions. As a result, in Q2, we were able to deliver 27% organic growth in the base business and continue our industry-leading response to the pandemic, generating $1.9 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in the quarter. 
Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate excellent pull-through on the very strong top line growth and is also enabling us to execute really well on our significant growth investments. As a result, we grew our adjusted EPS in Q2 by 44% to $5.60 and delivered $1.7 billion of free cash flow. Overall, another excellent quarter. 
Now let me provide some more color on the Q2 performance. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.61, up 59% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 34% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 28% organic growth, 2% from acquisitions and a tailwind of approximately 5% from foreign exchange. As I mentioned, the base business organic growth was 27%. 
Turning to our performance by geography during the quarter. North America grew 25%, Europe grew 35%, Asia Pacific and China both grew just under 30% and rest of the world grew low double digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 44%, and adjusted operating margin was 29%, 200 basis points higher than Q2 last year. 
In the quarter, our PPI Business System enabled us to deliver very strong contributions from volume and productivity. We also have favorable business mix. This was partially offset by the ongoing strategic investments across our businesses to support our near- and long-term growth. 
Included in the investments in the quarter is over $100 million of supplementary cash bonuses for the nonexecutive colleagues, and we recorded a similar amount in Q1. This is to recognize the extraordinary work that our colleagues continue to do for our customers, communities and shareholders. Our ongoing investments in our colleagues and capacity and capabilities are ensuring a really bright future for the company. 
Moving on to details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.6%, flat to Q2 of the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and had positive business mix. This was offset by strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, a decrease of 200 basis points versus Q2 2020, reflecting strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was approximately $340 million, representing growth of 29% versus Q2 2020 and reflects the increased investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. 
Looking our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $111 million, $17 million lower than Q2 last year largely due to lower net debt. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $3 million, $30 million lower than Q2 2020 mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. 
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%. This is 250 basis points versus Q2 last year due to the increase in pretax profit. Average diluted shares were 396 million in Q2, about 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. The cash flow performance enabled by our PPI Business System was very strong in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, cash flow from continuing operations was $4.2 billion, up 88% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $3 billion, up 76% over the same period last year, and that's after investing $1.2 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong returns we're generating in the short term and the investments we're making for the long term. 
We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 18% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended Q2 with $7 billion in cash and $18.8 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.4x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 0.9x on a net debt basis. 
Concluding my comments on total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 22.5%, up 10 percentage points from Q2 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns. 
I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Similar to the last few quarters, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impact of the COVID-19 response on our segment results. 
From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the last 3 quarters, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in Life Science Solutions, with the remainder recognized in Laboratory Products and Services and Specialty Diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and a different level of profitability on that revenue. 
In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment, so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. 
Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions. Q2 reported revenue in this segment increased 37%, and organic growth was 29%. In the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in our biosciences and bioproduction businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 39%, and adjusted operating margin was 48.3%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. 
In the quarter, we drove strong volume pull-through and saw a positive business mix, which were partially offset by the strategic investments. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX in this segment in Q2. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 41% in Q2, and organic growth was 36%. During the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all businesses within the segment. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 107%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.9%, up 600 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and productivity, which more than offset the strategic investments that we're making across this segment. 
Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q2, reported revenue in this segment increased 25%, and organic growth was 21%. During Q2, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income [ decreased ] 15% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, down 170 basis points from the prior year. In Q2, the positive volume leverage and favorable business mix were more than offset by the continued strategic investments in this segment. 
Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 29%. Organic growth was 23%. In the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 59%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, which is 230 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered positive volume leverage at a favorable business mix, and this was partially offset by strategic investments. 
With that, now let me turn to our updated 2021 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, reflecting the strength of our Q2 performance, along with a stronger outlook for the base business in the second half of the year. 
In terms of revenue, we're raising our full year guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion and increasing our full year organic growth to 9%. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by 3 factors: an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full year from 8% to 12%, an updated assumption of $6.7 billion of COVID-19 response revenue for 2021 and a slightly more favorable FX tailwind than previously assumed. Let me give you additional details on each of these factors. 
Starting with the base business. Here, we're increasing the outlook by $850 million, reflecting a great Q2 performance and a stronger outlook for growth in the second half of the year. This increases our 2021 full year organic growth outlook for the base business by 400 basis points to 12%. Our end markets are very strong, and we're executing very well on our growth strategy and increased strategic investments to drive excellent performance. 
Moving on to COVID-19 response revenue. Our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies continues to increase, and we now expect $1.8 billion of related revenue in 2021, up $300 million from the prior guide. Approximately half of that $1.8 billion was recognized in the first half of the year. 
Given the strength of both the base business growth and our vaccine and therapy response, we've taken the opportunity in this revised guidance to significantly derisk the outlook for testing. We've lowered the full year testing related response revenue by $900 million from the prior guidance. We're now assuming it will be $4.9 billion for 2021, of which $3.8 billion was delivered in the first half of the year, leaving just over $1 billion to go in the second half. 
There continues to be a wide range of outcomes for testing in the second half of the year. There are scenarios where the pandemic could increase in intensity, driving a higher need for testing. Should that be the case, we'll be well positioned to support customer needs, and we'll flow those benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to take the opportunity to derisk the outlook. 
The third and final element of the revenue guidance raise is FX. Rates continue to fluctuate. They were favorable to those from our prior guidance for most of Q2 and then moderated significantly. But net of these results, an increase in our FX revenue tailwind for the year is now assumed to be $525 million, up $50 million versus the prior guidance. 
Taking account of the different margin profiles of the revenue changes I've just outlined, we're increasing our annual adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will result in 13% growth over 2020. With the revenue mix assumed in the guide, we now estimate that the adjusted operating margin for the full year would be approximately 29.7%, in line with 2020. The other elements of our guidance remain the same as the prior guide. 
Let me remind you of some of those assumptions. We've not included any operational benefits in 2021 from the acquisition of PPD. When we get more clarity on the actual close date, we'll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2021. 
We expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $510 million. As a reminder, included within that number is $40 million or $0.10 to adjusted EPS as a placeholder for prefinancing for the PPD transaction. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. 
Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks, which are completed in Q1, $1.4 billion for completed M&A and $400 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We estimate the full year average diluted share count will be 397 million shares. 
Finally, I wanted to touch on phasing of revenue dollars and adjusted EPS for the remainder of the year. When I think about the split of the second half P&L between Q3 and Q4, we're assuming that the results will be slightly weighted to Q4. As you think about that split, remember the placeholder for PPD financing is all in Q4. 
To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter, and we're in a great position to achieve our 2021 goals as we move into the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf."

So testing volumes, they're slowing, but still robust. What I'm curious about is as we move into -- towards the fall, are you seeing these labs move more into 4-in-1 testing?

Because I think that would help us as we think about the durability of what's occurred in that category. 
And then the other one, I just want to sneak in for Stephen. COVID-19 revenue has clearly been a boon to operating margin. That said, underlying margin seems to be tracking quite nicely.

It's -- for us, the activities we do across all of the countries is the huge driver of our activity. And so a lot of what we read about is what's going on in the U.S. And in the U.S., testing demand is definitely less at this moment, although obviously, cases are starting to increase, but there's quite a bit of demand around the world. And certain customers are preparing for a respiratory panel for the winter season. And obviously, we'll have that.

In terms of capital deployment, first of all, it's been an active year, right, between -- and I'll give you an update on PPD in a minute, but it's been an active year. We obviously announced PPD. We've done a number of smaller bolt-on transactions. So we've been active. 
Our pipeline is quite busy, right? We're looking at things. We're disciplined. And because our industry is so large and fragmented, we're seeing opportunities to continue to build on our M&A strategy and execute against that. And so from that perspective, things are good. 
From a return of capital perspective, we felt the $2 billion that we did in terms of buybacks and the increase in the dividend felt like the right return, given the M&A commitments we've made to PPD. And we certainly revisit our return of capital mix with our Board periodically, and we'll continue to do so. But right now, we continue to have M&A as the primary focus. 
PPD, I'll spend a moment there because it's a large commitment of capital. I've been super impressed with the team, get to meet a number of the team because of the integration planning. It's going very smoothly. Colleagues are very excited to become part of the company. 
As you see from some of the other companies in the CRO field that are reporting, the end markets are super good. The industry is doing well as PPD as a leader is very well positioned. So this is going to be a really good growth asset. From the pathway to closure of the transaction, we've got most of the direct investment, the foreign investment approvals done. We've got a little bit left to do there, but that's pretty much done. 
We're working our way through the various antitrust filings around the world. We're collaborating with the FTC on second request, and we're looking forward to closing the transaction by the end of the year. So that's a quick recap on capital performance."

Our PPI Business System enables us to effectively navigate events like this and run our operations efficiently, use our scale to partner with suppliers and then maximize opportunities, as you mentioned, around pricing for certain products to help protect our margins. It's not just the challenge really across the portfolio. That's kind of the scale benefit of using our pricing discipline across the company.

When I think about the dynamics here, our new products, they're very exciting. I mentioned a few of them this quarter as they did last. So the investments we've been making in R&D there are really paying off. And the end markets are good, right? And you see that in electromicroscopy, both in the adoption of the tools for life sciences applications. So the cryo-electromicroscopy, but you also see that across the material science applications, including semiconductor.

We expect that to be about $1.8 billion this year. And demand is very robust, right? So for the industry, it's mostly about capacity coming online to support the demand.

And we have been able to secure meaningful orders for our new facility in Carlsbad. I had the opportunity of visiting the facility in June. It's awesome. And super excited, and it's open.

Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter call.

Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we executed on our growth strategy to deliver another fantastic quarter in Q2 with excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. 
As I reflect on the first half of the year, 3 things stand out to me: first, our team's exceptional execution, operating with speed at scale to deliver on our growth strategy and gain share; second, we're already seeing the benefit of the accelerated investments we initiated in 2020; and third, the power of our PPI Business System, which enables our performance. These 3 factors position us exceptionally well to deliver a fantastic 2021 and provide terrific momentum as we enter 2022. 
I'll cover each of these topics in more depth in my remarks. But first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in Q2 grew 34% year-over-year to $9.27 billion. Our adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased 44% to $2.69 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 29% for the quarter. Finally, we delivered another quarter of exceptional adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 44% increase to $5.60 per share. 
Turning to our end markets. We continue to see excellent conditions driven by 3 factors: robust fundamentals in the life sciences, strong economic activity globally and the role our industry is playing in the pandemic response. Our unique competitive position and excellent execution by our team have allowed us to gain share and deliver another outstanding quarter. 
Starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance with growth of over 30% driven by strong underlying market conditions, the benefit of our unique customer value proposition and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. 
We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, including bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry and in our research and safety market channel. We're clearly benefiting from our trusted partner status that we've earned over many years with these customers. 
In academic and government, we grew 35% this quarter. We saw very strong growth across our businesses supporting this customer base, especially in biosciences, electron microscopy and the research and safety market channel. 
Turning to industrial and applied. We grew approximately 30% during the quarter as the team continues to execute at a high level to capture opportunities. In Q2, we had particularly strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry business. 
Finally, in diagnostics and health care, we grew in the high teens during the quarter, and we're seeing customer demand in our base business approach prepandemic levels. Our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses delivered outstanding growth. Also in diagnostics and health care, demand for COVID-19 testing-related products grew to approximately $1.4 billion. 
Let me wrap up the end market recap with a quick comment on our role in the pandemic response. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have played the largest role in the life science tools and diagnostics industry in supporting the societal response in delivering critical solutions for our customers and governments around the world. 
In the second quarter, we generated a total of $1.9 billion, bringing our first half COVID-19 response revenue to $4.7 billion. One of the benefits of our response activity is the ability it gives us to accelerate investments and position the company for a phenomenal future. 
You know about the additions to capacity, capabilities and new products that we are making. And we are also continuing to invest in our colleagues. Building on our investments last year, we are again providing all nonexecutive colleagues with a special recognition payment of 2 weeks additional pay to reflect the incredible contributions to our success. This is just one of the many measures we are taking to ensure we remain the employer of choice across the life sciences industry. 
Let me turn to the great progress we made in Q2 on our growth strategy, which is based on 3 pillars: launching high-impact, innovative new products; leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me give you a few examples. 
I'll start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Let me highlight a few. 
In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched the new Thermo Scientific Orbitrap IQ-X Tribrid Mass Spectrometer, which further extends the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to accelerate small molecule analysis from metabolites and other complex compounds. In our electron microscopy business, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5EXL Wafer DualBeam scanning electron microscope, a very important tool to help semiconductor customers more efficiently ramp up production of new, smaller and more complex microprocessors and memory devices. 
In our biosciences business, we launched several new products, including 2 instruments to advance cell analysis. The Invitrogen Bigfoot Spectral Sorter is a powerful cell sorter tool based on the technology we acquired from Propel Labs in Q1; and the Invitrogen Attune CytPix Flow Cytometer, which offers enhanced imaging capability to enable researchers and cell therapy developers to better understand cell biology. 
Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers in the high-growth and emerging markets. This has contributed to excellent growth and share gain we are delivering across Asia Pacific. Let me cover a couple of the highlights. 
In China, we delivered strong growth of just under 30% in the quarter. The team is ramping up our new single-use technology facility in Suzhou. 
In India, we demonstrated speed at scale at our genetic sciences facility in Bengaluru, which shipped millions of COVID-19 PCR tests to support the country's response to the pandemic. We also contributed $10 million in urgently needed products and donations to help India bring the crisis under control. Our performance across the region demonstrates that we're creating a differentiated experience for our customers, and the significant investments that we've made in these markets are fueling growth. 
The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition, and we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals. Building on our significant investments last year, in 2021, we're executing on over $2.5 billion in CapEx to further expand our capacity and capabilities. It's exciting to see the continued progress of these investments. 
For example, during the quarter, we brought additional capacity online around the world to support customers' production of vaccines and therapies. These include sterile fill/finish lines in Italy and Greenville, North Carolina; expanding our single-use technology capacity in our facility in Logan, Utah; and adding to our Lithuania site for the production of essential raw materials used in making mRNA vaccines. These investments in our value proposition demonstrate our commitment to our customers, which rely on us as an essential partner to their work. 
During the quarter, we announced a number of collaborations with leading academic medical centers. The combination of our innovation and our unique customer value proposition position us to move science forward. 
For example, we're collaborating with the Mayo Clinic to develop more precise and personalized diagnostics for blood-based cancers, allergy, autoimmunity and therapeutic drug monitoring. This work will leverage our insight and technology in clinical and next-gen sequencing, immunology and clinical mass spectrometry. 
In addition, we announced that we'll build and operate a state-of-the-art cell therapy development, manufacturing and collaboration center at the University of California, San Francisco to advance innovation in cell and gene therapy. These partnerships will lead to new capabilities for our customers and ultimately better outcomes for patients. 
As always, our PPI Business System was a major factor in our success during Q2. This discipline and our mission-driven culture helps us to find a better way every day so we can continue to bring more innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, operate with speed at scale and create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning to capital deployment. We announced the acquisition of PPD at the beginning of the quarter. This acquisition will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in the attractive and high-growth clinical research services industry and add highly complementary services for our fastest-growing end market. The integration planning is going extremely well. I've been very impressed with the world-class talent I've met during the integration planning process. We're looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher upon closing of the transaction. 
Before turning to guidance, let me update you on our progress on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in serving science, we know that our role goes beyond the work we do to enable our customers and the value we create for our shareholders. It extends to our responsibility to make the world a better place. 
To that end, we continue to advance our sustainability initiatives. Yesterday, we announced our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This builds on our existing goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our operations by 2030. We're moving forward on this front by making our facilities more energy efficient, increasing our use of renewable energy and reducing waste in our operations while also innovating across our portfolio to enable customers to meet their sustainability needs. This is aligned with our commitment to doing business the right way and to fulfilling our mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. 
Now let me turn to our guidance for 2021. Driven by our very strong start to the first half of the year and our confidence in the full year outlook, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. Stephen will hop on the assumption behind our guidance. I'll cover the highlights. 
We're raising our revenue guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion, which represents 11% reported growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will represent 13% growth over 2020. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q2. Our team is doing an outstanding job of executing our proven growth strategy to strengthen our competitive position. Our PPI Business System is enabling our ability to operate with speed at scale. Our business is performing extremely well and gaining share. All of this enabled us to deliver excellent first half results, position us to deliver a fantastic 2021 and provides terrific momentum as we enter 2022. 
Finally, I'd like to thank my 80,000 colleagues for their dedication to our company, our customers and for once again delivering another excellent quarter. 
And now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"
97023,1673288606,2352927,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q2 performance. We had another excellent quarter and grew our revenues 34%, including 28% organic growth.

We had another excellent quarter and grew our revenues 34%, including 28% organic growth. As Marc mentioned, our growth strategy is enabling us to take share on top of strong market conditions. As a result, in Q2, we were able to deliver 27% organic growth in the base business and continue our industry-leading response to the pandemic, generating $1.9 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in the quarter. 
Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate excellent pull-through on the very strong top line growth and is also enabling us to execute really well on our significant growth investments. As a result, we grew our adjusted EPS in Q2 by 44% to $5.60 and delivered $1.7 billion of free cash flow. Overall, another excellent quarter. 
Now let me provide some more color on the Q2 performance. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.61, up 59% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 34% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 28% organic growth, 2% from acquisitions and a tailwind of approximately 5% from foreign exchange. As I mentioned, the base business organic growth was 27%. 
Turning to our performance by geography during the quarter. North America grew 25%, Europe grew 35%, Asia Pacific and China both grew just under 30%, and rest of the world grew low double digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 44%, and adjusted operating margin was 29%, 200 basis points higher than Q2 last year. 
In the quarter, our PPI Business System enabled us to deliver very strong contributions from volume and productivity. We also have favorable business mix. This was partially offset by the ongoing strategic investments across our businesses to support our near- and long-term growth. 
Included in the investments in the quarter is over $100 million of supplementary cash bonuses for the nonexecutive colleagues, and we recorded a similar amount in Q1. This is to recognize the extraordinary work that our colleagues continue to do for our customers, communities and shareholders. Our ongoing investments in our colleagues and capacity and capabilities are ensuring a really bright future for the company. 
Moving on to details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.6%, flat to Q2 of the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and had positive business mix. This was offset by strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, a decrease of 200 basis points versus Q2 2020, reflecting strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was approximately $340 million, representing growth of 29% versus Q2 2020 and reflects the increased investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. 
Looking at our results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $111 million, $17 million lower than Q2 last year largely due to lower net debt. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $3 million, $30 million lower than Q2 2020 mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. 
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%. This is 250 basis points versus Q2 last year due to the increase in pretax profit. Average diluted shares were 396 million in Q2, about 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. The cash flow performance enabled by our PPI Business System was very strong in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, cash flow from continuing operations was $4.2 billion, up 88% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $3 billion, up 76% over the same period last year, and that's after investing $1.2 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong returns we're generating in the short term and the investments we're making for the long term. 
We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 18% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended Q2 with $7 billion in cash and $18.8 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.4x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 0.9x on a net debt basis. 
Concluding my comments on total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 22.5%, up 10 percentage points from Q2 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns. 
I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Similar to the last few quarters, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impact of the COVID-19 response on our segment results. 
From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the last 3 quarters, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in Life Science Solutions, with the remainder recognized in Laboratory Products and Services and Specialty Diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. 
In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment, so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. 
Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions. Q2 reported revenue in this segment increased 37%, and organic growth was 29%. In the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in our biosciences and bioproduction businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 39%, and adjusted operating margin was 48.3%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. 
In the quarter, we drove strong volume pull-through and saw a positive business mix, which were partially offset by the strategic investments. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX in this segment in Q2. 
In the Analytical Instruments Segment, reported revenue increased 41% in Q2, and organic growth was 36%. During the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all businesses within the segment. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 107%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.9%, up 600 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and productivity, which more than offset the strategic investments that we're making across this segment. 
Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q2, reported revenue in this segment increased 25%, and organic growth was 21%. During Q2, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 15% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, down 170 basis points from the prior year. In Q2, the positive volume leverage and favorable business mix were more than offset by the continued strategic investments in this segment. 
Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Services Segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 29%. Organic growth was 23%. In the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 59%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, which is 230 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered positive volume leverage at a favorable business mix, and this was partially offset by strategic investments. 
With that, now let me turn to our updated 2021 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, reflecting the strength of our Q2 performance along with a stronger outlook for the base business in the second half of the year. 
In terms of revenue, we're raising our full year guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion and increasing our full year organic growth to 9%. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by 3 factors: an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full year from 8% to 12%, an updated assumption of $6.7 billion of COVID-19 response revenue for 2021 and a slightly more favorable FX tailwind than previously assumed. Let me give you additional details on each of these factors. 
Starting with the base business. Here, we're increasing the outlook by $850 million, reflecting a great Q2 performance and a stronger outlook for growth in the second half of the year. This increases our 2021 full year organic growth outlook for the base business by 400 basis points to 12%. Our end markets are very strong, and we're executing very well on our growth strategy and increased strategic investments to drive excellent performance. 
Moving on to COVID-19 response revenue. Our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies continues to increase, and we now expect $1.8 billion of related revenue in 2021, up $300 million from the prior guide. Approximately half of that $1.8 billion was recognized in the first half of the year. 
Given the strength of both the base business growth and our vaccine and therapy response, we've taken the opportunity in this revised guidance to significantly derisk the outlook for testing. We've lowered the full year testing-related response revenue by $900 million from the prior guidance. We're now assuming it will be $4.9 billion for 2021, of which $3.8 billion was delivered in the first half of the year, leaving just over $1 billion to go in the second half. 
There continues to be a wide range of outcomes for testing in the second half of the year. There are scenarios where the pandemic could increase in intensity, driving a higher need for testing. Should that be the case, we'll be well positioned to support customer needs, and we'll flow those benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to take the opportunity to derisk the outlook. 
The third and final element of the revenue guidance raise is FX. Rates continue to fluctuate. They were favorable to those from our prior guidance for most of Q2 and then moderated significantly. But net of these results, an increase in our FX revenue tailwind for the year is now assumed to be $525 million, up $50 million versus the prior guidance. 
Taking account of the different margin profiles of the revenue changes I've just outlined, we're increasing our annual adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will result in 13% growth over 2020. With the revenue mix assumed in the guide, we now estimate that the adjusted operating margin for the full year would be approximately 29.7%, in line with 2020. The other elements of our guidance remain the same as the prior guide. Let me remind you of some of those assumptions. 
We've not included any operational benefits in 2021 from the acquisition of PPD. When we get more clarity on the actual close date, we'll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2021. 
We expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $510 million. As a reminder, included within that number is $40 million or $0.10 to adjusted EPS as a placeholder for prefinancing for the PPD transaction. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. 
Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in Q1, $1.4 billion for completed M&A and $400 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We estimate the full year average diluted share count will be 397 million shares. 
Finally, I wanted to touch on phasing of revenue dollars and adjusted EPS for the remainder of the year. When I think about the split of the second half P&L between Q3 and Q4, we're assuming that the results will be slightly weighted to Q4. As you think about that split, remember the placeholder for PPD financing is all in Q4. 
To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter, and we're in a great position to achieve our 2021 goals as we move into the second half of the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf."

And we actually have a number of orders for the second half and felt that, given how much dialogue is around testing just generally and so much noise, we just felt that taking that off the table felt like the right thing to do. 
And we're well positioned, as you know, given our relationships and capacity. If things like the Delta variant continue to drive more demand for testing, then obviously, we're going to be higher than the number we assumed in the guidance."

So we thought an Analyst Day would be the best way because we think it's a great question. 
What I would say as you think about between now and whatever it is, 7 weeks from now as for 2022, the performance of the base business is super cool, right? 12% organic growth. We're going to be entering the year with a very strong order book with very strong momentum. And more and more of those investments that we've made and are making positions us for great momentum in 2022. 
We're going to play a meaningful role in what customers need on their response, right? 2022 seems like a long way off. But I'd say, obviously, vaccines and therapies are going to continue to be super relevant. 
And they'll be testing. The question is at what level. And we'll try to do some scenarios to help with that, but nobody knows what the demand is going to be for testing next year. So it will be a range of outcomes around that.

So testing volumes, they're slowing but still robust. What I'm curious about is, as we move into -- towards the fall, are you seeing these labs move more into 4-in-1 testing? And then I guess, beyond that, is there any move towards broader infectious disease testing at these sites? Because I think that would help us as we think about the durability of what's occurred in that category. 
And then the other one, I just want to sneak in for Stephen. COVID-19 revenue has clearly been a boon to operating margin. That said, underlying margin seems to be tracking quite nicely.

It's -- for us, the activities we do across all of the countries is the huge driver of our activity. And so a lot of what we read about is what's going on in the U.S. And in the U.S., testing demand is definitely less at this moment, although obviously, cases are starting to increase, but there's quite a bit of demand around the world. And certain customers are preparing for a respiratory panel for the winter season. And obviously, we'll have that. And we're going to support our customers for whatever level of demand that they need. 
In terms of margins, I'll make it sort of what's the philosophy -- and then Stephen, if you want to add, feel free -- which is we're not thinking about it base business versus COVID. We're thinking about how do we manage the company appropriately in terms of the profitability of the company and the investment grade for the going-forward. 
I think one of the things that -- if you kind of do very simple math, and I'll do it from an EPS perspective, right, we raised our -- based on the very strong outlook for the year and the very strong first half, we raised our EPS by $0.10 in the guidance. We chose to invest another $0.25 in our colleagues, right? The $100 million in the Q2 additional payment is an investment in the future, right? So we made the conscious decision.

We've done a number of smaller bolt-on transactions. So we've been active. 
Our pipeline is quite busy, right? We're looking at things. We're disciplined. And because our industry is so large and fragmented, we're seeing opportunities to continue to build on our M&A strategy and execute against that. And so from that perspective, things are good. 
From a return of capital perspective, we felt the $2 billion that we did in terms of buybacks and the increase in the dividend felt like the right return given the M&A commitments we've made to PPD. And we certainly revisit our return of capital mix with our Board periodically, and we'll continue to do so. But right now, we continue to have M&A as the primary focus. 
PPD, I'll spend a moment there because it's a large commitment of capital. I've been super impressed with the team, gotten to get to meet a number of the team because of the integration planning. It's going very smoothly. Colleagues are very excited to become part of the company. 
As you see from some of the other companies in the CRO field that are reporting, the end markets are super good. The industry is doing well as PPD as a leader is very well positioned. So this is going to be a really good growth asset. From the pathway to closure of the transaction, we've got most of the direct investment, the foreign investment approvals done. We've got a little bit left to do there, but that's pretty much done. 
We're working our way through the various antitrust filings around the world. We're collaborating with the FTC on second request, and we're looking forward to closing the transaction by the end of the year. So that's a quick recap on capital performance."

That's really the place you saw it the most. 
So what you're seeing now is that, largely, activity has returned back to normal around the world. I mean it might be different, but actually, the activity level is pretty normal. 
And what I'm encouraged about is 2 things. One is widespread in terms of the performance across our businesses, biosciences, research and safety market channel. That talks about activity is very high. And electron microscopy, really excellent funding, so it talks about sort of the big capital funding there also is strong. And then when you look going forward, that really does look good because there's so much positive talk around the world about the funding."

And when you think about the growth in operating income dollars, it will be very, very equivalent to the rest of the company. So a slightly different P&L profile we're bringing into the company. 
And we have to factor that in as you're thinking about modeling the company going forward as the scale of business coming in is lower than the average margins. But it doesn't change the margin profile or the margin opportunity for the rest of the company and doesn't change the great outlook that we think PPD has, and we're excited about bringing it into the company."

Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter call.

Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we executed on our growth strategy to deliver another fantastic quarter in Q2 with excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. 
As I reflect on the first half of the year, 3 things stand out to me: first, our team's exceptional execution, operating with speed at scale to deliver on our growth strategy and gain share; second, we're already seeing the benefit of the accelerated investments we initiated in 2020; and third, the power of our PPI Business System, which enables our performance. These 3 factors position us exceptionally well to deliver a fantastic 2021 and provide terrific momentum as we enter 2022. 
I'll cover each of these topics in more depth in my remarks. But first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in Q2 grew 34% year-over-year to $9.27 billion. Our adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased 44% to $2.69 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 29% for the quarter. Finally, we delivered another quarter of exceptional adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 44% increase to $5.60 per share. 
Turning to our end markets. We continue to see excellent conditions driven by 3 factors: robust fundamentals in the life sciences, strong economic activity globally and the role our industry is playing in the pandemic response. Our unique competitive position and excellent execution by our team have allowed us to gain share and deliver another outstanding quarter. 
Starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance with growth of over 30% driven by strong underlying market conditions, the benefit of our unique customer value proposition and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. 
We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, including bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry and in our research and safety market channel. We're clearly benefiting from our trusted partner status that we've earned over many years with these customers. 
In academic and government, we grew 35% this quarter. We saw very strong growth across our businesses supporting this customer base, especially in biosciences, electron microscopy and the research and safety market channel. 
Turning to industrial and applied. We grew approximately 30% during the quarter as the team continues to execute at a high level to capture opportunities. In Q2, we had particularly strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry business. 
Finally, in diagnostics and health care, we grew in the high teens during the quarter, and we're seeing customer demand in our base business approach prepandemic levels. Our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses delivered outstanding growth. Also in diagnostics and health care, demand for COVID-19 testing-related products grew to approximately $1.4 billion. 
Let me wrap up the end market recap with a quick comment on our role in the pandemic response. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have played the largest role in the life science tools and diagnostics industry in supporting the societal response in delivering critical solutions for our customers and governments around the world. 
In the second quarter, we generated a total of $1.9 billion, bringing our first half COVID-19 response revenue to $4.7 billion. One of the benefits of our response activity is the ability it gives us to accelerate investments and position the company for a phenomenal future. 
You know about the additions to capacity, capabilities and new products that we are making. And we are also continuing to invest in our colleagues. Building on our investments last year, we are again providing all nonexecutive colleagues with a special recognition payment of 2 weeks additional pay to reflect the incredible contributions to our success. This is just one of the many measures we are taking to ensure we remain the employer of choice across the life sciences industry. 
Let me turn to the great progress we made in Q2 on our growth strategy, which is based on 3 pillars: launching high-impact, innovative new products; leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me give you a few examples. 
I'll start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Let me highlight a few. 
In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched the new Thermo Scientific Orbitrap IQ-X Tribrid Mass Spectrometer, which further extends the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to accelerate small molecule analysis of metabolites and other complex compounds. In our electron microscopy business, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5EXL Wafer DualBeam scanning electron microscope, a very important tool to help semiconductor customers more efficiently ramp up production of new, smaller and more complex microprocessors and memory devices. 
In our biosciences business, we launched several new products, including 2 instruments to advance cell analysis. The Invitrogen Bigfoot Spectral Sorter is a powerful cell sorter tool based on the technology we acquired from Propel Labs in Q1; and the Invitrogen Attune CytPix Flow Cytometer, which offers enhanced imaging capability to enable researchers and cell therapy developers to better understand cell biology. 
Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers in high-growth and emerging markets. This has contributed to excellent growth and share gain we are delivering across Asia Pacific. Let me cover a couple of the highlights. 
In China, we delivered strong growth of just under 30% in the quarter. The team is ramping up our new single-use technology facility in Suzhou. 
In India, we demonstrated speed at scale at our genetic sciences facility in Bengaluru, which shipped millions of COVID-19 PCR tests to support the country's response to the pandemic. We also contributed $10 million in urgently needed products and donations to help India bring the crisis under control. Our performance across the region demonstrates that we're creating a differentiated experience for our customers, and the significant investments that we've made in these markets are fueling growth. 
The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition, and we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals. Building on our significant investments last year, in 2021, we're executing on over $2.5 billion in CapEx to further expand our capacity and capabilities. It's exciting to see the continued progress of these investments. 
For example, during the quarter, we brought additional capacity online around the world to support customers' production of vaccines and therapies. These include sterile fill/finish lines in Italy and Greenville, North Carolina; expanding our single-use technology capacity in our facility in Logan, Utah; and adding to our Lithuania site for the production of essential raw materials used in making mRNA vaccines. These investments in our value proposition demonstrate our commitment to our customers, which rely on us as an essential partner to their work. 
During the quarter, we announced a number of collaborations with leading academic medical centers. The combination of our innovation and our unique customer value proposition position us to move science forward. 
For example, we're collaborating with the Mayo Clinic to develop more precise and personalized diagnostics for blood-based cancers, allergy, autoimmunity and therapeutic drug monitoring. This work will leverage our insight and technology in clinical next-gen sequencing, immunology and clinical mass spectrometry. 
In addition, we announced that we'll build and operate a state-of-the-art cell therapy development, manufacturing and collaboration center at the University of California, San Francisco to advance innovation in cell and gene therapy. These partnerships will lead to new capabilities for our customers and ultimately better outcomes for patients. 
As always, our PPI Business System was a major factor in our success during Q2. This discipline and our mission-driven culture helps us to find a better way every day so we can continue to bring more innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, operate with speed at scale and create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning to capital deployment. We announced the acquisition of PPD at the beginning of the quarter. This acquisition will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in the attractive and high-growth clinical research services industry and add highly complementary services for our fastest-growing end market. The integration planning is going extremely well. I've been very impressed with the world-class talent I've met during the integration planning process. We're looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher upon closing of the transaction. 
Before turning to guidance, let me update you on our progress on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in serving science, we know that our role goes beyond the work we do to enable our customers and the value we create for our shareholders. It extends to our responsibility to make the world a better place. 
To that end, we continue to advance our sustainability initiatives. Yesterday, we announced our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This builds on our existing goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our operations by 2030. We're moving forward on this front by making our facilities more energy efficient, increasing our use of renewable energy and reducing waste in our operations while also innovating across our portfolio to enable customers to meet their sustainability needs. This is aligned with our commitment to doing business the right way and to fulfilling our mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. 
Now let me turn to our guidance for 2021. Driven by our very strong start to the first half of the year and our confidence in the full year outlook, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. Stephen will hop on the assumption behind our guidance. I'll cover the highlights. 
We're raising our revenue guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion, which represents 11% reported growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will represent 13% growth over 2020. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q2. Our team is doing an outstanding job of executing our proven growth strategy to strengthen our competitive position. Our PPI Business System is enabling our ability to operate with speed at scale. Our business is performing extremely well and gaining share. All of this enabled us to deliver excellent first half results, position us to deliver a fantastic 2021 and provides terrific momentum as we enter 2022. 
Finally, I'd like to thank my 80,000 colleagues for their dedication to our company, our customers and for once again delivering another excellent quarter. 
And now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"
97023,1673288606,2389051,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q2 performance. We had another excellent quarter and grew our revenues 34%, including 28% organic growth.

We had another excellent quarter and grew our revenues 34%, including 28% organic growth. As Marc mentioned, our growth strategy is enabling us to take share on top of strong market conditions. As a result, in Q2, we were able to deliver 27% organic growth in the base business and continue our industry-leading response to the pandemic, generating $1.9 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in the quarter. 
Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate excellent pull-through on the very strong top line growth and is also enabling us to execute really well on our significant growth investments. As a result, we grew our adjusted EPS in Q2 by 44% to $5.60 and delivered $1.7 billion of free cash flow. Overall, another excellent quarter. 
Now let me provide some more color on the Q2 performance. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.61, up 59% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 34% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 28% organic growth, 2% from acquisitions and a tailwind of approximately 5% from foreign exchange. As I mentioned, the base business organic growth was 27%. 
Turning to our performance by geography during the quarter. North America grew 25%, Europe grew 35%, Asia Pacific and China both grew just under 30%, and rest of the world grew low double digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 44%, and adjusted operating margin was 29%, 200 basis points higher than Q2 last year. 
In the quarter, our PPI Business System enabled us to deliver very strong contributions from volume and productivity. We also have favorable business mix. This was partially offset by the ongoing strategic investments across our businesses to support our near- and long-term growth. 
Included in the investments in the quarter is over $100 million of supplementary cash bonuses for the nonexecutive colleagues, and we recorded a similar amount in Q1. This is to recognize the extraordinary work that our colleagues continue to do for our customers, communities and shareholders. Our ongoing investments in our colleagues and capacity and capabilities are ensuring a really bright future for the company. 
Moving on to details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.6%, flat to Q2 of the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and had positive business mix. This was offset by strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, a decrease of 200 basis points versus Q2 2020, reflecting strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was approximately $340 million, representing growth of 29% versus Q2 2020 and reflects the increased investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. 
Looking at our results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $111 million, $17 million lower than Q2 last year largely due to lower net debt. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $3 million, $30 million lower than Q2 2020 mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. 
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%. This is 250 basis points versus Q2 last year due to the increase in pretax profit. Average diluted shares were 396 million in Q2, about 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. The cash flow performance enabled by our PPI Business System was very strong in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, cash flow from continuing operations was $4.2 billion, up 88% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $3 billion, up 76% over the same period last year, and that's after investing $1.2 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong returns we're generating in the short term and the investments we're making for the long term. 
We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 18% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended Q2 with $7 billion in cash and $18.8 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.4x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 0.9x on a net debt basis. 
Concluding my comments on total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 22.5%, up 10 percentage points from Q2 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns. 
I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Similar to the last few quarters, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impact of the COVID-19 response on our segment results. 
From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the last 3 quarters, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in Life Science Solutions, with the remainder recognized in Laboratory Products and Services and Specialty Diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. 
In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment, so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. 
Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions. Q2 reported revenue in this segment increased 37%, and organic growth was 29%. In the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in our biosciences and bioproduction businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 39%, and adjusted operating margin was 48.3%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. 
In the quarter, we drove strong volume pull-through and saw a positive business mix, which were partially offset by the strategic investments. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX in this segment in Q2. 
In the Analytical Instruments Segment, reported revenue increased 41% in Q2, and organic growth was 36%. During the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all businesses within the segment. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 107%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.9%, up 600 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and productivity, which more than offset the strategic investments that we're making across this segment. 
Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q2, reported revenue in this segment increased 25%, and organic growth was 21%. During Q2, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 15% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, down 170 basis points from the prior year. In Q2, the positive volume leverage and favorable business mix were more than offset by the continued strategic investments in this segment. 
Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Services Segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 29%. Organic growth was 23%. In the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 59%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, which is 230 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered positive volume leverage at a favorable business mix, and this was partially offset by strategic investments. 
With that, now let me turn to our updated 2021 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, reflecting the strength of our Q2 performance along with a stronger outlook for the base business in the second half of the year. 
In terms of revenue, we're raising our full year guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion and increasing our full year organic growth to 9%. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by 3 factors: an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full year from 8% to 12%, an updated assumption of $6.7 billion of COVID-19 response revenue for 2021 and a slightly more favorable FX tailwind than previously assumed. Let me give you additional details on each of these factors. 
Starting with the base business. Here, we're increasing the outlook by $850 million, reflecting a great Q2 performance and a stronger outlook for growth in the second half of the year. This increases our 2021 full year organic growth outlook for the base business by 400 basis points to 12%. Our end markets are very strong, and we're executing very well on our growth strategy and increased strategic investments to drive excellent performance. 
Moving on to COVID-19 response revenue. Our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies continues to increase, and we now expect $1.8 billion of related revenue in 2021, up $300 million from the prior guide. Approximately half of that $1.8 billion was recognized in the first half of the year. 
Given the strength of both the base business growth and our vaccine and therapy response, we've taken the opportunity in this revised guidance to significantly derisk the outlook for testing. We've lowered the full year testing-related response revenue by $900 million from the prior guidance. We're now assuming it will be $4.9 billion for 2021, of which $3.8 billion was delivered in the first half of the year, leaving just over $1 billion to go in the second half. 
There continues to be a wide range of outcomes for testing in the second half of the year. There are scenarios where the pandemic could increase in intensity, driving a higher need for testing. Should that be the case, we'll be well positioned to support customer needs, and we'll flow those benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to take the opportunity to derisk the outlook. 
The third and final element of the revenue guidance raise is FX. Rates continue to fluctuate. They were favorable to those from our prior guidance for most of Q2 and then moderated significantly. But net of these results, an increase in our FX revenue tailwind for the year is now assumed to be $525 million, up $50 million versus the prior guidance. 
Taking account of the different margin profiles of the revenue changes I've just outlined, we're increasing our annual adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will result in 13% growth over 2020. With the revenue mix assumed in the guide, we now estimate that the adjusted operating margin for the full year would be approximately 29.7%, in line with 2020. The other elements of our guidance remain the same as the prior guide. Let me remind you of some of those assumptions. 
We've not included any operational benefits in 2021 from the acquisition of PPD. When we get more clarity on the actual close date, we'll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2021. 
We expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $510 million. As a reminder, included within that number is $40 million or $0.10 to adjusted EPS as a placeholder for prefinancing for the PPD transaction. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. 
Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in Q1, $1.4 billion for completed M&A and $400 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We estimate the full year average diluted share count will be 397 million shares. 
Finally, I wanted to touch on phasing of revenue dollars and adjusted EPS for the remainder of the year. When I think about the split of the second half P&L between Q3 and Q4, we're assuming that the results will be slightly weighted to Q4. As you think about that split, remember the placeholder for PPD financing is all in Q4. 
To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter, and we're in a great position to achieve our 2021 goals as we move into the second half of the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf."

What I would say as you think about between now and whatever it is, 7 weeks from now as for 2022, the performance of the base business is super cool, right? 12% organic growth.

It's -- for us, the activities we do across all of the countries is the huge driver of our activity. And so a lot of what we read about is what's going on in the U.S. And in the U.S., testing demand is definitely less at this moment, although obviously, cases are starting to increase, but there's quite a bit of demand around the world.

Our pipeline is quite busy, right? We're looking at things. We're disciplined. And because our industry is so large and fragmented, we're seeing ample opportunities to continue to build on our M&A strategy and execute against that. And so from that perspective, things are good. 
From a return of capital perspective, we felt the $2 billion that we did in terms of buybacks and the increase in the dividend felt like the right return given the M&A commitments we've made to PPD. And we certainly revisit our return of capital mix with our Board periodically, and we'll continue to do so. But right now, we continue to have M&A as the primary focus. 
PPD, I'll spend a moment there because it's a large commitment of capital. I've been super impressed with the team, gotten to get to meet a number of the team because of the integration planning. It's going very smoothly. Colleagues are very excited to become part of the company. 
As you see from some of the other companies in the CRO field that are reporting, the end markets are super good. The industry is doing well as PPD as a leader is very well positioned. So this is going to be a really good growth asset. From the pathway to closure of the transaction, we've got most of the direct investment, the foreign investment approvals done.

When I think about the dynamics here, our new products, they're very exciting. I mentioned a few of them this quarter as I did last. So the investments we've been making in R&D there are really paying off. And the end markets are good, right? And you see that in electron microscopy, both in the adoption of the tools for life sciences applications, so the cryo-electron microscopy. But you also see that across the material science applications, including semiconductor. And obviously, from everything you read around what's going on in chip supply and investments there, that bodes well for the electron microscopy business for sure."

On COVID, I think you made a prudent move to take testing down. Just curious, your latest thoughts on the durability on the vaccine and therapy side, what you're hearing from customers. Obviously, a lot of focus on boosters now. 
And then on margins, I know a lot of people are focused on 2022 operating margins. You did take up R&D by 20% last year. So maybe another way to ask the question is, how much of the OpEx do you think will carry through? Or do you think you'll reset R&D a little bit to drive more leverage?"

And it cuts across both our pharma services capabilities for the active ingredients, the drug substance as well as in the sterile fill/finish activities for the vaccines. And we play obviously a very substantial role as the technology provider in our biosciences business with things like enzymes, nucleotides as well as in our single-use technologies, cell culture. So a very large role. We expect that to be about $1.8 billion this year. 
And demand is very robust, right? So for the industry, it's mostly about capacity coming online to support the demand. And so we look at our momentum going into 2022. We would expect the vaccine and therapy demand to be very strong given the likely demand for the response to the pandemic. And as our capacity comes more and more online, it positions us very well to meet the strong backlog of orders that we've been able to generate because we have the right solutions for our customers."

So -- and yes, we're in numerous dialogues in supporting those activities across our capabilities. That's a wonderful tailwind for our largest segment of pharma and biotech in terms of customers. So that looks very strong. 
One of the things that we have seen is that in plasmid DNA, there has been a shortage of capacity for some period of time. And we've been addressing that by making significant organic investments. And we have been able to secure meaningful orders for our new facility in Carlsbad. I had the opportunity of visiting the facility in June. It's awesome. I'm super excited, and it's open. And we just did the ribbon-cutting in early July, and we'll be producing product in the not-too-distant future there and building momentum on that. And that's great.

Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we executed on our growth strategy to deliver another fantastic quarter in Q2 with excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. 
As I reflect on the first half of the year, 3 things stand out to me: first, our team's exceptional execution, operating with speed at scale to deliver on our growth strategy and gain share; second, we're already seeing the benefit of the accelerated investments we initiated in 2020; and third, the power of our PPI Business System, which enables our performance. These 3 factors position us exceptionally well to deliver a fantastic 2021 and provide terrific momentum as we enter 2022. 
I'll cover each of these topics in more depth in my remarks. But first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in Q2 grew 34% year-over-year to $9.27 billion. Our adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased 44% to $2.69 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 29% for the quarter. Finally, we delivered another quarter of exceptional adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 44% increase to $5.60 per share. 
Turning to our end markets. We continue to see excellent conditions driven by 3 factors: robust fundamentals in the life sciences, strong economic activity globally and the role our industry is playing in the pandemic response. Our unique competitive position and excellent execution by our team have allowed us to gain share and deliver another outstanding quarter. 
Starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance with growth of over 30% driven by strong underlying market conditions, the benefit of our unique customer value proposition and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. 
We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, including bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry and in our research and safety market channel. We're clearly benefiting from our trusted partner status that we've earned over many years with these customers. 
In academic and government, we grew 35% this quarter. We saw very strong growth across our businesses supporting this customer base, especially in biosciences, electron microscopy and the research and safety market channel. 
Turning to industrial and applied. We grew approximately 30% during the quarter as the team continues to execute at a high level to capture opportunities. In Q2, we had particularly strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry business. 
Finally, in diagnostics and health care, we grew in the high teens during the quarter, and we're seeing customer demand in our base business approach prepandemic levels. Our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses delivered outstanding growth. Also in diagnostics and health care, demand for COVID-19 testing-related products grew to approximately $1.4 billion. 
Let me wrap up the end market recap with a quick comment on our role in the pandemic response. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have played the largest role in the life science tools and diagnostics industry in supporting the societal response in delivering critical solutions for our customers and governments around the world. 
In the second quarter, we generated a total of $1.9 billion, bringing our first half COVID-19 response revenue to $4.7 billion. One of the benefits of our response activity is the ability it gives us to accelerate investments and position the company for a phenomenal future. 
You know about the additions to capacity, capabilities and new products that we are making. And we are also continuing to invest in our colleagues. Building on our investments last year, we are again providing all nonexecutive colleagues with a special recognition payment of 2 weeks additional pay to reflect the incredible contributions to our success. This is just one of the many measures we are taking to ensure we remain the employer of choice across the life sciences industry. 
Let me turn to the great progress we made in Q2 on our growth strategy, which is based on 3 pillars: launching high-impact, innovative new products; leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me give you a few examples. 
I'll start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Let me highlight a few. 
In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched the new Thermo Scientific Orbitrap IQ-X Tribrid Mass Spectrometer, which further extends the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to accelerate small molecule analysis of metabolites and other complex compounds. In our electron microscopy business, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5EXL Wafer DualBeam scanning electron microscope, a very important tool to help semiconductor customers more efficiently ramp up production of new, smaller and more complex microprocessors and memory devices. 
In our biosciences business, we launched several new products, including 2 instruments to advance cell analysis. The Invitrogen Bigfoot Spectral Sorter is a powerful cell sorter tool based on the technology we acquired from Propel Labs in Q1; and the Invitrogen Attune CytPix Flow Cytometer, which offers enhanced imaging capability to enable researchers and cell therapy developers to better understand cell biology. 
Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers in high-growth and emerging markets. This has contributed to excellent growth and share gain we are delivering across Asia Pacific. Let me cover a couple of the highlights. 
In China, we delivered strong growth of just under 30% in the quarter. The team is ramping up our new single-use technology facility in Suzhou. 
In India, we demonstrated speed at scale at our genetic sciences facility in Bengaluru, which shipped millions of COVID-19 PCR tests to support the country's response to the pandemic. We also contributed $10 million in urgently needed products and donations to help India bring the crisis under control. Our performance across the region demonstrates that we're creating a differentiated experience for our customers, and the significant investments that we've made in these markets are fueling growth. 
The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition, and we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals. Building on our significant investments last year, in 2021, we're executing on over $2.5 billion in CapEx to further expand our capacity and capabilities. It's exciting to see the continued progress of these investments. 
For example, during the quarter, we brought additional capacity online around the world to support customers' production of vaccines and therapies. These include sterile fill/finish lines in Italy and Greenville, North Carolina; expanding our single-use technology capacity in our facility in Logan, Utah; and adding to our Lithuania site for the production of essential raw materials used in making mRNA vaccines. These investments in our value proposition demonstrate our commitment to our customers, which rely on us as an essential partner to their work. 
During the quarter, we announced a number of collaborations with leading academic medical centers. The combination of our innovation and our unique customer value proposition position us to move science forward. 
For example, we're collaborating with the Mayo Clinic to develop more precise and personalized diagnostics for blood-based cancers, allergy, autoimmunity and therapeutic drug monitoring. This work will leverage our insight and technology in clinical next-gen sequencing, immunology and clinical mass spectrometry. 
In addition, we announced that we'll build and operate a state-of-the-art cell therapy development, manufacturing and collaboration center at the University of California, San Francisco to advance innovation in cell and gene therapy. These partnerships will lead to new capabilities for our customers and ultimately better outcomes for patients. 
As always, our PPI Business System was a major factor in our success during Q2. This discipline and our mission-driven culture helps us to find a better way every day so we can continue to bring more innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, operate with speed at scale and create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning to capital deployment. We announced the acquisition of PPD at the beginning of the quarter. This acquisition will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in the attractive and high-growth clinical research services industry and add highly complementary services for our fastest-growing end market. The integration planning is going extremely well. I've been very impressed with the world-class talent I've met during the integration planning process. We're looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher upon closing of the transaction. 
Before turning to guidance, let me update you on our progress on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in serving science, we know that our role goes beyond the work we do to enable our customers and the value we create for our shareholders. It extends to our responsibility to make the world a better place. 
To that end, we continue to advance our sustainability initiatives. Yesterday, we announced our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This builds on our existing goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our operations by 2030. We're moving forward on this front by making our facilities more energy efficient, increasing our use of renewable energy and reducing waste in our operations while also innovating across our portfolio to enable customers to meet their sustainability needs. This is aligned with our commitment to doing business the right way and to fulfilling our mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. 
Now let me turn to our guidance for 2021. Driven by our very strong start to the first half of the year and our confidence in the full year outlook, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. Stephen will hop on the assumption behind our guidance. I'll cover the highlights. 
We're raising our revenue guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion, which represents 11% reported growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will represent 13% growth over 2020. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q2. Our team is doing an outstanding job of executing our proven growth strategy to strengthen our competitive position. Our PPI Business System is enabling our ability to operate with speed at scale. Our business is performing extremely well and gaining share. All of this enabled us to deliver excellent first half results, position us to deliver a fantastic 2021 and provides terrific momentum as we enter 2022. 
Finally, I'd like to thank my 80,000 colleagues for their dedication to our company, our customers and for once again delivering another excellent quarter. 
And now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"
97023,1673288606,2389056,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q2 performance. We had another excellent quarter and grew our revenues 34%, including 28% organic growth. As Marc mentioned, our growth strategy is enabling us to take s",2015,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q2 performance. We had another excellent quarter and grew our revenues 34%, including 28% organic growth. As Marc mentioned, our growth strategy is enabling us to take share on top of strong market conditions. As a result, in Q2, we were able to deliver 27% organic growth in the base business and continue our industry-leading response to the pandemic, generating $1.9 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in the quarter. 
Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate excellent pull-through on the very strong top line growth and is also enabling us to execute really well on our significant growth investments. As a result, we grew our adjusted EPS in Q2 by 44% to $5.60 and delivered $1.7 billion of free cash flow. Overall, another excellent quarter. 
Now let me provide some more color on the Q2 performance. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.61, up 59% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 34% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 28% organic growth, 2% from acquisitions and a tailwind of approximately 5% from foreign exchange. As I mentioned, the base business organic growth was 27%. 
Turning to our performance by geography during the quarter. North America grew 25%, Europe grew 35%, Asia Pacific and China both grew just under 30%, and rest of the world grew low double digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 44%, and adjusted operating margin was 29%, 200 basis points higher than Q2 last year. 
In the quarter, our PPI Business System enabled us to deliver very strong contributions from volume and productivity. We also have favorable business mix. This was partially offset by the ongoing strategic investments across our businesses to support our near- and long-term growth. 
Included in the investments in the quarter is over $100 million of supplementary cash bonuses for the nonexecutive colleagues, and we recorded a similar amount in Q1. This is to recognize the extraordinary work that our colleagues continue to do for our customers, communities and shareholders. Our ongoing investments in our colleagues and capacity and capabilities are ensuring a really bright future for the company. 
Moving on to details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.6%, flat to Q2 of the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and had positive business mix. This was offset by strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, a decrease of 200 basis points versus Q2 2020, reflecting strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was approximately $340 million, representing growth of 29% versus Q2 2020 and reflects the increased investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. 
Looking at our results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $111 million, $17 million lower than Q2 last year largely due to lower net debt. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $3 million, $30 million lower than Q2 2020 mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. 
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%. This is 250 basis points versus Q2 last year due to the increase in pretax profit. Average diluted shares were 396 million in Q2, about 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. The cash flow performance enabled by our PPI Business System was very strong in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, cash flow from continuing operations was $4.2 billion, up 88% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $3 billion, up 76% over the same period last year, and that's after investing $1.2 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong returns we're generating in the short term and the investments we're making for the long term. 
We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 18% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended Q2 with $7 billion in cash and $18.8 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.4x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 0.9x on a net debt basis. 
Concluding my comments on total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 22.5%, up 10 percentage points from Q2 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns. 
I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Similar to the last few quarters, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impact of the COVID-19 response on our segment results. 
From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the last 3 quarters, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in Life Science Solutions, with the remainder recognized in Laboratory Products and Services and Specialty Diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. 
In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment, so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. 
Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions. Q2 reported revenue in this segment increased 37%, and organic growth was 29%. In the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in our biosciences and bioproduction businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 39%, and adjusted operating margin was 48.3%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. 
In the quarter, we drove strong volume pull-through and saw a positive business mix, which were partially offset by the strategic investments. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX in this segment in Q2. 
In the Analytical Instruments Segment, reported revenue increased 41% in Q2, and organic growth was 36%. During the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all businesses within the segment. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 107%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.9%, up 600 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and productivity, which more than offset the strategic investments that we're making across this segment. 
Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q2, reported revenue in this segment increased 25%, and organic growth was 21%. During Q2, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 15% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, down 170 basis points from the prior year. In Q2, the positive volume leverage and favorable business mix were more than offset by the continued strategic investments in this segment. 
Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Services Segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 29%. Organic growth was 23%. In the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 59%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, which is 230 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered positive volume leverage at a favorable business mix, and this was partially offset by strategic investments. 
With that, now let me turn to our updated 2021 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, reflecting the strength of our Q2 performance along with a stronger outlook for the base business in the second half of the year. 
In terms of revenue, we're raising our full year guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion and increasing our full year organic growth to 9%. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by 3 factors: an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full year from 8% to 12%, an updated assumption of $6.7 billion of COVID-19 response revenue for 2021 and a slightly more favorable FX tailwind than previously assumed. Let me give you additional details on each of these factors. 
Starting with the base business. Here, we're increasing the outlook by $850 million, reflecting a great Q2 performance and a stronger outlook for growth in the second half of the year. This increases our 2021 full year organic growth outlook for the base business by 400 basis points to 12%. Our end markets are very strong, and we're executing very well on our growth strategy and increased strategic investments to drive excellent performance. 
Moving on to COVID-19 response revenue. Our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies continues to increase, and we now expect $1.8 billion of related revenue in 2021, up $300 million from the prior guide. Approximately half of that $1.8 billion was recognized in the first half of the year. 
Given the strength of both the base business growth and our vaccine and therapy response, we've taken the opportunity in this revised guidance to significantly derisk the outlook for testing. We've lowered the full year testing-related response revenue by $900 million from the prior guidance. We're now assuming it will be $4.9 billion for 2021, of which $3.8 billion was delivered in the first half of the year, leaving just over $1 billion to go in the second half. 
There continues to be a wide range of outcomes for testing in the second half of the year. There are scenarios where the pandemic could increase in intensity, driving a higher need for testing. Should that be the case, we'll be well positioned to support customer needs, and we'll flow those benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to take the opportunity to derisk the outlook. 
The third and final element of the revenue guidance raise is FX. Rates continue to fluctuate. They were favorable to those from our prior guidance for most of Q2 and then moderated significantly. But net of these results, an increase in our FX revenue tailwind for the year is now assumed to be $525 million, up $50 million versus the prior guidance. 
Taking account of the different margin profiles of the revenue changes I've just outlined, we're increasing our annual adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will result in 13% growth over 2020. With the revenue mix assumed in the guide, we now estimate that the adjusted operating margin for the full year would be approximately 29.7%, in line with 2020. The other elements of our guidance remain the same as the prior guide. Let me remind you of some of those assumptions. 
We've not included any operational benefits in 2021 from the acquisition of PPD. When we get more clarity on the actual close date, we'll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2021. 
We expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $510 million. As a reminder, included within that number is $40 million or $0.10 to adjusted EPS as a placeholder for prefinancing for the PPD transaction. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. 
Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in Q1, $1.4 billion for completed M&A and $400 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We estimate the full year average diluted share count will be 397 million shares. 
Finally, I wanted to touch on phasing of revenue dollars and adjusted EPS for the remainder of the year. When I think about the split of the second half P&L between Q3 and Q4, we're assuming that the results will be slightly weighted to Q4. As you think about that split, remember the placeholder for PPD financing is all in Q4. 
To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter, and we're in a great position to achieve our 2021 goals as we move into the second half of the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf."

So testing volumes, they're slowing but still robust. What I'm curious about is, as we move into -- towards the fall, are you seeing these labs move more into 4-in-1 testing? And then I guess, beyond that, is there any move towards broader infectious disease testing at these sites? Because I think that would help us as we think about the durability of what's occurred in that category. 
And then the other one, I just want to sneak in for Stephen. COVID-19 revenue has clearly been a boon to operating margin. That said, underlying margin seems to be tracking quite nicely.

When I think about the COVID testing demand and what we're seeing, what I would say is we obviously have built -- we've had and have built during the pandemic a huge installed base around the world, right? 
It's -- for us, the activities we do across all of the countries is the huge driver of our activity. And so a lot of what we read about is what's going on in the U.S. And in the U.S., testing demand is definitely less at this moment, although obviously, cases are starting to increase, but there's quite a bit of demand around the world. And certain customers are preparing for a respiratory panel for the winter season. And obviously, we'll have that. And we're going to support our customers for whatever level of demand that they need. 
In terms of margins, I'll make it sort of what's the philosophy -- and then Stephen, if you want to add, feel free -- which is we're not thinking about it base business versus COVID. We're thinking about how do we manage the company appropriately in terms of the profitability of the company and the investment grade for the going-forward. 
I think one of the things that -- if you kind of do very simple math, and I'll do it from an EPS perspective, right, we raised our -- based on the very strong outlook for the year and the very strong first half, we raised our EPS by $0.10 in the guidance. We chose to invest another $0.25 in our colleagues, right? The $100 million in the Q2 additional payment is an investment in the future, right? So we made a conscious decision. Obviously, margins are very strong, and we'll manage that appropriately. It really highlights the power of our PPI Business System."

In terms of capital deployment, first of all, it's been an active year, right, between -- and I'll give you an update on PPD in a minute, but it's been an active year. We obviously announced PPD. We've done a number of smaller bolt-on transactions. So we've been active. 
Our pipeline is quite busy, right? We're looking at things. We're disciplined. And because our industry is so large and fragmented, we're seeing ample opportunities to continue to build on our M&A strategy and execute against that. And so from that perspective, things are good. 
From a return of capital perspective, we felt the $2 billion that we did in terms of buybacks and the increase in the dividend felt like the right return given the M&A commitments we've made to PPD. And we certainly revisit our return of capital mix with our Board periodically, and we'll continue to do so. But right now, we continue to have M&A as the primary focus. 
PPD, I'll spend a moment there because it's a large commitment of capital. I've been super impressed with the team, gotten to get to meet a number of the team because of the integration planning. It's going very smoothly. Colleagues are very excited to become part of the company. 
As you see from some of the other companies in the CRO field that are reporting, the end markets are super good. The industry is doing well as PPD as a leader is very well positioned. So this is going to be a really good growth asset. From the pathway to closure of the transaction, we've got most of the direct investment, the foreign investment approvals done. We've got a little bit left to do there, but that's pretty much done. 
We're working our way through the various antitrust filings around the world. We're collaborating with the FTC on second request, and we're looking forward to closing the transaction by the end of the year. So that's a quick recap on capital performance."

Yes, and the revenue assumptions are -- remain the same as where they were last quarter. So from that perspective, very positive. 
And when I look at the Orbitrap, what a phenomenal technology, continues to drive very good growth for our Analytical Instruments business, super relevant for our customers. And we're able to continually push the technology forward to bring out more and more relevant solutions. 
The most recent launch really is focused on complex small molecule analysis, but you're also finding the technology being used in the multi-attribute method for biologics in terms of QA/QC, which is a very large market opportunity, and we're well positioned there. So I feel great about performance of our chroma-mass spec business and even more excited about what the future holds there as well. 
So Puneet, thank you for the questions. And I'll turn to just wrapping it up here. 
We really had an excellent first half of the year. We're on track to deliver another outstanding year, and we're going to enter 2022 with great momentum that sets us up for a very bright future.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call. We delivered another outstanding quarter, achieving exceptional financial performance while continuing to effectively execute our growth strategy to make Thermo Fisher Scientific an even stronger partner for our customers. 
As I reflect on the year so far, 3 things -- Our proven growth strategy powered by our PPI business system is driving outstanding financial performance; our base business is performing very well, and we are playing a leading role in our industry's response to COVID-19; and we continue to build on our trusted partner status with innovative new products and expanded capabilities to further enhance our unique customer value proposition. All of this gives me great confidence in a very bright future as we continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. I will get into more detail on these in my remarks later. But first, let me recap the financials. 
Our revenue in Q3 increased to $9.33 billion, growing 9% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $2.78 billion, and our adjusted operating margin was 29.8% for the quarter. Finally, we increased adjusted EPS by 2% to $5.76 per share. So another outstanding quarter. 
Turning to our end markets. In Q3, market conditions were strong, and our team executed well to deliver another fantastic quarter. Starting with pharma and biotech.  We continue to have outstanding performance in this end market with growth of just over 20%, driven once again by strong market dynamics our unique customer value proposition and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in supporting COV19 vaccines and therapies. 
Our trusted partner status earned over many years with these customers continues to drive robust growth. In this end market, we saw broad-based strength including in our bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter with very good growth in Biosciences and the research and safety market channel. 
Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the mid-teens. In Q3, we had particularly strong growth in our electron microscopy business and in the research and safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and health care, we declined 11%. Performance in our base business was strong driven by immunodiagnostics, clinical diagnostics and transplant diagnostics. The team also executed very well to support customers' COVID-19 testing needs, delivering $1.55 billion of revenue this quarter versus $1.8 billion in Q3 last year. 
Before I move on to our growth strategy, let me provide a few comments on our industry-leading role in the pandemic response. In the quarter, we generated $2.05 billion in COVID-19 response-related revenue. With the surge in the Delta variant, we saw strong testing demand around the world in Q3. We also played a very meaningful role in vaccines and therapies for COVID-19, generating just over $500 million in the quarter from these activities. The underlying demand for our product and service offerings used in the production and development of vaccines is very robust, and over time, we expect this demand to transition to non-COVID revenue. 
Our industry-leading response to the pandemic has enabled us to accelerate our growth strategy, strengthening customer relationships and accelerate investments which contributed to our ability to raise our long-term core organic growth guidance to 7% to 9% as we communicated at our recent Investor Day. 
Let me now give you an update on our growth strategy, which consists of 3 elements: continuously developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me provide a few examples of how we're delivering on our growth strategy. Starting with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enabling our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs and make the world a better place. In our genetic sciences business, we launched the Applied Biosystems' QuantStudio Absolute digital PCR system. This is the first fully integrated digital PCR system featuring simplified workflows and designed to provide highly accurate results in only 90 minutes. This system will help advance our customers' innovation efforts in areas like oncology and cell and gene therapy. 
In chromatography and mass cytometry, we launched 3 new Thermo Scientific TSQ Plus Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometers to address the growing need for faster throughput and increased sensitivity across a range of applications in biopharma and applied settings, including clinical research for larger small molecules, toxicology, food safety and environmental analysis. We also launched the Thermo Scientific Vanquish Neo UHPLC system and the Thermo Fisher Scientific PepMap Neo UHPLC Columns designed for use in proteomics, precision medicine and translational research. 
Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers in high-growth and emerging markets. This has contributed to the excellent performance we are delivering across Asia Pacific, where we delivered growth in the low double digits during the quarter. We continue to build our presence and capabilities in the region. During the quarter, we opened a bioprocess design center in South Korea. This facility features laboratory and educational space and more than 100 instruments that support pharmaceutical research and manufacturing processes. This center will help our pharma and biotech customers advance their important work. 
Our performance across the region demonstrates that we're creating a differentiated experience for our customers and the significant investments we've made in these markets are fueling growth. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition, and we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers to help them achieve their goals faster and more efficiently. As I mentioned last quarter, we're executing on over $2.5 billion in CapEx this year. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. 
Building our pharma services capabilities in Q3, we brought additional capacity online to support vaccine and therapy production. And as part of the previously announced strategic partnership with CSL Limited, we assumed operating responsibility for a new state-of-the-art biologics site in Lengnau, Switzerland. This site will feature highly flexible bioproduction technologies, including single-use and stainless steel to provide a pathway from development to large-scale production as customers' needs evolve. 
To support growing demand in the biopharmaceutical industry, we now have plans to open a new bioproduction facility in Nashville, Tennessee to manufacture single-use technologies. The facility will be one of our largest SUT sites in the world. In addition to support disease research and diagnostic testing, we announced our commitment to co-invest with the U.S. government in building the state-of-the-art facility to manufacture pipette tips. The new facility will be located in North Carolina and designed in line with Thermo Fisher Scientific's carbon neutrality goals. These investments in our value proposition demonstrate our commitment to our customers who rely on us as an essential partner in network. 
Now let me give you a brief update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined strategy for capital deployment, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, we are super excited for our acquisition of PPD. The business is performing well. The regulatory process is on track, and we expect to close by year-end. As a reminder, PPD will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in attractive and high-growth clinical research services industry and add highly complementary services for our fastest-growing end market. Integration planning is going very well, financing is largely complete, and we're looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher later this year. 
Before I turn to our guidance, let me update you on the progress we're making on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in service science, we know we have the responsibility to use our industry leadership position to make the world a better place. And to that end, we continue to advance our sustainability and social impact initiatives. 
During the quarter, we committed to expand our use of ACT product labeling to include our entire cold storage portfolio by the end of the year. ACT labeling clearly details the environmental impact of the product empowering our customers to make sustainable choices and ultimately helping them achieve their own goals for environmental stewardship. 
Our 90,000 colleagues are also passionate about the difference they can make, and our local site-based community action council support a number of charitable and STEM education activities throughout the year. We have amplified and supported our efforts by investing an additional $15 million in our foundation for science. And we continue to support the historically black colleges and universities to deliver accurate COVID testing to students and staff, helping to ensure campus safety and the ability to confidently deliver in-person learning. 
With that, I'd like to review our guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. As you saw in our press release, we are raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. This increase is a result of our strong Q3 operational performance in our base business and the continued strength of our  COVID-19 response revenue. We're raising our revenue guidance by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion, which would result in 15% revenue growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by $1.30 to $23.37 per share, which represents 20% growth year-over-year. The 2022 guidance raise reflects the increased outlook for the core business and add to the very strong outlook that we shared with you at our Investor Day. 
We're raising our 2022 full year revenue guidance by $200 million to $40.5 billion and increasing our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.20 to $21.36. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q3. We executed very well to continue our growth momentum and deliver excellent revenue and earnings performance. Our business is performing very well, and we continue to play a leading role in the pandemic response. We continue to expand our trusted partner status with innovative new products and expanded capabilities to further enhance our customer value proposition.  And our exceptional performance through the third quarter enabled us to raise our outlook for the year and sets us off for an even broader future. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with a quick reminder about the definition of core business. This is a term we introduced at our recent Investor Day. Core includes our base busines",2154,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with a quick reminder about the definition of core business. This is a term we introduced at our recent Investor Day. Core includes our base business and the vaccines and therapies response revenue and post close, it will also include the PPD acquisition. 
So moving on to the details of Q3. It was another excellent quarter. Let me provide a high-level view of how the quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call in July. We had a broad-based beat versus the prior guide. Revenue was $1.2 billion higher, driven by $900 million higher testing response revenue, $250 million higher core business revenue and $50 million more favorable core FX. On our last earnings call, our guidance derisked testing response revenue, and we said that if there were any additional opportunities to support customers' testing needs, we'll be ready to do so and flow the benefits through our P&L. That's exactly what we did in Q3. In total, delivering $1.55 billion of testing response revenue in the quarter. 
We also had a great strength in the core business. In Q3,  the base business organic growth was 10%, which is 3% or $190 million higher than included in our prior guide. Also in the core, vaccines and therapies response revenue was $60 million higher than in that prior guide and was $510 million for the quarter. So excellent momentum on the top line. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate excellent pull-through on the very strong top line performance. And at the same time, execute really well and have significant growth investments. And as a result, adjusted EPS in Q3 was $1.30 higher than included in our prior guide.  And the component of this overachievement are $1 from testing response revenue, $0.20 from the core business and $0.10 from FX on the base business. Overall, another excellent quarter. 
Let me now provide some color on our Q3 performance. Beginning with our Q3 earnings results. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 2% to $5.76. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.79, down 1% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our Q3 reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increase included 7% organic growth, a tailwind of 1% from foreign exchange and 1% contribution from acquisitions. As I mentioned, the baseline organic growth in the quarter was 10%. 
Tuning to our performance by geography during the quarter. North America was flat, Europe grew over 20%, Asia Pacific grew low double digits. China grew in the low single digits and rest of the world declined in the high single digits. The organic growth rates by geo are skewed by the response revenue in the current and prior quarters as well as the scale of the impact of the pandemic on the base business in the prior year. 
Since our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 29.8%, 310 basis points lower than Q3 last year. In the quarter, our PPI business system enabled us to deliver strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and the ongoing strategic investments across our businesses, including investments in our colleagues. All of these are being made to support our near- and long-term growth. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 51.4%, 90 basis points lower than Q3 last year. The decrease in gross margin has similar drivers to those I just mentioned for our adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, an increase of 190 basis points versus Q3 2020. Total R&D expense was approximately $350 million, representing growth of 19% versus Q3 2020 and reflects our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. 
Looking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $119 million, $17 million lower than Q3 last year, largely due to lower average interest rates on our debt. Adjusted other income and expense was net income in the quarter of $9 million, $7 million higher in Q3 2020, mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.2%, down 150 basis points versus Q3 last year due to the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were $397 million in Q3, $2 million lower year-over-year, driven by the share repurchases net of option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. The cash flow performance enabled by our PPI Business System continued to be very strong. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $6.9 billion, up 38% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $5.2 billion, up 27% from the same period last year, and that's after investing $1.7 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong returns we're generating in the short term and the investments we're making for the long term. 
We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects an 18% dividend increase we announced in February. And during the quarter, we issued $3.1 billion in new debt as part of the prefinancing for the PPD acquisition. We ended Q3 with $12 billion in cash and $21.7 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.6x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 0.7x on a net debt basis. 
Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 22.3%, up 740 basis points from Q3 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns.  
I'll now provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Similar to last quarter, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impact of COVID-19 response in our segments. From a revenue standpoint,  as was the case in the past quarters, the majority of our COVID-19 response revenue was recognized in Life Sciences Solutions, with the remainder recognized in Laboratory Products and Services and Specialty Diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment but that does skew some of the reported segment margins. 
Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in the segment increased 9% and organic growth was 4%. In the quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and Bioappliances businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 48.9%, down 600 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw positive volume leverage, which is more than offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 11% in Q3 and organic growth was 9%. Growth in the segment this quarter was driven by electromicroscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 54% and adjusted margin was 17.8%, up 500 basis points year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we delivered very strong volume pull-through and productivity, which is partially offset by the strategic investments we're making across thse segments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q3, reported revenue decreased by 5% and the segment declined organically by 5%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in our immunodiagnostics, clinical diagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses, which is offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased 22% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 22.7%, down 520 basis points from the prior year. 
In Q3, we drove positive productivity, enabled by our PPI Business System. This is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments in the quarter. Finally, in the Barge Products and Services segment. Q3 reported revenue increased 12% and organic growth was 10%. In the quarter, we saw very strong growth in all of our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 11%, which is 40 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove good volume pull-through and productivity by our PPI business system, which is more than offset by strategic investments. 
With that, let me now turn to our updated guidance. And as Marc mentioned, we're increasing full year guidance for both 2021 and 2022. For 2021, we're banking the Q3 beat and maintaining our prior guidance assumptions for Q4. Then for 2022, we're carrying over the base business and vaccines and therapies beat from Q3 '21 into the 2022 full year numbers. This is enabling a strong beaten raise for both years, reflecting the continued excellent strength of the business. Let me now provide you with a more detailed study with 2021. In terms of revenue, we're raising our full year '21 guidance by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion and increasing our full year organic growth outlook from 9% to 12%. That includes an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full year from 12% to 13% and an increase  in the COVID-19 response revenue for the year from $6.7 billion to $7.7 billion, which represents $5.8 billion of testing response revenue and $1.9 billion of vaccines and therapies response revenue. 
As I mentioned previously, there are no changes in the revenue assumptions for Q4 and our revised 2021 guidance. We're continuing the same derisked approach to guidance for COVID-19 testing response revenue and continue to assume $450 million of testing-related revenue in Q4. There continues to be a range of outcomes for testing in the fourth quarter and for 2022. There are scenarios where testing demand could be higher than that included in our guidance. Should that be the case, we'll be well positioned to support customer needs -- And as we did in Q3, we will flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a derisked approach to the outlook. And as a reminder, there are 4 fewer selling days in Q4 '21 and versus the same period last year. 
Incorporating our very strong Q3 performance into the revised '21 guidance, we now expect that adjusted operating margin for the full year will be approximately 30.4%, 70 basis points higher than both our prior guide and 2020. Then in terms of adjusted EPS by banking the Q3 beat, we're raising our full year '21 adjusted EPS guidance by $1.30 to $23.37, which would result in 20% growth over 2020. The revised guidance assumes an adjusted income tax rate of 14.3% in 2021, slightly higher than the prior guide to reflect the marginal tax rate and our increased profitability. The rest of the assumptions underlying the 2021 guidance remain the same. And to call out a few of those, we've not included any operational benefit in 2021 for the acquisition of PPD, which is assumed to close at the end of the year. We expect full year net interest costs to be approximately $510 million. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. 
Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks, $1.4 billion of completed M&A and $400 million of capital return to shareholders through dividends. And we estimate the full year average diluted share count will be 397 million shares. 
Now moving on to the 2022 guidance range. As I mentioned, we're carrying over the base business and facing from therapy per of Q3 '21 into the 2022 full year numbers. In terms of revenue, we're raising our full year 2022 guidance by $200 million to $40.5 billion. That reflects a $250 million increase in core revenue, offset partially by $50 million less FX tailwind for the year. The guidance for 2022 continues to assume core organic growth of 8% and $750 million of testing response revenue for the year. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our full year 2022 guidance by $0.20 to $21.36. And as Marc mentioned, the 2022 guidance increase reflects the increased strength of our core business, adding to the already very strong outlook for 2022 that I shared with you at the recent Investor Day.

We obviously entered the fourth quarter with very strong performance. As I look at the look at the outlook for Q4, first of all, we thought it was prudent to keep it the same that we did last quarter. There's nothing particularly deep about that. We have 4 less selling days. So when you look at the base business results, it's very similar, right? It implies about 9% growth, about 5% reported and you had about 4 points for the day. 
So you are about 9% growth. So very similar to what you saw in Q3. And when you look at the other part of core, which is the vaccine and therapy numbers, similar levels of revenue to what you saw in Q3 there. So we thought that was a prudent view. On the testing response, we kept the derisked number. We're obviously going to shift whatever our customers need and if you think about sort of the true visibility is for testing response, right, which is we derisked at the end of July. And by the time we got into August, the Delta variant had created huge demand for testing. So we feel like a 450 number is we have an incredibly high likelihood of achieving and we'll obviously ship meaningful work than that if customers need it, right? So that's how we thought about it. And as we talk about 2022, we carry forward the core revenue beat into the year. And as we sit here at the end of January, when we give our full year -- final guidance for the year, we'll look at what is the right level of assumptions and make adjustments as appropriate."

And then reviewing what's going on with our local team, conditions actually continue to be good, and the government is focused on some of the initiatives that would drive strong long-term growth, the focus on biotech industry and food safety, those kinds of things.

As I think about Q3, there was no material impact in our results based on supply chain challenges.  The areas that you see them there being managed things like freight and logistics, delivery times a little bit slower. So you have things like that, that you have to manage through.

There's obviously certain aspects of our response on the testing side that will have some level of durability, but it's a relatively modest number compared to the billions of dollars of COV-19 PPCR test and sample products that we provided.  The areas that you would expect to have long longevity is going to be the increased installed base of QPCR instruments and sample prep instruments, which will get repurposed for other testing. 
We've obviously developed respiratory panels as well. So likely for the future, you'll see some level of people presenting with an upper respiratory infection. And doctors will want to know whether it's COVID or flu or RSV. So you'll have some of that duration. And customer feedback on the as the biotech technology, super positive as turning to a large customer a couple of days ago, and they did a head-to-head versus some other technologies and basically said the users just love it and are excited about working on developing a broader menu over time as well. So those are some of the things that will increase our share of business post-COVID or more endemic COVID base.

I think one of the things that maybe investors don't have 100% understanding of, if you think about what the company looks like upon close of PPD, we have about $20 billion of revenue serving pharmaceutical and biotech.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call. We delivered another outstanding quarter, achieving exceptional financial performance while continuing to effectively execute our growth strategy to make Thermo Fisher Scientific an even stronger partner for our customers. 
As I reflect on the year so far, 3 things -- Our proven growth strategy powered by our PPI business system is driving outstanding financial performance; our base business is performing very well, and we are playing a leading role in our industry's response to COVID-19; and we continue to build on our trusted partner status with innovative new products and expanded capabilities to further enhance our unique customer value proposition. All of this gives me great confidence in a very bright future as we continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. I will get into more detail on these in my remarks later. But first, let me recap the financials. 
Our revenue in Q3 increased to $9.33 billion, growing 9% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $2.78 billion, and our adjusted operating margin was 29.8% for the quarter. Finally, we increased adjusted EPS by 2% to $5.76 per share. So another outstanding quarter. 
Turning to our end markets. In Q3, market conditions were strong, and our team executed well to deliver another fantastic quarter. Starting with pharma and biotech.  We continue to have outstanding performance in this end market with growth of just over 20%, driven once again by strong market dynamics our unique customer value proposition and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in supporting COV19 vaccines and therapies. 
Our trusted partner status earned over many years with these customers continues to drive robust growth. In this end market, we saw broad-based strength including in our bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter with very good growth in Biosciences and the research and safety market channel. 
Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the mid-teens. In Q3, we had particularly strong growth in our electron microscopy business and in the research and safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and health care, we declined 11%. Performance in our base business was strong driven by immunodiagnostics, clinical diagnostics and transplant diagnostics. The team also executed very well to support customers' COVID-19 testing needs, delivering $1.55 billion of revenue this quarter versus $1.8 billion in Q3 last year. 
Before I move on to our growth strategy, let me provide a few comments on our industry-leading role in the pandemic response. In the quarter, we generated $2.05 billion in COVID-19 response-related revenue. With the surge in the Delta variant, we saw strong testing demand around the world in Q3. We also played a very meaningful role in vaccines and therapies for COVID-19, generating just over $500 million in the quarter from these activities. The underlying demand for our product and service offerings used in the production and development of vaccines is very robust, and over time, we expect this demand to transition to non-COVID revenue. 
Our industry-leading response to the pandemic has enabled us to accelerate our growth strategy, strengthening customer relationships and accelerate investments which contributed to our ability to raise our long-term core organic growth guidance to 7% to 9% as we communicated at our recent Investor Day. 
Let me now give you an update on our growth strategy, which consists of 3 elements: continuously developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me provide a few examples of how we're delivering on our growth strategy. Starting with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enabling our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs and make the world a better place. In our genetic sciences business, we launched the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Absolute Q Digital PCR System. This is the first fully integrated digital PCR System featuring simplified workflows and designed to provide highly accurate results in only 90 minutes. This system will help advance our customers' innovation efforts in areas like oncology and cell and gene therapy. 
In chromatography and mass cytometry, we launched 3 new Thermo Scientific TSQ Plus Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometers to address the growing need for faster throughput and increased sensitivity across a range of applications in biopharma and applied settings, including clinical research for larger small molecules, toxicology, food safety and environmental analysis. We also launched the Thermo Scientific Vanquish Neo UHPLC system and the Thermo Fisher Scientific PepMap Neo UHPLC Columns designed for use in proteomics, precision medicine and translational research. 
Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers in high-growth and emerging markets. This has contributed to the excellent performance we are delivering across Asia Pacific, where we delivered growth in the low double digits during the quarter. We continue to build our presence and capabilities in the region. During the quarter, we opened a bioprocess design center in South Korea. This facility features laboratory and educational space and more than 100 instruments that support pharmaceutical research and manufacturing processes. This center will help our pharma and biotech customers advance their important work. 
Our performance across the region demonstrates that we're creating a differentiated experience for our customers and the significant investments we've made in these markets are fueling growth. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition, and we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers to help them achieve their goals faster and more efficiently. As I mentioned last quarter, we're executing on over $2.5 billion in CapEx this year. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. 
Building our pharma services capabilities in Q3, we brought additional capacity online to support vaccine and therapy production. And as part of the previously announced strategic partnership with CSL Limited, we assumed operating responsibility for a new state-of-the-art biologics site in Lengnau, Switzerland. This site will feature highly flexible bioproduction technologies, including single-use and stainless steel to provide a pathway from development to large-scale production as customers' needs evolve. 
To support growing demand in the biopharmaceutical industry, we now have plans to open a new bioproduction facility in Nashville, Tennessee to manufacture single-use technologies. The facility will be one of our largest SUT sites in the world. In addition to support disease research and diagnostic testing, we announced our commitment to co-invest with the U.S. government in building the state-of-the-art facility to manufacture pipette tips. The new facility will be located in North Carolina and designed in line with Thermo Fisher Scientific's carbon neutrality goals. These investments in our value proposition demonstrate our commitment to our customers who rely on us as an essential partner in network. 
Now let me give you a brief update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined strategy for capital deployment, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, we are super excited for our acquisition of PPD. The business is performing well. The regulatory process is on track, and we expect to close by year-end. As a reminder, PPD will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in attractive and high-growth clinical research services industry and add highly complementary services for our fastest-growing end market. Integration planning is going very well, financing is largely complete, and we're looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher later this year. 
Before I turn to our guidance, let me update you on the progress we're making on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in service science, we know we have the responsibility to use our industry leadership position to make the world a better place. And to that end, we continue to advance our sustainability and social impact initiatives. 
During the quarter, we committed to expand our use of ACT product labeling to include our entire cold storage portfolio by the end of the year. ACT labeling clearly details the environmental impact of the product empowering our customers to make sustainable choices and ultimately helping them achieve their own goals for environmental stewardship. 
Our 90,000 colleagues are also passionate about the difference they can make, and our local site-based community action council support a number of charitable and STEM education activities throughout the year. We have amplified and supported our efforts by investing an additional $15 million in our foundation for science. And we continue to support the historically black colleges and universities to deliver accurate COVID testing to students and staff, helping to ensure campus safety and the ability to confidently deliver in-person learning. 
With that, I'd like to review our guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. As you saw in our press release, we are raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. This increase is a result of our strong Q3 operational performance in our base business and the continued strength of our  COVID-19 response revenue. We're raising our revenue guidance by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion, which would result in 15% revenue growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by $1.30 to $23.37 per share, which represents 20% growth year-over-year. The 2022 guidance raise reflects the increased outlook for the core business and add to the very strong outlook that we shared with you at our Investor Day. 
We're raising our 2022 full year revenue guidance by $200 million to $40.5 billion and increasing our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.20 to $21.36. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q3. We executed very well to continue our growth momentum and deliver excellent revenue and earnings performance. Our business is performing very well, and we continue to play a leading role in the pandemic response. We continue to expand our trusted partner status with innovative new products and expanded capabilities to further enhance our customer value proposition.  And our exceptional performance through the third quarter enabled us to raise our outlook for the year and sets us off for an even broader future. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with a quick reminder about the definition of core business. This is a term we introduced at our recent Investor Day. Core includes our base business and the vaccines and therapies response revenue and post close, it will also include the PPD acquisition. 
So moving on to the details of Q3. It was another excellent quarter. Let me provide a high-level view of how the quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call in July. We had a broad-based beat versus the prior guide. Revenue was $1.2 billion higher, driven by $900 million higher testing response revenue, $250 million higher core business revenue and $50 million more favorable core FX. On our last earnings call, our guidance derisked testing response revenue, and we said that if there were any additional opportunities to support customers' testing needs, we'll be ready to do so and flow the benefits through our P&L. That's exactly what we did in Q3. In total, delivering $1.55 billion of testing response revenue in the quarter. 
We also had a great strength in the core business. In Q3,  the base business organic growth was 10%, which is 3% or $190 million higher than included in our prior guide. Also in the core, vaccines and therapies response revenue was $60 million higher than in that prior guide and was $510 million for the quarter. So excellent momentum on the top line. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate excellent pull-through on the very strong top line performance. And at the same time, execute really well and have significant growth investments. And as a result, adjusted EPS in Q3 was $1.30 higher than included in our prior guide.  And the component of this overachievement are $1 from testing response revenue, $0.20 from the core business and $0.10 from FX on the base business. Overall, another excellent quarter. 
Let me now provide some color on our Q3 performance. Beginning with our Q3 earnings results. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 2% to $5.76. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.79, down 1% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our Q3 reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increase included 7% organic growth, a tailwind of 1% from foreign exchange and 1% contribution from acquisitions. As I mentioned, the baseline organic growth in the quarter was 10%. 
Turning to our performance by geography during the quarter. North America was flat, Europe grew over 20%, Asia Pacific grew low double digits. China grew in the low single digits and rest of the world declined in the high single digits. The organic growth rates by geo are skewed by the response revenue in the current and prior quarters as well as the scale of the impact of the pandemic on the base business in the prior year. 
Since our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 29.8%, 310 basis points lower than Q3 last year. In the quarter, our PPI business system enabled us to deliver strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and the ongoing strategic investments across our businesses, including investments in our colleagues. All of these are being made to support our near- and long-term growth. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 51.4%, 90 basis points lower than Q3 last year. The decrease in gross margin has similar drivers to those I just mentioned for our adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, an increase of 190 basis points versus Q3 2020. Total R&D expense was approximately $350 million, representing growth of 19% versus Q3 2020 and reflects our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. 
Looking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $119 million, $17 million lower than Q3 last year, largely due to lower average interest rates on our debt. Adjusted other income and expense was net income in the quarter of $9 million, $7 million higher in Q3 2020, mainly due to changes in nonoperating FX. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.2%, down 150 basis points versus Q3 last year due to the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were $397 million in Q3, $2 million lower year-over-year, driven by the share repurchases net of option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. The cash flow performance enabled by our PPI Business System continued to be very strong. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $6.9 billion, up 38% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $5.2 billion, up 27% from the same period last year, and that's after investing $1.7 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong returns we're generating in the short term and the investments we're making for the long term. 
We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects an 18% dividend increase we announced in February. And during the quarter, we issued $3.1 billion in new debt as part of the prefinancing for the PPD acquisition. We ended Q3 with $12 billion in cash and $21.7 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.6x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 0.7x on a net debt basis. 
Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 22.3%, up 740 basis points from Q3 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns.  
I'll now provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Similar to last quarter, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impact of COVID-19 response in our segments. From a revenue standpoint,  as was the case in the past quarters, the majority of our COVID-19 response revenue was recognized in Life Sciences Solutions, with the remainder recognized in Laboratory Products and Services and Specialty Diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment but that does skew some of the reported segment margins. 
Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in the segment increased 9% and organic growth was 4%. In the quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and Bioappliances businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 48.9%, down 600 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw positive volume leverage, which is more than offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 11% in Q3 and organic growth was 9%. Growth in the segment this quarter was driven by electromicroscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 54% and adjusted margin was 17.8%, up 500 basis points year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we delivered very strong volume pull-through and productivity, which is partially offset by the strategic investments we're making across thse segments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q3, reported revenue decreased by 5% and the segment declined organically by 5%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in our immunodiagnostics, clinical diagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses, which is offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased 22% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 22.7%, down 520 basis points from the prior year. 
In Q3, we drove positive productivity, enabled by our PPI Business System. This is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments in the quarter. Finally, in the Barge Products and Services segment. Q3 reported revenue increased 12% and organic growth was 10%. In the quarter, we saw very strong growth in all of our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 11%, which is 40 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove good volume pull-through and productivity by our PPI business system, which is more than offset by strategic investments. 
With that, let me now turn to our updated guidance. And as Marc mentioned, we're increasing full year guidance for both 2021 and 2022. For 2021, we're banking the Q3 beat and maintaining our prior guidance assumptions for Q4. Then for 2022, we're carrying over the base business and vaccines and therapies beat from Q3 '21 into the 2022 full year numbers. This is enabling a strong beaten raise for both years, reflecting the continued excellent strength of the business. Let me now provide you with a more detailed study with 2021. In terms of revenue, we're raising our full year '21 guidance by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion and increasing our full year organic growth outlook from 9% to 12%. That includes an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full year from 12% to 13% and an increase  in the COVID-19 response revenue for the year from $6.7 billion to $7.7 billion, which represents $5.8 billion of testing response revenue and $1.9 billion of vaccines and therapies response revenue. 
As I mentioned previously, there are no changes in the revenue assumptions for Q4 and our revised 2021 guidance. We're continuing the same derisked approach to guidance for COVID-19 testing response revenue and continue to assume $450 million of testing-related revenue in Q4. There continues to be a range of outcomes for testing in the fourth quarter and for 2022. There are scenarios where testing demand could be higher than that included in our guidance. Should that be the case, we'll be well positioned to support customer needs -- And as we did in Q3, we will flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a derisked approach to the outlook. And as a reminder, there are 4 fewer selling days in Q4 '21 and versus the same period last year. 
Incorporating our very strong Q3 performance into the revised '21 guidance, we now expect that adjusted operating margin for the full year will be approximately 30.4%, 70 basis points higher than both our prior guide and 2020. Then in terms of adjusted EPS by banking the Q3 beat, we're raising our full year '21 adjusted EPS guidance by $1.30 to $23.37, which would result in 20% growth over 2020. The revised guidance assumes an adjusted income tax rate of 14.3% in 2021, slightly higher than the prior guide to reflect the marginal tax rate and our increased profitability. The rest of the assumptions underlying the 2021 guidance remain the same. And to call out a few of those, we've not included any operational benefit in 2021 for the acquisition of PPD, which is assumed to close at the end of the year. We expect full year net interest costs to be approximately $510 million. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. 
Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks, $1.4 billion of completed M&A and $400 million of capital return to shareholders through dividends. And we estimate the full year average diluted share count will be 397 million shares. 
Now moving on to the 2022 guidance range. As I mentioned, we're carrying over the base business and facing from therapy per of Q3 '21 into the 2022 full year numbers. In terms of revenue, we're raising our full year 2022 guidance by $200 million to $40.5 billion. That reflects a $250 million increase in core revenue, offset partially by $50 million less FX tailwind for the year. The guidance for 2022 continues to assume core organic growth of 8% and $750 million of testing response revenue for the year. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our full year 2022 guidance by $0.20 to $21.36. And as Marc mentioned, the 2022 guidance increase reflects the increased strength of our core business, adding to the already very strong outlook for 2022 that I shared with you at the recent Investor Day. 
So to conclude, we're delivering another -- we delivered another excellent quarter, and we're in a great position to achieve both our '21 and 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf."

We obviously entered the fourth quarter with very strong performance. As I look at the look at the outlook for Q4, first of all, we thought it was prudent to keep it the same that we did last quarter. There's nothing particularly deep about that. We have 4 less selling days. So when you look at the base business results, it's very similar, right? It implies about 9% growth, about 5% reported and you had about 4 points for the day. 
So you are about 9% growth. So very similar to what you saw in Q3. And when you look at the other part of core, which is the vaccine and therapy numbers, similar levels of revenue to what you saw in Q3 there. So we thought that was a prudent view. On the testing response, we kept the derisked number. We're obviously going to shift whatever our customers need and if you think about sort of the true visibility is for testing response, right, which is we derisked at the end of July. And by the time we got into August, the Delta variant had created huge demand for testing. So we feel like a 450 number is we have an incredibly high likelihood of achieving and we'll obviously ship meaningful work than that if customers need it, right? So that's how we thought about it. And as we talk about 2022, we carry forward the core revenue beat into the year. And as we sit here at the end of January, when we give our full year -- final guidance for the year, we'll look at what is the right level of assumptions and make adjustments as appropriate."

As I think about Q3, there was no material impact in our results based on supply chain challenges.

The areas that you would expect to have long longevity is going to be the increased installed base of QPCR instruments and sample prep instruments, which will get repurposed for other testing. 
We've obviously developed respiratory panels as well. So likely for the future, you'll see some level of people presenting with an upper respiratory infection. And doctors will want to know whether it's COVID or flu or RSV. So you'll have some of that duration. And customer feedback on the as the biotech technology, super positive as turning to a large customer a couple of days ago, and they did a head-to-head versus some other technologies and basically said the users just love it and are excited about working on developing a broader menu over time as well. So those are some of the things that will increase our share of business post-COVID or more endemic COVID base. And that's a business that we really didn't have pretty pendant I think that's pretty cool. But relative to the $1 billion dollars of revenue, it'll be a more modest number."

And we have really -- we've really focused on ensuring that this is the best place to work. And we've rewarded our teams. 
We talked last quarter about some of the additional compensation actions we've taken. We  continue to do that to recognize the strong performance. We've invested in our facilities, training. We are recognized for world-class development training business things that we continue to focus on. And that really has allowed us to have very, very strong retention of our teams. 
PPD is a very well-run business with a great leadership team that's navigating the environment well, the business is performing very well. There is no disruption to the integration, right? We're literally is lifting it as it is and running it as it is going forward. And over time, we're going to come up with some great new solutions that will make a difference for customers. But this is a growth-oriented customer-oriented patients benefit acquisition. So the feedback that the PPD team that's getting on their colleagues is super positive and super excited, and we're looking forward to the transition to our company on -- in the fourth quarter."
