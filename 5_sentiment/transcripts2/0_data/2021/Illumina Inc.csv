Illumina had a strong finish to 2020, with both revenue and orders setting new records. Fourth quarter revenue of $953 million was up 20% sequentially from the third quarter. Sequencing instruments grew 29% qua",1317,"Thank you, Juliet. Good afternoon, everyone. Illumina had a strong finish to 2020, with both revenue and orders setting new records. Fourth quarter revenue of $953 million was up 20% sequentially from the third quarter. Sequencing instruments grew 29% quarter-over-quarter. We also booked the second highest NovaSeq units during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the August launch of our v1.5 reagents. v1.5 resulted in higher new customer growth, as well as additional HiSeq conversions. 
NovaSeq continues to be the market-leading sequencer as it enters its 5th year since launch. Full year 2020 revenue of $3.2 billion declined 9% year-over-year, with the largest impact in the pandemic in the second quarter. Our business accelerated in the second half of the year, growing 17% compared to the first half. In 2020, we shipped more than 2,000 sequencing systems, setting another record for mid-throughput shipments and added more than 700 new customers, which exceeded our expectation. 
I'd like to share some fourth quarter highlights by platform, starting with our high throughput systems. NovaSeq consumable pull-through was at its highest level of the year at over $1.2 million per instrument. We expect NovaSeq flow-through to continue at pre-pandemic levels of $1.1 million to $1.2 million per year in 2021. The NovaSeq v1.5 reagent introduction is catalyzing a new wave of high throughput customers as a $600 genome became a reality for labs of any size. In fact, over half our NovaSeq system orders in 2020 were to new high throughput customers. This includes customers like Argentina's Ministry of Health, which purchased NovaSeq for infectious disease research. 
v1.5 introduction also accelerated the purchasing time line for [indiscernible], a contract research organization and a new to high throughput customer who plans to use their NovaSeq to support oncology clinical trials. Though v1.5 reagents are also strengthening the economic case for legacy HiSeq customers to upgrade, like the University of Oregon, who is using NovaSeq for large, single cell and epigenetic studies. We ended the year with about 1,000 active HiSeq units. And in 2021, we expect continued HiSeq to NovaSeq adoption among the 320 customers yet to transition. 
Moving to mid throughput, 2020 marked the second consecutive year of record placements, and the mid- throughput segment continues to provide durable growth in our core business. Fourth quarter strength was primarily driven by the successful launches of NextSeq 1000 and 2000, which also drove an increase in mid throughput consumables revenue for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect continued NextSeq expansion in 2021, particularly in the clinical segment. Notably, we received NMPA approval in China for NextSeqDx, driving demand in local hospital and applications like oncology and infectious disease testing. We expect this approval to drive NextSeqDx placements and further increase our clinical presence in 2021. 
We added more than 500 new low throughput customers in 2020, bringing our total to more than 6,100 customers worldwide. Our platforms hold the largest set of flow cell configurations and enable the most expansive set of supported methods with run times as fast as 5 hours. In the fourth quarter, we had record low throughput consumable revenue, driven by customers like invite of products in development using MiSeqDX. 
I'll now provide updates on our clinical and research and applied segments. Total sequencing consumables revenue of $2 billion was down 2% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on academic and research institutions. By the fourth quarter of 2020, clinical sequencing run rates actually exceeded pre-pandemic levels, and research run rates also returned to normalized pre pandemic volumes. It was great to see how our customers successfully rebounded under these challenging circumstances. More than 43% of our sequencing consumable shipments in 2020 were to clinical customers, which includes testing for oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease. Clinical testing proved durable during the pandemic, with clinical consumables growing about 8% year-over-year to approximately $890 million in 2020. And in the fourth quarter, clinical consumables growth accelerated to over 20% year-over-year. 
In clinical, I'll highlight first the tremendous progress made in market access and reimbursement. We believe recent landmark coverage decisions will drive greater adoption of next-generation sequencing to new levels over the next several years. In oncology, 205 million lives are now covered for tumor-comprehensive genomic profiling in the U.S. and with an increasing number of targeted oncology therapies, we expect CGP to grow to be a $1 billion-plus market by 2026. 
Additionally, Germany recently started covering tumor CGP and whole exome and whole genome for rare and undiagnosed genetic disease without restrictions. This means that 73 million lives will have better access to CGP and whole exome and whole genome testing. 
In reproductive health, with multiple large payers expanding coverage for all pregnancies, we expect an NIPT coverage in the U.S. to exceed 3 million pregnancies by the end of 2021. And finally, whole genome sequencing coverage for genetic disease testing increased tenfold in 2020. And we expect WGS to become the standard of care in genetic disease as awareness and reimbursement continues to grow. 
With these positive reimbursement trends as a backstop, I will now discuss our clinical focus areas in a little more detail. Oncology testing continues to represent approximately 20% of total sequencing consumables, and it grew year-over-year, driven by companies like Garden Health, who expanded its mobile subatomic services to help patients access its [indiscernible] 360 liquid biopsy test during the pandemic. This also includes genomic [indiscernible] in the NHS that adopted NovaSeq comprehensive genomic profiling as a standard of care in the U.K. And oncology centers like Florida Cancer Specialists, a private community oncology and hematology practice with nearly 100 offices throughout Florida. Florida Cancer Specialists purchased multiple NextSeqDx systems in 2020 to run Illumina's Trusight Oncology 500 assay in its new lab. 
Reproductive health represented about 12% of sequencing consumables, with revenue and samples for our end-to-end VeriSeq and ITT solution growing over 20% in 2020. Lastly, about 10% of our sequencing consumables revenue is related to genetic disease testing. Customers continue to choose Illumina's highly accurate and scalable sequencers as their platform of choice in this area. 
For example, the recent collaboration between Wild Cornell Medicine and New York Presbyterian Hospital, in partnership with the New York Genome Center, will use Illumina technology for clinical WGS in carriers like cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. 
Turning to our research and applied segment. Revenue of approximately $1.2 billion represented just under 57% of our sequencing consumable shipments and was lower by about 6% year-over-year as customers were impacted by the pandemic. Research accelerated in the second half, growing 20% compared to the first half as researchers return to their labs. This segment includes research in oncology and genetic disease, as well as population genomic and research initiatives. Our sequencers enabled programs like K-DNA, a large-scale Korean project aiming to sequence 1 million genomes by 2030. A service provider consortium, standardized on Illumina technology won the competitive tender based on NovaSeq superior technical evaluation. The program plans to complete a 7,500 genome Phase I by the end of the year. 
The NHS commenced a phased rollout for whole genome sequencing in the fourth quarter for selected rare disease and cancer patients as part of their routine care. Once this live clinical testing phase is complete, we expect the whole genome sequencing service to further ramp in the Spring. We expect the Olivet program to continue to scale this year. And the NIH anticipates releasing de-identified data from 100,000 sequenced and array genotype samples to its research portal by the end of 2021. 
Finally, as a leading innovator, Illumina remains steadfast in the defense of our intellectual property globally. We received injunctions against BGI for patent infringement in the U.S., Germany, U.K., Spain, Sweden and Finland. We remain confident that our IP portfolio affords strong protection for Illumina's innovation now and well into the future. 
And now I'll turn it over to Sam."

As Francis discussed, we had record fourth quarter revenue that grew slightly year-over-year to $953 million, driven by 1% growth in sequencing, offset by an 8% decline in microarrays. Total sequencing revenue reached a record of $84",1032,"Thank you, Francis. As Francis discussed, we had record fourth quarter revenue that grew slightly year-over-year to $953 million, driven by 1% growth in sequencing, offset by an 8% decline in microarrays. 
Total sequencing revenue reached a record of $846 million, which represented 89% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 and grew 19% sequentially. Sequencing consumables revenue grew 5% compared to the prior year period and 20% sequentially. Sequencing instruments revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and grew 29% sequentially. And sequencing service and other was down 15% compared to the prior year period due to IVD partnership revenue recognized last year. 
Moving to regional results. The Americas revenue grew 14% sequentially. Revenue in the region was 2% lower compared to the prior year quarter, which was primarily driven by onetime technology access fees for an IVD partnership and lower DTC revenue. These items were partially offset by sequencing consumables. The Americas had record sequencing product revenue in the fourth quarter, driven by clinical customers. 
EMEA delivered record revenue of $285 million, representing 34% sequential growth and 2% growth year-over-year, driven by strong instrument revenue from NovaSeq. We also saw certain customers in emerging countries taking their first NovaSeq shipments. 
Greater China grew 16% sequentially and 3% year-over-year to $96 million. And had its highest sequencing instrument revenue quarter since 2017, driven in part by growing demand in hospitals. Subsequent to Q4, we also announced the Sequoia Capital China genomics incubator, which builds on our other incubator efforts in Silicon Valley and the U.K. Together, we will partner with leading entrepreneurs in China to build genomic start-up companies to create breakthrough genomics applications and clinical sequencing solutions. 
Finally, APJ revenue of $77 million was up 24% sequentially and up 5% from the prior year period. For the full year, the region was roughly flat compared to 2019 with full year growth in sequencing consumables. 
Moving to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders. 
As expected, non-GAAP gross margin of 66.9% decreased approximately 50 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was down 330 basis points, primarily due to a onetime inventory write-down in Q4, onetime IVD partnership revenue in the year ago quarter and higher freight costs related to COVID-19. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $439 million were up $74 million sequentially, as expected, reflecting the extra week in the fourth quarter variable compensation expenses and other investments. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.9%, down from 21.4% in the third quarter. Non-GAAP other income of $20 million was $13 million higher sequentially due to gains on short-term investments sold as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition. 
The non-GAAP tax rate of 18.4% was up from last quarter due to a discrete charge related to a tax structure initiative in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase of our tax rate in Q4 was also impacted by discrete tax benefits in the third quarter of 2020 related to prior year return adjustments. 
For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net income was $257 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $179 million or $1.22 per diluted share. 
Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $406 million. DSO of 50 days compared to 53 days last quarter, driven by revenue linearity. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $62 million, and free cash flow was $344 million. We repurchased $280 million of stock in the fourth quarter. 
We ended the year with approximately $3.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 147 million. 
Moving now to 2021 guidance. We expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 17% to 20% or $3.79 billion to $3.89 billion, representing an increase of approximately $599 million at the midpoint. For the full year of 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 20%. This includes sequencing consumable growth of around 20%. We expect sequencing system revenue to grow 33% year-over-year, driven by placements of NovaSeq due to continued HiSeq conversions and the adoption of v1.5 reagents as well as placements of NextSeq due to NextSeq 2000 and DX demand and a rate to grow approximately 5% and compared to 2020. 
We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to modestly improve from 2020, reflecting increased leverage from higher volumes and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by product mix and IVD partnership revenue in the first quarter of 2020. We expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 24%. As volumes increase and freight charges normalize, we expect both gross and operating margins to improve in the second half of 2021 and be above the full year average. We expect other income to be about $40 million lower than 2020 due to the gains in the fourth quarter of 2020, lower interest rates and shorter duration investments in anticipation of the close of the GRAIL acquisition. 
We expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.76 to $5.01 and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.10 to $5.35. And we expect diluted shares outstanding in 2021 to be approximately 147 million. 
Moving to the first quarter of 2021, we  are raising our previous expectations. And we now expect high single-digit revenue growth compared to the first quarter of 2020. We expect sequential improvement in non-GAAP gross margin, sequential decline in non-GAAP operating expenses similar to historical seasonality, non-GAAP other income to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the onetime gain on short-term investments previously discussed. And as a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. 
I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks."

We're seeing strength in our core business and are playing an essential role in the emerging surveillance effort necessary to fight the pandemic. In the past couple of months, as new, more dangerous SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, there has been a growing recognition of the need for COVID surveillance around the globe, with countries like the U.K., Australia, Canada and Germany leading the way in deploying national surveillance infrastructures. 
In the U.S. The proposed budget package contains $1.75 billion for the CDC to conduct, expand and improve activities to sequence genomes, identify mutations and survey the transmission of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. 
Sequencing-based surveillance is one of the key elements in the fight against this pandemic. And it's also becoming clear that sequencing and surveillance are becoming mainstream in the defense against infectious disease. This global surveillance infrastructure being built right now will be instrumental in identifying future outbreaks, including coronaviruses, antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. Illumina is proud to be at the forefront of this important work. 
We'd also like to congratulate Nobel Laureate and Illumina Board member, Dr. Frances Arnold, who was named as co-Chair of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors in Science and Technology. We believe the recent appointment of highly experienced scientists signal the administration's focus on science, including genomics, to improve life in the U.S. for everyone. 
Finally, we continue to expect to close the GRAIL acquisition in the second half of this year, enabling us to help accelerate the adoption of early cancer detection screening and opening up the largest application for Genomics by far. We're looking forward to GRAIL launching gallery in Q2. 
We see a vast number of opportunities ahead of us. And there has never been a more exciting time to be in genomics and at Illumina. Now I'll invite the operator to open up for Q&A."

And then secondarily, I was hoping that you could walk through in terms of your sequencing guidance for next year, Francis, in terms of the NovaSeq success that you've had thus far. Of the remaining HiSeq existing customers that haven't converted, can you give a little more color kind of what's baked in, in terms of the new v1.5 launch? And how many of those you expect to convert? And that's kind of what's impacted in your guidance?"

So let me talk a little bit about the EPS guide of $5.10 to $5.35 for this year. Basically, we're expecting roughly 24% operating margin. So there is an element of OpEx growth in there.

Basically, we're expecting roughly 24% operating margin. So there is an element of OpEx growth in there. And part of that is a onetime also impact related to stock-based compensation that we talked about at JPMorgan when we provided the guide, which is related to 2 plans for the '19 and '20 plans, and were significantly impacted by the pandemic, and that we are modifying the targets on those plants. So that has a onetime catch up expense in 2021 of approximately $50 million to $55 million, and that's really a significant portion of the OpEx growth. 
Beyond that, we are continuing to invest behind our platforms, behind our technologies, behind our assays, so -- which we are committed to R&D is a big commitment for us. 
As we look forward then, our goal is to continue to improve in terms of the leverage on our operating margin to get back to traditional operating margin levels that we had back in '19, which were close to 30%. That will take some time to get back to. But that's a commitment that we have, to continue to drive operating leverage by making sure that we're very actively focused on G&A investments and reducing or making sure that those continue to grow beyond the rate of growth in revenues. But that we continue to invest in R&D and to some extent, commercial as well. But we are committed over the long-term to get back into operating leverage. 
And in fact, in the second half as well of the year, as we get past the pandemic, the second half we expect to see an improvement in terms of both gross margin and operating margin versus the first half and definitely higher than the full year as well for gross margin and operating margin."
29753,702208890,2206936,"Illumina, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Super. Thanks, Sam. So Dan, now I'll take your question about NovaSeq this year and touch specifically also on the remaining HiSeq customers and how we're thinking about it this year. So I'll start by saying that, look, we're entering this year with a l",485,"Super. Thanks, Sam. So Dan, now I'll take your question about NovaSeq this year and touch specifically also on the remaining HiSeq customers and how we're thinking about it this year. 
So I'll start by saying that, look, we're entering this year with a lot of momentum on NovaSeq. The version 1.5 NovaSeq reagents that we released in August really did a nice job in terms of unlocking the elasticity of demand in that high throughput segment of the market. And so as we talked about it coming into this year, we're coming off our Q4 where in our first quarter of selling the version 1.5 reagents, NovaSeq Consumables had a record quarter, growing in the mid-teens year-over-year, so really strong from a consumable perspective. And we talked about the fact that in Q4, we also had our second highest order in terms of bookings orders for NovaSeq. And the first highest was when we first launched NovaSeq back in 2017. So both from a -- an instruments perspective and a consumables perspective, we're coming off a really strong Q4, and we're walking into this year with a really strong pipeline and a strong backlog following the orders that came in, in Q4. 
So as we think about this year, then, there are 2 sources of demand we see for NovaSeq. One, and we talked about this in Q4 also that we're seeing -- because of 1.5, really an unlocking demand from new to high throughput customers. And if you think about in Q4, over half the bookings went to new to high throughput customers. So again, that new pricing is opening up the market for new customers to come in. 
And the other source of demand for NovaSeq coming into this year is the remaining HiSeq customers. And as we pointed out, there are -- of our original HiSeq base, we still have 320 customers that have yet to begin the upgrade cycle. And now with the lower pricing on 1.5, these typically smaller core labs now have a NovaSeq accessible to them. And if you look at the pricing now, all it takes for a HiSeq 2500 customer is for them to run about 4 high output kits a month, and they can justify the list price of a NovaSeq in a year. In addition, with the 1.5 release, we extended the shelf life of the consumables from 3 months to 6 months, so they don't have to sequence as frequency to justify the upgrade. 
And then finally, the new 35 cycles as [ 4 ] kits also enables counting methods now on the NovaSeq, which was important to those labs. So you add all those in, and we're walking into this year with strong momentum on the NovaSeq side, and that's what we expect to drive orders this year. In fact, we're expecting another strong year of NovaSeq orders coming into 2021."

On the fourth quarter, was there any consumable stocking? We just hear about that your peers last night. And then how much of the record order book was catch up spending versus, Francis, what you just talked about, the acceleration and adoption driven by the flow sale? 
And then I'm curious why margins were so soft. You did have the price adjustments, the inventory write-down in stock-based comp, but it seems like maybe there was more there. I'm curious if you're kind of pulling forward any spending. 
And then secondly, shifting to the outlook, it's good to see you're stepping up the first quarter guidance here versus what you gave at our conference. I'm just curious if there was something that changed in your outlook, the original guidance down 9% to 10%, obviously, didn't really make a ton of sense. So this is more of what I think people had been expecting anyway. But I'm curious what drove that. 
And then Francis, more broadly, I'm wondering if you can comment on the surveillance opportunity. Just how material you think that could be? And how much of that do you think ends up getting done on short versus long rate?"

So maybe I'll cover a couple of the points that you mentioned upfront cycle, and I'll let Francis talk about the surveillance aspect. So I think there's a lot there. So hopefully, I'll capture everything here. But in terms of Q4 stocking, we had a very strong quarter in Q4. We did not see any unusual stocking beyond what you see traditionally at the year-end. I mean, there's usually a reset of budgets at the end of Q4, academic budgets at the end of the year. So beyond what we usually see every year, we have not seen any unusual stocking in Q4. And we validate this by looking at, basically, activity on our sequencers. We look at the activity, the data that we have, looking at all the active sequencers that we have that are connected. And in fact, we saw a strong increase in terms of activity levels in Q4 in terms of clinical, getting back and showing growth pre-pandemic levels, and in terms of research now going basically at pre pandemic levels. 
So pleased to see that and -- which validates that there wasn't any unusual stocking at the end of Q4. In terms of gross margin, I think we talked about the drivers, Tycho. I mean we're still impacted by the pandemic. Freight is still a factor for us in Q4. We did have the onetime write-down on certain inventory, which was approximately a percentage point impact negatively on gross margin. And mix was an impact as well in Q4 because we had strong instruments in the quarter as well. So those are the things that impacted margins in Q4. 
We expect margins to improve in Q1, to progressively improve across 2021 and, in the second half, in fact, to be, as I said earlier, above the full year average. And starting to get back to our -- what we call our normal levels of 70% plus -- not quite at 70%, but close to that in the second half. So we definitely see that as we start to get out of the constraints driven by the pandemic, and which resulted in higher freight and other higher expenses. 
With regards to Q1 outlook, we are pleased to be raising our Q1 outlook based on what we're seeing. We're seeing strength in the business. We're seeing strength in activity levels. Again, too early to comment specifically. It's been 4 weeks since the start of the year. But everything that we're seeing in terms of orders is really encouraging. So we are pleased with where the business has started."

So you're right, Tycho, this is a significant raise for us in terms of what we were expecting for Q1, given what we shared at JPMorgan. Now JPMorgan, what we shared, was very typical for our busin",692,"Yes. Let me build on -- yes. Let me build on Sam's remark. So you're right, Tycho, this is a significant raise for us in terms of what we were expecting for Q1, given what we shared at JPMorgan. Now JPMorgan, what we shared, was very typical for our business and other players in our business, which is sequentially from Q4 to Q1 because of the capital cycle, you expect a decrease in revenue. And that's what we called. And we said, look, you should expect us to be flat to Q1 of last year. But we're seeing a lot more strength even in the first few weeks of the quarter. And that strength is coming from our core business, as Sam said, and we're monitoring both -- not just orders, but we're monitoring activity levels. And exiting Q4 and into Q1, we're seeing strong activity levels both from the clinical side of the business, but also on the research side of the business. 
And so as we stand here, it's become clear to us that instead of being flat to a year ago, we're going to be up high single digits. And so we're coming pretty close to where we were in Q4. That's unusual in this business, but it really speaks to the strength that we're seeing in terms of orders coming in. Obviously, there's a lot of the year left. And so we're leaving the year guidance intact, but certainly, with strength in Q1. 
In terms of surveillance, surveillance is something we've been talking about now for about a year. And the idea is that, in addition to rolling out testing infrastructure to fight this pandemic, you will need surveillance infrastructure to understand how the virus is spreading geographically and how it's mutating. And that information about mutations are essential to understand that the tools we're using to fight the pandemic, the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies, will continue to be effective. 
And really once the outbreak we started to see around Christmas of the B-117 variants in the U.K. and then the South African variant that started to really get people to realize that we do need the surveillance infrastructure. So it didn't contribute much in terms of revenue in Q4, and we've only built in a modest amount in Q1. But you can see the activity, right? You can see the activity in [indiscernible] U.K. You can see the activity in countries around the world, in France, in Germany, Italy and Spain and really sort of around the world. And we expect that to continue over the course of this year as countries build out the surveillance infrastructures. And that's going to be a durable surveillance infrastructure. We're going to need it in the future to warn of the next pandemic, to warn us of a bioterrorist attack, antimicrobial resistance. 
And what's interesting is that Illumina's technology is uniquely well suited for this need. And the reason for that is because we have unmatched accuracy, we can deliver the highest scale, we can deliver the price point per sample that's necessary. And we also have the first cleared product for customers to use. And so those things came together, and you'll see that playing out in the numbers, right? So right at the very beginning, we were the sequencer used at Wuhan. And then in Shanghai to published the first viral genome. It was Illumina sequencing data that was used by the vaccine developers to develop the vaccines. The mRNA vaccines are being used today. And that was because of the accuracy of the Illumina sequencing. 
And now as you look at the large-scale initiatives, COG U.K. and some of the other ones, it's Illumina sequencers that's being used because of the scale that we can achieve, and the throughput and the turnaround time. And so you look at the numbers of the genomes in just a, for example, and you will see that the vast majority of the data and just say, the vast majority of the genomes that have in sequence have been done on Illumina sequencers. And so very exciting, very important, starting now."

On NovaSeq utilization, NovaSeq consumables pull-through on an annualized basis, I believe, was above $1.2 million in the fourth quarter. I believe your expectation for 2021, at least in terms of what's embedded into guidance is 1.1 to 1.2 in per box. I'm just wondering what's driving the assumption for slightly lower utilization versus Q4, keeping in mind that there was no abnormal stocking in Q4? 
There's a couple of things I could think of. Maybe it's just early in the year uncertainty, especially as we're coming out of the pandemic. Maybe it's the expectation for a lot more boxes being placed, which can pressure pull-through at least initially on an average basis. And/or it could have something to do with the v1.5 reagent pricing having an impact. So some detail on that assumption would be helpful. 
And then the second thing I wanted to talk about was just GRAIL. Do you expect Pathfinder data in Q1, is that still the case? When would you expect to initiate registration studies? And can you share anything in terms of progress being made with self-insured employers, closed health care systems and/or concierge systems?"

We were back to above pre-pandemic levels, actually at the high end of the guidance range in terms of pre pandemic levels. 
We do expect with the v1.5 that you will have -- that it will catalyze significant HiSeq conversion with those 320 remaining HiSeq customers. So those will start to also transition to NovaSeq. That has, I would say, a very -- a modest impact on pull-through on the downside, but also you have the large centers that will drive pull-through higher on the upside. 
And -- but as you said, we're still in a pandemic year. The first 6 months of the year are expected to still be basically a pandemic reality, so to speak. And at this point, I think it's prudent that the guidance that we have and the expectation that we have is the $1.1 million to $1.2 million range. But very encouraged by what we saw in Q4."

The big announcement, obviously, from the health system side was the announcement around the NHS, and that's tracking for the pilot to be launched this year.

Easy comps, obviously, new chemistry, $600 genome discount that we saw in the fourth quarter, that's obviously driving a last, sort of, demand here as you would have expected. There is increase in COVID sequencing, COVID variants that's coming in. There's post pandemic instrumentation buys and cancer patients potentially returning back as they get vaccinated in 2021 here. And MRD and screening, and those trials are ramping up too. 
So just wanted to understand sort of why the conservatism on at 20%, given all that of a backdrop? And then I also wanted to understand, first of all, I appreciate you providing the road map details in terms of product improvements that you expect. But wondering how should we look at that in light of the customer event that you have coming up here? 
And then lastly, if I could also touch on MRD. That's been a new focus area for GRAIL. So there are already 2 competitors in the place in the market there. So how do you position into that market? And also, how do you -- what's your expectation in terms of those other competitors? Obviously, they're running samples on Illumina sequences too. So what's your expectation for the MRD market here, acceleration over the next 1 to 3 years? I appreciate you taking these questions."

So we are expecting 20% sequencing consumable growth this year. For a number of reasons, there are some very good tailwinds in the business and strength in the core business that drive us to that. As you mentioned, additional market access and coverage for both on the NIPT side, on the genetic disease side. We're seeing definitely growth in the comprehensive genomic profiling on the oncology side. The v1.5 is a great introduction. 
The COVID variance part, Puneet, we have not really assumed a significant impact of that in our guide. That's something that we're really encouraged by in terms of the surveillance aspect. We are seeing definitely strength from that. But again, a bit early to really size that for the full year. So that's not significantly included in our guide, I would say. 
And then remember, one other thing as well is we're still -- and again, I don't want to sound like a broken record on this, but we're still in a pandemic year, and we still have an expectation here that for the first 6 months of the year that we are in a pandemic. So this -- I would not call this a normal year. But in the second half, we hope to be coming out of the pandemic, definitely with the progress that's being made around vaccination rates as well. 
But all good points that you made. But hopefully, this gives you some additional background."
29753,702208890,2206936,"Illumina, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So now I will talk about 2 things. I'll talk about the customer event. I'll talk about the road map, and I'll talk about the GRAIL MRD test. So we do have a customer event. It's going to be sort of our first global this year virtual customer event",645,"Yes. So now I will talk about 2 things. I'll talk about the customer event. I'll talk about the road map, and I'll talk about the GRAIL MRD test. 
So we do have a customer event. It's going to be sort of our first global this year virtual customer event that we will have at the tail end of April. It's shaping up to be a terrific event. And we have some fabulous speakers, and we have tracks for different segments of our customer base. So there'll be a track, for example, on population sequencing, where we will convene some of the largest population sequencing initiatives around the world to come together, share best practices and learn from each other. And we'll do the same thing on oncology testing and so on. 
I suspect where you were going with that, Puneet, was -- so are we going to announce anything and at the customer event. And I've been on the record of saying, I'd love to announce products in front of customers rather than in front of bankers. But obviously, I can't say what we're going to do in terms of product roadmaps. As a company, we don't preannounce products. What we did announce recently the P1 flow cell. On the NextSeq, we announced ICA, the connected analytics platform at JPMorgan, which is seeing a really nice traction in population sequencing efforts. And obviously, the v1.5. So you'll just have to stay tuned in terms of what we announced when. 
In terms of the GRAIL -- just MRD in general and the GRAIL MRD test. We are very excited about the impact on patients asides from having an MRD test. We think that will improve life for cancer patients, enable them to catch recurrence earlier. And that's going to be an important market, and there's a big opportunity. But as you said, there are 2 customers already of ours that have MRD tests. We will support them. We want to make sure they're hugely successful because this is an important segment and a large segment as a genomics application as well. So we'll continue to do everything we can to make sure they're successful. 
We're also excited about GRAIL's MRD test. And GRAIL has a little bit of a different take on their approach on MRD. And the difference between what GRAIL is trying to do and what some of the other players are trying to do is that some of the tests that exist in the market today are patient-specific tests. And so the way it works is you do a tumor profile on a particular patient's cancer. And you -- based on the tissue sample you take from that patient. And then you create the test for that cancer patient. Then -- and you run that as a blood test then going forward. So a terrific test, very important, very groundbreaking. But because you're taking a tissue sample and you're building a patient-specific test, it does take some time. 
GRAIL is using a different approach. They're basing their MRD test on their screening test, which means it isn't patient specific, that it's the single blood test that they use for screening that they're using for MRD as well. That should significantly compress the time frame in terms of having that test available for a patient and doesn't require a tissue biopsy. And so we think they have a differentiated view in the market, and we're excited about bringing that to the market as well and giving patients the choice. 
Over the last few weeks, GRAIL announced some important partnerships. So at JPMorgan, we talked about the fact that we have announced partnerships with Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, as partners for its MRD test. Obviously, a terrific set of partners and continues to show good momentum around the development of that test of GRAIL."

Can you talk a little bit on grail in terms of thinking about how you're going to do with sales and marketing plan here and how you're going to address customers?

With regards to pull-through on the mid throughput and low throughput, Derik, so starting with NextSeq, we will not yet give a pull-through expectation for NextSeq. There's a lot of moving parts there, as you know, with regards to NextSeq 2000, the introduction being fairly recently at the end of Q1 of last year, with the NextSeq 1000 coming into the mix as well late in the year. And so those will have an impact on NextSeq 550, and we're still evaluating what the potential pull-through would look like in terms of NextSeq 2000. So it would be premature right now to give a guidance range around what the pull-through expectation is there. 
With regards to low throughput, MiSeq and MiniSeq as well. MiSeq was impacted by the pandemic in 2020. So usually, we give a guidance range of 40,000 to 45,000 per box on MiSeq. It was impacted by the pandemic in 2020, so it was well below that. And then it started to approach that lower end of the range towards the end of 2020 in terms of the high 30s. So right now, we're expecting somewhere, for MiSeq, close to 35,000 to 40,000 in terms of MiSeq pull-through per box for 2021. 
With regards to MiniSeq, usually, the range is 20% to 25%, and we are expecting to be on the low end of that range for MiniSeq."

The go-to-market plan for GRAIL, and you started to see glimpses of this, is not going to be to build this big direct to physician sales force necessarily. The initial plan for GRAIL is to sell to -- it's a B2B model, right? To sell to health systems, national health systems like the deal they talked about with the NHS, for example. But also integrated health systems in the U.S. to sell to concierge health systems and to sell to self-insured employers. And so that's an enterprise sale, a B2B sale. 
So similar to what we do at Illumina, obviously, a little bit different, but we also have an enterprise sales force. And so that's the intent with GRAIL going forward. And while there might be some patient advocacy and some education, I think one of the advantages that GRAIL have relative to some of the tests in the market today is that it's a blood test. And it doesn't require a lot of pushing to get people to be compliant with the test that they have to take home, for example. 
And so it's a little bit of a different model that they're using. Again, they are using that model today. So they have, sort of, an IDE from the FDA, and they are returning results to patients in some really top-tier health care systems, like the -- like [indiscernible] and so on. And so that's the model that they are refining. That's the model that's going to be rolled out at the NHS. And so that's the model we expect to continue going forward."

And so that's sort of a wave that started to grow last year and certainly sort of picking up as we entered this year. That was part of the reason why this last quarter in Q4 was the highest quarter we've had for instruments since 2017 when we launched NovaSeq.

We are seeing COVID drive some purchasing of sequencing. We talked about the fact that, again, we got called into Wuhan in December 2019.

But in terms of how to think about this, I think it's done right, it's significantly bigger than what we have today with the flu. And obviously, this pandemic was sort of a wake-up moment from so many perspectives. 
I'll give you one example. We were talking to officials from the U.S. government at some point in sort of late Q1, early Q2. And there was a realization that we have the coronavirus spreading in the U.S. for weeks, and people were dying maybe months, and we didn't even know that we had it. And that's a huge wake-up call, because that's important not just for a coronavirus pandemic, but it has implications around surveillance for bioterrorism, for example. 
And so the wake up call is to say, look, we need the surveillance infrastructure. And we need a global surveillance infrastructure. It's got to be genomic space, and it's got a watch for emerging antimicrobial resistance, new pathogens, bioterrorism. The scope of that is significantly bigger than flu tracking that happens today. 
The other interesting dynamic that's playing out is this is absolutely a public health infrastructure, essential for public health, absolutely. But it's also a defense infrastructure. And the 2 are funded very differently, right? So public health, as you know, goes from panic to starvation, right? So there's a panic, infrastructure then gets built and then maybe doesn't always get the funding follow through. 
Defense is not like that. And so this is going to be a combination of both. It's going to be a public health infrastructure, and it's going to be part of the national defense infrastructure. And so if you think about this long term, it's definitely got a scope that's significantly bigger in terms of thinking than what we do with for you today."

And then my second question is on GRAIL. In the past, you sort of alluded to the possibility of potentially some sort of a risk-sharing structure and sort of Illumina being on the hook for -- or other payers being on the hook for a rise in overall diagnostic testing costs, following Galleri deployment in order to encourage customers to participate in pilots. Have you, sort of, like chopped any wood in terms of implementing those sort of arrangements just yet? Or is it still too early?"

They're going as fast as they can to get the product out in the quality they need, especially given the important work that our customers do with our products. So  while I'd love to, the reality is we can't pull P1 forward, although I know people really, really want it. And that's true across our entire portfolio. 
And I think you're right, it will actually have -- it will have a really an important role to play even in surveillance. 
I think your second question was around the partnerships that we were looking to do with other customers in the oncology diagnostics space, and we're looking to get into screening. And we're making progress with those customers. We've signed supply agreements, long-term site supply agreements with some of those customers and continuing dialogue with the remaining customers. And so our commitment is to continue to supply them with the technology they need and make sure that they have all equal access to the technologies that we commercialize going forward. In some cases, those are agreements that are over a decade-long and that's great for our customers. That's great for us too."

Illumina had a strong finish to 2020, with both revenue and orders setting new records. Fourth quarter revenue of $953 million was up 20% sequentially from the third quarter. Sequencing instruments grew 29% qua",1303,"Thank you, Juliet. Good afternoon, everyone. Illumina had a strong finish to 2020, with both revenue and orders setting new records. Fourth quarter revenue of $953 million was up 20% sequentially from the third quarter. Sequencing instruments grew 29% quarter-over-quarter. We also booked the second-highest NovaSeq units during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the August launch of our v1.5 reagents. v1.5 resulted in higher new customer growth as well as additional HiSeq conversions. NovaSeq continues to be the market-leading sequencer as it enters its 5th year since launch.
Full year 2020 revenue of $3.2 billion declined 9% year-over-year, with the largest impact in the pandemic in the second quarter. Our business accelerated in the second half of the year, growing 17% compared to the first half. In 2020, we shipped more than 2,000 sequencing systems, setting another record for mid-throughput shipments and added more than 700 new customers, which exceeded our expectation.
I'd like to share some fourth quarter highlights by platform, starting with our high throughput systems. NovaSeq consumable pull-through was at its highest level of the year at over $1.2 million per instrument. We expect NovaSeq flow-through to continue at pre-pandemic levels of $1.1 million to $1.2 million per year in 2021. The NovaSeq v1.5 reagent introduction is catalyzing a new wave of high-throughput customers as a $600 genome became a reality for labs of any size. In fact, over half our NovaSeq system orders in 2020 were to new high-throughput customers. This includes customers like Argentina's Ministry of Health, which purchased NovaSeq for infectious disease research.
v1.5 introduction also accelerated the purchasing time line for CellCarta, a contract research organization and a new to high-throughput customer who plans to use their NovaSeq to support oncology clinical trials. The v1.5 reagents are also strengthening the economic case for legacy HiSeq customers to upgrade, like the University of Oregon who is using NovaSeq for large, single cell and epigenetic studies. We ended the year with about 1,000 active HiSeq units. And in 2021, we expect continued HiSeq to NovaSeq adoption among the 320 customers yet to transition.
Moving to mid-throughput. 2020 marked the second consecutive year of record placements, and the mid-throughput segment continues to provide durable growth in our core business. Fourth quarter strength was primarily driven by the successful launches of NextSeq 1000 and 2000, which also drove an increase in mid-throughput consumables revenue for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect continued NextSeq expansion in 2021, particularly in the clinical segment. Notably, we received NMPA approval in China for NextSeqDx, driving demand in local hospitals and applications like oncology and infectious disease testing. We expect this approval to drive NextSeqDx placements and further increase our clinical presence in 2021.
We added more than 500 new low-throughput customers in 2020, bringing our total to more than 6,100 customers worldwide. Our platforms hold the largest set of flow cell configurations and enable the most expansive set of supported methods with run times as fast as 5 hours. In the fourth quarter, we had record low-throughput consumable revenue driven by customers like Invitae of products in development using MiSeqDX.
I'll now provide updates on our clinical and research and applied segments. Total sequencing consumables revenue of $2 billion was down 2% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on academic and research institutions. By the fourth quarter of 2020, clinical sequencing run rates actually exceeded pre-pandemic levels, and research run rates also returned to normalized pre-pandemic volumes. It was great to see how our customers successfully rebounded under these challenging circumstances. More than 43% of our sequencing consumable shipments in 2020 were to clinical customers, which includes testing for oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease. Clinical testing proved durable during the pandemic, with clinical consumables growing about 8% year-over-year to approximately $890 million in 2020. And in the fourth quarter, clinical consumables growth accelerated to over 20% year-over-year.
In clinical, I'll highlight first the tremendous progress made in market access and reimbursement. We believe recent landmark coverage decisions will drive greater adoption of next-generation sequencing to new levels over the next several years. In oncology, 205 million lives are now covered for tumor-comprehensive genomic profiling in the U.S. And with an increasing number of targeted oncology therapies, we expect CGP to grow to be a $1 billion-plus market by 2026. Additionally, Germany recently started covering tumor CGP and whole exome and whole genome for rare and undiagnosed genetic disease without restrictions. This means that 73 million lives will have better access to CGP and whole exome and whole genome testing. In reproductive health, with multiple large payers expanding coverage for all pregnancies, we expect NIPT coverage in the U.S. to exceed 3 million pregnancies by the end of 2021. And finally, whole genome sequencing coverage for genetic disease testing increased tenfold in 2020. And we expect WGS to become the standard of care in genetic disease as awareness and reimbursement continues to grow.
With these positive reimbursement trends as a backstop, I will now discuss our clinical focus areas in a little more detail. Oncology testing continues to represent approximately 20% of total sequencing consumables, and it grew year-over-year driven by companies like Guardant Health who expanded its mobile phlebotomy services to help patients access its Guardant360 liquid biopsy test during the pandemic. This also includes Genomic Health and the NHS that adopted NovaSeq comprehensive genomic profiling as a standard of care in the U.K. And oncology centers like Florida Cancer Specialists, a private community oncology and hematology practice, with nearly 100 offices throughout Florida. Florida Cancer Specialists purchased multiple NextSeqDx systems in 2020 to run Illumina's TruSight Oncology 500 assay in its new lab. Reproductive health represented about 12% of sequencing consumables, with revenue and samples for our end-to-end VeriSeq NIPT solution growing over 20% in 2020.
Lastly, about 10% of our sequencing consumables revenue is related to genetic disease testing. Customers continue to choose Illumina's highly accurate and scalable sequencers as their platform of choice in this area. For example, the recent collaboration between Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, in partnership with the New York Genome Center, will use Illumina technology for clinical WGS in areas like cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.
Turning to our research and applied segment. Revenue of approximately $1.2 billion represented just under 57% of our sequencing consumable shipments and was lower by about 6% year-over-year as customers were impacted by the pandemic. Research accelerated in the second half, growing 20% compared to the first half as researchers return to their labs. This segment includes research in oncology and genetic disease as well as population genomic and research initiatives. Our sequencers-enabled programs like K-DNA, a large-scale Korean project aiming to sequence 1 million genomes by 2030. A service provider consortium, standardized on Illumina technology, won the competitive tender based on NovaSeq's superior technical evaluation. The program plans to complete a 7,500-genome Phase I by the end of the year.
The NHS commenced a phased rollout for whole genome sequencing in the fourth quarter for selected rare disease and cancer patients as part of their routine care. Once this live clinical testing phase is complete, we expect the whole genome sequencing service to further ramp in the spring. We expect the [ Olivet ] program to continue to scale this year. And the NIH anticipates releasing de-identified data from 100,000 sequence and array genotype samples to its research portal by the end of 2021.
Finally, as a leading innovator, Illumina remains steadfast in the defense of our intellectual property globally. We received injunctions against BGI for patent infringement in the U.S., Germany, U.K., Spain, Sweden and Finland. We remain confident that our IP portfolio affords strong protection for Illumina's innovation now and well into the future.
And now I'll turn it over to Sam."

As Francis discussed, we had record fourth quarter revenue that grew slightly year-over-year to $953 million driven by 1% growth in sequencing, offset by an 8% decline in microarrays.
Total sequencing revenue reached a record of $846 million, which represented 89% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 and grew 19% sequentially. Sequencing consumables revenue grew 5% compared to the prior year period and 20% sequentially. Sequencing instruments revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and grew 29% sequentially. And sequencing service and other was down 15% compared to the prior year period due to IVD partnership revenue recognized last year.
Moving to regional results. The Americas revenue grew 14% sequentially. Revenue in the region was 2% lower compared to the prior year quarter, which was primarily driven by onetime technology access fees for an IVD partnership and lower DTC revenue. These items were partially offset by sequencing consumables. The Americas had record sequencing product revenue in the fourth quarter driven by clinical customers.
EMEA delivered record revenue of $285 million, representing 34% sequential growth and 2% growth year-over-year, driven by strong instrument revenue from NovaSeq. We also saw certain customers in emerging countries taking their first NovaSeq shipments.
Greater China grew 16% sequentially and 3% year-over-year to $96 million and had its highest sequencing instrument revenue quarter since 2017 driven in part by growing demand in hospitals. Subsequent to Q4, we also announced the Sequoia Capital China genomics incubator, which builds on our other incubator efforts in Silicon Valley and the U.K. Together, we will partner with leading entrepreneurs in China to build genomic start-up companies that create breakthrough genomics applications and clinical sequencing solutions.
Finally, APJ revenue of $77 million was up 24% sequentially and up 5% from the prior year period. For the full year, the region was roughly flat compared to 2019 with full year growth in sequencing consumables.
Moving to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders.
As expected, non-GAAP gross margin of 66.9% decreased approximately 50 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was down 330 basis points, primarily due to a onetime inventory write-down in Q4, onetime IVD partnership revenue in the year ago quarter and higher freight costs related to COVID-19. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $439 million were up $74 million sequentially, as expected, reflecting the extra week in the fourth quarter, variable compensation expenses and other investments. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.9%, down from 21.4% in the third quarter. Non-GAAP other income of $20 million was $13 million higher sequentially due to gains on short-term investments sold as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition.
The non-GAAP tax rate of 18.4% was up from last quarter due to a discrete charge related to a tax structure initiative in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase of our tax rate in Q4 was also impacted by discrete tax benefits in the third quarter of 2020 related to prior year return adjustments.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net income was $257 million or $1.75 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $179 million or $1.22 per diluted share.
Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $406 million. DSO is 50 days compared to 53 days last quarter driven by revenue linearity. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $62 million, and free cash flow was $344 million. We repurchased $280 million of stock in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with approximately $3.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 147 million.
Moving now to 2021 guidance. We expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 17% to 20% or $3.79 billion to $3.89 billion, representing an increase of approximately $599 million at the midpoint. For the full year of 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 20%. This includes sequencing consumable growth of around 20%. We expect sequencing system revenue to grow 33% year-over-year driven by placements of NovaSeq due to continued HiSeq conversions and the adoption of v1.5 reagents as well as placements of NextSeq due to NextSeq 2000 and DX demand and arrays to grow approximately 5% compared to 2020.
We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to modestly improve from 2020, reflecting increased leverage from higher volumes and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by product mix and IVD partnership revenue in the first quarter of 2020. We expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 24%. As volumes increase and freight charges normalize, we expect both gross and operating margins to improve in the second half of 2021 and be above the full year average.
We expect other income to be about $40 million lower than 2020 due to the gains in the fourth quarter of 2020, lower interest rates and shorter duration investments in anticipation of the close of the GRAIL acquisition. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.76 to $5.01 and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.10 to $5.35. And we expect diluted shares outstanding in 2021 to be approximately 147 million.
Moving to the first quarter of 2021, we are raising our previous expectations, and we now expect high single-digit revenue growth compared to the first quarter of 2020. We expect sequential improvement in non-GAAP gross margin; sequential decline in non-GAAP operating expenses, similar to historical seasonality; non-GAAP other income to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the onetime gain on short-term investments previously discussed and, as a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks."

We're seeing strength in our core business and are playing an essential role in the emerging surveillance effort necessary to fight the pandemic. In the past couple of months, as new, more dangerous SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, there has been a growing recognition of the need for COVID surveillance around the globe, with countries like the U.K., Australia, Canada and Germany leading the way in deploying national surveillance infrastructures. In the U.S. The proposed budget package contains $1.75 billion for the CDC to conduct, expand and improve activities to sequence genomes, identify mutations and survey the transmission of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
Sequencing-based surveillance is one of the key elements in the fight against this pandemic. And it's also becoming clear that sequencing and surveillance are becoming mainstream in the defense against infectious disease. This global surveillance infrastructure being built right now will be instrumental in identifying future outbreaks, including coronaviruses, antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. Illumina is proud to be at the forefront of this important work.
We'd also like to congratulate Nobel Laureate and Illumina Board member, Dr. Frances Arnold, who was named as Co-Chair of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors in Science and Technology. We believe the recent appointment of highly experienced scientists signal the administration's focus on science, including genomics, to improve life in the U.S. for everyone.
Finally, we continue to expect to close the GRAIL acquisition in the second half of this year, enabling us to help accelerate the adoption of early cancer detection screening and opening up the largest application for genomics by far. We're looking forward to GRAIL launching Galleri in Q2.
We see a vast number of opportunities ahead of us. And there has never been a more exciting time to be in genomics and at Illumina. Now I'll invite the operator to open up for Q&A."

Basically, we're expecting roughly 24% operating margin. So there is an element of OpEx growth in there. And part of that is a onetime also impact related to stock-based compensation that we talked about at JPMorgan when we provided the guide, which is related to 2 plans for -- the '19 and '20 plans that were significantly impacted by the pandemic and that we are modifying the targets on those plans. So that has a onetime catch-up expense in 2021 of approximately $50 million to $55 million, and that's really a significant portion of the OpEx growth. Beyond that, we are continuing to invest behind our platforms, behind our technologies, behind our assays so -- which we are committed to. R&D is a big commitment for us.
As we look forward, Dan, our goal is to continue to improve in terms of the leverage on our operating margin to get back to traditional operating margin levels that we had back in '19, which were close to 30%. That will take some time to get back to. But that's a commitment that we have, is to continue to drive operating leverage by making sure that we're very actively focused on G&A investments and reducing -- or making sure that those continue to grow beyond the rate of growth in revenues. But then we continue to invest in R&D and, to some extent, commercial as well. But we are committed over the long term to get back into operating leverage. And in fact, in the second half as well of the year, as we get past the pandemic, the second half, we expect to see an improvement in terms of both gross margin and operating margin versus the first half and definitely higher than the full year as well for gross margin and operating margin."

So Dan, now I'll take your question about NovaSeq this year and touch specifically also on the remaining HiSeq customers and how we're thinking about it this year. So I'll start by saying that, look, we're entering this year with a lot of momentum on NovaSeq. The version 1.5 NovaSeq reagents that we released in August really did a nice job in terms of unlocking the elasticity of demand in that high-throughput segment of the market. And so as we talked about, coming into this year, we're coming off a Q4 where, in our first quarter of selling the version 1.5 reagents, NovaSeq consumables had a record, growing mid-teens year-over-year, so very strong from a consumable perspective.
And we talked about the fact that in Q4, we also had our second-highest order in terms of bookings orders for NovaSeq. And the first highest was when we first launched NovaSeq back in 2017. So both from an instruments perspective and a consumables perspective, we're coming off a really strong Q4, and we're walking into this year with a really strong pipeline and a strong backlog following the orders that came in, in Q4. So as we think about this year then, there are 2 sources of demand we see for NovaSeq. One, and we talked about this in Q4 also, that we're seeing, because of 1.5, really an unlocking of demand from new to high-throughput customers. And if you think about it, in Q4, over half the bookings went to new to high-throughput customers. So again, that new pricing is opening up the market for new customers to come in.
And the other source of demand for NovaSeq coming into this year is the remaining HiSeq customers. And as we pointed out, there are -- of our original HiSeq base, we still have 320 customers that have yet to begin the upgrade cycle. And now with the lower pricing on 1.5, these typically smaller core labs now have a NovaSeq accessible to them. And if you look at the pricing now, all it takes for a HiSeq 2500 customer is for them to run about 4 high-output kits a month, and they can justify the list price of a NovaSeq in a year. In addition, with the 1.5 release, we extended the shelf life of the consumables from 3 months to 6 months, so they don't have to sequence as frequently to justify the upgrade. And then, finally, the new 35-cycle S4 kits also enables counting method now on the NovaSeq, which was important to those labs. So you add all those in, and we're walking into this year with strong momentum on the NovaSeq side, and that's what we expect to drive orders this year. In fact, we're expecting another strong year of NovaSeq orders coming into 2021."

And then how much of the record order book was catch-up spending versus, Francis, what you just talked about, the acceleration and adoption driven by the flow cell? And then I'm curious why margins were so soft. You did have the price adjustments, the inventory write-down and stock-based comp, but it seems like maybe there was more there. I'm curious if you're kind of pulling forward any spending.
And then secondly, shifting to the outlook, it's good to see you're stepping up the first quarter guidance here versus what you gave at our conference. I'm just curious if there was something that changed in your outlook. The original guidance of down 9% to 10%, obviously, didn't really make a ton of sense. So this is more of what I think people had been expecting anyway, but I'm curious what drove that. And then Francis, more broadly, I'm wondering if you can comment on the surveillance opportunity, just how material you think that could be and how much of that you think ends up getting done on short versus long read?"

So maybe I'll cover a couple of the points that you mentioned upfront, Tycho, and I'll let Francis talk about the surveillance aspect. So I think there's a lot there.

So maybe I'll cover a couple of the points that you mentioned upfront, Tycho, and I'll let Francis talk about the surveillance aspect. So I think there's a lot there. So hopefully, I'll capture everything here. But in terms of Q4 stocking, listen, we had a very strong quarter in Q4. We did not see any unusual stocking beyond what you see traditionally at the year-end. I mean there's usually a reset of budgets at the end of Q4, academic budgets at the end of the year. So beyond what we usually see every year, we have not seen any unusual stocking in Q4.
And we validate this by looking at, basically, activity on our sequencers. We look at the activity, the data that we have, looking at all the active sequencers that we have that are connected. And in fact, we saw a strong increase in terms of activity levels in Q4 in terms of clinical, getting back and showing growth pre-pandemic levels and in terms of research now going basically at pre-pandemic levels. So pleased to see that and -- which validates that there wasn't any unusual stocking at the end of Q4.
In terms of gross margin, I think we talked about the drivers, Tycho. I mean we're still impacted by the pandemic. Freight is still a factor for us in Q4. We did have the onetime write-down on certain inventory, which was approximately a percentage point impact negatively on gross margin. And mix was an impact as well in Q4 because we had strong instruments in the quarter as well. So those are the things that impacted margins in Q4. We expect margins to improve in Q1, to progressively improve across 2021 and, in the second half, in fact, to be, as I said earlier, above the full year average and starting to get back to our -- what we call our normal levels of 70% plus -- not quite at 70% but close to that in the second half. So we definitely see that as we start to get out of the constraints driven by the pandemic and which resulted in higher freight and other higher expenses.
With regards to Q1 outlook, we are pleased to be raising our Q1 outlook based on what we're seeing. We're seeing strength in the business. We're seeing strength in activity levels. Again, too early to comment specifically. It's been 4 weeks since the start of the year. But everything that we're seeing in terms of orders is really encouraging. So we are pleased with where the business has started."

So you're right, Tycho, this is a significant raise for us in terms of what we were expecting for Q1 given what we shared at JPMorgan. And at JPMorgan, what we shared was very typical for our business and other players i",691,"Yes. Let me build on Sam's remark. So you're right, Tycho, this is a significant raise for us in terms of what we were expecting for Q1 given what we shared at JPMorgan. And at JPMorgan, what we shared was very typical for our business and other players in our business, which is sequentially, from Q4 to Q1, because of the capital cycle, you expect a decrease in revenue. And that's what we called and we said, look, you should expect us to be flat to Q1 of last year. But we're seeing a lot more strength even in the first few weeks of the quarter. And that strength is coming from our core business, as Sam said, and we're monitoring both -- not just orders, but we're monitoring activity levels. And exiting Q4 and into Q1, we're seeing strong activity levels both from the clinical side of the business but also on the research side of the business.
And so as we stand here, it's become clear to us that instead of being flat to a year ago, we're going to be up high single digits. And so we're coming pretty close to where we were in Q4. That's unusual in this business, but it really speaks to the strength that we're seeing in terms of orders coming in. Obviously, there's a lot of the year left, and so we're leaving the year guidance intact but, certainly, with strength in Q1.
In terms of surveillance, surveillance is something we've been talking about now for about a year. And the idea is that, in addition to rolling out testing infrastructure to fight this pandemic, you will need surveillance infrastructure to understand how the virus is spreading geographically and how it's mutating. And that information about mutations are essential to understand that the tools we're using to fight the pandemic, the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies, will continue to be effective. And really once the outbreak we started to see around Christmas of the B-117 variants in the U.K. and then the South African variant, that started to really get people to realize that we do need the surveillance infrastructure.
So it didn't contribute much in terms of revenue in Q4, and we've only built in a modest amount in Q1. But you can see the activity, right? You can see the activity in COG-UK. You can see the activity in countries around the world, in France, in Germany, in Italy and Spain and really sort of around the world. And we expect that to continue over the course of this year as countries build out the surveillance infrastructures. And that's going to be a durable surveillance infrastructure. We're going to need it in the future to warn us of the next pandemic, to warn us of bioterrorist attacks, antimicrobial resistance.
And what's interesting is that Illumina's technology is uniquely well suited for this need. And the reason for that is because we have unmatched accuracy. We can deliver at the highest scale. We can deliver the price point per sample that's necessary. And we also have the first cleared product for our customers to use. And so those things came together. And you'll see that playing out in the numbers, right? So right at the very beginning, we were the sequencer used in Wuhan. And then in Shanghai to publish the first viral genome. It was Illumina sequencing data that was used by the vaccine developers to develop the vaccines, the mRNA vaccines that are being used today. And that was because of the accuracy of the Illumina sequencing.
And now as you look at the large-scale initiatives, COG-UK and some of the other ones, it's Illumina sequencers that's being used because of the scale that we can achieve and the throughput and the turnaround time. And so you look at the numbers of the genomes in [ GS ], for example, and you will see that the vast majority of the data in [ GS ], the vast majority of the genomes that have been sequenced have been done on Illumina sequencers. And so very exciting, very important, starting now."

I'm just wondering what's driving the assumption for slightly lower utilization versus Q4, keeping in mind that there was no abnormal stocking in Q4. There's a couple of things I could think of, maybe it's just early in the year, uncertainty especially as we're coming out of the pandemic. Maybe it's the expectation for a lot more boxes being placed, which can pressure pull-through at least initially on an average basis. And/or it could have something to do with the v1.5 reagent pricing having an impact, so some detail on that assumption would be helpful.
And then the second thing I wanted to talk about was just GRAIL. Do you expect PATHFINDER data in Q1? Is that still the case? When would you expect to initiate registration studies?

We were back to above pre-pandemic levels, actually at the high end of the guidance range in terms of pre pandemic levels. We do expect with the v1.5 that you will have -- that it will catalyze significant HiSeq conversion with those 320 remaining HiSeq customers, so those will start to also transition to NovaSeq. That has, I would say, a very -- a modest impact on pull-through on the downside, but also you have the large centers that will drive pull-through higher on the upside.
And -- but as you said, we're still in a pandemic year. The first 6 months of the year are expected to still be basically a pandemic reality, so to speak.

So we are expecting 20% sequencing consumable growth this year for a number of reasons, there are some very good tailwinds in the business and strength in the core business that drive us to that. As you mentioned, additional market access and coverage for both on the NIPT side, on the genetic disease side, we're seeing definitely growth in the comprehensive genomic profiling on the oncology side, the v1.5 is a great introduction.
The COVID variance part, Puneet, we have not really assumed a significant impact of that in our guide. That's something that we're really encouraged by in terms of the surveillance aspect. We are seeing definitely strength from that. But again, a bit early to really size that for the full year. So that's not significantly included in our guide, I would say. And then, remember, one other thing as well is we're still -- and again, I don't want to sound like a broken record on this, but we're still in a pandemic year, and we still have an expectation here that for the first 6 months of the year that we are in a pandemic. So this -- I would not call this a normal year. But in the second half, we hope to be coming out of the pandemic definitely with the progress that's being made around vaccination rates as well.

It's going to be sort of our first global this year virtual customer event that we will have at the tail end of April. It's shaping up to be a terrific event. And we have some fabulous speakers, and we have tracks for different segments of our customer base. So there'll be a track, for example, on population sequencing where we will convene some of the largest population sequencing initiatives around the world to come together, share best practices and learn from each other. And we'll do the same thing on oncology testing and so on.
I suspect where you were going with that, Puneet, was so are we going to announce anything at the customer event. And I've been on the record of saying I'd love to announce products in front of customers rather than in front of bankers. But obviously, I can't say what we're going to do in terms of product road maps. As a company, we don't preannounce products. What we did announce recently the P1 flow cell. On the NextSeq, we announced ICA, the connected analytics platform at JPMorgan, which is seeing a really nice traction in population sequencing efforts. And obviously, the v1.5. So you'll just have to stay tuned in terms of what we announced when.
In terms of the GRAIL -- just MRD in general and the GRAIL MRD test. We are very excited about the impact on the patient side from having an MRD test. We think that that will improve life for cancer patients, enable them to catch recurrence earlier. And that's going to be an important market and is a big opportunity. But as you said, there are 2 customers already of ours that have MRD tests. We will support them. We want to make sure they're hugely successful because this is an important segment and a large segment as a genomics application as well. So we'll continue to do everything we can to make sure they're successful.
We're also excited about GRAIL's MRD test. And GRAIL has a little bit of a different take on their approach on MRD. And the difference between what GRAIL is trying to do and what some of the other players are trying to do is that some of the tests that exist in the market today are patient-specific tests. And so the way it works is you do a tumor profile on a particular patient's cancer and you -- based on the tissue sample you take from that patient, and then you create the test for that cancer patient. Then you -- and you run that as a blood test then going forward. So a terrific test, very important, very groundbreaking, but because you're taking a tissue sample and you're building a patient-specific test, it does take some time.
GRAIL is using a different approach. They're basing their MRD test on their screening test, which means it isn't patient specific, that it's the single blood test that they use for screening that they're using for MRD as well. That should significantly compress the time frame in terms of having that test available for a patient and doesn't require a tissue biopsy. And so we think they have a differentiated view in the market, and we're excited about bringing that to the market as well and giving patients the choice. Over the last few weeks, GRAIL announced some important partnerships. So at JPMorgan, we talked about the fact that GRAIL announced partnerships with Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb as partners for its MRD test, obviously, a terrific set of partners and continues to show good momentum around the development of that test of GRAIL."

With regards to pull-through on the mid-throughput and low throughput, Derik, so starting with NextSeq, we will not yet give a pull-through expectation for NextSeq. There's a lot of moving parts there, as you know, with regards to NextSeq 2000, the introduction being fairly recently at the end of Q1 of last year, with the NextSeq 1000 coming into the mix as well late in the year. And so those will have an impact on NextSeq 550, and we're still evaluating what the potential pull-through would look like in terms of NextSeq 2000. So it would be premature right now to give a guidance range around what the pull-through expectation is there.
With regards to low throughput, MiSeq and MiniSeq as well. MiSeq was impacted by the pandemic in 2020. So usually, we give a guidance range of 40,000 to 45,000 per box on MiSeq. It was impacted by the pandemic in 2020, so it was well below that. And then it started to approach that lower end of the range towards the end of 2020 in terms of the high 30s. So right now, we're expecting somewhere, for MiSeq, close to 35,000 to 40,000 in terms of MiSeq pull-through per box for 2021. With regards to MiniSeq, usually, the range is 20,000 to 25,000, and we are expecting to be on the low end of that range for MiniSeq."

The go-to-market plan for GRAIL, and you started to see glimpses of this, is not going to be to build this big direct-to-physician sales force necessarily. The initial plan for GRAIL is to sell to -- it's a B2B model, right, to sell to health systems, national health systems like the deal they talked about with the NHS, for example, but also integrated health systems in the U.S. to sell to concierge health systems and to sell to self-insured employers. And so that's an enterprise sale, a B2B sale. So similar to what we do at Illumina, obviously, a little bit different, but we also have an enterprise sales force. And so that's the intent with GRAIL going forward.
And while there might be some patient advocacy and some education, I think one of the advantages that GRAIL have relative to some of the tests in the market today is that it's a blood test. And it doesn't require a lot of pushing to get people to be compliant with the test that they have to take home, for example. And so it's a little bit of a different model that they're using. Again, they are using that model today. So they have sort of an IDE from the FDA, and they are returning results to patients in some really top-tier health care systems, like the [ Cleveland ] and so on. And so that's the model that they are refining. That's the model that's going to be rolled out at the NHS. And so that's the model we expect to continue going forward."

One, we're now starting to see sort of the next wave of adoption in the clinical market in China. And so we're seeing more hospitals embrace sequencing in their own hospital labs. And so that's sort of a wave that started to grow last year and, certainly, sort of picking up as we entered this year. That was part of the reason why this last quarter in Q4 was the highest quarter we've had for instruments since 2017 when we launched NovaSeq. And that was driven partially by hospitals starting to embrace sequencing and sort of bringing it into their labs.
We are seeing COVID drive some purchasing of sequencing. We talked about the fact that, again, we got called into Wuhan in December 2019. We've been involved since then as part of their pandemic-fighting efforts. That's a part of this business. And again, it's part of a durable surveillance infrastructure that's being built out. And then we continue to be long-term excited about the opportunity in China. And you saw us, for example, announce the partnership with one of the top venture capital firms in China, Sequioa Capital China, to launch a genomic incubator in China, to catalyze the next-generation of exciting genomics applications that leverage Illumina's sequencing technology."

It's too early to size the surveillance opportunity, I think, is sort of the short answer. But in terms of how to think about this, I think it's done right, it's significantly bigger than what we have today with the flu. And obviously, this pandemic was sort of a wake-up moment from so many perspectives. I'll give you one example. We were talking to officials from the U.S. government at some point in sort of late Q1, early Q2, and there was a realization that we have the coronavirus spreading in the U.S. for weeks, and people were dying, maybe months, and we didn't even know that we had it. And that's a huge wake-up call because that's important not just for a coronavirus pandemic but it has implications around surveillance for bioterrorism, for example. And so the wake-up call is to say, look, we need the surveillance infrastructure, and we need a global surveillance infrastructure. It's got to be genomic-based, and it's got to watch for emerging antimicrobial resistance, new pathogens, bioterrorism. The scope of that is significantly bigger than flu tracking that happens today. 
The other interesting dynamic that's playing out is this is absolutely a public health infrastructure, essential for public health, absolutely. But it's also a defense infrastructure. And the 2 are funded very differently, right? So public health, as you know, goes from panic to starvation, right? So there's the panic, infrastructure that gets built and then maybe doesn't always get the funding follow-through. Defense is not like that. And so this is going to be a combination of both. It's going to be a public health infrastructure, and it's going to be part of the national defense infrastructure. And so if you think about this long term, it's definitely got a scope that's significantly bigger in terms of thinking than what we do with flu today."

They're going as fast as they can to get the product out with the quality they need, especially given the important work that our customers do with our products. So while I'd love to, the reality is we can't pull P1 forward, although I know people really, really want it. And that's true across our entire portfolio. And I think you're right, it will actually have -- it will have really an important role to play even in surveillance.
I think your second question was around the partnerships that we were looking to do with other customers in the oncology diagnostics space that we're looking to get into screening. And we're making progress with those customers. We've signed supply agreements, long-term supply agreements, with some of those customers and continuing dialogue with the remaining customers. And so our commitment is to continue to supply them with the technology they need and make sure that they have all equal access to the technologies that we commercialize going forward.

Illumina had a strong finish to 2020, with both revenue and orders setting new records. Fourth quarter revenue of $953 million was up 20% sequentially from the third quarter.

Fourth quarter revenue of $953 million was up 20% sequentially from the third quarter. Sequencing instruments grew 29% quarter-over-quarter. We also booked the second-highest NovaSeq units during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the August launch of our v1.5 reagents. v1.5 resulted in higher new customer growth as well as additional HiSeq conversions. NovaSeq continues to be the market-leading sequencer as it enters its 5th year since launch.
Full year 2020 revenue of $3.2 billion declined 9% year-over-year, with the largest impact in the pandemic in the second quarter. Our business accelerated in the second half of the year, growing 17% compared to the first half. In 2020, we shipped more than 2,000 sequencing systems, setting another record for mid-throughput shipments and added more than 700 new customers, which exceeded our expectation.
I'd like to share some fourth quarter highlights by platform, starting with our high throughput systems. NovaSeq consumable pull-through was at its highest level of the year at over $1.2 million per instrument. We expect NovaSeq flow-through to continue at pre-pandemic levels of $1.1 million to $1.2 million per year in 2021. The NovaSeq v1.5 reagent introduction is catalyzing a new wave of high-throughput customers as a $600 genome became a reality for labs of any size. In fact, over half our NovaSeq system orders in 2020 were to new high-throughput customers. This includes customers like Argentina's Ministry of Health, which purchased NovaSeq for infectious disease research.
v1.5 introduction also accelerated the purchasing time line for CellCarta, a contract research organization and a new to high-throughput customer who plans to use their NovaSeq to support oncology clinical trials. The v1.5 reagents are also strengthening the economic case for legacy HiSeq customers to upgrade, like the University of Oregon who is using NovaSeq for large, single cell and epigenetic studies. We ended the year with about 1,000 active HiSeq units. And in 2021, we expect continued HiSeq to NovaSeq adoption among the 320 customers yet to transition.
Moving to mid-throughput. 2020 marked the second consecutive year of record placements, and the mid-throughput segment continues to provide durable growth in our core business. Fourth quarter strength was primarily driven by the successful launches of NextSeq 1000 and 2000, which also drove an increase in mid-throughput consumables revenue for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect continued NextSeq expansion in 2021, particularly in the clinical segment. Notably, we received NMPA approval in China for NextSeqDx, driving demand in local hospitals and applications like oncology and infectious disease testing. We expect this approval to drive NextSeqDx placements and further increase our clinical presence in 2021.
We added more than 500 new low-throughput customers in 2020, bringing our total to more than 6,100 customers worldwide. Our platforms hold the largest set of flow cell configurations and enable the most expansive set of supported methods with run times as fast as 5 hours. In the fourth quarter, we had record low-throughput consumable revenue driven by customers like Invitae of products in development using MiSeqDX.
I'll now provide updates on our clinical and research and applied segments. Total sequencing consumables revenue of $2 billion was down 2% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on academic and research institutions. By the fourth quarter of 2020, clinical sequencing run rates actually exceeded pre-pandemic levels, and research run rates also returned to normalized pre-pandemic volumes. It was great to see how our customers successfully rebounded under these challenging circumstances. More than 43% of our sequencing consumable shipments in 2020 were to clinical customers, which includes testing for oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease. Clinical testing proved durable during the pandemic, with clinical consumables growing about 8% year-over-year to approximately $890 million in 2020. And in the fourth quarter, clinical consumables growth accelerated to over 20% year-over-year.
In clinical, I'll highlight first the tremendous progress made in market access and reimbursement. We believe recent landmark coverage decisions will drive greater adoption of next-generation sequencing to new levels over the next several years. In oncology, 205 million lives are now covered for tumor-comprehensive genomic profiling in the U.S. And with an increasing number of targeted oncology therapies, we expect CGP to grow to be a $1 billion-plus market by 2026. Additionally, Germany recently started covering tumor CGP and whole exome and whole genome for rare and undiagnosed genetic disease without restrictions. This means that 73 million lives will have better access to CGP and whole exome and whole genome testing. In reproductive health, with multiple large payers expanding coverage for all pregnancies, we expect NIPT coverage in the U.S. to exceed 3 million pregnancies by the end of 2021. And finally, whole genome sequencing coverage for genetic disease testing increased tenfold in 2020. And we expect WGS to become the standard of care in genetic disease as awareness and reimbursement continues to grow.
With these positive reimbursement trends as a backstop, I will now discuss our clinical focus areas in a little more detail. Oncology testing continues to represent approximately 20% of total sequencing consumables, and it grew year-over-year driven by companies like Guardant Health who expanded its mobile phlebotomy services to help patients access its Guardant360 liquid biopsy test during the pandemic. This also includes Genomic Health and the NHS that adopted NovaSeq comprehensive genomic profiling as a standard of care in the U.K. And oncology centers like Florida Cancer Specialists, a private community oncology and hematology practice, with nearly 100 offices throughout Florida. Florida Cancer Specialists purchased multiple NextSeqDx systems in 2020 to run Illumina's TruSight Oncology 500 assay in its new lab. Reproductive health represented about 12% of sequencing consumables, with revenue and samples for our end-to-end VeriSeq NIPT solution growing over 20% in 2020.
Lastly, about 10% of our sequencing consumables revenue is related to genetic disease testing. Customers continue to choose Illumina's highly accurate and scalable sequencers as their platform of choice in this area. For example, the recent collaboration between Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, in partnership with the New York Genome Center, will use Illumina technology for clinical WGS in areas like cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.
Turning to our research and applied segment. Revenue of approximately $1.2 billion represented just under 57% of our sequencing consumable shipments and was lower by about 6% year-over-year as customers were impacted by the pandemic. Research accelerated in the second half, growing 20% compared to the first half as researchers return to their labs. This segment includes research in oncology and genetic disease as well as population genomic and research initiatives. Our sequencers-enabled programs like K-DNA, a large-scale Korean project aiming to sequence 1 million genomes by 2030. A service provider consortium, standardized on Illumina technology, won the competitive tender based on NovaSeq's superior technical evaluation. The program plans to complete a 7,500-genome Phase I by the end of the year.
The NHS commenced a phased rollout for whole genome sequencing in the fourth quarter for selected rare disease and cancer patients as part of their routine care. Once this live clinical testing phase is complete, we expect the whole genome sequencing service to further ramp in the spring. We expect the All of Us program to continue to scale this year. And the NIH anticipates releasing de-identified data from 100,000 sequence and array genotype samples to its research portal by the end of 2021.
Finally, as a leading innovator, Illumina remains steadfast in the defense of our intellectual property globally. We received injunctions against BGI for patent infringement in the U.S., Germany, U.K., Spain, Sweden and Finland. We remain confident that our IP portfolio affords strong protection for Illumina's innovation now and well into the future.
And now I'll turn it over to Sam."
29753,702208890,2207182,"Illumina, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Francis. As Francis discussed, we had record fourth quarter revenue that grew slightly year-over-year to $953 million driven by 1% growth in sequencing, offset by an 8% decline in microarrays.Total sequencing revenue reached a record of $846",1030,"Thank you, Francis. As Francis discussed, we had record fourth quarter revenue that grew slightly year-over-year to $953 million driven by 1% growth in sequencing, offset by an 8% decline in microarrays.
Total sequencing revenue reached a record of $846 million, which represented 89% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 and grew 19% sequentially. Sequencing consumables revenue grew 5% compared to the prior year period and 20% sequentially. Sequencing instruments revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and grew 29% sequentially. And sequencing service and other was down 15% compared to the prior year period due to IVD partnership revenue recognized last year.
Moving to regional results. The Americas revenue grew 14% sequentially. Revenue in the region was 2% lower compared to the prior year quarter, which was primarily driven by onetime technology access fees for an IVD partnership and lower DTC revenue. These items were partially offset by sequencing consumables. The Americas had record sequencing product revenue in the fourth quarter driven by clinical customers.
EMEA delivered record revenue of $285 million, representing 34% sequential growth and 2% growth year-over-year, driven by strong instrument revenue from NovaSeq. We also saw certain customers in emerging countries taking their first NovaSeq shipments.
Greater China grew 16% sequentially and 3% year-over-year to $96 million and had its highest sequencing instrument revenue quarter since 2017 driven in part by growing demand in hospitals. Subsequent to Q4, we also announced the Sequoia Capital China genomics incubator, which builds on our other incubator efforts in Silicon Valley and the U.K. Together, we will partner with leading entrepreneurs in China to build genomic start-up companies that create breakthrough genomics applications and clinical sequencing solutions.
Finally, APJ revenue of $77 million was up 24% sequentially and up 5% from the prior year period. For the full year, the region was roughly flat compared to 2019 with full year growth in sequencing consumables.
Moving to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders.
As expected, non-GAAP gross margin of 66.9% decreased approximately 50 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was down 330 basis points, primarily due to a onetime inventory write-down in Q4, onetime IVD partnership revenue in the year ago quarter and higher freight costs related to COVID-19. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $439 million were up $74 million sequentially, as expected, reflecting the extra week in the fourth quarter, variable compensation expenses and other investments. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.9%, down from 21.4% in the third quarter. Non-GAAP other income of $20 million was $13 million higher sequentially due to gains on short-term investments sold as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition.
The non-GAAP tax rate of 18.4% was up from last quarter due to a discrete charge related to a tax structure initiative in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase of our tax rate in Q4 was also impacted by discrete tax benefits in the third quarter of 2020 related to prior year return adjustments.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net income was $257 million or $1.75 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $179 million or $1.22 per diluted share.
Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $406 million. DSO is 50 days compared to 53 days last quarter driven by revenue linearity. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $62 million, and free cash flow was $344 million. We repurchased $280 million of stock in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with approximately $3.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 147 million.
Moving now to 2021 guidance. We expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 17% to 20% or $3.79 billion to $3.89 billion, representing an increase of approximately $599 million at the midpoint. For the full year of 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 20%. This includes sequencing consumable growth of around 20%. We expect sequencing system revenue to grow 33% year-over-year driven by placements of NovaSeq due to continued HiSeq conversions and the adoption of v1.5 reagents as well as placements of NextSeq due to NextSeq 2000 and DX demand and arrays to grow approximately 5% compared to 2020.
We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to modestly improve from 2020, reflecting increased leverage from higher volumes and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by product mix and IVD partnership revenue in the first quarter of 2020. We expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 24%. As volumes increase and freight charges normalize, we expect both gross and operating margins to improve in the second half of 2021 and be above the full year average.
We expect other income to be about $40 million lower than 2020 due to the gains in the fourth quarter of 2020, lower interest rates and shorter duration investments in anticipation of the close of the GRAIL acquisition. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.76 to $5.01 and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.10 to $5.35. And we expect diluted shares outstanding in 2021 to be approximately 147 million.
Moving to the first quarter of 2021, we are raising our previous expectations, and we now expect high single-digit revenue growth compared to the first quarter of 2020. We expect sequential improvement in non-GAAP gross margin; sequential decline in non-GAAP operating expenses, similar to historical seasonality; non-GAAP other income to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the onetime gain on short-term investments previously discussed and, as a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks."

We're seeing strength in our core business and are playing an essential role in the emerging surveillance effort necessary to fight the pandemic. In the past couple of months, as new, more dangerous SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, there has been a growing recognition of the need for COVID surveillance around the globe, with countries like the U.K., Australia, Canada and Germany leading the way in deploying national surveillance infrastructures. In the U.S. The proposed budget package contains $1.75 billion for the CDC to conduct, expand and improve activities to sequence genomes, identify mutations and survey the transmission of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
Sequencing-based surveillance is one of the key elements in the fight against this pandemic. And it's also becoming clear that sequencing and surveillance are becoming mainstream in the defense against infectious disease. This global surveillance infrastructure being built right now will be instrumental in identifying future outbreaks, including coronaviruses, antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. Illumina is proud to be at the forefront of this important work.
We'd also like to congratulate Nobel Laureate and Illumina Board member, Dr. Frances Arnold, who was named as Co-Chair of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors in Science and Technology. We believe the recent appointment of highly experienced scientists signal the administration's focus on science, including genomics, to improve life in the U.S. for everyone.
Finally, we continue to expect to close the GRAIL acquisition in the second half of this year, enabling us to help accelerate the adoption of early cancer detection screening and opening up the largest application for genomics by far. We're looking forward to GRAIL launching Galleri in Q2.
We see a vast number of opportunities ahead of us. And there has never been a more exciting time to be in genomics and at Illumina. Now I'll invite the operator to open up for Q&A."

And then secondarily, I was hoping that you could walk through in terms of your sequencing guidance for next year, Francis, in terms of the NovaSeq success that you've had thus far. Of the remaining HiSeq existing customers that haven't converted, can you give a little more color kind of what's baked in, in terms of the new v1.5 launch and how many of those you expect to convert and kind of what's impacted in your guidance?"

Basically, we're expecting roughly 24% operating margin. So there is an element of OpEx growth in there. And part of that is a onetime also impact related to stock-based compensation that we talked about at JPMorgan when we provided the guide, which is related to 2 plans for -- the '19 and '20 plans that were significantly impacted by the pandemic and that we are modifying the targets on those plans. So that has a onetime catch-up expense in 2021 of approximately $50 million to $55 million, and that's really a significant portion of the OpEx growth. Beyond that, we are continuing to invest behind our platforms, behind our technologies, behind our assays so -- which we are committed to. R&D is a big commitment for us.
As we look forward, Dan, our goal is to continue to improve in terms of the leverage on our operating margin to get back to traditional operating margin levels that we had back in '19, which were close to 30%. That will take some time to get back to. But that's a commitment that we have, is to continue to drive operating leverage by making sure that we're very actively focused on G&A investments and reducing -- or making sure that those continue to grow beyond the rate of growth in revenues. But then we continue to invest in R&D and, to some extent, commercial as well. But we are committed over the long term to get back into operating leverage. And in fact, in the second half as well of the year, as we get past the pandemic, the second half, we expect to see an improvement in terms of both gross margin and operating margin versus the first half and definitely higher than the full year as well for gross margin and operating margin."

So Dan, now I'll take your question about NovaSeq this year and touch specifically also on the remaining HiSeq customers and how we're thinking about it this year. So I'll start by saying that, look, we're entering this year with a lot of momentum on NovaSeq. The version 1.5 NovaSeq reagents that we released in August really did a nice job in terms of unlocking the elasticity of demand in that high-throughput segment of the market. And so as we talked about, coming into this year, we're coming off a Q4 where, in our first quarter of selling the version 1.5 reagents, NovaSeq consumables had a record, growing mid-teens year-over-year, so very strong from a consumable perspective.
And we talked about the fact that in Q4, we also had our second-highest order in terms of bookings orders for NovaSeq. And the first highest was when we first launched NovaSeq back in 2017. So both from an instruments perspective and a consumables perspective, we're coming off a really strong Q4, and we're walking into this year with a really strong pipeline and a strong backlog following the orders that came in, in Q4. So as we think about this year then, there are 2 sources of demand we see for NovaSeq. One, and we talked about this in Q4 also, that we're seeing, because of 1.5, really an unlocking of demand from new to high-throughput customers. And if you think about it, in Q4, over half the bookings went to new to high-throughput customers. So again, that new pricing is opening up the market for new customers to come in.
And the other source of demand for NovaSeq coming into this year is the remaining HiSeq customers. And as we pointed out, there are -- of our original HiSeq base, we still have 320 customers that have yet to begin the upgrade cycle. And now with the lower pricing on 1.5, these typically smaller core labs now have a NovaSeq accessible to them. And if you look at the pricing now, all it takes for a HiSeq 2500 customer is for them to run about 4 high-output kits a month, and they can justify the list price of a NovaSeq in a year. In addition, with the 1.5 release, we extended the shelf life of the consumables from 3 months to 6 months, so they don't have to sequence as frequently to justify the upgrade. And then, finally, the new 35-cycle S4 kits also enables counting method now on the NovaSeq, which was important to those labs. So you add all those in, and we're walking into this year with strong momentum on the NovaSeq side, and that's what we expect to drive orders this year. In fact, we're expecting another strong year of NovaSeq orders coming into 2021."

And then how much of the record order book was catch-up spending versus, Francis, what you just talked about, the acceleration and adoption driven by the flow cell? And then I'm curious why margins were so soft. You did have the price adjustments, the inventory write-down and stock-based comp, but it seems like maybe there was more there. I'm curious if you're kind of pulling forward any spending.
And then secondly, shifting to the outlook, it's good to see you're stepping up the first quarter guidance here versus what you gave at our conference. I'm just curious if there was something that changed in your outlook. The original guidance of down 9% to 10%, obviously, didn't really make a ton of sense. So this is more of what I think people had been expecting anyway, but I'm curious what drove that. And then Francis, more broadly, I'm wondering if you can comment on the surveillance opportunity, just how material you think that could be and how much of that you think ends up getting done on short versus long read?"

So maybe I'll cover a couple of the points that you mentioned upfront, Tycho, and I'll let Francis talk about the surveillance aspect. So I think there's a lot there. So hopefully, I'll capture everything here. But in terms of Q4 stocking, listen, we had a very strong quarter in Q4. We did not see any unusual stocking beyond what you see traditionally at the year-end. I mean there's usually a reset of budgets at the end of Q4, academic budgets at the end of the year. So beyond what we usually see every year, we have not seen any unusual stocking in Q4.
And we validate this by looking at, basically, activity on our sequencers. We look at the activity, the data that we have, looking at all the active sequencers that we have that are connected. And in fact, we saw a strong increase in terms of activity levels in Q4 in terms of clinical, getting back and showing growth pre-pandemic levels and in terms of research now going basically at pre-pandemic levels. So pleased to see that and -- which validates that there wasn't any unusual stocking at the end of Q4.
In terms of gross margin, I think we talked about the drivers, Tycho. I mean we're still impacted by the pandemic. Freight is still a factor for us in Q4. We did have the onetime write-down on certain inventory, which was approximately a percentage point impact negatively on gross margin. And mix was an impact as well in Q4 because we had strong instruments in the quarter as well. So those are the things that impacted margins in Q4. We expect margins to improve in Q1, to progressively improve across 2021 and, in the second half, in fact, to be, as I said earlier, above the full year average and starting to get back to our -- what we call our normal levels of 70% plus -- not quite at 70% but close to that in the second half. So we definitely see that as we start to get out of the constraints driven by the pandemic and which resulted in higher freight and other higher expenses.
With regards to Q1 outlook, we are pleased to be raising our Q1 outlook based on what we're seeing. We're seeing strength in the business. We're seeing strength in activity levels. Again, too early to comment specifically. It's been 4 weeks since the start of the year. But everything that we're seeing in terms of orders is really encouraging. So we are pleased with where the business has started."

So you're right, Tycho, this is a significant raise for us in terms of what we were expecting for Q1 given what we shared at JPMorgan. And at JPMorgan, what we shared was very typical for our business and other players in our business, which is sequentially, from Q4 to Q1, because of the capital cycle, you expect a decrease in revenue. And that's what we called and we said, look, you should expect us to be flat to Q1 of last year. But we're seeing a lot more strength even in the first few weeks of the quarter. And that strength is coming from our core business, as Sam said, and we're monitoring both -- not just orders, but we're monitoring activity levels. And exiting Q4 and into Q1, we're seeing strong activity levels both from the clinical side of the business but also on the research side of the business.
And so as we stand here, it's become clear to us that instead of being flat to a year ago, we're going to be up high single digits. And so we're coming pretty close to where we were in Q4. That's unusual in this business, but it really speaks to the strength that we're seeing in terms of orders coming in. Obviously, there's a lot of the year left, and so we're leaving the year guidance intact but, certainly, with strength in Q1.
In terms of surveillance, surveillance is something we've been talking about now for about a year. And the idea is that, in addition to rolling out testing infrastructure to fight this pandemic, you will need surveillance infrastructure to understand how the virus is spreading geographically and how it's mutating. And that information about mutations are essential to understand that the tools we're using to fight the pandemic, the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies, will continue to be effective. And really once the outbreak we started to see around Christmas of the B-117 variants in the U.K. and then the South African variant, that started to really get people to realize that we do need the surveillance infrastructure.
So it didn't contribute much in terms of revenue in Q4, and we've only built in a modest amount in Q1. But you can see the activity, right? You can see the activity in COG-UK. You can see the activity in countries around the world, in France, in Germany, in Italy and Spain and really sort of around the world. And we expect that to continue over the course of this year as countries build out the surveillance infrastructures. And that's going to be a durable surveillance infrastructure. We're going to need it in the future to warn us of the next pandemic, to warn us of bioterrorist attacks, antimicrobial resistance.
And what's interesting is that Illumina's technology is uniquely well suited for this need. And the reason for that is because we have unmatched accuracy. We can deliver at the highest scale. We can deliver the price point per sample that's necessary. And we also have the first cleared product for our customers to use. And so those things came together. And you'll see that playing out in the numbers, right? So right at the very beginning, we were the sequencer used in Wuhan. And then in Shanghai to publish the first viral genome. It was Illumina sequencing data that was used by the vaccine developers to develop the vaccines, the mRNA vaccines that are being used today. And that was because of the accuracy of the Illumina sequencing.
And now as you look at the large-scale initiatives, COG-UK and some of the other ones, it's Illumina sequencers that's being used because of the scale that we can achieve and the throughput and the turnaround time. And so you look at the numbers of the genomes in GISAID, for example, and you will see that the vast majority of the data in GISAID, the vast majority of the genomes that have been sequenced have been done on Illumina sequencers. And so very exciting, very important, starting now."

There's a couple of things I could think of, maybe it's just early in the year, uncertainty especially as we're coming out of the pandemic. Maybe it's the expectation for a lot more boxes being placed, which can pressure pull-through at least initially on an average basis.

We were back to above pre-pandemic levels, actually at the high end of the guidance range in terms of pre pandemic levels. We do expect with the v1.5 that you will have -- that it will catalyze significant HiSeq conversion with those 320 remaining HiSeq customers, so those will start to also transition to NovaSeq. That has, I would say, a very -- a modest impact on pull-through on the downside, but also you have the large centers that will drive pull-through higher on the upside.
And -- but as you said, we're still in a pandemic year. The first 6 months of the year are expected to still be basically a pandemic reality, so to speak.

As you mentioned, additional market access and coverage for both on the NIPT side, on the genetic disease side, we're seeing definitely growth in the comprehensive genomic profiling on the oncology side, the v1.5 is a great introduction.
The COVID variance part, Puneet, we have not really assumed a significant impact of that in our guide. That's something that we're really encouraged by in terms of the surveillance aspect. We are seeing definitely strength from that. But again, a bit early to really size that for the full year. So that's not significantly included in our guide, I would say.

It's going to be sort of our first global this year virtual customer event that we will have at the tail end of April. It's shaping up to be a terrific event. And we have some fabulous speakers, and we have tracks for different segments of our customer base. So there'll be a track, for example, on population sequencing where we will convene some of the largest population sequencing initiatives around the world to come together, share best practices and learn from each other. And we'll do the same thing on oncology testing and so on.
I suspect where you were going with that, Puneet, was so are we going to announce anything at the customer event. And I've been on the record of saying I'd love to announce products in front of customers rather than in front of bankers. But obviously, I can't say what we're going to do in terms of product road maps. As a company, we don't preannounce products. What we did announce recently the P1 flow cell. On the NextSeq, we announced ICA, the connected analytics platform at JPMorgan, which is seeing a really nice traction in population sequencing efforts. And obviously, the v1.5. So you'll just have to stay tuned in terms of what we announced when.
In terms of the GRAIL -- just MRD in general and the GRAIL MRD test. We are very excited about the impact on the patient side from having an MRD test. We think that that will improve life for cancer patients, enable them to catch recurrence earlier. And that's going to be an important market and is a big opportunity. But as you said, there are 2 customers already of ours that have MRD tests. We will support them. We want to make sure they're hugely successful because this is an important segment and a large segment as a genomics application as well. So we'll continue to do everything we can to make sure they're successful.
We're also excited about GRAIL's MRD test. And GRAIL has a little bit of a different take on their approach on MRD. And the difference between what GRAIL is trying to do and what some of the other players are trying to do is that some of the tests that exist in the market today are patient-specific tests. And so the way it works is you do a tumor profile on a particular patient's cancer and you -- based on the tissue sample you take from that patient, and then you create the test for that cancer patient. Then you -- and you run that as a blood test then going forward. So a terrific test, very important, very groundbreaking, but because you're taking a tissue sample and you're building a patient-specific test, it does take some time.
GRAIL is using a different approach. They're basing their MRD test on their screening test, which means it isn't patient specific, that it's the single blood test that they use for screening that they're using for MRD as well. That should significantly compress the time frame in terms of having that test available for a patient and doesn't require a tissue biopsy. And so we think they have a differentiated view in the market, and we're excited about bringing that to the market as well and giving patients the choice. Over the last few weeks, GRAIL announced some important partnerships. So at JPMorgan, we talked about the fact that GRAIL announced partnerships with Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb as partners for its MRD test, obviously, a terrific set of partners and continues to show good momentum around the development of that test of GRAIL."

So first one I would just want to talk about is, can you talk a little bit about the culture expectations for the mid-range instruments for the NextSeq and MiSeq as you look into '21? I appreciate the color on the NovaSeq, but some commentary there would be helpful, particularly, I think on the NextSeq as you're sort of placing more instruments on the 2000 and 1000 side. And then the other side -- the other question is a follow-up on Doug's. Can you talk a little bit on GRAIL in terms of thinking about how you're going to do with sales and marketing plan here and how you're going to address customers? I mean do you need to go out and build or buy a more primary care sales force given where your current business is not exactly targeting that market? I'm just sort of curious in terms of your commercialization plans and how you think about the go-to-market strategy."

With regards to pull-through on the mid-throughput and low throughput, Derik, so starting with NextSeq, we will not yet give a pull-through expectation for NextSeq. There's a lot of moving parts there, as you know, with regards to NextSeq 2000, the introduction being fairly recently at the end of Q1 of last year, with the NextSeq 1000 coming into the mix as well late in the year. And so those will have an impact on NextSeq 550, and we're still evaluating what the potential pull-through would look like in terms of NextSeq 2000. So it would be premature right now to give a guidance range around what the pull-through expectation is there.
With regards to low throughput, MiSeq and MiniSeq as well. MiSeq was impacted by the pandemic in 2020. So usually, we give a guidance range of 40,000 to 45,000 per box on MiSeq. It was impacted by the pandemic in 2020, so it was well below that. And then it started to approach that lower end of the range towards the end of 2020 in terms of the high 30s. So right now, we're expecting somewhere, for MiSeq, close to 35,000 to 40,000 in terms of MiSeq pull-through per box for 2021. With regards to MiniSeq, usually, the range is 20,000 to 25,000, and we are expecting to be on the low end of that range for MiniSeq."

So let me start by saying that post acquisition, the intent is to run GRAIL as a separate division. So it's going to have its own sort of end-to-end infrastructure. The go-to-market plan for GRAIL, and you started to see glimpses of this, is not going to be to build this big direct-to-physician sales force necessarily. The initial plan for GRAIL is to sell to -- it's a B2B model, right, to sell to health systems, national health systems like the deal they talked about with the NHS, for example, but also integrated health systems in the U.S. to sell to concierge health systems and to sell to self-insured employers. And so that's an enterprise sale, a B2B sale. So similar to what we do at Illumina, obviously, a little bit different, but we also have an enterprise sales force. And so that's the intent with GRAIL going forward.
And while there might be some patient advocacy and some education, I think one of the advantages that GRAIL have relative to some of the tests in the market today is that it's a blood test. And it doesn't require a lot of pushing to get people to be compliant with the test that they have to take home, for example. And so it's a little bit of a different model that they're using. Again, they are using that model today. So they have sort of an IDE from the FDA, and they are returning results to patients in some really top-tier health care systems, like the [ Cleveland ] and so on. And so that's the model that they are refining. That's the model that's going to be rolled out at the NHS. And so that's the model we expect to continue going forward."

And so that's sort of a wave that started to grow last year and, certainly, sort of picking up as we entered this year. That was part of the reason why this last quarter in Q4 was the highest quarter we've had for instruments since 2017 when we launched NovaSeq. And that was driven partially by hospitals starting to embrace sequencing and sort of bringing it into their labs.
We are seeing COVID drive some purchasing of sequencing. We talked about the fact that, again, we got called into Wuhan in December 2019. We've been involved since then as part of their pandemic-fighting efforts. That's a part of this business. And again, it's part of a durable surveillance infrastructure that's being built out.

It's too early to size the surveillance opportunity, I think, is sort of the short answer. But in terms of how to think about this, I think it's done right, it's significantly bigger than what we have today with the flu. And obviously, this pandemic was sort of a wake-up moment from so many perspectives. I'll give you one example. We were talking to officials from the U.S. government at some point in sort of late Q1, early Q2, and there was a realization that we have the coronavirus spreading in the U.S. for weeks, and people were dying, maybe months, and we didn't even know that we had it. And that's a huge wake-up call because that's important not just for a coronavirus pandemic but it has implications around surveillance for bioterrorism, for example. And so the wake-up call is to say, look, we need the surveillance infrastructure, and we need a global surveillance infrastructure. It's got to be genomic-based, and it's got to watch for emerging antimicrobial resistance, new pathogens, bioterrorism. The scope of that is significantly bigger than flu tracking that happens today. 
The other interesting dynamic that's playing out is this is absolutely a public health infrastructure, essential for public health, absolutely. But it's also a defense infrastructure. And the 2 are funded very differently, right? So public health, as you know, goes from panic to starvation, right? So there's the panic, infrastructure that gets built and then maybe doesn't always get the funding follow-through. Defense is not like that. And so this is going to be a combination of both. It's going to be a public health infrastructure, and it's going to be part of the national defense infrastructure. And so if you think about this long term, it's definitely got a scope that's significantly bigger in terms of thinking than what we do with flu today."

As we shared in our pre announcement, Illumina had a very strong start to 2021, with the first $1 billion quarter in Illumina's history. We achieved first quarter revenue of $1.093 billion, growing 27% compared to the prior year and 15% from the last quarter. Sequencing revenue was especially strong, up 29% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by accelerating growth in our core business, with both clinical and research customers exceeding pre-COVID activity levels. In addition, we're seeing global investment in the creation of a genomic epidemiology infrastructure to combat COVID-19 as well as monitor for future pathogen outbreaks. 
I'd like to share some additional first quarter highlights by platform. Beginning with our high throughput platforms, NovaSeq drove a significant share of the exceptional performance, achieving its highest first quarter placements on record, which is remarkable as it enters its fifth year since launch. We continue to see the positive impact of our v1.5 reagents, enabling both new high throughput customers as well as continued conversions from our existing HiSeq customer base. Our mid-throughput platforms drove additional growth with a 23% increase in consumables revenue compared to last year. We saw continued success for NextSeq 1000 and 2000 as well as strong performance from NextSeq 550. Notably, we saw an increase in customers upgrading from their existing Illumina benchtop sequencers to NextSeq 1000 and 2000. Clinical customers continue to drive new NextSeq 550 placements, with NextSeqDx recording its highest shipment quarter to date. 
In China, where the instrument received NMPA approval in Q4, we're seeing strong adoption in the hospital setting as we work with IVD development partners like Burning Rock, Bio San and MatriDx, to provide comprehensive clinical solutions. Additionally, working with our strategic partner, R Pharm, NextSeqDx received medical device registration in Russia in March, enabling the clinical use of next-generation sequencing for more patients across Russia. 
Our low throughput portfolio revenue had another strong quarter, growing 33% year-over-year, with robust growth in both sequencing consumables and instrument shipments in Q1. MiSeq, MiniSeq and HiSeq all generated year-over-year and sequential growth in consumables as well as instrument placements. Our low-throughput platforms continue to be a compelling entry point for new-to-NGS customers with an ever-increasing number of use cases. One interesting customer example is [ Blue and Lou ], a start-up using our technology in the development of cell-cultured seafood to support sustainability in oceanic diversity. Additionally, these instruments play a critical role in catalyzing localized COVID surveillance programs across the globe. 
Turning to our clinical and research and applied segments. Total sequencing consumables revenue of $695 million was up 26% year-over-year, demonstrating strong demand for sequencing across both clinical and research segments. More than 44% of our sequencing consumable shipments in the first quarter of 2021 were to clinical customers. Clinical testing showed significant growth with consumables up 35% year-over-year. These results do not include COVID surveillance, which is reported in our research and academic segment. 
Oncology testing exceeded our overall clinical growth rate and is our largest and fastest-growing clinical segment. This growth was driven by our customers benefiting from expanded access to reimbursement for NGS-based testing, particularly in comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, for therapy selection and some of the first reimbursement for sequencing-based monitoring tests. 
TruSight Oncology 500, our RUO comprehensive genomic profiling assay, continued its success this quarter, adding over 20 new customers. In February, the Belgian Society of Medical Oncology announced that they will use TSO 500 for a national pilot to evaluate the use of CGP for patients with advanced metastatic cancer. As a leading distributable CGP assay, TSO 500 continues to offer a compelling choice for our pharmaceutical partners. We announced last week an exciting new partnership with Kartos Therapeutics, to develop a TP 53 companion diagnostic, expanding the TruSight oncology offering into blood cancers. 
Beyond CGP, we've seen promising developments in the use of whole genome sequencing in cancer treatment this quarter. Most notably, a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine published by our partners at Washington University, St. Louis, showed that for AML and MDS patients studied, whole genome sequencing using Illumina technology produced more accurate results in less time and at a similar cost compared to standard techniques like fish or karyotyping. 
In reproductive health, the cascading effect of the [ Acon ] guidance on increasing coverage of NIPT for all pregnancies drove the third consecutive quarter of both year-over-year and sequential growth. In the U.S., 2 large payers, Anthem and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, expanded their coverage criteria to include twin pregnancies just last month. And in March, we reported out on the results of our groundbreaking, risk-sharing, real-world study with Harvard Pilgrim, demonstrating the cost effectiveness of offering NIPT to all pregnant women. These studies add to the building momentum for broader access to NIPT. 
International support for NIPT coverage also continues to grow, fueling the continued rapid adoption of our CE-IVD marked NIPT kit. For example, there was positive news from Italy and Sweden, where new coverage requirements were approved during the first quarter of 2021. 
Moving to genetic disease testing. Customers are choosing Illumina's highly accurate and scalable sequencers, and our growth rate in this segment exceeded the company's growth rate in Q1. We also continue to see new favorable coverage decisions being issued. This quarter, 2 major health insurers in Germany announced that they will cover the cost of whole genome and whole exome sequencing for rare disease for their over 10 million members. And Geisinger in the U.S. expanded coverage to include epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Research continues to demonstrate a 40% to 68% diagnostic year for children suspected of having a genetic disease, and whole genome sequencing is used as a [ first tier ] test. The increasing coverage of these tests will provide more patients with faster diagnoses and better care. 
Turning to our research and academic segment. We saw strong growth in the quarter compared to the prior year period as the majority of research and academic customers have returned to the lab. The pandemic and emerging variants of concern have raised awareness within governments around the world about the essential role that genomic pathogen surveillance plays in the fight against infectious disease. We're seeing investment globally in the creation of a pathogen surveillance infrastructure to manage outbreaks and improve health outcomes, including sequencing capabilities to determine the spread of pathogens, the emergence of variant strains and emerging drug or vaccine resistance. 
In the U.S., the American Rescue Plan Act includes $1.7 billion in funding for the CDC to improve sequencing capacity to identify mutation and circulation of viruses. In Europe, the EC announced EUR 123 million commitment to combat COVID variants. In India, the government launched the Indian SARS-CoV-2, Genomic Consortia, with a plan to sequence 120,000 viral genomes over the next 4 months. This investment in sequencing for national genomic surveillance activities drove approximately $55 million of incremental revenue in the first quarter, comprising of $35 million in instrument placements and $20 million in sequencing consumables. As countries around the world battle the pandemic, we expect continued investment in genomic pathogen surveillance to expand national genomic epidemiology capabilities. While the initial focus of this infrastructure is COVID surveillance, there are durable longer-term needs, including tracking future emerging natural pathogens, bio terrorism, antimicrobial drug resistance and hospital-acquired infections, and determining how host genetics can impact the risk and severity of infectious disease. While the pandemic has certainly fueled demand for our sequencing, we also believe it has established a new baseline of awareness and infrastructure build out that will support sustained activity. 
As we work through the COVID-19 pandemic, we're also seeing acceleration in several population genomics programs, expanding our presence in national health systems around the world. In the U.S., all of us ramped up sample volumes in Q1 to a level that we expect to continue throughout 2021. In Japan, the Tohoku Medical Mega Bank Organization chose Illumina sequencing for a 40,000-sample multigenerational study to take place this year. In February, Egypt announced the first population genomics program in Africa with the launch of their Egyptian genome project. This project is focused on establishing a map of the Egyptian human genome with the goal of ushering the country into the world of precision medicine. Large population health initiatives serve as 1 good example of our focus on improving the health of patients, communities and our planet. Earlier this month, we published our second annual CSR report, outlining our specific commitments to help improve our world. This 2021 report is available on our website, and notable highlights include expanded transparency on U.S. diversity demographics, climate resilience planning, disclosure on trade group membership and data assurance on energy and emissions. We look forward to continued investor feedback on the evolution of our environmental, social and governance programs. 
Our commitment to the advancement of human health is an Illumina core tenet, which brings me to GRAIL. We are pleased with the progress GRAIL is making and remain committed to pursue the completion of the GRAIL acquisition. GRAIL recently presented affirmative data from its CCGA 3 study at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting, and is expecting to launch Gallery, its breakthrough multi-cancer early detection screening test in Q2. One of the many reasons we decided to acquire GRAIL was to accelerate patient access to breakthrough multi-cancer early detection blood tests, which could save tens of thousands of lives. We are committed to supporting all our customers and strongly believe that our acquisition of GRAIL is pro competitive. We expect the acquisition to accelerate the early detection of cancer market as a whole. 
We saw a similar dynamic play out in the noninvasive prenatal testing market, where, after Illumina's entry, the market grew and prices decreased, making these important tests accessible to a much larger population of pregnant women. 
And now I'll turn it over to Sam."

Record revenue across all regions contributed to the first $1 billion quarter in the company's histo",1332,"As Francis outlined, first quarter revenue grew by 27% year-over-year to $1.093 billion, driven by 29% growth in sequencing and 15% growth in microarrays. Record revenue across all regions contributed to the first $1 billion quarter in the company's history. 
Total sequencing revenue reached a new high, with first quarter revenue of $979 million, growing 16% sequentially and representing 90% of total revenue. Sequencing consumables revenue grew 26% compared to the prior year period, driven by strong growth in clinical testing and demand for NovaSeq v1.5 flow cells. 
Most clinical and research customers are running above pre-COVID activity levels, as Francis highlighted. COVID-19 surveillance initiatives contributed approximately $20 million in sequencing consumables revenue during the first quarter. Sequencing consumables also benefited by approximately $20 million from the timing of customer purchases during the first quarter. Sequencing instruments revenue grew 123% year-over-year, with revenue of $176 million in the first quarter, reflecting strong performance across all instrument categories. The first quarter marked another consecutive quarter of record mid throughput shipments driven by strong adoption of NextSeq 1000 and 2000. 
COVID surveillance initiatives resulted in approximately $35 million of incremental instrument revenue due to some customers building additional capacity for genomic epidemiology. As expected, sequencing service and other revenue was down 16% year-over-year due to IVD partnership revenue recognized in the prior year period. Sequencing service and other was roughly flat sequentially. 
Moving to regional results. The Americas delivered revenue of $562 million with 18% growth compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strength in sequencing product revenue from clinical customers in oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing and contributions from genomic epidemiology initiatives related to COVID surveillance. These items were partially offset by lower IVD partnership revenue as expected. 
EMEA delivered revenue of $305 million, representing 38% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by strong sequencing demand for clinical testing applications that resulted in higher-than-expected sequencing consumables revenue in the first quarter and instrument demand by research customers, including initiatives for COVID surveillance and genomic epidemiology. 
Greater China revenue was $127 million, representing growth of 51% year-over-year and 32% sequentially due to continued strength in sequencing revenue driven by clinical expansion in the region and growing demand in hospitals, including the successful launch of NextSeq 550 Dx. 
Finally, APJ revenue of $99 million grew 29%, both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by sequencing consumables revenue growth in clinical applications, such as oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing as well as end of fiscal year purchases. 
Moving to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Non-GAAP gross margin of 70.5% improved sequentially by 360 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes and a onetime inventory write-down in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin decreased 250 basis points due to IVD partnership revenue in the year ago quarter, higher freight costs attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and product mix, partially offset by fixed cost leverage on higher volumes. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $420 million were up $81 million year-over-year, in line with expectations, due to increased performance-based compensation expenses, headcount growth and increased project spend during the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly down sequentially, driven by an additional week in Q4 2020, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses in Q1. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32.1%, up from 20.9% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The sequential improvement was better-than-expected due to higher revenues, gross margin and resulting increased fixed cost absorption in the quarter. Non-GAAP other expense of $3 million was $23 million lower sequentially as expected. This was due to fourth quarter gains on short-term investments that we sold as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition. In addition, we had lower interest income in the first quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate of 20.3% was up from last quarter due to tax expense on certain foreign subsidiary earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested, partly due to the capital requirements associated with funding the anticipated GRAIL acquisition. For the first quarter of 2021, GAAP net income was $147 million or $1 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $278 million or $1.89 per diluted share. 
Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $282 million, DSO of 43 days compared to 50 days last quarter, driven by revenue linearity. First quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $42 million, and free cash flow was $240 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the first quarter. We ended the year with approximately $4.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the first quarter, we received approximately $1 billion in proceeds from bond issuances to fund the anticipated GRAIL acquisition. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 147 million. 
Moving now to 2021 guidance. We expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 25% to 28% or $4.05 billion to $4.15 billion. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents an increase of approximately $858 million and a significant increase from our expectations earlier this year. For the full year 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we now expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 29% year-over-year, driven by strong orders and instrument placements. This includes sequencing consumable growth of approximately 30% compared to 2020, driven by strong demand for NovaSeq v1.5 reagents and growth in clinical markets. We expect sequencing system revenue to grow approximately 50% year-over-year, driven by NovaSeq placements to new to high throughput customers and continued HiSeq conversion in addition to mid throughput demand across our NextSeq platforms. NovaSeq pull-through to be towards the high end of our initial guidance range of $1.1 million to $1.2 million. A [ race ] to grow approximately an increased leverage on higher volumes, partially offset by product mix and IVD partnership revenue in the first quarter of 2020. We now expect 2021 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 26.5%, reflecting our higher revenue expectations and our ongoing commitment to investment in research and development. 
We continue to maintain our focus on improving our core business operating margin leverage over time. We expect non-GAAP other income to be about $60 million lower than 2020 due to the gains realized in the fourth quarter of 2020, lower interest income on shorter duration investments in anticipation of the close of the GRAIL acquisition and interest expense from our recent bond issuances. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.80 to $6.05 and GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.97. And we expect diluted shares outstanding in 2021 to be approximately 148 million. 
Moving to the second quarter of 2021, we expect revenue to be up approximately 60% year-over-year due to the broader economic recovery and strength in our core business. We expect a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP gross margin due to the higher volumes and resulting leverage. Non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be down modestly on a sequential basis due to mix and additional investments to support the higher-than-expected volume growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses did increase significantly on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to investments supporting the growth of the business and research and development as well as compensation-related expenses. Non-GAAP other expense to be modestly unfavorable on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter. Non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly lower on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.35 for the quarter and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.21 to $1.26. 
I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks."

I mean, I think the question really is, the COVID surveillance opportunity and the cadence of that as you build out the epidemiological infrastructure, how is -- what's the cadence of that? 
And appreciate that COVID is still raging in different parts of the world, U.S. vaccinations are ramping, and administration is investing $1 billion-plus in sequencing. So just wondering how much of that is baked in into this year? And how -- what sort of a tail should we see longer term there? 
And then my second one is just on GRAIL. What does the process look like next for both FTC and the European Commission directory general? What are the steps? And obviously, you're implying a second half close here. So just wondering what's the -- what are some of the next steps?"

I'll start by saying that it is -- it's exciting to see how the world is sort of moving forward with putting out a surveillance infrastructure for pathogens.

I'll start by saying that it is -- it's exciting to see how the world is sort of moving forward with putting out a surveillance infrastructure for pathogens. It's something, as you know, Puneet, we've been talking about from the beginning of last year and talking about the fact that in addition to testing, what we really need is this genomic epidemiology infrastructure. So it's encouraging to see that play out around the world and to see the big commitments here made in the U.S. 
Now to get to your question, in terms of what we're building into this year, the vast majority of the growth in that 25% to 28% is coming from our core business. So the way we've modeled this year is we said, look, we expect small contributions from the surveillance infrastructure over the course of the whole year. We saw some investment in Q1. And so we saw a bolus of $35 million in instrument purchases that we got in Q1 to lay out some of that infrastructure, and we saw some consumables infrastructure. So in terms of our model, we continue to model some consumable purchases over the course of the rest of the year, but not a lot in terms of additional infrastructure investment. 
Now the way we expect it to play out is we are seeing the bid commitment made even in the U.S. around the American Rescue Plan, and we expect some of that investment to be released towards the tail end of this year and start to play out more sort of next year. And what's interesting is that this infrastructure, while it'll be very helpful in fighting the pandemic, is really a durable plan by the nations that are rolling it out. And what they are thinking about is a long-term creation of a genomics-based pathogen surveillance infrastructure to help fight this pandemic and prepare as next -- for the next outbreak, whether it's a natural outbreak or bio terrorism or emerging antimicrobial resistance or hospital-acquired infections. And so we do expect, as you point out, some tail on this. That's -- it's not a story of this year. In fact, we've modeled in very little this year, but it really is a story that plays out into next year and going forward. And so that's how we're thinking about it in terms of model. Obviously, as more details come out, we'll make sure to share them with you. 
In terms of GRAIL, as I said, we are committed to pursuing the acquisition of GRAIL. In the U.S. that means we are taking sort of our case into district court. And we're also working with the European Commission on their review of the GRAIL acquisition. We continue to feel that the facts are on our side, the law is on our side. And we continue to expect that the deal will close and will close in the second half of this year."

So on antitrust and strategy, as you know, over the last couple of years, Illumina has run into challenges with regulators on the now abandoned acquisition of PacBio and the plan to acquire GRAIL. And recognizing everything you said in your prepared remarks as well as in your response to Puneet's question on GRAIL, I am wondering, one, how is your criteria for strategic opportunities evolving in light of these developments? And two, what changes you're making in process? You obviously felt adequate in terms of how you're approaching these deals, but both proved to be a lot more challenging than you expected. So presumably, you are making changes accordingly. I think it would be helpful to hear about those. 
And then on guidance philosophy, how would you describe confidence in your targets for this year at this point? I mean, your targets make a lot of sense to me, even though the growth numbers are really big. And you did talk about -- I think it was $1.4 billion in backlog entering Q2. And that said, the world is still uncertain, as we all know, coming out of 2020. And then if we go back to 2019, it was a tough year for Illumina relative to self-imposed targets. So with those things in mind, I'm just -- I think it would be helpful to hear about the philosophy you're applying to guidance this year. And if you still think you're skewing towards the more conservative side of things?"

I'll talk first about our acquisition strategy, specifically touching on any impact from our experience with the FTC and how it changes power philosophy going forward. And then I'll talk about guida",644,"Great. Doug, so let me take both parts of your question. I'll talk first about our acquisition strategy, specifically touching on any impact from our experience with the FTC and how it changes power philosophy going forward. And then I'll talk about guidance for the rest of the year. And Sam may contribute then, too. 
So first, by saying, if you look at our acquisitions over the last couple of years, we have -- we attempted the PacBio acquisition, I think, so that 3 years ago, initiated that, and we obviously didn't get that through the FTC. But we were successful in closing the Edico acquisition, which was a huge success in terms of building in the DRAGEN technology into our sequencers and has been super well received by our customers, and so really create a positive momentum on the informatics side. We also completed, for example, the Enancio acquisition and brought lossless data compression technologies and capabilities into our into our sequencers as well. And so what we're seeing is we've had success in terms of buying innovative technologies that we can build into our sequences and take to market. But we're also seeing that given how popular our sequencers are in our core market that we have work to do in terms of some of these bigger acquisitions. 
And so one, I think we're going to continue to scan the marketplace and look for acquisitions that make sensible technology tuck-ins as well as from, time to time, larger acquisitions that make sense. We continue to believe that vertical acquisitions are well within bounds, and that's where we're going to go to court on the GRAIL acquisition. And we also recognize that given the scale we are and given our position in the market, we will have to do more work in terms of educating the regulators about our business and making sure they are up to speed on our business even before we do an acquisition. So that's another takeaway over the last couple of years. 
Strategically, though, I'd say, we're still continuing to focus on making sure that we are looking for places where we can allocate capital, both internally and externally, that deliver maximum shareholder value. And that focus hasn't changed at all. 
In terms of our guiding philosophy for the year, I think you touched on a couple of important points. It's a balanced point of view, we feel, that on the one hand, recognizes that we're coming into the year and we're coming off the quarter with a huge amount of momentum in our core business. So if you look at both the clinical side of the business and the research side of the business, we're seeing real strength. And that's showing up in terms of the revenue numbers that we had in Q4, but obviously, also in Q1, it's showing up in the orders numbers, it's showing up in the instrument, the huge instrument growth rate we saw year-on-year in Q1. And so a huge amount of momentum in our core business. 
You add to that, we're seeing very positive signs from the COVID surveillance add-on business. And so on the one hand, with the huge amount of momentum going into the rest of the year, but as you point out, there's still uncertainty because we're still dealing with the pandemic. And so we're still watching to see how the pandemic plays out as countries are grappling with the third wave and a fourth wave, and that could have impact on people's ability to go into the labs or run their clinical sequencing that they that they need. And so we're balancing those two. And the numbers we put out, although they're big numbers, we have confidence in and we think it strikes that appropriate balance. 
I don't know, Sam, if you have anything else to add."

Had a bunch of questions in there, so let me make sure I capture them all. I will -- so first, you asked us about the strength we're seeing from the instrument portfolio, let's comment on what's driving that. Then you asked about COVID surveillance and said, look, we talked about we will represent about 70% of the surveillance testing that was done and how is that playing out since we last talked about the numbers, which instruments play best for that. And then sort of a commentary on the competitive landscape. 
Okay. So let me start with instrument strength. Yes. We talked about the fact that we had enormous instrument strength in Q1, so more than doubling year-over-year in terms of the revenue in Q1 that we got from sequencing instruments, a huge amount of strength. And what's driving that is the strength in the core businesses, both the clinical side and the research side. We talked about the strength that we saw on the clinical side in oncology testing. That oncology testing, as a segment, is now not only our largest clinical segment, but it's actually our fastest-growing segment. And there's lots of drivers behind the strength in the oncology segment, right? And more broadly in the clinical segment. One of the big drivers is we saw a very significant step forward in reimbursement across a number of clinical segments last year. Genetic disease testing, oncology, NIPT. And so what's happening is that the addressable market in terms of people who have access to the tests in a reimbursed way has expanded last year. And so that's driving increased business for our customers in the clinic, and that's driving their purchases. 
Other dynamics that are playing out are the strength of the clinical business in China, for example, and the clearance we received from the NMPA around NextSeq, and that's driving an instrument growth. And so it's not catch up. It's just -- the market continues to build, right? So with more reimbursement, the addressable market expands. With more cleared products, the addressable market expands in terms of our ability to place instruments into hospitals, for example, in China. And that's really what's driving the instrument strength. And obviously, that's hugely exciting because that talks well about future consumable spend from all the instruments that we placed in Q1. 
In terms of COVID, and what we talked about is if you look at [ just aid ] or NCBI, you can track in terms of the number of genomes that are deposited, the platforms they have been run on. And so I think there was a helpful blog that came out in the last couple of days. I think Keith Robinson did a genomics clinic blog. And he sort of did an analysis, and it's pretty close to what we did, too, which says that our share there is about -- it's gone up about 79%. Now of all the genomes in [ Aid ] have been done on Illumina platforms. I think the next highest is [ Voluntee ] with about 17%, I believe, and that sort of tapers off after that. And so similar, but maybe a little bit better than what we talked about last time. 
In terms of the instruments, there's a broad range of instruments that are being used for surveillance. Obviously, NovaSeqs are a very popular instrument in the high-volume shops. But we're seeing a lot of NextSeqs and MiSeqs being used as well. And so it's sort of the blend, if you like, that are playing really well. 
In terms of competition, but there's always competition in the market. As you can imagine, a market that's this early and growing this quickly is going to continue to attract investment dollars. So like you were looking at some emerging players that are going to be investing in the next year or 2, and I think you listed some of them, there are clearly players that are in the market right now, too, that we compete with. But that's been true every year. So I'd say every year, we face sort of a new wave of venture-funded competitors. And it's up to us to continue to innovate and deliver more value to our customers."

So as you point out, obviously, we work very closely with our customers, and we have terrific customers like FMI and Gardens and so on in oncology testing. And our perspective is that they -- if you were in the liquid biopsy space, so if you offer a blood-based test, you're actually more durable through the pandemic than many other types of clinical testing. And so some of our customers found very innovative ways in terms of mobile phlebotomy units or having home-based access to the test even for some patients. And that's possible if you have a blood test. And so in oncology testing, I think one of the stories of the pandemic is going to be that there was an acceleration of the acceptance of liquid biopsy, and I think that's a durable trend. I think we come out of the pandemic, and you'll continue to see the growth in liquid biopsy because people realize that not only can you get high-quality results, but it's a much more patient-friendly way to do the test than a tissue-based test. So I think if possible, you'll see liquid biopsy being a preferred way to go. 
Now what that means, there isn't really a whole lot of catch-up to do in Q1 because you saw the durability of liquid biopsies. And so far and away, I think the biggest driver of the strength in oncology are things like: One, expanded reimbursement for things like CGP; two, the continued emergence of new therapeutics that leverage genomic biomarkers. And that's also showing up in terms of the companion diagnostic relationships that we're signing up for TSO 500. And then the availability of products like TSO 500 from us, from our -- from our partners that create products that make it easier for labs to stand up those steps. And so I think all of those factors are driving the durable strength in oncology testing, and there may be a little catch up, but frankly, if there was, it wasn't much, in my opinion."

So piggybacking on a prior question. The language in the FTC's challenge of the GRAIL acquisition seems to be narrowly focused on blood-based multi-cancer screening, which is just one of the several emerging clinical applications within a broader liquid biopsy landscape, which does seek to serve a wide range of cancer types. So with this in mind, while the GRAIL acquisition is under FTC review, is it reasonable to expect that you'll continue to be active on the M&A front? And if the deal is blocked, is it reasonable to expect that any future M&A activity would target companies that are developing of clinical liquid biopsy applications targeted for just 1 or a small number of cancer types versus sort of the home run opportunity in multi cancer?"

I think that's a good observation in terms of the fact that liquid biopsy or blood-based tests are used for various types of testing in oncology. So 1 type, as you point out, is multi-cancer early detection, which is what GRAIL does as well as other players that are looking to do that in the market. Another area that liquid biopsy is used is for therapy selection. So helping match patients -- cancer patients who were already diagnosed with the right therapies for them. We already have a product, a kit that serves that space. So our TSO 500 product is used for therapy selection. A completely different part of the market, requires a different technology, looks for different things in the blood. And so liquid biopsy can be used for many things, but they're very different segments. And all of them are different and require sort of different technologies as part of a liquid biopsy approach. 
The answer is, yes, we are going to continue to look at M&A going forward. It's going to be both technology tuck-ins that help us advance our mission and our strategic priorities and that could be a range of things. It could be technology tuck-ins. It look -- it could look for capabilities that extend the offerings as part of our sequencing offerings. And so we're going to continue to do that."

Why is that, that you're not expecting this kind of work to contribute a little more in the near term of that $20 million consumables contribution in the first quarter? So that's my first question. 
Second, on sequencing services, and this is more for Sam. Outside of the $25 million milestone in the year-over-year comp, quarterly growth was essentially flattish. Are there any offsets that we should be thinking about in terms of this quarter? 
And then finally, in arrays, the business, I mean, both from a services and consumables standpoint, actually grew year-over-year after quite a while. Is it fair to think of the business finally having bottomed here outside of the usual seasonality that you'll see in 2Q and beyond?"

So I'll start, and we'll talk a little bit about COVID. And the question is, why not more, right? Because it's clearly there's now a very recognized value in terms of using sequencing for genomic pathogen-based surveillance, both for COVID and as a recognition that this infrastructure is going to be valuable for many, many, many years to come. So the question is, why not more? The second question you had is with arrays, have we bottomed out? 
Okay. So let's go to the first one. We absolutely sort of believe that we are laying an infrastructure here that's durable, that it's going to be an important part of all national -- major national health systems going forward. We absolutely believe that this infrastructure is going to be valuable not just to protect the public health, but also from a national defense perspective. So we expect this is going to play out over a decade plus, right? And we are going to -- we are going to have, in most countries, some kind of genomic pathogen-based surveillance going forward. 
In terms of how we thought about it this year, so the way we thought about it this year is we said, you see some bolus of instrument buying in Q1 and we expect -- that was the bulk of the instrument buying we should expect to see this year. And we've talked about the fact that many countries now, we engaged with them last year, they bought some sequencing. And so for the rest of this year, we expect to continue to see consumable buying. But our expectation is what you saw the bulk of the instrument buying for what's going to happen this year already happened. It is possible that more happens, and the things that would drive that are, obviously, the American Rescue Plan that talks about some very big numbers. Our expectations are that it's going to take a while for the details to be worked out. And so while you'll see consumables being purchased over the course of the year, it won't really be towards the end of the year, we expect, that you'll start to see people talking about, okay, where are these 6 Centers of Excellence, how much sequencing infrastructure do they already have, how much additional hardware we need. And so it's going to be a story of the tail end of this year going into next year and beyond from an instruments perspective. And so that's how we thought about it. We'll keep you up-to-date if any of that accelerates over the course of this year. 
In terms of arrays, we did see some growth year-over-year. And there are different parts to that business. There's the direct-to-consumer part, and then there's sort of [indiscernible], and maybe Sam will talk a little bit about how those parts play out."

So I think the way you characterize the [indiscernible] is correct in the sense that the business is stabilizing, and we're seeing less of a negative -- definitely not a negative impact from arrays. We actually saw them grow in Q1. 
The fact of the matter is, DTC is now a very small part of our business. It's somewhere between 2% and 3% of our overall revenues. Back in 2018, DTC was a much bigger contributor to our overall revenue. So even though we're very pleased to see arrays growing in Q1, it's -- DTC specifically is less of a contributor, and we still see the mature arrays that we have, the mature business, whether it's agrigenomics or other applications continuing to grow as well and has continued to grow over time. 
Maybe to go to the last question that you had with regards to sequencing services and others. So let me explain the dynamics there, Tejas. Q1 over Q1 of last year, we do have a negative headwind related to a $25 million IVD licensing fee that we had in Q1 of 2020 that we didn't see in Q1 of this year. So that was a negative. And as you saw, sequencing and other were down for the quarter by 16%. As we look for the year, what our guidance assumes is no material licensing fees or IVD fees with regards to any significant transactions or partnerships, I should say, for the year. So we're expecting mostly sequencing service and other to be flattish for the year, quarter-over-quarter. And that's consistent with our original guidance that we had back in January."

And how much of the strength you saw in the first quarter was due to basically people that were planning upgrades last year and never did them. Just trying to get a sense of, one, I think there's a lot of questions on sort of the instrument strength. 
And also, just sort of looking at the guide, you're just -- it looks like roughly that the -- roughly $1 billion each in Q2, Q3, Q4 is sort of the way, acknowledging you probably have some conservatism built in there. So I'm just wondering, as you look at that second half, it's like why would sort of be flattish given historical trends? 
And then just one other question on -- can you walk us through sort of like the full stock comp numbers this year and sort of like how those flow in and how this flow into '22? Just so we can get a better sense of how to model."

So I'll start talking with HiSeq, and then I'll turn it over to Sam to talk about the other 2. 
So in terms of the HiSeqs, we -- well, when we first started the NovaSeq upgrade path, as you know, we talked about the fact there were 850 HiSeq customers that, over time, we expect that the majority -- the vast majority of them would move to NovaSeq. So between 2017 and then until the end of last year, we went from 850 that had to upgrade, and then we refresh the numbers and shared with you that we are now left with 320 that had to upgrade. And so that upgrade continued in Q1. I don't think there was a bolus or a catch-up. I think it was more of a steady sort of course of upgrade as we've continued to see, and we expect to continue to see that play forward over the quarters of this year and going into future years. So there was definitely continued upgrading, but there wasn't really a giant bolus or a catch-up that happened. 
So now I'll turn over to you, Sam."

So first of all, let's keep in mind, for Q1, we did have a couple",346,"Yes. With regards to your other 2 questions there. So first, let me talk about the linearity, which is I think what you're referring to with regards to the approximately $1 billion quarter. So first of all, let's keep in mind, for Q1, we did have a couple of, I would say, items that benefited Q1, one was with regards to the $35 million of instrument purchases with regards to COVID surveillance. We believe that was a onetimer in terms of building the infrastructure. We don't expect material instrument placements going forward with regards to COVID, at least. That's in our assumptions, in our guidance assumptions. The other one is we called it out, which was a $20 million roughly consumable purchases, what we're calling catch-up purchases in Q1. And because of the fact that the customers were maybe running a little bit lower on inventory and purchased by approximately $20 million higher than they would usually do, not a material amount, but some elements of that. 
So that's what elevates Q1. That's why Q2 is sequentially a step down. That's why the year and the second half is also not higher than the first half. 
The other contributor to the second half not being higher than the first half is the U.K. BioBank, which we expect to complete their sequencing in the second half. So actually, towards Q3, they will wrap up that project. So those are the contributions, and that's why I would say our linearity is flattish this year. 
With regards to stock-based compensation, I called out at the beginning of the year, roughly just over $50 million year-over-year impact from stock-based comp. That is now higher, actually from an expense standpoint because also driven by our performance, our stock-based accruals, stock-based compensation accruals are actually higher. So we're expecting higher stock-based comp overall. So from a year-over-year standpoint, it's actually north of that $50 million. 
We haven't called out 2022. It's still early to talk about 2022 for stock-based comp, but that impact, that negative impact, obviously moderates in 2022 versus 2021."

And maybe, Derek, I'll give you some more color on NovaSeq because the reality is we're seeing a huge amount of momentum in the NovaSeq business. So we talked about the fact that in Q4, we saw our highest order quarter for NovaSeq since we first launched that product in Q1 of 2017, which is really impressive because we're entering the fifth year of NovaSeq, right? So we had huge amount of momentum in Q4, record orders, again, second only to when we launched. 
And then in Q1, we again had a huge amount of momentum. Just talked about the fact that it was our strongest placement order for first quarter of any year since we've launched NovaSeq. So you're absolutely right. We're seeing this huge amount of momentum. 
Now what's driving that? I talked about the fact that it wasn't any kind of catch-up in terms of upgrade. And what's interesting, and we called this out before, an it's continued, is that we're seeing a huge amount of strength from new to Illumina, new to high throughput customers. And that's something we didn't expect when we launched NovaSeq. About half [indiscernible] were going to come from labs that were fundamentally enabled by the democratization of sequencing that we NovaSeq represents, and that continues the launch of v1.5. 
And so what we're hearing from the market is 1.5 really catalyzed the elasticity of demand and was the accelerant that drove those large amount of orders of NovaSeq in Q4 and the placements that we saw in Q1."

Sure, Patrick. Thanks for the question. So with regards to profitability, I mean, as you saw in terms of both our guidance and also results in Q1, obviously, we've made pretty significant strides here in terms of improving the profitability or building on the profitability of the business. And that's that goes with our -- as we mentioned all along, that as the volumes start to ramp, and we saw significant strength in the business in terms of the core business and some contribution from COVID, we're seeing leverage improvement. We saw in Q1 that operating margins were north of 30%. We're expecting approximately 26.5% for the year. And we're expecting that to improve as we look forward over time. 
What are some of the things that are maybe the contributors to that and the ingredients to that? Obviously, gross margins, which have improved since our last guidance, and we'll continue to improve as we get past some of the COVID aspects related to higher freight expenses, for instance. Obviously, as volumes have ramped, we're seeing improvements in gross margin. We are making investments, though, I want to mention in the business, both in terms of manufacturing capacity and in terms of OpEx investments. I mean the growth that we're seeing in the business far exceeds our expectations, and we're incredibly encouraged by that. And we have to catch up in terms of making some investments in the infrastructure to catch up with some of the demand that we're seeing, both, as I said, in terms of manufacturing and in terms of OpEx, which is why we are -- we're committed to that. But as we look forward, we're also committed to improving leverage over time and getting back to historical levels. And we're still on that path. We made good strides in just 1 quarter, but we're still on that path. 
With regards to mid throughput -- was it mid throughput or low throughput? That was the question, sorry. Mid throughput. So with regards to the throughput, we're not at the stage yet where we can share what the expectations are for pull-through in terms of NextSeq 2000, NextSeq 1000. Suffice it to say, and I know you're asking more about consumables, but I can tell you the level that we're seeing in terms of placements on mid throughput for 2000 and 1000 as well as 550 DX and 550, is incredibly encouraging. We're seeing record placements every quarter. We're expecting to continue at that level going forward to improve on those levels going forward. And so when you're having still when you're early stage of the launch of this instrument and you're seeing this growth, it's really hard now to put a level of consumable pull-through range at this stage. So we have to still give it a few quarters before we can do that."

As we shared in our pre-announcement, Illumina had a very strong start to 2021, with the first $1 billion quarter in Illumina's history. We achieved first quarter revenue of $1.093 billion, growing 27% compared to",1641,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared in our pre-announcement, Illumina had a very strong start to 2021, with the first $1 billion quarter in Illumina's history. We achieved first quarter revenue of $1.093 billion, growing 27% compared to the prior year and 15% from the last quarter. Sequencing revenue was especially strong, up 29% compared to the prior year driven primarily by accelerating growth in our core business, with both clinical and research customers exceeding pre-COVID activity levels. In addition, we're seeing global investment in the creation of a genomic epidemiology infrastructure to combat COVID-19 as well as monitor for future pathogen outbreaks.
I'd like to share some additional first quarter highlights by platform. Beginning with our high-throughput platforms, NovaSeq drove a significant share of the exceptional performance, achieving its highest first quarter placements on record, which is remarkable as it enters its fifth year since launch. We continue to see the positive impact of our v1.5 reagents, enabling both new high-throughput customers as well as continued conversions from our existing HiSeq customer base.
Our mid-throughput platforms drove additional growth with a 23% increase in consumables revenue compared to last year. We saw continued success for NextSeq 1000 and 2000 as well as strong performance from NextSeq 550. Notably, we saw an increase in customers upgrading from their existing Illumina benchtop sequencers to NextSeq 1000 and 2000. Clinical customers continue to drive new NextSeq 550 placements, with NextSeqDx recording its highest shipment quarter to date. In China, where the instrument received NMPA approval in Q4, we're seeing strong adoption in the hospital setting as we work with IVD development partners like Burning Rock, Biosan and Matridx, to provide comprehensive clinical solutions. Additionally, working with our strategic partner, R-Pharm, NextSeqDx received medical device registration in Russia in March, enabling the clinical use of next-generation sequencing for more patients across Russia.
Our low-throughput portfolio revenue had another strong quarter, growing 33% year-over-year with robust growth in both sequencing consumables and instrument shipments in Q1. MiSeq, MiniSeq and HiSeq all generated year-over-year and sequential growth in consumables as well as instrument placements. Our low-throughput platforms continue to be a compelling entry point for new-to-NGS customers with an ever-increasing number of use cases. One interesting customer example is BlueNalu, a start-up using our technology in the development of cell-cultured seafood to support sustainability in oceanic diversity. Additionally, these instruments play a critical role in catalyzing localized COVID surveillance programs across the globe.
Turning to our clinical and research and applied segments. Total sequencing consumables revenue of $695 million was up 26% year-over-year, demonstrating strong demand for sequencing across both clinical and research segments. More than 44% of our sequencing consumable shipments in the first quarter of 2021 were to clinical customers. Clinical testing showed significant growth with consumables up 35% year-over-year. These results do not include COVID surveillance, which is reported in our research and academic segment.
Oncology testing exceeded our overall clinical growth rate and is our largest and fastest-growing clinical segment. This growth was driven by our customers benefiting from expanded access to reimbursement for NGS-based testing, particularly in comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, for therapy selection and some of the first reimbursement for sequencing-based monitoring tests. TruSight Oncology 500, our RUO comprehensive genomic profiling assay, continued its success this quarter, adding over 20 new customers. In February, the Belgian Society of Medical Oncology announced that they will use TSO 500 for a national pilot to evaluate the use of CGP for patients with advanced metastatic cancer. As a leading distributable CGP assay, TSO 500 continues to offer a compelling choice for our pharmaceutical partners. We announced last week an exciting new partnership with Kartos Therapeutics, to develop a TP53 companion diagnostic, expanding the TruSight oncology offering into blood cancers.
Beyond CGP, we've seen promising developments in the use of whole genome sequencing in cancer treatment this quarter. Most notably, a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine published by our partners at Washington University, St. Louis, showed that for AML and MDS patients studied, whole genome sequencing using Illumina technology produced more accurate results in less time and at a similar cost compared to standard techniques like FISH or karyotyping.
In reproductive health, the cascading effect of the ACOG guidance on increasing coverage of NIPT for all pregnancies drove the third consecutive quarter of both year-over-year and sequential growth. In the U.S., 2 large payers, Anthem and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, expanded their coverage criteria to include twin pregnancies just last month. And in March, we reported out on the results of our groundbreaking, risk-sharing, real-world study with Harvard Pilgrim, demonstrating the cost effectiveness of offering NIPT to all pregnant women. These studies add to the building momentum for broader access to NIPT. International support for NIPT coverage also continues to grow, fueling the continued rapid adoption of our CE-IVD marked NIPT kit. For example, there was positive news from Italy and Sweden where new coverage requirements were approved during the first quarter of 2021.
Moving to genetic disease testing. Customers are choosing Illumina's highly accurate and scalable sequencers, and our growth rate in this segment exceeded the company's growth rate in Q1. We also continue to see new favorable coverage decisions being issued. This quarter, 2 major health insurers in Germany announced that they will cover the cost of whole genome and whole exome sequencing for rare disease for their over 10 million members. And Geisinger in the U.S. expanded coverage to include epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Research continues to demonstrate a 40% to 68% diagnostic yield for children suspected of having a genetic disease, and whole genome sequencing is used as a first-tier test. The increasing coverage of these tests will provide more patients with faster diagnoses and better care.
Turning to our research and academic segment. We saw strong growth in the quarter compared to the prior year period as the majority of research and academic customers have returned to the lab. The pandemic and emerging variants of concern have raised awareness within governments around the world about the essential role that genomic pathogen surveillance plays in the fight against infectious disease. We're seeing investment globally in the creation of a pathogen surveillance infrastructure to manage outbreaks and improve health outcomes, including sequencing capabilities to determine the spread of pathogens, the emergence of variant strains and emerging drug or vaccine resistance.
In the U.S., the American Rescue Plan Act includes $1.7 billion in funding for the CDC to improve sequencing capacity to identify mutation and circulation of viruses. In Europe, the EC announced EUR 123 million commitment to combat COVID variants. In India, the government launched the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia with a plan to sequence 120,000 viral genomes over the next 4 months. This investment in sequencing for national genomic surveillance activities drove approximately $55 million of incremental revenue in the first quarter, comprising of $35 million in instrument placements and $20 million in sequencing consumables.
As countries around the world battle the pandemic, we expect continued investment in genomic pathogen surveillance to expand national genomic epidemiology capabilities. While the initial focus of this infrastructure is COVID surveillance, there are durable longer-term needs, including tracking future emerging natural pathogens, bio terrorism, antimicrobial drug resistance and hospital-acquired infections, and determining how host genetics can impact the risk and severity of infectious disease. While the pandemic has certainly fueled demand for our sequencing, we also believe it has established a new baseline of awareness and infrastructure build-out that will support sustained activity.
As we work through the COVID-19 pandemic, we're also seeing acceleration in several population genomics programs, expanding our presence in national health systems around the world. In the U.S., All of Us ramped up sample volumes in Q1 to a level that we expect to continue throughout 2021. In Japan, the Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization chose Illumina sequencing for a 40,000-sample multigenerational study to take place this year. In February, Egypt announced the first population genomics program in Africa with the launch of their Egyptian genome project. This project is focused on establishing a map of the Egyptian human genome with the goal of ushering the country into the world of precision medicine.
Large population health initiatives serve as one good example of our focus on improving the health of patients, communities and our planet. Earlier this month, we published our second annual CSR report, outlining our specific commitments to help improve our world. This 2021 report is available on our website, and notable highlights include expanded transparency on U.S. diversity demographics, climate resilience planning, disclosure on trade group membership and data assurance on energy and emissions. We look forward to continued investor feedback on the evolution of our environmental, social and governance programs.
Our commitment to the advancement of human health is an Illumina core tenet, which brings me to GRAIL. We are pleased with the progress GRAIL is making and remain committed to pursue the completion of the GRAIL acquisition. GRAIL recently presented affirmative data from its CCGA3 study at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting and is expecting to launch Galleri, its breakthrough multi-cancer early detection screening test, in Q2. One of the many reasons we decided to acquire GRAIL was to accelerate patient access to breakthrough multi-cancer early detection blood tests, which could save tens of thousands of lives. We are committed to supporting all our customers and strongly believe that our acquisition of GRAIL is pro-competitive. We expect the acquisition to accelerate the early detection of cancer market as a whole. We saw a similar dynamic play out in the noninvasive prenatal testing market where, after Illumina's entry, the market grew and prices decreased, making these important tests accessible to a much larger population of pregnant women.
And now I'll turn it over to Sam."
29753,710393042,2259890,"Illumina, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","As Francis outlined, first quarter revenue grew by 27% year-over-year to $1.093 billion driven by 29% growth in sequencing and 15% growth in microarrays.

Record revenue across all regions contributed to the first $1 billion quarter in the company's history. Total sequencing revenue reached a new high with first quarter revenue of $979 million, growing 16% sequentially and representing 90% of total revenue. Sequencing consumables revenue grew 26% compared to the prior year period driven by strong growth in clinical testing and demand for NovaSeq v1.5 flow cells.
Most clinical and research customers are running above pre-COVID activity levels, as Francis highlighted. COVID-19 surveillance initiatives contributed approximately $20 million in sequencing consumables revenue during the first quarter. Sequencing consumables also benefited by approximately $20 million from the timing of customer purchases during the first quarter. Sequencing instruments revenue grew 123% year-over-year with revenue of $176 million in the first quarter, reflecting strong performance across all instrument categories. The first quarter marked another consecutive quarter of record mid-throughput shipments driven by strong adoption of NextSeq 1000 and 2000.
COVID surveillance initiatives resulted in approximately $35 million of incremental instrument revenue due to some customers building additional capacity for genomic epidemiology. As expected, sequencing service and other revenue was down 16% year-over-year due to IVD partnership revenue recognized in the prior year period. Sequencing service and other was roughly flat sequentially.
Moving to regional results. The Americas delivered revenue of $562 million with 18% growth compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strength in sequencing product revenue from clinical customers in oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing and contributions from genomic epidemiology initiatives related to COVID surveillance. These items were partially offset by lower IVD partnership revenue as expected.
EMEA delivered revenue of $305 million, representing 38% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by strong sequencing demand for clinical testing applications that resulted in higher-than-expected sequencing consumables revenue in the first quarter and instrument demand by research customers, including initiatives for COVID surveillance and genomic epidemiology.
Greater China revenue was $127 million, representing growth of 51% year-over-year and 32% sequentially due to continued strength in sequencing revenue driven by clinical expansion in the region and growing demand in hospitals, including the successful launch of NextSeq 550 Dx.
Finally, APJ revenue of $99 million grew 29%, both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by sequencing consumables revenue growth in clinical applications, such as oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing as well as end of fiscal year purchases.
Moving to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 70.5% improved sequentially by 360 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes and a onetime inventory write-down in the fourth quarter of 2020. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin decreased 250 basis points due to IVD partnership revenue in the year ago quarter, higher freight costs attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and product mix, partially offset by fixed cost leverage on higher volumes.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $420 million were up $81 million year-over-year, in line with expectations, due to increased performance-based compensation expenses, head count growth and increased project spend during the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly down sequentially driven by an additional week in Q4 2020, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses in Q1.
Non-GAAP operating margin was 32.1%, up from 20.9% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The sequential improvement was better than expected due to higher revenues, gross margin and resulting increased fixed cost absorption in the quarter. Non-GAAP other expense of $3 million was $23 million lower sequentially as expected. This was due to fourth quarter gains on short-term investments that we sold as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition. In addition, we had lower interest income in the first quarter.
The non-GAAP tax rate of 20.3% was up from last quarter due to the tax expense on certain foreign subsidiary earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested, partly due to the capital requirements associated with funding the anticipated GRAIL acquisition. For the first quarter of 2021, GAAP net income was $147 million or $1 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $278 million or $1.89 per diluted share.
Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $282 million, DSO of 43 days compared to 50 days last quarter driven by revenue linearity. First quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $42 million, and free cash flow was $240 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the first quarter. We ended the year with approximately $4.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the first quarter, we received approximately $1 billion in proceeds from bond issuances to fund the anticipated GRAIL acquisition. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 147 million.
Moving now to 2021 guidance. We expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 25% to 28% or $4.05 billion to $4.15 billion. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents an increase of approximately $858 million and a significant increase from our expectations earlier this year. For the full year 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we now expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 29% year-over-year driven by strong orders and instrument placements. This includes sequencing consumable growth of approximately 30% compared to 2020 driven by strong demand for NovaSeq v1.5 reagents and growth in clinical markets.
We expect sequencing system revenue to grow approximately 50% year-over-year driven by NovaSeq placements to new to high throughput customers and continued HiSeq conversion in addition to mid-throughput demand across our NextSeq platforms; NovaSeq pull-through to be towards the high end of our initial guidance range of $1.1 million to $1.2 million; arrays to grow approximately -- increased leverage on higher volumes, partially offset by product mix and IVD partnership revenue in the first quarter of 2020. We now expect 2021 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 26.5%, reflecting our higher revenue expectations and our ongoing commitment to investment in research and development. We continue to maintain our focus on improving our core business operating margin leverage over time.
We expect non-GAAP other income to be about $60 million lower than 2020 due to the gains realized in the fourth quarter of 2020, lower interest income on shorter-duration investments in anticipation of the close of the GRAIL acquisition and interest expense from our recent bond issuances. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.80 to $6.05 and GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.97. And we expect diluted shares outstanding in 2021 to be approximately 148 million.
Moving to the second quarter of 2021, we expect revenue to be up approximately 60% year-over-year due to the broader economic recovery and strength in our core business. We expect a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP gross margin due to the higher volumes and resulting leverage. Non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be down modestly on a sequential basis due to mix and additional investments to support the higher-than-expected volume growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses to increase significantly on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to investments supporting the growth of the business and research and development as well as compensation-related expenses. Non-GAAP other expense to be modestly unfavorable on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter. Non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly lower on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.35 for the quarter and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.21 to $1.26.
I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks."

I mean, I think the question really is the COVID surveillance opportunity and the cadence of that as you build out the epidemiological infrastructure, how is -- what's the cadence of that? And appreciate that COVID is still raging in different parts of the world, U.S. vaccinations are ramping and administration is investing $1 billion-plus in sequencing. So just wondering how much of that is baked in into this year and how -- what sort of a tail should we see longer term there?
And then my second one is just on GRAIL. What does the process look like next for both FTC and the European Commission Director General? What are the steps? And obviously, you're implying a second half close here. So just wondering what's the -- what are some of the next steps?"

I'll start by saying that it is -- it's exciting to see how the world is sort of moving forward with putting out a surveillance infrastructure for pathogens. It's something, as you know, Puneet, we've been talking about from the beginning of last year and talking about the fact that, in addition to testing, what we really need is this genomic epidemiology infrastructure. So it's encouraging to see that play out around the world and to see the big commitments here made in the U.S.
Now to get to your question, in terms of what we're building into this year, the vast majority of the growth in that 25% to 28% is coming from our core business. So the way we've modeled this year is we said, look, we expect small contributions from the surveillance infrastructure over the course of the whole year. We saw some investment in Q1. And so we saw a bolus of $35 million in instrument purchases that we got in Q1 to lay out some of that infrastructure, and we saw some consumables infrastructure. So in terms of our model, we continue to model some consumable purchases over the course of the rest of the year but not a lot in terms of additional infrastructure investment.
Now the way we expect it to play out is we are seeing the [ bid commitment ] made even in the U.S. around the American Rescue Plan, and we expect some of that investment to be released towards the tail end of this year and start to play out more sort of next year. And what's interesting is that this infrastructure, while it'll be very helpful in fighting the pandemic, it's really a durable plan by the nations that are rolling it out. And what they are thinking about is a long-term creation of a genomics-based pathogen surveillance infrastructure to help fight this pandemic and prepare for the next outbreak, whether it's a natural outbreak or bio terrorism or emerging antimicrobial resistance or hospital-acquired infections. And so we do expect, as you point out, some tail on this. It's not a story of this year. In fact, we've modeled in very little this year but it really is a story that plays out into next year and going forward. And so that's how we're thinking about it in terms of model. Obviously, as more details come out, we'll make sure to share them with you.
In terms of GRAIL, as I said, we are committed to pursuing the acquisition of GRAIL. In the U.S., that means we are taking sort of our case into district court. And we're also working with the European Commission on their review of the GRAIL acquisition. We continue to feel that the facts are on our side, the law is on our side. And we continue to expect that the deal will close and will close in the second half of this year."

So on antitrust and strategy, as you know, over the last couple of years, Illumina has run into challenges with regulators on the now abandoned acquisition of PacBio and the plan to acquire GRAIL. And recognizing everything you said in your prepared remarks as well as in your response to Puneet's question on GRAIL, I am wondering, one, how is your criteria for strategic opportunities evolving in light of these developments and, two, what changes you're making in process? You obviously felt adequate in terms of how you're approaching these deals, but both proved to be a lot more challenging than you expected. So presumably, you are making changes accordingly. I think it would be helpful to hear about those.
And then on guidance philosophy, how would you describe confidence in your targets for this year at this point? I mean your targets make a lot of sense to me, even though the growth numbers are really big. And you did talk about -- I think it was $1.4 billion in backlog entering Q2. That said, the world is still uncertain, as we all know, coming out of 2020. And then if we go back to 2019, it was a tough year for Illumina relative to self-imposed targets. So with those things in mind, I'm just -- I think it would be helpful to hear about the philosophy you're applying to guidance this year and if you still think you're skewing towards the more conservative side of things."

So I'll talk first about our acquisition strategy, specifically touching on any impact from our experience with the FTC and how it changes our philosophy going forward. And then I'll talk about guidance for the rest of the year. And Sam may contribute then, too.
So I'll start by saying if you look at our acquisitions over the last couple of years, we have -- we attempted the PacBio acquisition. I think it's about 3 years ago, initiated that, and we obviously didn't get that through the FTC. But we were successful in closing the Edico acquisition, which was a huge success in terms of building in the DRAGEN technology into our sequencers and has been super well received by our customers, and so really created a positive momentum on the informatics side. We also completed, for example, the Enancio acquisition and brought lossless data compression technologies and capabilities into our into our sequencers as well. And so what we're seeing is we've had success in terms of buying innovative technologies that we can build into our sequencers and take to market. But we're also seeing that given how popular our sequencers are in our core market that we have work to do in terms of some of these bigger acquisitions.
And so one, I think we're going to continue to scan the marketplace and look for acquisitions that make sense, both technology tuck-ins as well as, from time to time, larger acquisitions that make sense. We continue to believe that vertical acquisitions are well within bounds, and that's where we're going to go to court on the GRAIL acquisition. And we also recognize that given the scale we are and given our position in the market, we will have to do more work in terms of educating the regulators about our business and making sure they are up to speed on our business even before we do an acquisition. So that's another takeaway over the last couple of years. Strategically, though, I'd say, we're still continuing to focus on making sure that we are looking for places where we can allocate capital, both internally and externally, that deliver maximum shareholder value. And that focus hasn't changed at all.
In terms of our guiding philosophy for the year, I think you touched on a couple of important points. It's a balanced point of view, we feel, that, on the one hand, recognizes that we're coming into the year and we're coming off the quarter with a huge amount of momentum in our core business. So if you look at both the clinical side of the business and the research side of the business, we're seeing real strength. And that's showing up in terms of the revenue numbers that we had in Q4 but, obviously, also in Q1. It's showing up in the orders numbers. It's showing up in the instrument, the huge instrument growth rate we saw year-on-year in Q1, and so a huge amount of momentum in our core business.
You add to that, we're seeing very positive signs from the COVID surveillance add-on business. And so on the one hand, there's huge amount of momentum going into the rest of the year. But as you point out, there's still uncertainty because we're still dealing with the pandemic. And so we're still watching to see how the pandemic plays out as countries are grappling with the third wave and a fourth wave, and that could have impact on people's ability to go into the labs or run their clinical sequencing that they need. And so we're balancing those two. And the numbers we put out, although they're big numbers, we have confidence in and we think it strikes that appropriate balance.
I don't know, Sam, if you have anything else to add."

There's a bunch of questions in there, so let me make sure I capture them all. I will -- so first, you asked us about the strength we're seeing from the instrument portfolio, a comment on what's driving that. Then you asked about COVID surveillance and said, look, we talked about we represent about 70% of the surveillance testing that was done and how is that playing out since we last talked about the numbers, which instruments play best for that, and then sort of a commentary on the competitive landscape.
Okay. So let me start with instrument strength. Yes, we talked about the fact that we had enormous instrument strength in Q1, so more than doubling year-over-year in terms of the revenue in Q1 that we got from sequencing instruments, a huge amount of strength. And what's driving that is the strength in the core businesses, both the clinical side and the research side. We talked about the strength that we saw on the clinical side in oncology testing. That oncology testing, as a segment, is now not only our largest clinical segment, but it's actually our fastest-growing segment. And there's lots of drivers behind the strength in the oncology segment, right, and more broadly in the clinical segment. One of the big drivers is we saw a very significant step forward in reimbursement across a number of clinical segments last year: genetic disease testing, oncology, NIPT. And so what's happening is that the addressable market in terms of people who have access to the tests in a reimbursed way has expanded last year. And so that's driving increased business for our customers in the clinic, and that's driving their purchases.
Other dynamics that are playing out are the strength of the clinical business in China, for example, and the clearance we received from the NMPA around NextSeq, and that's driving an instrument growth. And so it's not catch-up. It's just the market continues to build, right? So with more reimbursement, the addressable market expands. With more cleared products, the addressable market expands in terms of our ability to place instruments into hospitals, for example, in China. And that's really what's driving the instrument strength. And obviously, that's hugely exciting because that talks well about future consumable spend from all the instruments that we placed in Q1.
In terms of COVID and what we talked about is, if you look at GISAID or NCBI, you can track, in terms of the number of genomes that are deposited, the platforms they have been run on. And so I think there was a helpful blog that came out in the last couple of days. I think Keith Robison did a genomics omics blog. And he sort of did an analysis, and it's pretty close to what we did, too, which says that our share there is about -- it's gone up to about 79%. Now all the genomes in GISAID have been done on Illumina platforms. I think the next highest is ONT with about 17%, I believe, and that sort of tapers off after that. And so similar but maybe a little bit better than what we talked about last time.
In terms of the instruments, there's a broad range of instruments that are being used for surveillance. Obviously, NovaSeqs are a very popular instrument in the high-volume shops. But we're seeing a lot of NextSeqs and MiSeqs being used as well. And so it's sort of the blend, if you like, that are playing really well. In terms of competition, there's always competition in the market. As you can imagine, a market that's this early and growing this quickly is going to continue to attract investment dollars. So like you, we're looking at some emerging players that are going to be [ investing ] in the next year or 2, and I think you listed some of them, there are clearly players that are in the market right now, too, that we compete with. But that's been true every year. So I'd say, every year, we face sort of a new wave of venture-funded competitors. And it's up to us to continue to innovate and deliver more value to our customers."

So as you point out, obviously, we work very closely with our customers, we have terrific customers like FMI and Garden and so on in oncology testing. And our perspective is that they -- if you were in the liquid biopsy space, so if you offered a blood-based test, you're actually more durable through the pandemic than many other types of clinical testing. And so some of our customers found very innovative ways in terms of mobile [ phlebotomy ] units or having home-based access to the test even for some patients. And that's possible if you have a blood test. And so in oncology testing, I think one of the stories of the pandemic is going to be that there was an acceleration of the acceptance of liquid biopsy, and I think that's a durable trend. I think we come out of the pandemic, and you'll continue to see the growth in liquid biopsy, because people realize that not only can you get high-quality results, but it's a much more patient-friendly way to do the test than a tissue-based test. So I think if possible, you'll see liquid biopsy being a preferred way to go.
Now what that means, there isn't really a whole lot of catch-up to do in Q1 because you saw the durability of liquid biopsies. And so far and away, I think the biggest driver of the strength in oncology are things like: one, expanded reimbursement for things like CGP; two, the continued emergence of new therapeutics that leverage genomic biomarkers. And that's also showing up in terms of the companion diagnostic relationships that we're signing up for TSO 500. And then the availability of products like TSO 500 from us, from our partners that create products that make it easier for labs to stand up those tests. And so I think all of those factors are driving the durable strength in oncology testing, and there may be a little catch up. But frankly, if there was, it wasn't much, in my opinion."

So piggybacking on a prior question, the language in the FTC's challenge of the GRAIL acquisition seems to be narrowly focused on blood-based multi-cancer screening, which is just one of the several emerging clinical applications within a broader liquid biopsy landscape, which does seek to serve a wide range of cancer types. So with this in mind, while the GRAIL acquisition is under FTC review, is it reasonable to expect that you'll continue to be active on the M&A front? And if the deal is blocked, is it reasonable to expect that any future M&A activity would target companies that are developing of clinical liquid biopsy applications targeted for just 1 or a small number of cancer types versus sort of the home-run opportunity in multi-cancer?"

So one type, as you point out, is multi-cancer early detection, which is what GRAIL does as well as other players that are looking to do that in the market. Another area that liquid biopsy is used is for therapy selection, so helping match cancer patients who were already diagnosed with the right therapies for them. We already have a product, a kit, that serves that space. So our TSO 500 product is used for therapy selection. A completely different part of the market, requires a different technology, looks for different things in the blood. And so liquid biopsy can be used for many things, but they're very different segments. And all of them are different and require sort of different technologies as part of a liquid biopsy approach.
The answer is, yes, we are going to continue to look at M&A going forward. It's going to be both technology tuck-ins that help us advance our mission and our strategic priorities and that could be a range of things. It could be technology tuck-ins.

Are there any offsets that we should be thinking about in terms of this quarter? And then finally, in arrays, the business, I mean both from a services and consumables standpoint, actually grew year-over-year after quite a while.

And the question is, why not more, right, because it clearly is now a very recognized value in terms of using sequencing for genomic pathogen-based surveillance, both for COVID and as a recognition that this infrastructure is going to be valuable for many, many, many years to come. So the question is why not more. The second question you had is with arrays, have we bottomed out.
Okay. So let's go to the first one. We absolutely sort of believe that we are laying an infrastructure here that's durable, that it's going to be an important part of all national -- major national health systems going forward. We absolutely believe that this infrastructure is going to be valuable not just to protect the public health but also from a national defense perspective. So we expect this is going to play out over a decade plus, right, and we are going to have, in most countries, some kind of genomic pathogen-based surveillance going forward.
In terms of how we thought about it this year, so the way we thought about it this year is we said you see some bolus of instrument buying in Q1, and we expect -- that was the bulk of the instrument buying we should expect to see this year. And we've talked about the fact that many countries now, we engaged with them last year, they bought some sequencing. And so for the rest of this year, we expect to continue to see consumable buying. But our expectation is -- well, you saw the bulk of the instrument buying for what's going to happen this year already happened. It is possible that more happens, and the things that would drive that are, obviously, the American Rescue Plan that talks about some very big numbers.
Our expectations are that it's going to take a while for the details to be worked out. And so while you'll see consumables being purchased over the course of the year, it won't really be towards the end of the year, we expect, that you'll start to see people talking about, okay, where are these 6 Centers of Excellence, how much sequencing infrastructure do they already have, how much additional hardware we need. And so it's going to be a story of the tail end of this year going into next year and beyond from an instruments perspective. And so that's how we thought about it. We'll keep you up-to-date if any of that accelerates over the course of this year. In terms of arrays, we did see some growth year-over-year. And there are different parts to that business. There's the direct-to-consumer part, and then there's sort of ag, and maybe Sam will talk a little bit about how those parts play out."

So I think the way you characterize it, Tejas, is correct in the sense that the business is stabilizing, and we're seeing less of a negative -- definitely not a negative impact from arrays. We actually saw them grow in Q1. The fact of the matter is DTC is now a very small part of our business. It's somewhere between 2% and 3% of our overall revenues. Back in 2018, DTC was a much bigger contributor to our overall revenue. So even though we're very pleased to see arrays growing in Q1, DTC specifically is less of a contributor. And we still see the mature arrays that we have, the mature business, whether it's agrigenomics or other applications, continuing to grow as well and has continued to grow over time.
Maybe to go to the last question that you had with regards to sequencing services and others. So let me explain the dynamics there, Tejas. Q1-over-Q1 of last year, we do have a negative headwind related to a $25 million IVD licensing fee that we had in Q1 of 2020 that we didn't see in Q1 of this year. So that was a negative. And as you saw, sequencing and other were down for the quarter by 16%. As we look for the year, what our guidance assumes is no material licensing fees or IVD fees with regards to any significant transactions or partnerships, I should say, for the year. So we're expecting mostly sequencing service and other to be flattish for the year quarter-over-quarter. And that's consistent with our original guidance that we had back in January."

So in terms of the HiSeqs, well, when we first started the NovaSeq upgrade path, as you know, we talked about the fact there were 850 HiSeq customers that, over time, we expect that the majority -- the vast majority of them would move to NovaSeq. So between 2017 and then until the end of last year, we went from 850 that had to upgrade, and then we refreshed the numbers and shared with you that we are now left with 320 that had to upgrade. And so that upgrade continued in Q1. I don't think there was a bolus or a catch-up. I think it was more of a steady sort of course of upgrade as we've continued to see, and we expect to continue to see that play forward over the quarters of this year and going into future years. So there was definitely continued upgrading, but there wasn't really a giant bolus or a catch-up that happened.
So now I'll turn over to you, Sam."

With regards to your other 2 questions there, so first, let me talk about the linearity, which is I think what you're referring to with regards to the approximately $1 billion in the quarter. So first of all, let's keep in mind, for Q1, we did have a couple of, I would say, items that benefited Q1. One was with regards to the $35 million of instrument purchases with regards to COVID surveillance. We believe that was a onetimer in terms of building the infrastructure. We don't expect material instrument placements going forward with regards to COVID, at least. That's in our assumptions, in our guidance assumptions. The other one is we called it out, which was a $20 million roughly consumable purchases, what we're calling catch-up purchases in Q1 because of the fact that the customers were maybe running a little bit lower on inventory and purchased by approximately $20 million higher than they would usually do, not a material amount but some elements of that. So that's what elevates Q1. That's why Q2 is sequentially a step-down. That's why the year and the second half is also not higher than the first half.
The other contributor to the second half not being higher than the first half is the UK Biobank, which we expect to complete their sequencing in the second half. So actually, towards Q3, they will wrap up that project. So those are the contributions, and that's why I would say our linearity is flattish this year. With regards to stock-based compensation, I called out at the beginning of the year, roughly just over $50 million year-over-year impact from stock-based comp. That is now higher, actually, from an expense standpoint because also driven by our performance, our stock-based accruals, stock-based compensation accruals, are actually higher. So we're expecting higher stock-based comp overall. So from a year-over-year standpoint, it's actually north of that $50 million. We haven't called out 2022. It's still early to talk about 2022 for stock-based comp. But that impact, that negative impact, obviously moderates in 2022 versus 2021."

Just to talk about the fact that it was our strongest placement order for first quarter of any year since we've launched NovaSeq. So you're absolutely right, we're seeing this huge amount of momentum.
Now what's driving that? I talked about the fact that it wasn't any kind of catch-up in terms of upgrade.

So with regards to profitability, I mean, as you saw in terms of both our guidance and also results in Q1, obviously, we've made pretty significant strides here in terms of improving the profitability or building on the profitability of the business. And that goes with our -- as we mentioned all along that as the volumes start to ramp, and we saw significant strength in the business in terms of the core business and some contribution from COVID, we're seeing leverage improve. We saw in Q1 that operating margins were north of 30%. We're expecting approximately 26.5% for the year. And we're expecting that to improve as we look forward over time. What are some of the things that are maybe the contributors to that and the ingredients to that? Obviously, gross margins, which have improved since our last guidance, and we'll continue to improve as we get past some of the COVID aspects related to higher freight expenses, for instance. Obviously, as volumes have ramped, we're seeing improvements in gross margin. 
We are making investments, though, I want to mention in the business, both in terms of manufacturing capacity and in terms of OpEx investments. I mean the growth that we're seeing in the business far exceeds our expectations, and we're incredibly encouraged by that. And we have to catch up in terms of making some investments in the infrastructure to catch up with some of the demand that we're seeing, both, as I said, in terms of manufacturing and in terms of OpEx, which is why we are -- we're committed to that. But as we look forward, we're also committed to improving leverage over time and getting back to historical levels. And we're still on that path. We made good strides in just 1 quarter, but we're still on that path.
With regards to mid throughput -- was it mid throughput or low throughput that was the question, sorry? Mid throughput. So with regards to mid throughput, we're not at the stage yet where we can share what the expectations are for pull-through in terms of NextSeq 2000, NextSeq 1000. Suffice it to say, and I know you're asking more about consumables, but I can tell you the level that we're seeing, in terms of placements on mid throughput for 2000 and 1000 as well as 550 Dx and 550, is incredibly encouraging. We're seeing record placements every quarter. We're expecting to continue at that level going forward, to improve on those levels going forward. And so when you're having -- so when you're early stage of the launch of this instrument and you're seeing this growth, it's really hard now to put a level of consumable pull-through range at this stage. So we have to still give it a few quarters before we can do that."

29753,1673844948,2365741,"Illumina, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Illumina delivered Q2 revenues of $1.126 billion, running 78% year-over-year growth, significantly exceeding expectations across all geographic regions and market segments. Our clinical markets, including oncology,",1254,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Illumina delivered Q2 revenues of $1.126 billion, running 78% year-over-year growth, significantly exceeding expectations across all geographic regions and market segments. Our clinical markets, including oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing, are expanding as reimbursement coverage increases, patient awareness grows and more sequencing applications into the clinic. 
Rapid population sequencing programs are contributing to the robust growth in our research business. Additionally, genomic surveillance has emerged a critical tool in the global fight against the pandemic, with over 70 countries now using Illumina platforms for COVID-19 surveillance. Looking forward, there's momentum for this global surveillance infrastructure to be the backbone of a durable global genomic epidemiology capability to combat future outbreaks, including transmissions, antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism.  
Q2 is the second consecutive quarter of record instrument sales with revenue up 113% year-over-year, and we ended the quarter with the highest instrument backlog since launching NovaSeq. Now looking at our performance by platform. Our high-throughput portfolio continued its spectacular run, with NovaSeq achieving its highest order volume since launch in Q1 2017. Demand for high-throughput sequencing capacity continues to expand, with over half of the orders in Q2 coming from customers who are new to high throughput. Additionally, our customers are continuing to use these systems at a higher rate to meet demand in oncology testing, genetic disease testing and population sequencing programs. 
Our mid-throughput platforms continue to drive growth with a record placements in Q2. The strength of the NextSeq 2000s is almost 3x the outlook of NextSeq 550 is enabling exciting new applications for customers like Cold Spring Harbor Labs in single cell analysis. Clinical customers drove new NextSeq 550 placements. NextSeqDX again set a record for shipments as we see a trend towards decentralization of clinical sequencing outside the U.S. 
Benchtop platforms also had an excellent quarter with instrument revenue up over 50% year-over-year. We shipped more MiSeq instruments this quarter than any prior quarter in the last 5 years. This record demand has been driven by our core business as well as emerging areas like preimplantation genetic screening and COVID surveillance. 
Turning to our clinical and research and applied segments. Sequencing consumables revenue of $4 million was up 82% year-over-year, driven by demand in both our clinical and research segments. Starting with our clinical business, our focus on market access and collaborations are expanding reimbursement, powering new and existing testing providers and benefiting patients around the world. There are now over 1 billion covered lives globally across NIPT, WGS for RUGGED and CGP in oncology, demonstrating the expertise and impact of Illumina's market access team to drive coverage and also the opportunity in our clinical segment. 
Oncology testing, our largest market segment, recorded its consecutive quarter of outstanding year-over-year growth. Our customers announced additional offerings for therapy selection and MRD tests. In therapy selection, expanding reimbursement for comprehensive genomic profiling is fueling the shift from small to large panels. With 74% of lives now covered for CGP in the U.S. and additional indications approved, new customers are entering the oncology testing field and existing customers like are expanding their footprint.  Two-side Oncology 500, Illumina's RUO comprehensive genomic profiling assay, achieved its 100,000 sample milestone in Q2 and added over 40 additional customers so far this year across 23 countries. 
In addition, over the last year, MRD testing has emerged as a key driver of future growth in the oncology segment, with positive reimbursement decisions, more customers and multiple approaches entering the market. It's also exciting to see pharma invest in MRD-based clinical trials to bring proven drugs to early-stage disease and improve patient outcomes. 
Reproductive health consumable shipments continue to benefit from the revised ACOG guidelines. In January, we expected that NIPT would be covered for approximately 3 million pregnancies in the U.S. by the end of 2021. We have already surpassed that milestone, and we expect coverage to continue to expand. We're also making progress outside the U.S. to ensure all expecting families have access to NIPT. In Germany, for example, national coverage will be implemented in 2022. Additionally, we're seeing continued growth from our CE-IVD mark, VeriSeq NIPT solution in Europe and Asia. 
In Q2, Generation Genomic in Thailand adopted our VeriSeq NIPT solution version 2, broadening access to expanded NIPT for expected parents in Southeast Asia. Genetic disease testing delivered another outstanding quarter, driven by reimbursement coverage increasing across Europe, and lower sequencing prices, enabling an accelerated shift from to genome. In the quarter, we also saw promising research and guidelines recognizing the diagnostic yield and cost effectiveness of whole genome sequencing for genetic disease. In June, Rady Children's Hospital in the State of California published the results of Project Baby Bear, a groundbreaking program that showcases the significant benefits of rapid whole genome sequencing and decreasing both time to diagnosis and health care spending for critically ill infants. More than 30% of these patients had a change of care due to the diagnosis enabled by WGS. This rapid whole-genome sequencing protocol is now available through Rady's growing network of over 60 hospital partners as well as other hospital networks across the country. 
Turning to our research and applied segments. We saw strong year-over-year and sequential growth. Momentum from population genomics programs continue to grow in Q2. In the U.S., All of Us is now operating at full scale, running thousands of genomes a week. We also saw multiple initiatives ramped internationally, providing an ongoing pipeline of new PopGen opportunities. We expect revenue from over 30 different PopGen initiatives in the second half of the year. Multiomic, spatial and single-cell approaches are gaining traction in many of our research segments, driving high-intensity sequencing. The success of partnerships with companies such as Olink, NanoString and will enable novel discoveries and expanded applications to enter the clinic. 
The emergence of the Delta variant has renewed focus on and heightened awareness for genomic surveillance in the fight against COVID-19 and future pathogens. The launch of the RU 96 sample COVIDSeq assay and the expanded EUA for COVIDSeq and NextSeq 2000 this quarter demonstrate our continued commitment to provide the workflow instruments and bioinformatics to meet this challenge. We are now working with governments and testing labs on COVID surveillance initiatives in over 70 countries. 
These efforts have driven increased COVID consumable revenue in Q2 relative to Q1. And at this time, we expect the consumable revenue in the second half to remain relatively steady to the first half. Through our philanthropic efforts, we are working to ensure that countries with high needs for COVID surveillance, but limited resources also have access to our sequencers and consumables. Earlier this week, we announced a donation of $1 million in sequencing capabilities, including 2 NextSeq 2000s to the Molecular Diagnostic Reference Laboratory at Kasturba Hospital. This will enable COVID surveillance in Mumbai, an epicenter of India's devastating second wave. 
Before I hand the call over to Sam, I'll provide a brief update on GRAIL. In Q2, GRAIL launched the first-of-its-kind multi-cancer screening test, Galleri. We make this test available to our employees and are encouraged by the positive feedback we've received. It's exciting to see the promise of genomics come to fruition in oncology screening, and we're committed to supporting all companies innovating in this space. As we shared in late July, we remain committed to closing this pro-competitive deal and believe with this acquisition, Illumina will be uniquely positioned to help save tens of thousands of lives. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Sam."

For the first time in company history, total quarter sequencing revenue exceeded $1 billion, growing 4% sequentially to $1.021 billion and representing 91% of total revenue. 
Our core business continued to accelerate across all regions in the quarter, driven by growth in clinics as well as strong demand from our research customers who were particularly impacted by the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020 and are continuing to resume and expand their sequencing. 
Sequencing consumables revenue grew 82% year-over-year to $704 million, led by record NovaSeq consumable shipments with robust demand driven by v1.5 flow cells. Sequencing instruments revenue grew 115% year-over-year to $189 million, reflecting another quarter of significant strength across all instrument categories. NovaSeq shipments more than doubled from the second quarter of 2020, driven by continued adoption by new to high-throughput customers. 
Mid-throughput system shipments reached a new high, driven by record NextSeqDx shipments and demand for NextSeq 1000 and 2000. Since launch, 25% of NextSeq's 1000 and 2000 have been shipped to new to Illumina customers. Contributions from COVID-19 surveillance testing exceeded our expectations, contributing approximately $40 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $50 million in incremental instrument revenue. 
Sequencing service and other revenue was also higher than expected growing 41% year-over-year to $128 million, primarily due to approximately $20 million of onetime revenue recognized from NIPT royalties received related to a patent litigation settlement. 
Moving to regional results. Revenue for the Americas region was $589 million, growing 76% compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by record sequencing product revenue related to demand for clinical oncology testing and genetic disease testing. The regional performance was also driven by strength in genetic disease research from population genomic initiatives as well as contributions from COVID surveillance testing. 
EMEA delivered revenue of $320 million, representing 90% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by both a recovery in research and an acceleration of the clinical business, including a record quarter for genetic disease testing due to momentum from expanded market access and reimbursement. COVID surveillance testing also contributed to the strong performance in the region. 
Greater China revenue was $132 million, representing growth of 67% year-over-year due to continued strength in sequencing led by clinical growth in the region. Sequencing instrument shipments more than doubled year-over-year, driven by growing demand for NextSeqDx in hospitals, given the superiors of use, accuracy and quality of outputs from Illumina sequencers. 
Finally, APJ revenue of $85 million grew 67% year-over-year, driven by sequencing consumables revenue growth across clinical applications in reproductive health and genetic disease testing as well as strong utilization by research customers. As expected, APJ revenue decreased sequentially due to timing of fiscal year-end purchases and normal seasonality in Japan in the first quarter of 2021. 
Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. 
Non-GAAP gross margin of 71.8% improved sequentially by 130 basis points, mainly due to favorable utilization on strong demand as well as onetime revenue from the patent litigation settlement. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 320 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes as well as a positive impact from the patent litigation settlement, partially offset by product mix. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $471 million increased $51 million sequentially due to higher compensation-related expenses and increased project-related spend, but were lower than expected due to the timing of certain investments shifting to the second half of 2021. 
As expected, non-GAAP operating expenses were up $137 million year-over-year due to increased performance-based compensation expenses and headcount growth as well as additional investments to support the growth of our business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30% and compared to 32.1% in the first quarter of 2021. 
Operating margins were better than expected due to higher revenues and favorable gross margin, driven by higher volumes than the onetime patent litigation settlement. Non-GAAP other expense of $2 million was flat sequentially and $15 million lower year-over-year as expected. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower interest income on short-term investments as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition. 
The non-GAAP tax rate of decrease from last quarter due to a tax expense recognized in the first quarter of 2021 on certain foreign subsidiary earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested. The decrease in the non-GAAP tax rate year-over-year was due to a higher mix of earnings in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate. 
For the second quarter, GAAP net income was $185 million or $1.26 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income was $276 million or $1.87 per diluted share. 
Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $253 million which included $105 million in continuation payments made to GRAIL pursuant to the merger agreement. DSO of 44 days compared to 43 days last quarter, driven by revenue linearity. First quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $44 million. Cash flow was $209 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the second quarter. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the second quarter, we used $491 million to repay the outstanding principal of our 2021 convertible notes, which matured in June. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $147 million. 
Moving now to 2021 guidance. We now expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 32% to 34% or $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion. At the midpoint, this represents an increase of approximately $1.07 billion compared to 2020. 
For the full year 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we now expect total sequencing revenue to grow approximately 35% year-over-year, driven by accelerating strength in our core business and higher-than-expected contributions from COVID surveillance testing. We now expect 2021 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 27.5%, reflecting our higher revenue expectations and our ongoing commitment to continued innovation in R&D. 
We continue to maintain our focus on improving our core business operating margin leverage over time. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to increase approximately 200 to 250 basis points from the prior year, which is higher than our previous expectations. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $6.30 to $6.50 and GAAP earnings share in the range of $4.69 to $4.89. 
Moving to the third quarter of 2021, we expect revenue to increase approximately 30% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.35 and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.23 to $1.28. Now I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks."

It's clear from our strong first half results that Illumina and our customers are firing on all cylinders. Our clinical markets are all growing as expanding reimbursement gives more patients access to existing genomic tests and evidence generation brings new genomic applications into the clinic. In oncology, more cancer patients have access to CGP for therapy selection. And emerging MRD and early cancer detection tests will drive significant long hot for sequencing. 
In genetic disease testing, the speed to diagnosis and treatment benefits that Rapid WGS offers is catalyzing awareness and adoption. In NIPT, while coverage has expanded dramatically in the U.S., there is still a significant need internationally, representing a tremendous growth opportunity. 
Research funding and overall investor capital deployment in life sciences continues to be incredibly robust, which will drive innovation and new use cases for sequencing for decades to come. Single cell, spatial and multi-omic approaches to complex problems are driving larger scale, novel research and clinical solutions. The benefit of population genomics programs in national health systems is driving more governments to take up these initiatives, further broadening the reach of sequencing across the globe. 
COVID surveillance initiatives are laying the foundation for a permanent global genomic epidemiology infrastructure. Illumina is playing a central role in these advancements in genomics and human health. I am very proud of the execution of our fantastic teams around the world. This is an incredible time for our field, and we have the most exciting technology road map in development that I have seen in my time at the company.

One, and Sam will add more color on this, but there are a number of onetime things that happened in Q1 that we don't expect to repeat in Q2, and we'll sort of list what they are. And then the second thing that's playing out is that we're still in the midst of the pandemic. And so we are keeping a watchful eye to see how the Delta variant plays out both here in the U.S. and around the world. 
And so that allows -- that means we should put some moderation in terms of what we expect to see in the business for the second half. We're definitely still in the middle of the pandemic. And those are the 2 factors I'd say that counterbalance what we see is incredible momentum in the markets that we're in."

Our business is really strong and really accelerating across the core markets. There are onetime factors in the first half that I do want to call out that are important when you think about the second half. So the onetime factors I would bucket as follows. You have -- in Q1, we had about $20 million of stocking. We did not see any stopping in the second quarter, but we did have $20 million in the first quarter. I would characterize roughly $55 million of COVID surveillance instrument placements. So that $55 million in the first half that we are now not expecting to repeat in the second half, so that's another item. 
There's the U.K. Biobank, which terminates and basically wraps up in the third quarter. So that's about $30 million of extra revenues in the first half that we will not have in the second half. And then finally, there's a $20 million NIPT settlement in the second quarter that I referred to in my prepared remarks, that will not repeat in the second half. So if you put all these together, it's about $125 million of what I would call onetime factors in the first half that don't repeat. If you exclude those from the first half and annualized, basically we're looking at flattish second half of this first half."

And what's especially exciting about that, as you know, is that instruments tend to be a lead indicator on the business because of the model that we employ. And if you look at what I said about instruments, we have the highest overall backlog for instruments since we launched NovaSeq. 
On the high throughput side, we had the highest order volume for NovaSeq since we launched the product in Q1 '17. On the mid-throughput side, we're on track to almost double the number of NextSeqs that we ship. If you look at the average we shipped for the last few years. So really strong momentum in the mid-throughput portfolio. And then even at the low end, as I pointed out in the remarks, we've got the highest MiSeq shipments of any quarter in the last. So low-throughput, mid-throughput, high-throughput, all of those businesses are showing real momentum, resulting in the big backlog that we have going into the second half of the year"

So recognizing what you talked about in your prepared remarks that you remain committed to GRAIL. I think it's fair and not controversial to say this process is clearly not going the way you expected it to. And unfortunately, this happens in a different way, but recently with PacBio as, of course, you know. So really kind of a 3-parter here. One, it seems like the U.S. and EU regulators tactically could really drag out this process if they want to and in a way, try to run out the clock over a 1- to 2-year period. 
I know that's not what you expect to happen or hope to happen. But if that does, are you willing to stick with this well into 2022? And then secondly, if this doesn't go through, is the conclusion that effectively Illumina can't acquire any service company that is Illumina sequencing dependent? And then third, what do you think you could be doing better with your regulatory evaluation process moving forward? And how are you changing your approach?"

And does it look like the process is going to run out the clock? So the way the timing is going to work is the deal contract last till December 20th. And so we are working both the FTC and the European Commission to get approval by that time frame. The -- at this point, there's processes and work. There's the work we're doing with the FTC. there is the work we're doing with the European Commission in Phase II review. And there's a work we're doing in Luxembourg to dismiss the European case because of jurisdiction. 
At this point, it is possible that all of those land one way or another by December 20. And so at this point, we're not yet at the stage where the clock has run out. And at this stage, we are committed to working through this period to get this to a conclusion. We continue to believe that this deal is procompetitive. We continue to believe that this deal will result in the savings of tens of thousands of lives that would not be saved if we didn't buy GRAIL just simply because we can accelerate the business. 
So to answer the question, we are committed to working through this deal through that time frame through the end of the year. I would not read this to mean that we can't buy any other services provider or anything else we want to buy. We have done a number of other acquisitions in the last 18 months. So those have gone through. And I think we are going to continue to look for things that we believe add long-term shareholder value. And if it means we need to acquire them, we will continue to look for those from time to time. 
In terms of what we can do better. One of the things we have learned is clearly, we don't have a DC presence and we don't have employees on the hill that are telling the Illumina story to the various agencies, to the other folks on the hill. And it's become clear to us that we need a bigger presence there. And so we're starting to build our presence there. And the fantastic thing and I personally have spent a lot more time over the hill, on the hill in the last couple of months. And the story really resonates. And so when we tell the story, I mean, people get really behind it and we want to support it. And so one of the things we have learned and we're going to do differently is we going have more of a presence on the hill, and we're going to be telling the Illumina story more often and more clearly."

Recognizing what we've seen in terms of recent acquisitions in the space and some of the new public entrants in sequencing. It seems fair to say that over the next few years, competitive dynamics are going to intensify our debt in sequencing. There's going to be more short-read platforms. There's going to be advancements in long-read tools. We're seeing that already. And I think you appreciate -- and I try to say this in the humblest way possible that coming from somebody that's focused a lot on sequencing over the last 15 years, and has seen a lot of planned technological threats come and go. 
For me to kind of look at the landscape and conclude that, hey, maybe this feels a little bit different now, maybe means something. So as you kind of think about that and really think about the next few years, is the playbook the same? New instruments maybe as soon as next year from top to bottom on the market, more flow cell density and essentially play the same elasticity curve, the same way you have in the past? Or as we think about the next few years, it's a little bit different?"

So let's start with a couple of parts of the question. One is, does it feel like that competition is intensifying right now in a way that it wasn't before? And two, so therefore, is the playbook the same in terms of comp",663,"All right. Another great question. So let's start with a couple of parts of the question. One is, does it feel like that competition is intensifying right now in a way that it wasn't before? And two, so therefore, is the playbook the same in terms of competing here? And so let's go to each part. One, now says, look, and you'll appreciate this, given the 15 years you've been looking at this is we've always had waves of competition, right? And a few years ago, we'd be talking about Qiagen and thermal and you were coming from behind in some markets. 
And so there have been -- and because the market is so big, and we're still at the very beginning of this giant market, we fully anticipate it will continue to attract a lot of venture investment. I mean there are dozens of companies. And we could have had this conversation any time in the last decade. And I'd have told you there are dozens of companies that are being funded to go after the sequencing space. So I don't especially see a difference in terms of the number of companies being started. The actual competitors showing up are different, obviously, every time. And I like what you said in one of the notes I read from you, Doug, where you said the trail is literally with the dead bodies of people whose sequencers look great on PowerPoint, but a couple of years away from launch, could never get closer than that to launching. So we've seen that. Now we will see more competition, though, going forward. Again, we expect that. The part of the playbook is the same. Better, faster sequencing continue to be the gold standard for accuracy, continue to a relentless pace in terms of innovation that our competitors have to follow, continue to set the price point in the market that everybody else has to follow. Those parts of the competitive playbook will be the same. 
Another part will be the same is continue to just add more and more value to the sequencers that our customers get. And you've seen us do that with Edico with the hardware acceleration that's now built into a sequencer. You've seen us do that by expanding the bioinformatics pipeline that's now built into a sequencer. And so we continue to expand what it means to create a sequencer. You remember the move we made from the output of our sequencers to images and then it became base calls. And now from our sequencer, you can get variants, and that's unique in the market. And now we'll force everybody else to react to that, say you've got to add that secondary pipeline now to your sequencer to catch up to Illumina giving you variance. But some part of the playbook has changed. 
The genomics industry and Illumina's business is way more diversified than it's ever been, right? A few years ago, we used to be targeting the research market. And it was really a single instrument, the HiSeq, right of the GA before that. So you were selling sort of highest throughput sequencers into the, the research market. Today, that's only one segment of our business. So our business is really diversified, almost 44%, 45% of our business comes from the clinical market and the rest is research and applied. More than half of our business comes from outside the U.S., And we have a lot of cleared end-to-end workflows into the market. 
And so as I look at the landscape, no single competitor out there matches all those segments of the business. And so each of them have their own different sort of playbook. In some cases, if you have to deliver clear end-to-end workflows, in some cases, it is better, faster, cheaper. And so that's a different. I think there's no single competitor I can look at Doug and say that competitor is coming after most of our business."

We are very happy with where we are with the PopSeq programs right now. I talked about the U.K. Biobank is just continuing to go full force. We expect it to sort of end towards the end of this year, but it's continuing to sequence at full production scale. All of us is now sequencing at full production scale. We talked about doing thousands of samples a week. And that pipeline seems really robust. And I don't expect much disruption over the course of the year, barring something massively unexpected for what's happening with all of us. So they've been running really well. 
The other thing that is really exciting about PopSeq is now we have 30 programs that are up and running around the world. And so that means we're starting to diversify the revenue contribution from the PopSeq programs as they start to ramp around the world. And that gives us, I think, a little bit more resilience in terms of if any part of the world is more impacted than the other, it's -- there's still a lot of parts that will go. So I think it's -- I think it's a really healthy set up for us in terms of PopSeq for the rest of the year. 
In terms of COVID instruments, you're right, when I was here doing this call a few months ago, I told you that we weren't expecting any more instruments for the year. We thought the was going to happen in Q1. And then on behold, we sold some instruments or COVID surveillance in Q2. That part of the business, candidly, Tycho, is hard to predict. And so what we've built into the model is no more instruments for the rest of the year and $50 million to $60 million in terms of consumables. And yes, absolutely, it's possible we buy that people buy more instruments. But again, that's hard to predict."

In terms of China, we were really happy with the performance we've been seeing out of China. We talked about the growth we're seeing in China. We are maintaining our leading position in China. Our strategy there is paying off, and it touches on the things you asked about. So we have always followed a strategy in China that was very partner-centric. And so we have partners that are building their products on our instruments and selling them into customers. And those customers are -- those partners are Chinese partners. 
And so a lot of them are qualified even under the made in China regulations. And that puts us in a really good position in China. The other thing that -- a couple of other things, one you touched on, which is the NovaSeqDx again, sort of a partner model, but that's a really positive step forward for us in China.

And so we continue to be in dialogue with our customers to try and understand where sort of the demand curve is. And when we feel that there is an opportunity to expand the market through the launch of an instrument with a certain price point or a certain capability, that's when we bring the product to market. 
So our technical teams are just constantly pushing the technology. And then when we feel the market is ready, we do the engineering to bring those technologies into end. That has -- that part of the philosophy has not changed, and we're going to continue to watch the in the right time is to catalyze a segment of the market with a new product offering. What has changed, actually, it's really interesting has been the result of watching what happened with NextSeq 1000, 2000. And what we have seen with NextSeq 1000, 2000 is that the 1000, 2000 has dramatically expanded the mid-throughput market. There wasn't just and upgrade our replacement cycle. And it's quite dramatic actually. 
If you look at the number of mid-throughput instruments we shipped over the last few years, it's been fairly steady. This year, we are on track to almost double that number. And there are lots of people who are still buying 550s in the 550Dxs. What's happened is we've catalyzed and opened up new markets for the mid-throughput instrument with the price points that we've put out with the 1000, 2000. And that's different than the market has been before. And so now we see an opportunity, even in a market segment to not just catalyze an upgrade cycle, but actually to open up other parts of that segment with an offering in that market segment.

We are seeing a good number of new to Illumina and new to that segment customers come in. 
It continues to be on the clinical workhorses of our portfolio and you see applications in oncology, you see applications in NIPT. And that continues to be true. The things we talked about in terms of the expansion we're seeing in the clinical market, all that reimbursement that kicked in last year oncology, for NIPT, all of that is driving the instrument purchases we're seeing. And that's a really great sign because as we talked about, instrument purchases for us are a lead indicator of future growth. And so when you place that many instruments, it's exciting for us to think about. And so those are some things that they are driving the mid-throughput."

In terms of this year, Kyle, just to kind of strip out what is the progression in terms of the guide. In Q1, we had 55 million with 35 million instruments, 20 million consumables. In Q2, we had 60 million with 20 million instruments and 40 million consumables. And our expectation in the second half is that we have approximately $50 million to $60 million of are of sequencing consumables revenue in the second half. We look at it as equally split between Q3 and Q4.

Illumina delivered Q2 revenues of $1.126 billion, representing 78% year-over-year growth, significantly exceeding expectations across all geographic regions and market segments. Our clinical markets, including onco",1264,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Illumina delivered Q2 revenues of $1.126 billion, representing 78% year-over-year growth, significantly exceeding expectations across all geographic regions and market segments. Our clinical markets, including oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing are expanding as reimbursement coverage increases, patient awareness grows and more sequencing applications enter the clinic.
Ramping population sequencing programs are contributing to the robust growth in our research business. Additionally, genomic surveillance has emerged as a critical tool in the global fight against the pandemic, with over 70 countries now using Illumina platforms for COVID-19 surveillance. Looking forward, there's momentum for this global surveillance infrastructure to be the backbone of a durable, global genomic epidemiology capability to combat future outbreaks, including zoonotic transmissions, antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism.
Q2 was the second consecutive quarter of record instrument sales, with revenue up 113% year-over-year and we ended the quarter with the highest instrument backlog since launching NovaSeq.
Now looking at our performance by platform. Our high throughput portfolio continued its spectacular run, with NovaSeq achieving its highest order volume since launch in Q1 2017. Demand for high throughput sequencing capacity continues to expand, with over half of the orders in Q2 coming from customers who are new to high throughput. Additionally, our customers are continuing to use these systems at a higher rate to meet demand in oncology testing, genetic disease testing and population sequencing programs.
Our mid-throughput platforms continue to drive growth with record placements in Q2. The strength of the NextSeq 2000s, with almost 3x the output of NextSeq 550, is enabling exciting new applications for customers like Cold Spring Harbor Labs in single cell analysis. Clinical customers drove new NextSeq 550 placements. NextSeqDx again set a record for shipments as we see a trend towards decentralization of clinical sequencing outside the U.S.
Benchtop platforms also had an excellent quarter with instrument revenue up over 50% year-over-year. We shipped more MiSeq instruments this quarter than any prior quarter in the last 5 years. This record demand has been driven by our core business as well as emerging areas like preimplantation genetic screening and COVID surveillance.
Turning to our Clinical and Research and Applied segments. Sequencing consumables revenue of $704 million was up 82% year-over-year, driven by demand in both our Clinical and Research segments. Starting with our clinical business, our focus on market access and collaborations are expanding reimbursement, powering new and existing testing providers and benefiting patients around the world. There are now over 1 billion covered lives globally across NIPT, WGS for RUGD and CGP in oncology, demonstrating the expertise and impact of Illumina's market access team to drive coverage and also the enormous opportunity in our clinical segment.
Oncology testing, our largest market segment, recorded its third consecutive quarter of outstanding year-over-year growth as our customers announced additional offerings for therapy selection and MRD tests. In therapy selection, expanding reimbursement for comprehensive genomic profiling is fueling the shift from small to large panels. With 74% of lives now covered for CGP in the U.S. and additional indications approved, new customers are entering the oncology testing field and existing customers like Caris are expanding their footprint. TruSight Oncology 500, Illumina's RUO comprehensive genomic profiling assay, achieved its 100,000 sample milestone in Q2 and added over 40 additional customers so far this year across 23 countries.
In addition, over the last year, MRD testing has emerged as a key driver of future growth in the oncology segment, with positive reimbursement decisions, more customers and multiple approaches entering the market. It's also exciting to see pharma invest in MRD-based clinical trials to bring proven drugs to early-stage disease and improve patient outcomes.
Reproductive health consumable shipments continue to benefit from the revised ACOG guidelines. In January, we expected that NIPT would be covered for approximately 3 million pregnancies in the U.S. by the end of 2021. We have already surpassed that milestone, and we expect coverage to continue to expand. We're also making progress outside the U.S. to ensure all expecting families have access to NIPT. In Germany, for example, national coverage will be implemented in 2022. Additionally, we're seeing continued growth from our CE-IVD marked VeriSeq NIPT solution in Europe and Asia. In Q2, Next Generation Genomic in Thailand adopted our VeriSeq NIPT Solution v2, broadening access to expanded NIPT for expectant parents in Southeast Asia.
Genetic disease testing delivered another outstanding quarter, driven by reimbursement coverage increasing across Europe, and lower sequencing prices, enabling an accelerated shift from exomes to genomes. In the quarter, we also saw promising research and guidelines recognizing the diagnostic yield and cost effectiveness of whole genome sequencing for genetic disease. In June, Rady Children's Hospital and the State of California published the results of Project Baby Bear, a groundbreaking program that showcases the significant benefits of rapid whole genome sequencing in decreasing both time to diagnosis and health care spending for critically ill infants. More than 30% of these patients had a change of care due to the diagnosis enabled by WGS. This rapid whole genome sequencing protocol is now available through Rady's growing network of over 60 hospital partners as well as other hospital networks across the country.
Turning to our Research and Applied segments, we saw strong year-over-year and sequential growth. Momentum from population genomics programs continued to grow in Q2. In the U.S., All of Us is now operating at full scale, running thousands of genomes a week. We also saw multiple initiatives ramp internationally, providing an ongoing pipeline of new PopGen opportunities. We expect revenue from over 30 different PopGen initiatives in the second half of the year. Multiomic, spatial and single-cell approaches are gaining traction in many of our research segments, driving high-intensity sequencing. The success of Illumina's partnerships with companies such as Olink, NanoString and 10x will enable novel discoveries and expanded applications to enter the clinic.
The emergence of the Delta variant has renewed focus on and heightened awareness for genomic surveillance in the fight against COVID-19 and future pathogens. The launch of the RUO 96-sample COVIDSeq assay and the expanded EUA for COVIDSeq on NextSeq 2000 this quarter demonstrate our continued commitment to provide the workflows, instruments and bioinformatics to meet this challenge. We are now working with governments and testing labs on COVID surveillance initiatives in over 70 countries. These efforts have driven increased COVID consumable revenue in Q2 relative to Q1. And at this time, we expect the consumable revenue in the second half to remain relatively steady to the first half.
Through our philanthropic efforts, we are working to ensure that countries with high needs for COVID surveillance but limited resources also have access to our sequencers and consumables. Earlier this week, we announced a donation of $1 million in sequencing capabilities, including 2 NextSeq 2000s to the Molecular Diagnostic Reference Laboratory at Kasturba Hospital. This will enable COVID surveillance in Mumbai, an epicenter of India's devastating second wave.
Before I hand the call over to Sam, I'll provide a brief update on GRAIL. In Q2, GRAIL launched the first-of-its-kind multi-cancer screening test, Galleri. We made this test available to our employees and are encouraged by the positive feedback we've received. It's exciting to see the promise of genomics come to fruition in oncology screening, and we're committed to supporting all companies innovating in this space. As we shared in late July, we remain committed to closing this pro-competitive deal and believe with this acquisition, Illumina will be uniquely positioned to help save tens of thousands of lives.
And now I'll turn the call over to Sam."

For the first time in company history, total quarter sequencing revenue exceeded $1 billion, growing 4% sequentially to $1.021 billion and representing 91% of total revenue.
Our core business continued to accelerate across all regions in the quarter, driven by growth in clinical as well as strong demand from our research customers who were particularly impacted by the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020 and are continuing to resume and expand their sequencing.  
Sequencing consumables revenue grew 82% year-over-year to $704 million, led by record NovaSeq consumable shipments with robust demand driven by v1.5 flow cells. Sequencing instruments revenue grew 115% year-over-year to $189 million, reflecting another quarter of significant strength across all instrument categories. NovaSeq shipments more than doubled from the second quarter of 2020, driven by continued adoption by new to high-throughput customers.
Mid-throughput system shipments reached a new high, driven by record NextSeqDx shipments and demand for NextSeq 1000 and 2000. Since launch, 25% of NextSeq 1000 and 2000 have been shipped to new-to-Illumina customers.
Revenue contributions from COVID-19 surveillance testing exceeded our expectations, contributing approximately $40 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $20 million in incremental instrument revenue.
Sequencing service and other revenue was also higher than expected growing 41% year-over-year to $128 million, primarily due to approximately $20 million of onetime revenue recognized from NIPT royalties received related to a patent litigation settlement.
Moving to regional results. Revenue for the Americas region was $589 million, growing 76% compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by record sequencing product revenue related to demand for clinical oncology testing and genetic disease testing. The regional performance was also driven by strength in genetic disease research from population genomic initiatives as well as contributions from COVID surveillance testing.
EMEA delivered revenue of $320 million, representing 90% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by both a recovery in research and an acceleration of the clinical business, including a record quarter for genetic disease testing due to momentum from expanded market access and reimbursement. COVID surveillance testing also contributed to the strong performance in the region.
Greater China revenue was $132 million, representing growth of 67% year-over-year due to continued strength in sequencing led by clinical growth in the region. Sequencing instrument shipments more than doubled year-over-year, driven by growing demand for NextSeqDx in hospitals, given the superiors ease of use, accuracy and quality of outputs from Illumina sequencers.
Finally, APJ revenue of $85 million grew 67% year-over-year, driven by sequencing consumables revenue growth across clinical applications in reproductive health and genetic disease testing as well as strong utilization by research customers. As expected, APJ revenue decreased sequentially due to timing of fiscal year-end purchases and normal seasonality in Japan in the first quarter of 2021.
Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 71.8% improved sequentially by 130 basis points, mainly due to favorable utilization on strong demand as well as onetime revenue from the patent litigation settlement. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 320 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes as well as a positive impact from the patent litigation settlement, partially offset by product mix.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $471 million increased $51 million sequentially due to higher compensation-related expenses and increased project-related spend, but were lower than expected due to the timing of certain investments shifting to the second half of 2021. As expected, non-GAAP operating expenses were up $137 million year-over-year due to increased performance-based compensation expenses and headcount growth as well as additional investments to support the growth of our business.
Non-GAAP operating margin was 30% compared to 32.1% in the first quarter of 2021. Operating margins were better than expected due to higher revenues and favorable gross margin, driven by higher volumes and the onetime patent litigation settlement.
Non-GAAP other expense of $2 million was flat sequentially and $15 million lower year-over-year as expected. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower interest income on short-term investments as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition.
The non-GAAP tax rate of 17.9% decreased from last quarter due to a tax expense recognized in the first quarter of 2021 on certain foreign subsidiary earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested. The decrease in the non-GAAP tax rate year-over-year was due to a higher mix of earnings in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate.
For the second quarter, GAAP net income was $185 million or $1.26 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income was $276 million or $1.87 per diluted share.
Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $253 million, which included $105 million in continuation payments made to GRAIL pursuant to the merger agreement.
DSO of 44 days compared to 43 days last quarter, driven by revenue linearity.
Second quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $44 million and free cash flow was $209 million.
We did not repurchase any common stock in the second quarter.
We ended the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the second quarter, we used $491 million to repay the outstanding principal of our 2021 convertible notes, which matured in June.
Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 147 million.
Moving now to 2021 guidance. We now expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 32% to 34% or $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion. At the midpoint, this represents an increase of approximately $1.07 billion compared to 2020.
For the full year 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we now expect total sequencing revenue to grow approximately 35% year-over-year, driven by accelerating strength in our core business and higher-than-expected contributions from COVID surveillance testing. We now expect 2021 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 27.5%, reflecting our higher revenue expectations and our ongoing commitment to continued innovation in R&D. We continue to maintain our focus on improving our core business operating margin leverage over time.
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to increase approximately 200 to 250 basis points from the prior year, which is higher than our previous expectations. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $6.30 to $6.50 and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $4.69 to $4.89.
Moving to the third quarter of 2021, we expect revenue to increase approximately 30% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.35 and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.23 to $1.28.
Now I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks."

It's clear from our strong first half results that Illumina and our customers are firing on all cylinders.
Our clinical markets are all growing as expanded reimbursement gives more patients access to existing genomic tests, and evidence generation brings new genomic applications into the clinic. In oncology, more cancer patients have access to CGP for therapy selection. And emerging MRD and early cancer detection tests will drive significant long-term growth for sequencing.
In genetic disease testing, the speed to diagnosis and treatment benefits that rapid WGS offers is catalyzing awareness and adoption. In NIPT, while coverage has expanded dramatically in the U.S., there is still a significant need internationally, representing a tremendous growth opportunity.
Research funding and overall investor capital deployment in life sciences continues to be incredibly robust, which will drive innovation and new use cases for sequencing for decades to come. Single-cell, spatial and multiomic approaches to complex problems are driving larger scale, novel research and clinical solutions. The benefit of population genomics programs in national health systems is driving more governments to take up these initiatives, further broadening the reach of sequencing across the globe. COVID surveillance initiatives are laying the foundation for a permanent global genomic epidemiology infrastructure.
Illumina is playing a central role in these advancements in genomics and human health. I am very proud of the execution of our fantastic teams around the world. This is an incredible time for our field, and we have the most exciting technology road map in development that I have seen in my time at the company. I'm honored to work alongside my colleagues to fulfill Illumina's instrumental role in improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome.
Now I'll invite the operator to open for Q&A."

But there are a number of things that we are watching for. One, and Sam will add more color on this, but there are a number of onetime things that happened in Q1 that we don't expect to repeat in Q2, and we'll sort of list what they are.
And then the second thing that's playing out is that we're still in the midst of the pandemic. And so we are keeping a watchful eye to see how the Delta variant plays out both here in the U.S. and around the world. And so that allows -- that means we should put some moderation in terms of what we expect to see in the business for the second half. We're definitely still in the middle of the pandemic. And those are the 2 factors I'd say that counterbalance what we see is incredible momentum in the markets that we're in."

Our business is really strong and really accelerating across the core markets. There are onetime factors in the first half that I do want to call out that are important when you think about the second half. So the onetime factors I would bucket as follows. You have -- in Q1, we had about $20 million of stocking. We did not see any stocking in the second quarter, but we did have $20 million in the first quarter. I would characterize roughly $55 million of COVID surveillance instrument placements. So that $55 million in the first half that we are now not expecting to repeat in the second half, so that's another item.
There's the U.K. Biobank, which terminates and basically wraps up in the third quarter. So that's about $30 million of extra revenues in the first half that we will not have in the second half. And then finally, there's a $20 million NIPT settlement in the second quarter that I referred to in my prepared remarks, that will not repeat in the second half.
So if you put all these together, it's about $125 million of what I would call onetime factors in the first half that don't repeat. If you exclude those from the first half and annualized, it's basically we're looking at flattish second half of this first half."

And if you look at what I said about instruments, we have the highest overall backlog for instruments since we launched NovaSeq.
On the high throughput side, we had the highest order volume for NovaSeq since we launched the product in Q1 '17. On the mid-throughput side, we're on track to almost double the number of NextSeqs that we ship. If you look at the average we shipped for the last few years, so really strong momentum in the mid-throughput portfolio.
And then even at the low end, as I pointed out in the remarks, we've got the highest MiSeq shipments of any quarter in the last. So low throughput, mid-throughput, high throughput, all of those businesses are showing real momentum, resulting in the big backlog that we have going into the second half of the year."

One, it seems like the U.S. and EU regulators tactically could really drag out this process if they want to and in a way, try to run out the clock over a 1- to 2-year period.
I know that's not what you expect to happen or hope to happen. But if that does, are you willing to stick with this well into 2022? And then secondly, if this doesn't go through, is the conclusion that effectively Illumina can't acquire any service company that is Illumina sequencing dependent?

And does it look like the process is going to run out the clock? So the way the timing is going to work is the deal contract last till December 20. And so we are working both the FTC and the European Commission to get approval by that time frame. The -- at this point, there's processes and work. There's the work we're doing with the FTC, there is the work we're doing with the European Commission in Phase II review and there's a work we're doing in Luxembourg to dismiss the European case because of jurisdiction.
At this point, it is possible that all of those land one way or another by December 20. And so at this point, we're not yet at the stage where the clock has run out. And at this stage, we are committed to working through this period to get this to a conclusion. We continue to believe that this deal is procompetitive. We continue to believe that this deal will result in the savings of tens of thousands of lives that would not be saved if we didn't buy GRAIL just simply because we can accelerate the business.
So to answer the question, we are committed to working through this deal through that time frame through the end of the year. I would not read this to mean that we can't buy any other services provider or anything else we want to buy. We have done a number of other acquisitions in the last 18 months. So those have gone through. And I think we are going to continue to look for things that we believe add long-term shareholder value. And if it means we need to acquire them, we will continue to look for those from time to time.
In terms of what we can do better? One of the things we have learned is clearly, we don't have a DC presence and we don't have employees on the hill that are telling the Illumina story to the various agencies, to the other folks on the hill. And it's become clear to us that we need a bigger presence there. And so we're starting to build our presence there. And the fantastic thing and I personally have spent a lot more time over the hill -- on the hill in the last couple of months. And the story really resonates. And so when we tell the story, I mean, people get really behind it and want to support it. And so one of the things we have learned and we're going to do differently is we going to have more of a presence on the hill, and we're going to be telling the Illumina story more often and more clearly."

Recognizing what we've seen in terms of recent acquisitions in the space and some of the new public entrants in sequencing, it seems fair to say that over the next few years, competitive dynamics are going to intensify our debt in sequencing. There's going to be more short-read platforms. There's going to be advancements in long-read tools. We're seeing that already. And I think you appreciate -- and I try to say this in the humblest way possible that coming from somebody that's focused a lot on sequencing over the last 15 years and has seen a lot of planned technological threats come and go.
For me to kind of look at the landscape and conclude that, hey, maybe this feels a little bit different now, maybe means something. So as you kind of think about that and really think about the next few years, is the playbook the same? New instruments maybe as soon as next year from top to bottom on the market, more flow cell density and essentially play the same elasticity curve, the same way you have in the past? Or as we think about the next few years, it's a little bit different?"

So let's start with a couple of parts of the question. One is, does it feel like that competition is intensifying right now in a way that it wasn't before? And two, so therefore, is the playbook the same in terms of comp",665,"All right. Another great question. So let's start with a couple of parts of the question. One is, does it feel like that competition is intensifying right now in a way that it wasn't before? And two, so therefore, is the playbook the same in terms of competing here? And so let's go to each part. One, I'll say, look, and you'll appreciate this, given the 15 years you've been looking at this is we've always had waves of competition, right? And a few years ago, we'd be talking about Qiagen and Thermo and you were coming from behind in some markets.
And so there have been -- and because the market is so big and we're still at the very beginning of this giant market, we fully anticipate it will continue to attract a lot of venture investment. I mean there are dozens of companies. And we could have had this conversation any time in the last decade. And I'd have told you there are dozens of companies that are being funded to go after the sequencing space. So I don't especially see a difference in terms of the number of companies being started.
The actual competitors showing up are different, obviously, every time. And I like what you said in one of the notes I read from you, Doug, where you said the trail is literally the dead bodies of people whose sequencers look great on PowerPoint, but a couple of years away from launch, could never get closer than that to launching. So we've seen that.
Now we will see more competition, though, going forward. Again, we expect that. The part of the playbook is the same. Better, faster sequencing continue to be the gold standard for accuracy, continue to set a relentless pace in terms of innovation that our competitors have to follow, continue to set the price point in the market that everybody else has to follow. Those parts of the competitive playbook will be the same.
Another part will be the same is continue to just add more and more value to the sequencers that our customers get. You've seen us do that with Edico with the hardware acceleration that's now built into a sequencer. You've seen us do that by expanding the bioinformatics pipeline that's now built into a sequencer. And so we continue to expand what it means to create a sequencer. And you remember the move we made from the output of our sequencers to images and then it became base calls. And now from our sequencer, you can get variants, and that's unique in the market. And now we'll force everybody else to react to that to say you've got to add that secondary pipeline now to your sequencer to catch up to Illumina giving you variance. But some part of the playbook has changed.
The genomics industry and Illumina's business is way more diversified than it's ever been, right? A few years ago, we used to be targeting the research market. And it was really a single instrument, the HiSeq, right at the GA before that. So you were selling sort of highest throughput sequencers into the RUO, the research market. Today, that's only one segment of our business. So our business has really diversified. Almost 44%, 45% of our business comes from the clinical market and the rest is research and applied. More than half of our business comes from outside the U.S. And we have a lot of cleared end-to-end workflows into the market.
And so as I look at the landscape, no single competitor out there matches all those segments of the business. And so each of them have their own different sort of playbook. In some cases, if you have to deliver clear end-to-end workflows, in some cases, it is better, faster, cheaper. And so that's a different. I think there's no single competitor I can look at, Doug, and say that competitor is coming after most of our business."

We are very happy with where we are with COVID -- with the PopSeq programs right now. I talked about the U.K. Biobank is just continuing to go full force. We expect it to sort of end towards the end of this year, but it's continuing to sequence at full production scale. All of us is now sequencing at full production scale. We talked about doing thousands of samples a week. And that pipeline seems really robust. And I don't expect much disruption over the course of the year, barring something massively unexpected for what's happening with all of us. So they've been running really well.
The other thing that is really exciting about PopSeq is now we have 30 programs that are up and running around the world. And so that means we're starting to diversify the revenue contribution from the PopSeq programs as they start to ramp around the world. And that gives us, I think, a little bit more resilience in terms of if any part of the world is more impacted than the other, it's -- there's still a lot of parts that will go. So I think it's -- I think it's a really healthy set up for us in terms of PopSeq for the rest of the year.
In terms of COVID instruments, you're right. When I was here doing this call a few months ago, I told you that we weren't expecting any more instruments for the year. We thought the buy was going to happen in Q1. And then on behold, we sold some instruments for COVID surveillance in Q2. That part of the business, candidly, Tycho, is hard to predict. And so what we've built into the model is no more instruments for the rest of the year and $50 million to $60 million in terms of consumables. And yes, absolutely, it's possible we buy -- that people buy more instruments. But again, that's hard to predict."

In terms of China, we were really happy with the performance we've been seeing out of China. We talked about the growth we're seeing in China. We are maintaining our leading position in China. Our strategy there is really paying off, and it touches on the things you asked about. So we have always followed a strategy in China that was very partner-centric. And so we have partners that are building their products on our instruments and selling them into customers. And those customers are -- those partners are Chinese partners. And so a lot of them are qualified even under the Made in China regulations. And that puts us in a really good position in China.
The other thing that -- a couple of other things, one you touched on, which is the NovaSeqDx, again, sort of a partner model, but that's a really positive step forward for us in China.

The part that hasn't changed is we will launch products into the market when we think the market is ready, meaning that the ready to absorb the price points, we will unlock additional elasticities and grow the market as a whole. And so we continue to be in dialogue with our customers to try and understand where sort of the demand curve is. And when we feel that there is an opportunity to expand the market through the launch of an instrument with a certain price point or a certain capability, that's when we bring the product to market.
So our technical teams are just constantly pushing the technology. And then when we feel the market is ready, we do the engineering to bring those technologies into end. That has -- that part of the philosophy has not changed, and we're going to continue to watch when the right time is to catalyze a segment of the market with a new product offering.
What has changed, actually, and it's really interesting has been the result of watching what happened with NextSeq 1000, 2000. And what we have seen with NextSeq 1000, 2000 is that the 1000, 2000 has dramatically expanded the mid-throughput market. There wasn't just and upgrade or a replacement cycle. And it's quite dramatic actually.
If you look at the number of mid-throughput instruments we shipped over the last few years, it's been fairly steady. This year, we are on track to almost double that number. And there are lots of people who are still buying 550s in the 550Dxs. What's happened is we've catalyzed and opened up new markets for the mid-throughput instrument with the price points that we've put out with the 1000, 2000. And that's different than the Genomics market has been before. And so now we see an opportunity, even in a market segment to not just catalyze an upgrade cycle, but actually to open up other parts of that segment with an offering in that market segment. And so that's a different philosophy that we're building into now our strategies as we think about future products."

So we're not giving you an exact number, but we were going to be above that $1.2 million top end.
With regards to NextSeq, the pull-through on NextSeq 550, at least, we haven't shared any pull-through on NextSeq 2000 or 1000, too early right now in the life cycle of those instruments to provide that. But for NextSeq 550, we're at the high end of that 100 to 150 range that we traditionally shared. So pull-through is at the high end of that.
With regards to MiSeq, we're within the 40,000 to 45,000 pull-through range of that instrument. And with regards to MiniSeq, we're within that -- on the high end of that 20,000 to 25,000 pull-through range for that instrument."

I would say that with the price reduction that we put into the market last summer, which catalyzed the elasticity we're seeing, the $600 genome is now pretty broadly available to our NovaSeq customers. So I would expect a significant number of them are actually availing themselves at that price point.
Now of course, you know that it's not necessarily genomes that they're running. NovaSeqs are now used for a very broad range of applications, a lot of NovaSeq usage in oncology for the TSO 500 or some of these large panels.

One, we continue to ship 550s and 550Dxs. So there are people who validated workflows on those instruments, they are continuing to buy. We are seeing a good number of new to Illumina and new to that segment customers come in.
It continues to be on the clinical workhorses of our portfolio and you see applications in oncology, you see applications in NIPT and that continues to be true. The things we talked about in terms of the expansion we're seeing in the clinical market, all that reimbursement that kicked in last year oncology, for NIPT, all of that is driving the instrument purchases we're seeing.

In terms of this year, Kyle, just to kind of script out what is the progression in terms of the guide, in Q1, we had $55 million with $35 million instruments, $20 million consumables. In Q2, we had $60 million with $20 million instruments and $40 million consumables. And our expectation in the second half is that we have approximately $50 million to $60 million of -- of sequencing consumables revenue in the second half.

Illumina's third quarter was another exceptionally strong quarter with $1.108 billion in revenue, up 40% year-over-year and once again, significantly ahead of expectations. Our customer base continues to expand rapidly. And in the first 3 quarters of 2021, we added 50% more new customers than in all of 2020 or 2019. Because of this strength across our business, we're raising our full year revenue growth outlook for the third quarter in a row to approximately 36%. This is approximately double the growth rate and $567 million higher than the midpoint of the range we guided to at the beginning of the year. 
I will talk through the third quarter results for core Illumina as defined as Illumina other than GRAIL, and then I'll turn the call over to Bob Ragusa, the CEO of our GRAIL subsidiary to cover the GRAIL business. Core Illumina revenue was $1.106 billion. Sequencing instrument revenue was up 65% year-over-year, and we exited the quarter with a record instrument backlog, a positive leading indicator for future revenue. Sequencing activity in the quarter was also strong, with sequencing consumable revenue up 45% year-over-year, setting a new record. Our high throughput platform order volume is accelerating. Oncology testing, population sequencing and drug discovery initiatives drove record NovaSeq consumable and instrument shipments. Oncology testing customers represented the highest proportion of NovaSeq shipments for the quarter as large oncology testing labs added to their fleets to support expanded reimbursement for therapy selection testing. 
Drug discovery is emerging as a new application for high throughput sequencing with opportunities across common diseases ranging from obesity to aging. Our mid-throughput platforms also drove growth and expanded our installed base. In the third quarter, over 50% of NextSeq 1000 and 2000 placements were new to Illumina customers or to customers upgrading from low throughput instruments. These instruments continue to unlock new applications. Researchers at School of Medicine are using the NextSeq 2000 for single cell experiments focused on infection and inflammation. The team is working to develop inhaled vaccines for pneumonia and use single-cell RNA Seq on a NextSeq 2000 to study the immune cells elicited by this vaccine platform in a recent paper published in Science Immunology. 
Benchtop platforms also saw significant growth year-over-year, with the highest number of MiSeq shipments since Q4 2015. MiSeq, coupled with our COVIDSeq 96 sample assay, is enabling labs around the world to engage in local pathogen surveillance. This quarter, MiSeq placements in both Argentina and Brazil brought COVID surveillance to local communities in conjunction with broader national programs. 
Now turning to Clinical and Research and Applied segments, Oncology testing, our largest market segment, had another record quarter. Sequencing is becoming the standard of care and therapy selection, which is driving robust demand for Illumina sequencers, and our oncology testing customers are rapidly scaling their fleets in response. Reimbursement for genetic testing for therapy selection continues to expand with over 70% of insured lives in the U.S. now covered for these tests. 
Additionally, there are over 60 targeted and immunotherapy treatments currently on the market, highlighting the power of comprehensive genomic profiling in matching patients to treatment. TruSight Oncology 500, our research use-only comprehensive genomic profiling assay, had another record quarter, with over 340 customers now using the assay in their labs. In September, we announced a CDx partnership with Merck to develop and commercialize tests leveraging TSO 500 content and an HRD status based on Myriad's myChoice in patients with ovarian cancer. Approximately 300,000 women around the world will be diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer, the fifth deadliest cancer for women. This partnership will help these patients access additional treatment options with the goal of improving care. 
In reproductive health, we saw another quarter of strong year-over-year growth. Most 80% of pregnancies in the U.S. are now covered for noninvasive prenatal testing. And we're seeing additional progress as states begin to incorporate the ACOG guideline revision from last year into their prenatal screening programs. In California, the prenatal screening program is being revised to include noninvasive prenatal testing, and the state has now issued a request for proposal. NIPT is increasingly being incorporated into guidelines outside the U.S. as well. 
In September, the Italian Ministry of Health issued new guidelines supporting the use of NIPT in a contingent model. With the continued momentum in coverage and guidelines, our end-to-end VeriSeq v2 solution is gaining traction across global markets. Genetic disease testing also posted another strong quarter, as broad reimbursement and compelling clinical utility data drive a shift to whole genome sequencing. 
This quarter, the results of the groundbreaking NICUSeq trial, co-authored by Illumina scientists were published in JAMA Pediatrics. The randomized time-laid trial demonstrated that clinical whole genome sequencing drives a twofold improvement in both diagnostic efficacy and change of clinical management for acutely ill newborns. We are working to ensure that families and NICU patients around the world can access these tests. 
In the U.S., Michigan recently became the first state to offer rapid whole genome sequencing to acutely ill infants and children regardless of insurance. And other states, like California and Florida, are making progress in this direction as well. Outside the U.S., last week, we announced the pilot program in Israel, to implement whole genome sequencing for critically ill infants suspected of having a genetic disorder and neonatal intensive care units. This program will accelerate time to diagnosis for these patients and support rapid clinical decision-making. 
Turning to our Research and Applied segments. We saw another strong quarter of sequential and year-over-year growth. The 30-plus population genomics initiatives that we support around the world drove growth in the quarter. The accuracy and scalability of our sequencing platforms, combined with our end-to-end solutions, like Illumina-connected analytics, make Illumina an ideal partner for large sequencing initiatives. The value of these population programs is expanding across clinical outcomes, research and drug discovery. This traction is generating significant interest and investment for additional programs like our future health. The U.K.'s largest ever research program focused on developing new ways to detect, treat and prevent disease. 
Just yesterday, we announced that the Illumina-Connected Analytics solutions are being used by HostSeq, part of the Canadian COVID-19 Genomics network. Our sequencing and bioinformatics solutions will be used to identify biomarkers that can help predict potential risk of serious disease and support the development of novel therapeutics to combat COVID-19. We anticipate these types of population programs will become increasingly critical to innovation as their findings translate into greater use of sequencing in clinical workflows and actionable data for drug discovery. We're already seeing this with the initial data from the U.K. Biobank as the program concludes. 
Regeneron is utilizing the U.K. biobank data in multiple ways, including to find more than 500 genes with variant trade associations linked to higher risk of diseases, like hypertension, asthma and liver disease. And as part of their data set to create new obesity medicines in partnership with AstraZeneca. And companies like Relay Therapeutics are utilizing genomic data along with AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery. 
COVID surveillance drove $55 million in sequencing shipments in the quarter, of which $15 million were instrument purchases, as concerns about variants continue to heighten the focus on surveillance efforts. We see the infrastructure for COVID surveillance as the foundation for broader pathogen surveillance to increase around the world. For example, Siri, a new genomics facility in South Africa, was launched this quarter with capabilities to bolster the pandemic and epidemic response across Africa. With resources like this in place, sequencing data from 51 of the 54 countries in Africa, is now available in . And a total of 50,000 SARS-CoV 2 genomes have been sequenced, 2 months ahead of Africa CDC schedule. 
Turning to GRAIL. In August, we closed our acquisition, which we believe will help accelerate patient access and affordability for multi-cancer early detection screening. I am delighted to introduce Bob Ragusa on his first call as GRAIL's CEO. Bob most recently served as Illumina's Chief Operations Officer, and he has more than 30 years of experience in genomics. He played a critical role in providing the sequencing systems for the human genome project and was responsible for significantly scaling Illumina's business in more than 140 countries and enabled the first NovaSeq shipments. With his decades of deep expertise, Bob is uniquely positioned to lead GRAIL during a time of extraordinary growth and discovery. I will now turn the call over to Bob to discuss GRAIL's business updates."

I am pleased to share a few thoughts on our recent progress. First, I want to highlight Galleri commercial progress. We see significant pre-reimbursement opportunities for Galleri and encouraged with the momentum across our 3 primary channels. In the employer channel, we are gaining momentum and expect to announce notable new partnerships in the technology, industrial, professional services and transportation sectors. We are also successfully engaging with key high cancer risk area of public sector employers, such as firefighters. 
For health systems, we are focused on establishing strategic agreements with influential systems in the medical community to increase awareness and experience with Galleri. Health systems are also strategic partners to generate real-world evidence in key patient communities and regions. To date, we have signed agreements with several health partners who are planning to start providing access to Galleri in the fourth quarter. We're also in contract discussions with several additional influential health systems that we expect will begin offering Galleri to patients early next year. 
In addition, we are excited to see interest from progressive and innovative payers, including Medicare Advantage, where we expect to communicate our first partnership soon. Medical practices are an important driver of the Galleri launch. We have agreements with several of the largest primary care private practice networks and expect to continue to expand in this area. We are focused on onboarding physicians in these networks and see positive prescriber trends. We also recently partnered with Genome Medical, an independent health care provider to serve individuals who prefer a telemedicine option. We launched a service several weeks ago on galleri.com and believe this will be an important future pre-reimbursement growth driver. 
In addition, we partnered with PWN Health, a national telehealth network to further extend our service capability for some employer programs. Additionally, in September, the State of New York granted approval for the gallery test. The standards set by New York State represents one of the most rigorous levels of validation required for laboratory developed test. 
Finally, there is tremendous excitement around the recent start of the NHS Galleri study, a 140,000 participant real-world randomized controlled study that has generated widespread national and international media coverage. This is part of England's national priority to speed up earlier detection of cancer to improve survival. Enrollment has been robust and is on track with our expectations. Based on data generated from this initial study, access to Galleri could expand to around 1 million people in 2024 and '25, and to a larger population after that time. 
Lastly, I would like to note that the reported GRAIL revenue represents both revenue recognized from the sale of our gallery tests and generated from our MRD collaboration agreements with biopharmaceutical companies. We are encouraged by the initial test results generated with our partners and plan to expand a number of pilot studies to support development of MRD and PDX product opportunities. We also expect MRD and PDX collaboration income will continue as an important component of GRAIL's revenue mix and is an attractive future growth driver of our business. 
I look forward to sharing with you more about GRAIL's progress in the coming quarters. 
Now I'll turn it over to Sam."
29753,1685065058,2426306,"Illumina, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. As a reminder, our third quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL for the period beginning after the acquisition closed on August 18, 2021. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, foll",1579,"Thanks, Bob. As a reminder, our third quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL for the period beginning after the acquisition closed on August 18, 2021. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL then conclude with our outlook. I will be highlighting non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. 
Third quarter revenue once again significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 40% year-over-year to $1.108 billion, driven by core Illumina revenue growth of 39% and $2 million of revenue from GRAIL. For the third quarter, GAAP net income was $317 million or $2.08 per diluted share, which included a $900 million gain from our previously held investment in GRAIL as a part of the acquisition and $654 million in day 1 compensation expense related to the GRAIL acquisition. 
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $221 million or $1.45 per diluted share, which included $0.19 of dilution from GRAIL operating losses and $0.06 of incremental dilution from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $153 million. 
Moving to the rest of the consolidated P&L. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $528 million increased $57 million sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses of $50 million for the quarter and a $7 million increase in core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expense is increased $163 million year-over-year, driven by $50 million of GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses and $113 million increase in core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses. 
Non-GAAP other expense of $6 million increased $4 million sequentially and was $13 million lower than other income in Q3 of last year as expected. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower interest income on short-term investments as we repositioned our investment portfolio and subsequently liquidated our holdings to fund the GRAIL acquisition as well as interest expense on the term notes issued in Q1 2021. The non-GAAP tax rate of 13.2% decreased from last quarter and year-over-year due to the tax impact of including GRAIL and Illumina's consolidated results of operations. The decrease in the non-GAAP tax rate year-over-year was partially offset by discrete tax benefits recorded in the third quarter of 2020 related to prior year return adjustments and tax reserve releases. 
Moving to segment results. I will start by highlighting the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue grew 39% year-over-year to $1.106 billion driven by record shipments for both clinical and research. Core Illumina sequencing revenue of $1.013 billion grew 43% year-over-year and represented 92% of core Illumina revenue. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $723 million, led by record NovaSeq consumables shipments that grew over 50% year-over-year. 
Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina grew 65% year-over-year to $180 million, driven by record NovaSeq shipments that again more than doubled year-over-year due to accelerating demand in oncology testing. NextSeq 1000 and 2000 orders reached a new high in the quarter, and there was a solid growth across all mid- and low-throughput systems year-over-year. We ended the quarter with record sequencing instrument backlog that is almost double the backlog entering the year. Revenue from COVID-19 surveillance, again, exceeded our expectations due to the sustained focus on variant tracking and surveillance infrastructure scaling in the quarter, contributing approximately $40 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $15 million in incremental instrument revenue. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $110 million, driven by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as gel sample growth. 
Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas region was $581 million, growing 33% compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by record oncology testing shipments and ongoing population genomics initiatives, such as [indiscernible]. The regional performance was also driven by COVID surveillance strength due to expanded public health network adoption of NGS in Latin America. EMEA delivered revenue of $313 million, representing 47% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by significant growth across all clinical markets and strength in emerging markets. Population genomics initiatives partially driven by U.K. Biobank, which concluded in Q3 and COVID surveillance testing also contributed to the stronger quarter performance in the region. 
Greater China revenue was $122 million, representing growth of 47% year-over-year due to continued clinical strength in the region, led by NexeDX demand in hospitals and oncology testing growth. Almost half of the NextSeqDx shipments were to new to Illumina hospital customers and the expanding footprint in hospitals is helping drive growth in infectious disease testing, which more than doubled year-over-year. 
Finally, APJ revenue of $90 million grew 45% year-over-year, driven by sequencing instrument growth from clinical demand for NextSeq 2000 as well as consumables revenue growth across oncology testing and research. 
Moving to the rest of the core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 71.3% declined sequentially by 50 basis points, due primarily to onetime revenue from the NIPT patent litigation settlement recorded in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 390 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes, partially offset by higher freight costs as a result of the pandemic. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $478 million were up $7 million sequentially, but overall were lower than expected due to the timing of hiring and project spend shifting into Q4. 
As expected, non-GAAP operating expenses were up $113 million year-over-year due to increased performance-based compensation expenses and headcount growth as well as additional investments to support the significant growth of our business. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 28% compared to 30% in the second quarter of 2021. Operating margins declined sequentially as expected, mostly due to $20 million of onetime patent litigation settlement revenue recognized in the prior quarter.
Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL, Rail revenue was $2 million for the quarter consisted primarily of Galleri test speeds, the multi-cancer early detection test that commercially launched in June as well as moderate MRD partnership revenue. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $50 million for the quarter, which consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. As a reminder, GRAIL's third quarter financial results are for the period beginning after the acquisition closed on August 18. 
Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items for consolidated Illumina. Cash flow used in operations was $272 million, which was a net outflow for the quarter due to expenses related to the GRAIL acquisition. DSO of 50 days compared to 44 days last quarter, driven by revenue linearity. Third quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $52 million, and free cash flow was a negative $324 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
During the third quarter, we used $2.9 billion to fund the GRAIL acquisition. Before I discuss guidance, I wanted to acknowledge that I'm especially proud of our team's strong execution to fulfill surging demand and deliver another record quarter in a challenging global environment. While there were some small pockets of supply constraints for certain products in specific geographies this quarter, there was no material impact, thanks to our team's incredible efforts. We will continue to source, produce and operate with agility to enable further growth and support our customers. 
Moving now to 2021 guidance. We now expect full year 2021 consolidated and core Illumina revenue to grow approximately 36%. This represents consolidated revenue of approximately $4.41 billion for 2021 or revenue growth of approximately $1.17 billion compared to 2020 and an increase of approximately $100 million compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance. For fiscal 2021, we now expect core alumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 39% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum in our base business. We now expect core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin to be between 27.5% to 28%, which reflects our higher revenue expectations. We expect core Illumina operating expenses for Q4 2021 and to increase by approximately $50 million compared to Q3 2021 due to the timing of expenses shifting from Q3 into Q4, increased investments to support the robust growth of our business as well as expected payments in Q4 2021 related to certain partnerships. 
Our focus continues to be on improving the core Illumina operating margin leverage over time. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $5.50 to $5.60, which includes dilution from GRAIL operating loss of approximately $1 and incremental dilution of $0.15 from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition. 
We now expect GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4.41 to $4.51. We now expect diluted shares outstanding in fiscal 2021 to be approximately $151 million. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.35 to $0.45 and GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.10 to $0.20. We expect diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2021 of approximately $158 million. 
Now I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks."

Welcome back and good to have you on the call. So for Q4, first of all, let me talk about the full year. We are, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, Dan, we are raising our revenue guide to approximately 36%. For Q4, I think there's a couple of areas that you need to keep in mind. One is the conclusion of the U.K. Biobank initiatives. This has been an incredibly productive; incredibly, I would say, a very important initiative strong for the year. We've seen, obviously, with the pandemic, the way it is, that there's continued testing and sequencing of positive samples across the globe. 
For Q3, we have $55 million of COVID surveillance revenue in the quarter. That represented $15 million of instruments and $40 million of consumables. For Q4, our expectation is that we will have $35 million of COVID Covet surveillance revenue, which represents a modest amount of instrument revenue that is about $5 million and then approximately $30 million of total COVID consumables. That represents, again, another $20 million reduction from Q3 into Q4. So when we think about that sequential momentum, the core business is really strong. And when I say the core business, I mean our clinical business, research business, you heard comments from Bob around GRAIL, but there is that reduction associated with those 2 items, which is COVID surveillance as well as the U.K. Biobank including."

So as I talked about on the call, there are -- in Q4, there's $0.80 roughly a dilution $1 for the year, but in Q4, about $0.80 related to GRAIL dilution. And then there's about $0.09 of dilution related to the weighted average share count as a result of the shares that we issued to finance the GRAIL acquisition. So those are specific to GRAIL. That obviously impacts the $0.35 to $0.45 non-GAAP EPS for Q4. 
In terms of the core Illumina business, I talked to answer to Dan's question, I talked a little bit about a couple of dynamics around revenues. In terms of OpEx, yes, there are some costs that I also mentioned in our prepared remarks. First of all, we have timing of expenses that shifted from Q3 to Q4, that's why Q3 was lower than our expectations in terms of operating expenses. Q4 now has increased in terms of our expectations to spend there. And then I talked about also partnership OpEx that is expected in Q4. 
So we do have some expenses associated with certain partnerships but somewhat significant in Q4 that's discrete to Q4. In terms of 2022 guidance, we're not going to talk about guidance on this call, except to say the fundamentals of the business are incredibly strong. We have talked before about the GRAIL dilution of $3.25 to $3.75 for 2022, that remains the case. That has not changed.

And as we said on the call, I'm incredibly proud of the work the team has done in terms of demand capacity planning to make sure that we're able to stay ahead of this big demand we're seeing. And as we pointed out, we started to see this demand build at the tail end of last year. And so the team did a lot of work on a number of fronts. 
First, they did work around making sure that our inbound suppliers will be able to cope with the demand that was coming. And that meant things like building safety stock internally of supplies coming in, ordering items that would have long lead times, sometimes up to a year plus in advance for things like resins, where we knew there might be shortages. But then also, we started to invest in increasing our own production capacity, and that was true across the board. So whether it's cartridges flow sales or rate across the board, we started certainly by the first half of this year, we were significantly increasing capacity to build the supplies. 
And then in addition to that, we started to invest starting last year in increasing our ability to move production. So specifically, for example, we expanded our warehousing capacity and opened up a new center in into and then that's our regional distribution for EMEA, as you might know. And we doubled the capacity we had in . Similarly, -- We expanded capacity in Japan this year from a warehousing perspective, we put a new warehouse in Brazil this year. And we also continue to invest in strengthening the transportation links between these hubs. 
And then we started to build safety stock on the outbound side to make sure that we had enough inventory on site to cope with what we knew was going to be strong demand ended up being much stronger than even we had expected. And so for the vast majority of our core consumables now, we have safety stock on hand at 6 to 8 weeks of supply. And so our team did a really terrific job sort of calling it early and then jumping on it end to end to make sure that we have the capacity to supply the demand coming in."

There have been, I would say, a few isolated customer instances where there have been extensions of lead time, which is normal. That's very much something that we see every quarter. But in general, the backlog is really driven by demand. It's not driven by any supply issues that are causing that."

We look to get a decision on the Phase II view that's happening in Europe at the tail end of Q1 likely makes it a little, and we are waiting for the trial date for the jurisdiction trial that's happening in Brussels. So playing out as expected. 
And then in the U.S., we are continuing to wrap up the administered trial that just played out and we expect a decision likely in Q1. So we tail end the year but more likely in Q1. So it's playing out as we expected in terms of the whole separate. The order came out, and it was consistent with how we thought it would be and consistent with -- generally consistent with the whole sector that we put into place ourselves voluntarily in anticipation of how this would play out. So in general, no real surprises. The process is playing out as we planned. Now I turn it over to you, Bob."

We see significant pre-reimbursement opportunities for Galleri. And it's really across 3 main channels: employer, health systems and medical practices. And one of the key elements of working with the team now is to make sure that we can, in fact, ramp up the commercial scale of the organization to really meet the demand that's out there. 
In addition, just on the commercial side, we're going to have to ramp up really the entire operation so that we have the ability to deliver at scale a great customer experience. And so that will cause us to build across a number of functions across the company. Really excited to be able to take on that challenge because we're in the beautiful position of having a product that is so strong and now just really building out -- have the opportunity to build out all the commercial elements and all the delivery elements so that we can really deploy Galleri in a big way."

It's a market that's really embracing and not just in IPT, which they enacted early, but increasingly also starting to more broadly roll out oncology testing, genome testing. And so we're seeing there. A lot of it is driven by the terrific partner ecosystem that we've built up over the years in China, that's really paying off. 
In addition, we're actually seeing a tailwind associated with some regulations that have emerged that allow the use of LDTs in Shanghai. And so that has been -- that's fairly recent, but has already started to pay dividends as you see more labs being stood up to generate their own LDT testing capability. And so that's helped us in driving some of the tailwind there. But we're definitely excited and optimistic about what's happening in China for us right now."

So we've talked about the fact that we've been cultivating over 50 of these opportunities, and we're now at the stage where over 30 of these opportunities are already generating revenue. So that's really good to see from a diversification perspective. What's also really great about it is a lot of these population sequencing initiatives are driven from a national health perspective. So they aren't research projects. What you're seeing is countries embrace genomic testing as part of the standard of care EMA health system. 
And that's terrific, first of all, because of the very human impact it allows you to have because you're in the pathway of delivering valuable information to patients. But it also is a place that's very durable, right? So it means once you've built into the health care system, then you just get ramped up 2 population scales and it goes year after year. And so that's another really exciting thing to see. 
During that's playing out, we're starting to see the emergence of cohorts, a lot of them involving pharma partners that are looking to generate data from population level data from some of the big data repositories out there around the world, like Biobank. And so that's an emerging, sort of, building part of the population sequencing ecosystem right now, too"

Listen, in general, there is really no fundamental change at all in terms of instrument demand from Q3 -- or Q2 into Q3. In general, we do have sometimes some ebb and flow between the quarters in terms of instrument revenues. NovaSeq had record revenues for the quarter, record placements in terms of doubling the placements that we had last year. As we said, we exited the quarter with record backlog in terms of instruments. So I would say there's probably some very small movements here and there, but nothing really that's anything significant in terms of why we were slightly down in terms of Q2 versus -- Q3 versus Q2. 
In terms of sequencing instruments as well for COVID surveillance, I would say that was a minor factor as well from Q2 into Q3. There was a few less sequencing instruments that were placed in Q3 compared to Q2. So that has a little bit of an impact there as well. But in general, demand is exceptionally strong, as we talked about with doubling the NextSeq 2000, 1000 and 550 placements versus prior years, not just last year, but prior -- historically, what we used to place in the mid-throughput category, and then the NovaSeq demand is exceptionally strong."

But even with that, the total average pull-through on NovaSeq as at the high end of the range we've talked about. So it's impact there. And so there's just a lot of activity happening on our NovaSeq out in the field. and that's causing customers to place the orders that are driving the record backlog that we have walking into Q4.

It's been in the market since June. And nothing in terms of trials that are needed for the existing revenue sources that Bob talked about GRAIL. 
So everything in terms of studies and data is all out there. In fact, the DB studies that were public showed this year just reinforced already the huge amount of data that's been put out onto the market so far. So nothing more is needed there. And what we said about NHS is, the NHS is sort of a self-contained trial in the sense that it has designed the milestones and the progress that would get it comfortable rolling it out at a population scale. And they were the ones who rolled out the path that started 140,000, then scale up to 1 million in the next couple of years and then go population scale. And so it's a fully self-contained process. They have identified what they need to see. They are partnering with GRAIL. And so that's what we've said before, and that's what we continue to see. And I'll turn it over to Bob."

So that's been very positive to this point. And then also a reflection the Galleri reflection registry study, where we'll look at the experience in clinical outcomes of 35,000 screening eligible patients over the age of 50, who were prescribed the test from a health care provider. And that enrollment began this quarter, and that will also provide significant data on the March to reimbursement.

And obviously, it's been a pretty polarizing topic I just think it would be helpful to understand the level of visibility regarding, I guess, the regulatory outcome that you expect to have beyond the first quarter of '22? 
And just one other thing to tack on here. The GRAIL revenue performance in the quarter.

And so our perspective is obviously, we're going to continue to work through the trial process, and I'll give you an update on that. But what we want to do is make sure that GRAIL continues to create value because what that means is that no matter what scenario plays out in the event that we get done and we have GRAIL and we can grow it, that's a huge, huge success, obviously, and hugely valuable for our shareholders. But we know that if we create a lot of value in GRAIL, then no matter what the regulatory outcome is, it's still a big win, not only for people who are getting screened but also for our shareholders because we'll have an asset significantly appreciated. 
And even if you look at the progress that's been made at GRAIL since we announced the deal, right? So since we announced the deal, they've published some of their study results. They have launched a product on the schedule they said in June. They have initiated not only signed the NHS deal but started the rollout to 140,000 customers and signed up some other health care systems and employers in the U.S. So it's clear the business has created significant value from maybe 12, 15 months ago when we announced the deal. And so our focus is going to be partially also just to make sure that Bob and his team have everything they need to go create a hugely valuable business. And what that does is it ensures our shareholders in some ways, no matter what the outcome is, it's a win for our share. 
So I want to make sure that I feel very clear that, that's continuing to happen while we talk a lot about the trial. From a trial perspective, we expect the decisions we expect out in Europe come on 2 fronts, right? So as you pointed out, the Phase II result right now the date is February 24, it makes up a little, but we expect to result from Phase II around that time frame. So late Q1, maybe early Q2. We are also looking for a date in the trial, around jurisdiction in Brussels, and that's also a first half thing, maybe sort of maybe Q1, maybe Q2. Should we prevail in either of those, then we are done with the regulatory process in the European Union. If we don't, then depending on which one, there's certain appeals process that you go through. And then so in the FTC, we expect a decision, as I said, in Q1 around the administrative process. Inevitably, there will be a re-review or appeal to the commissioners after that. And then you go -- if you -- if we don't prevail on any of those steps, then we go to a District Court probably in the back half of next year. So that's the process. And now I'll turn it over to Bob for any other color."

Illumina's third quarter was another exceptionally strong quarter with $1.108 billion in revenue, up 40% year-over-year and once again, significantly ahead of expectations. Our customer base continues to expand rapidly. And in the first 3 quarters of 2021, we added 50% more new customers than in all of 2020 or 2019. Because of this strength across our business, we're raising our full year revenue growth outlook for the third quarter in a row to approximately 36%. This is approximately double the growth rate and $567 million higher than the midpoint of the range we guided to at the beginning of the year. 
I will talk through the third quarter results for core Illumina as defined as Illumina other than GRAIL, and then I'll turn the call over to Bob Ragusa, the CEO of our GRAIL subsidiary to cover the GRAIL business. Core Illumina revenue was $1.106 billion. Sequencing instrument revenue was up 65% year-over-year, and we exited the quarter with a record instrument backlog, a positive leading indicator for future revenue. 
Sequencing activity in the quarter was also strong, with sequencing consumable revenue up 45% year-over-year, setting a new record. Our high throughput platform order volume is accelerating. Oncology testing, population sequencing and drug discovery initiatives drove record NovaSeq consumable and instrument shipments. Oncology testing customers represented the highest proportion of NovaSeq shipments for the quarter as large oncology testing labs added to their fleets to support expanded reimbursement for therapy selection testing. 
Drug discovery is emerging as a new application for high throughput sequencing with opportunities across common diseases ranging from obesity to aging. Our mid-throughput platforms also drove growth and expanded our installed base. In the third quarter, over 50% of NextSeq 1000 and 2000 placements were new-to-Illumina customers or to customers upgrading from low-throughput instruments. These instruments continue to unlock new applications. Researchers at Tulane School of Medicine are using the NextSeq 2000 for single cell experiments focused on infection and inflammation. The team is working to develop inhaled vaccines for pneumonia and use single-cell RNA-Seq on a NextSeq 2000 to study the immune cells elicited by this vaccine platform in a recent paper published in Science Immunology. 
Benchtop platforms also saw significant growth year-over-year, with the highest number of MiSeq shipments since Q4 2015. MiSeq, coupled with our COVIDSeq 96-sample assay, is enabling labs around the world to engage in local pathogen surveillance. This quarter, MiSeq placements in both Argentina and Brazil brought COVID surveillance to local communities in conjunction with broader national programs. 
Now turning to Clinical and Research and Applied segments, Oncology testing, our largest market segment, had another record quarter. Sequencing is becoming the standard of care and therapy selection, which is driving robust demand for Illumina sequencers, and our oncology testing customers are rapidly scaling their fleets in response. Reimbursement for genetic testing for therapy selection continues to expand with over 70% of insured lives in the U.S. now covered for these tests. 
Additionally, there are over 60 targeted and immunotherapy treatments currently on the market, highlighting the power of comprehensive genomic profiling in matching patients to treatment. TruSight Oncology 500, our research use-only comprehensive genomic profiling assay, had another record quarter, with over 340 customers now using the assay in their labs. 
In September, we announced a CDx partnership with Merck to develop and commercialize tests leveraging TSO 500 content and an HRD status based on Myriad's myChoice in patients with ovarian cancer. Approximately 300,000 women around the world will be diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer, the fifth deadliest cancer for women. This partnership will help these patients access additional treatment options with the goal of improving care. 
In reproductive health, we saw another quarter of strong year-over-year growth. [ Almost ] 80% of pregnancies in the U.S. are now covered for noninvasive prenatal testing. And we're seeing additional progress as states begin to incorporate the ACOG guideline revision from last year into their prenatal screening programs. In California, the prenatal screening program is being revised to include noninvasive prenatal testing, and the state has now issued a request for proposal. NIPT is increasingly being incorporated into guidelines outside the U.S. as well. 
In September, the Italian Ministry of Health issued new guidelines supporting the use of NIPT in a contingent model. With the continued momentum in coverage and guidelines, our end-to-end VeriSeq v2 solution is gaining traction across global markets. Genetic disease testing also posted another strong quarter, as broad reimbursement and compelling clinical utility data drive a shift to whole genome sequencing. 
This quarter, the results of the groundbreaking NICUSeq trial, co-authored by Illumina scientists were published in JAMA Pediatrics. The randomized time-delayed trial demonstrated that clinical whole genome sequencing drives a twofold improvement in both diagnostic efficacy and change of clinical management for acutely ill newborns. We are working to ensure that families and NICU patients around the world can access these tests. 
In the U.S., Michigan recently became the first state to offer rapid whole genome sequencing to acutely ill infants and children regardless of insurance and other states, like California and Florida, are making progress in this direction as well. Outside the U.S., last week, we announced the pilot program in Israel, to implement whole genome sequencing for critically ill infants suspected of having a genetic disorder in neonatal intensive care units. This program will accelerate time to diagnosis for these patients and support rapid clinical decision-making. 
Turning to our Research and Applied segments. We saw another strong quarter of sequential and year-over-year growth. The 30-plus population genomics initiatives that we support around the world drove growth in the quarter. The accuracy and scalability of our sequencing platforms, combined with our end-to-end solutions, like Illumina Connected Analytics make Illumina an ideal partner for large sequencing initiatives. The value of these population programs is expanding across clinical outcomes, research and drug discovery. This traction is generating significant interest and investment for additional programs like Our Future Health, the U.K.'s largest ever research program focused on developing new ways to detect, treat and prevent disease. 
Just yesterday, we announced that the Illumina-Connected Analytics solutions are being used by HostSeq, part of the Canadian COVID-19 Genomics network. Our sequencing and bioinformatics solutions will be used to identify biomarkers that can help predict potential risk of serious disease and support the development of novel therapeutics to combat COVID-19. We anticipate these types of population programs will become increasingly critical to innovation as their findings translate into greater use of sequencing in clinical workflows and actionable data for drug discovery. We're already seeing this with the initial data from the U.K. Biobank as the program concludes. 
Regeneron is utilizing the U.K. biobank data in multiple ways, including to find more than 500 genes with variant trade associations linked to higher risk of diseases, like hypertension, asthma and liver disease and as part of their data set to create new obesity medicines in partnership with AstraZeneca. And companies like Relay Therapeutics are utilizing genomic data along with AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery. 
COVID surveillance drove $55 million in sequencing shipments in the quarter, of which $15 million were instrument purchases, as concerns about variants continue to heighten the focus on surveillance efforts. We see the infrastructure for COVID surveillance as the foundation for broader pathogen surveillance to increase around the world. For example, CERI, a new genomics facility in South Africa, was launched this quarter with capabilities to bolster the pandemic and epidemic response across Africa. With resources like this in place, sequencing data from 51 of the 54 countries in Africa, is now available in GISAID. And a total of 50,000 SARS-CoV 2 genomes have been sequenced, 2 months ahead of Africa CDC's schedule. 
Turning to GRAIL. In August, we closed our acquisition, which we believe will help accelerate patient access and affordability for multi-cancer early detection screening. I am delighted to introduce Bob Ragusa on his first call as GRAIL's CEO. Bob most recently served as Illumina's Chief Operations Officer, and he has more than 30 years of experience in genomics. He played a critical role in providing the sequencing systems for the Human Genome Project and was responsible for significantly scaling Illumina's business in more than 140 countries and enabled the first NovaSeq shipments. With his decades of deep expertise, Bob is uniquely positioned to lead GRAIL during a time of extraordinary growth and discovery. I will now turn the call over to Bob to discuss GRAIL's business updates."

I am pleased to share a few thoughts on our recent progress. First, I want to highlight Galleri commercial progress. We see significant pre-reimbursement opportunities for Galleri and are encouraged with the momentum across our 3 primary channels. In the employer channel, we are gaining momentum and expect to announce notable new partnerships in the technology, industrial, professional services and transportation sectors. We are also successfully engaging with key high-cancer-risk area of public sector employers, such as firefighters. 
For health systems, we are focused on establishing strategic agreements with influential systems in the medical community to increase awareness and experience with Galleri. Health systems are also strategic partners to generate real-world evidence in key patient communities and regions. To date, we have signed agreements with several health partners who are planning to start providing access to Galleri in the fourth quarter. We're also in contract discussions with several additional influential health systems that we expect will begin offering Galleri to patients early next year. 
In addition, we are excited to see interest from progressive and innovative payers, including Medicare Advantage, where we expect to communicate our first partnership soon. Medical practices are an important driver of the Galleri launch. We have agreements with several of the largest primary care private practice networks and expect to continue to expand in this area. We are focused on onboarding physicians in these networks and see positive prescriber trends. 
We also recently partnered with Genome Medical, an independent health care provider to serve individuals who prefer a telemedicine option. We launched a service several weeks ago on galleri.com and believe this will be an important future pre-reimbursement growth driver. 
In addition, we partnered with PWNHealth, a national telehealth network to further extend our service capability for some employer programs. Additionally, in September, the State of New York granted approval for the Galleri test. The standards set by New York State represents one of the most rigorous levels of validation required for laboratory developed test. 
Finally, there is tremendous excitement around the recent start of the NHS Galleri study, a 140,000 participant real-world randomized controlled study that has generated widespread national and international media coverage. This is part of England's national priority to speed up earlier detection of cancer to improve survival. Enrollment has been robust and is on-track with our expectations. Based on data generated from this initial study, access to Galleri could expand to around 1 million people in 2024 and '25, and to a larger population after that time. 
Lastly, I would like to note that the reported GRAIL revenue represents both revenue recognized from the sale of our Galleri tests and generated from our MRD collaboration agreements with biopharmaceutical companies. We are encouraged by the initial test results generated with our partners and plan to expand a number of pilot studies to support development of MRD and PDX product opportunities. We also expect MRD and PDX collaboration income will continue as an important component of GRAIL's revenue mix and is an attractive future growth driver of our business. 
I look forward to sharing with you more about GRAIL's progress in the coming quarters. 
Now I'll turn it over to Sam."

As a reminder, our third quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL for the period beginning after the acquisition closed on August 18, 2021. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL then conclude with our outlook. I will be highlighting non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. 
Third quarter revenue once again significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 40% year-over-year to $1.108 billion, driven by core Illumina revenue growth of 39% and $2 million of revenue from GRAIL. For the third quarter, GAAP net income was $317 million or $2.08 per diluted share, which included a $900 million gain from our previously held investment in GRAIL as a part of the acquisition and $654 million in day 1 compensation expense related to the GRAIL acquisition. 
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $221 million or $1.45 per diluted share, which included $0.19 of dilution from GRAIL operating losses and $0.06 of incremental dilution from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $153 million. 
Moving to the rest of the consolidated P&L. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $528 million increased $57 million sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses of $50 million for the quarter and a $7 million increase in core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $163 million year-over-year, driven by $50 million of GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses and $113 million increase in core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses. 
Non-GAAP other expense of $6 million increased $4 million sequentially and was $13 million lower than other income in Q3 of last year as expected. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower interest income on short-term investments as we repositioned our investment portfolio and subsequently liquidated our holdings to fund the GRAIL acquisition as well as interest expense on the term notes issued in Q1 2021. 
The non-GAAP tax rate of 13.2% decreased from last quarter and year-over-year due to the tax impact of including GRAIL and Illumina's consolidated results of operations. The decrease in the non-GAAP tax rate year-over-year was partially offset by discrete tax benefits recorded in the third quarter of 2020 related to prior year return adjustments and tax reserve releases. 
Moving to segment results. I will start by highlighting the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue grew 39% year-over-year to $1.106 billion driven by record shipments for both clinical and research. Core Illumina sequencing revenue of $1.013 billion grew 43% year-over-year and represented 92% of core Illumina revenue. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $723 million, led by record NovaSeq consumables shipments that grew over 50% year-over-year. 
Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina grew 65% year-over-year to $180 million, driven by record NovaSeq shipments that again more than doubled year-over-year due to accelerating demand in oncology testing. NextSeq 1000 and 2000 orders reached a new high in the quarter, and there was solid growth across all mid- and low-throughput systems year-over-year. 
We ended the quarter with record sequencing instrument backlog that is almost double the backlog entering the year. Revenue from COVID-19 surveillance, again, exceeded our expectations due to the sustained focus on variant tracking and surveillance infrastructure scaling in the quarter, contributing approximately $40 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $15 million in incremental instrument revenue. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $110 million, driven by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as gel sample growth. 
Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas region was $581 million, growing 33% compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by record oncology testing shipments and ongoing population genomics initiatives, such as All of Us. The regional performance was also driven by COVID surveillance strength due to expanded public health network adoption of NGS in Latin America. EMEA delivered revenue of $313 million, representing 47% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by significant growth across all clinical markets and strength in emerging markets; population genomics initiatives partially driven by UK Biobank, which concluded in Q3 and COVID surveillance testing also contributed to the stronger quarter performance in the region. 
Greater China revenue was $122 million, representing growth of 47% year-over-year due to continued clinical strength in the region, led by NextSeqDx demand in hospitals and oncology testing growth. Almost half of the NextSeqDx shipments were to new-to-Illumina hospital customers and the expanding footprint in hospitals is helping drive growth in infectious disease testing, which more than doubled year-over-year. 
Finally, APJ revenue of $90 million grew 45% year-over-year, driven by sequencing instrument growth from clinical demand for NextSeq 2000 as well as consumables revenue growth across oncology testing and research. 
Moving to the rest of the core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 71.3% declined sequentially by 50 basis points, due primarily to onetime revenue from the NIPT patent litigation settlement recorded in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 390 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes, partially offset by higher freight costs as a result of the pandemic. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $478 million were up $7 million sequentially, but overall were lower than expected due to the timing of hiring and project spend shifting into Q4. 
As expected, non-GAAP operating expenses were up $113 million year-over-year due to increased performance-based compensation expenses and headcount growth as well as additional investments to support the significant growth of our business. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 28% compared to 30% in the second quarter of 2021. Operating margins declined sequentially as expected, mostly due to $20 million of onetime patent litigation settlement revenue recognized in the prior quarter.
Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue was $2 million for the quarter consisting primarily of Galleri test fees, the multi-cancer early detection test that commercially launched in June, as well as moderate MRD partnership revenue. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $50 million for the quarter, which consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. As a reminder, GRAIL's third quarter financial results are for the period beginning after the acquisition closed on August 18. 
Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items for consolidated Illumina. Cash flow used in operations was $272 million, which was a net outflow for the quarter due to expenses related to the GRAIL acquisition. DSO of 50 days compared to 44 days last quarter, driven by revenue linearity. Third quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $52 million, and free cash flow was a negative $324 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
During the third quarter, we used $2.9 billion to fund the GRAIL acquisition. Before I discuss guidance, I wanted to acknowledge that I'm especially proud of our team's strong execution to fulfill surging demand and deliver another record quarter in a challenging global environment. While there were some small pockets of supply constraints for certain products in specific geographies this quarter, there was no material impact, thanks to our team's incredible efforts. We will continue to source, produce and operate with agility to enable further growth and support our customers. 
Moving now to 2021 guidance. We now expect full year 2021 consolidated and core Illumina revenue to grow approximately 36%. This represents consolidated revenue of approximately $4.41 billion for 2021 or revenue growth of approximately $1.17 billion compared to 2020 and an increase of approximately $100 million compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance. 
For fiscal 2021, we now expect core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 39% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum in our base business. We now expect core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin to be between 27.5% to 28%, which reflects our higher revenue expectations. We expect core Illumina operating expenses for Q4 2021 and to increase by approximately $50 million compared to Q3 2021 due to the timing of expenses shifting from Q3 into Q4, increased investments to support the robust growth of our business, as well as expected payments in Q4 2021 related to certain partnerships. 
Our focus continues to be on improving the core Illumina operating margin leverage over time. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $5.50 to $5.60, which includes dilution from GRAIL operating loss of approximately $1 and incremental dilution of $0.15 from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition. 
We now expect GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4.41 to $4.51. We now expect diluted shares outstanding in fiscal 2021 to be approximately $151 million. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.35 to $0.45 and GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.10 to $0.20. We expect diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2021 of approximately 158 million.
Now I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks."

And given the easy comp and given the backlog and the momentum, I'm just wondering why the fourth quarter outlook might not be stronger? And then I have a follow-up."
29753,1685065058,2426551,"Illumina, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Thank you, Dan. This is Sam.

We are, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, Dan, we are raising our revenue guide to approximately 36%. For Q4, I think there's a couple of areas that you need to keep in mind. One is the conclusion of the UK Biobank initiatives. This has been an incredibly productive; incredibly, I would say, very important initiative from a population genomics standpoint that we talked a little bit about the outcomes from that and the next step. But that will likely present a $20 million quarter-to-quarter headwind or reduction in terms of revenue in terms of Q4 versus Q3. So that's one area. 
And then the second area, and I think you touched on that in your question in regards to COVID surveillance. So COVID surveillance has been strong for the year. We've seen, obviously, with the pandemic, the way it is, that there's continued testing and sequencing of positive samples across the globe. 
For Q3, we have $55 million of COVID surveillance revenue in the quarter. That represented $15 million of instruments and $40 million of consumables. For Q4, our expectation is that we will have $35 million of COVID surveillance revenue, which represents a modest amount of instrument revenue, about $5 million and then approximately $30 million of COVID consumables. That represents, again, another $20 million reduction from Q3 into Q4. 
So when we think about that sequential momentum, the core business is really strong. And when I say the core business, I mean our clinical business, research business, you heard comments from Bob around GRAIL, but there is that reduction associated with those 2 items, which is COVID surveillance as well as the UK Biobank concluding."

Thanks, Dan, and I'll have my welcome to Cowen, and it's great to see you covering us again. So I did talk a lot about the strength in the oncology segment, specifically oncology therapy selection testing because that really has been one of the breakout stories, frankly, for the whole year. And what's really driving that story is a few things. One, we saw significant expansion in reimbursements for genomic testing for therapy selection play out in the U.S. And so now we have a significant base in the U.S. that has coverage for genomic testing. And at the same time, we've seen a move towards larger panels as comprehensive genomic profiling really gets traction in the market. And so those who have created a powerful force in oncology therapy selection testing and we're seeing our customers expanding their fleets. Now in terms of how that's playing out, 
you're seeing that play out across all segments. You're seeing some of our larger customers significantly expanding their fleets and expanding their NovaSeqs specifically because of the demand that they're seeing as well as the anticipated demand going forward. But you're also seeing new customers and some of our smaller customers getting into oncology therapy selection. One of the interesting metrics to look at, and it takes into account more than oncology. 
Like I said, oncology is one of the biggest drivers of it, is if you look at the strength in the NovaSeq instrument, you see we're placing a lot of NovaSeq instruments and we're having a very strong backlog of NovaSeq instruments. And at the same time, we're seeing really strong pull-through into NovaSeqs. And so that's sort of the pot of gold at the end of the double rainbow right, because you're seeing they're putting a lot of instruments out there and yet, pull-through remains high, at the high end of the range we talked about. And so to your question about what's the outlook going forward, I'd say that's a really good, positive indicator for what people are experiencing today and what they're expecting going forward."

Or is that something abnormal happening because that's an annualized run rate of $1.60. I don't think that sounds like, I just want to make sure I had the Q4 assumptions, right. 
And for fiscal '22, should comps matter because most of your peers are assuming normalized growth. And given your comments on backlog I understand you have surveillance being a big component this year, but the 36%, should comps matter and how should we think about it?"

So as I talked about on the call, there are -- in Q4, there's $0.80 roughly a dilution $1 for the year, but in Q4, about $0.80 related to GRAIL dilution. And then there's about $0.09 of dilution related to the weighted average share count as a result of the shares that we issued to finance the GRAIL acquisition. So those are specific to GRAIL. That obviously impacts the $0.35 to $0.45 non-GAAP EPS for Q4. 
In terms of the core Illumina business, I talked to answer to Dan's question, I talked a little bit about a couple of dynamics around revenues. In terms of OpEx, yes, there are some costs that I also mentioned in our prepared remarks. First of all, we have timing of expenses that shifted from Q3 to Q4. That's why Q3 was lower than our expectations in terms of operating expenses. Q4 now has increased in terms of our expectations to spend there. And then I talked about also partnership OpEx that is expected in Q4. So we do have some expenses associated with certain partnerships that's somewhat significant in Q4, that's discrete to Q4. 
In terms of 2022 guidance, we're not going to talk about guidance on this call, except to say the fundamentals of the business are incredibly strong. We have talked before about the GRAIL dilution of $3.25 to $3.75 for 2022, that remains the case. That has not changed. But as you heard, the backlog is very strong in terms of instruments and the core fundamentals in terms of clinical and research are exceptionally strong."

So any time we have such a big beat playing out against the backdrop of a pandemic, the first thing you look at is the supply chain, your ability to serve. 
And as we said on the call, I'm incredibly proud of the work the team has done in terms of demand capacity planning to make sure that we're able to stay ahead of this big demand we're seeing. And as we pointed out, we started to see this demand build at the tail end of last year. And so the team did a lot of work on a number of fronts. 
First, they did work around making sure that our inbound suppliers will be able to cope with the demand that was coming. And that meant things like building safety stock internally of supplies coming in, ordering items that would have long lead times, sometimes up to a year-plus in advance for things like resins, where we knew there might be shortages. But then also, we started to invest in increasing our own production capacity, and that was true across the board. So whether it's cartridges flow cells or [ rigs ] across the board, we started certainly by the first half of this year, we were significantly increasing capacity to build the supplies. 
And then in addition to that, we started to invest starting last year in increasing our ability to move production. So specifically, for example, we expanded our warehousing capacity in Eindhoven and opened up a new center in Eindhoven and that's our regional distribution for EMEA, as you might know. And we doubled the capacity we had in Eindhoven. Similarly, we expanded capacity in Japan this year. From a warehousing perspective, we put a new warehouse in Brazil this year. And we also continue to invest in and strengthen the transportation links between these hubs. 
And then we started to build safety stock on the outbound side to make sure that we had enough inventory on site to cope with what we knew was going to be strong demand ended up being much stronger than even we had expected. And so for the vast majority of our core consumables now, we have safety stock on hand of 6 to 8 weeks of supply. And so our team did a really terrific job sort of calling it early and then jumping on it end to end to make sure that we have the capacity to supply the demand coming in."

It's a market that's really embracing and not just NIPT, which they embraced early, but increasingly also starting to more broadly roll out oncology testing, genomic testing. And so we're seeing progress there. A lot of it is driven by the terrific partner ecosystem that we've built up over the years in China. That's really paying off. 
In addition, we're actually seeing a tailwind associated with some regulations that have emerged that allow the use of LDTs in Shanghai. And so that has been -- that's fairly recent, but has already started to pay dividends as you see more labs being stood up to generate their own LDT testing capability. And so that's helped us in driving some of the tailwind there. But we're definitely excited and optimistic about what's happening in China for us right now."

So we've talked about the fact that we've been cultivating over 50 of these opportunities, and we're now at the stage where over 30 of these opportunities are already generating revenue. So that's really good to see from a diversification perspective. 
What's also really great about it is a lot of these population sequencing initiatives are driven from a national health perspective. So they aren't research projects. What you're seeing is countries embrace genomic testing as part of the standard of care in a health system. 
And that's terrific, first of all, because of the very human impact it allows you to have because you're in the pathway of delivering valuable information to patients. But it also is a place that's very durable, right? So it means once you've built into the health care system, then you just get ramped up as your population scales and it goes year after year. And so that's another really exciting thing to see. 
The other thing that's playing out, we're starting to see the emergence of cohorts, a lot of them involving pharma partners that are looking to generate data from -- population level data from some of the Big Data repositories out there around the world, like Biobanks. And so that's an emerging, sort of, building part of the population sequencing ecosystem right now, too"

Listen, in general, there is really no fundamental change at all in terms of instrument demand from Q3 -- or Q2 into Q3. In general, we do have sometimes some ebb and flows between the quarters in terms of instrument revenues. NovaSeq had record revenues for the quarter, record placements in terms of volumes doubling the placements that we had last year. 
As we said, we exited the quarter with record backlog in terms of instruments. So I would say there's probably some very small movements here and there, but nothing really that's anything significant in terms of why we were slightly down in terms of Q2 versus -- Q3 versus Q2. 
In terms of sequencing instruments as well for COVID surveillance, I would say that was a minor factor as well from Q2 into Q3. There was a few less sequencing instruments that were placed in Q3 compared to Q2. So that has a little bit of an impact there as well. But in general, demand is exceptionally strong, as we talked about with doubling the NextSeq 2000, 1000 and 550 placements versus prior years, not just last year, but prior -- historically, what we used to place in the mid-throughput category, and then the NovaSeq demand is exceptionally strong."

Really, 3 key elements driving towards that, one that is the NHS that we've talked about with 140,000 participants and then that expanding over the years. So that will provide enormous set of data. We also have the PATHFINDER study, which will conclude in the middle of next year. And so far, the data to date has shown generally consistent with the early validation data. So that's been very positive to this point. And then also a reflection -- the Galleri REFLECTION Registry study, where we'll look at the experience in clinical outcomes of 35,000 screening eligible patients over the age of 50, who were prescribed the test from a health care provider. And that enrollment began this quarter, and that will also provide significant data on the march to reimbursement. Want to amplify also the way Francis said, though is, even without reimbursement, there is a tremendous amount of [ free ] reimbursement activity and pre-reimbursement opportunity for Galleri. And so while the march to reimbursement is incredibly important, it's not the only factor to look at."

I know this was alluded to earlier, but the paused EU investigation has been resumed. The decision that happened in early February now. Honestly, most of these decisions for trials and reviews are kind of expected in the first quarter of '22. So I just wanted to kind of ask how much clarity will be provided when these events conclude? And obviously, it's been a pretty polarizing topic. I just think it would be helpful to understand the level of visibility regarding, I guess, the regulatory outcome that you expect to have beyond the first quarter of '22? 
And just one other thing to tack on here. The GRAIL revenue performance in the quarter. It looks like it was maybe $5 million-or-so if you kind of spread out throughout the 3 months that annualized $20 million. I just want to understand what the maybe test volume trends are and maybe even reimbursement as well? That would be helpful."

Maybe I'll start and say, look, as we think about GRAIL and sort of the path forward in terms of clarity, I know it's been a question that investors have asked. And so our perspective is obviously, we're going to continue to work through the trial process, and I'll give you an update on that. But what we want to do is make sure that GRAIL continues to create value because what that means is that no matter what scenario plays out in the event that we get done and we have GRAIL and we can grow it, that's a huge, huge success, obviously, and hugely valuable for our shareholders. But we know that if we create a lot of value in GRAIL, then no matter what the regulatory outcome is, it's still a big win, not only for people who are getting screened but also for our shareholders because we'll have an asset significantly appreciated. 
And even if you look at the progress that's been made at GRAIL since we announced the deal, right? So since we announced the deal, they've published some of their study results. They have launched a product on the schedule they set in June. They have initiated -- not only signed the NHS deal but started the rollout to 140,000 customers and signed up some other health care systems and employers in the U.S. So it's clear the business has created significant value from maybe 12, 15 months ago when we announced the deal. And so our focus is going to be partially also just to make sure that Bob and his team have everything they need to go create a hugely valuable business. And what that does is it ensures our shareholders in some ways, no matter what the outcome is, it's a win for our shareholders. So I want to make sure that I feel very clear that, that's continuing to happen while we talk a lot about the trial. 
From a trial perspective, we expect the decisions we expect out in Europe to come on 2 fronts, right? So as you pointed out, the Phase II result, right now the date is February 24, it may slip a little, but we expect to results from Phase II around that time frame. So late Q1, maybe early Q2. We are also looking for a date in the trial, around jurisdiction in Brussels, and that's also a first half thing, maybe sort of mid-Q1, maybe Q2. Should we prevail in either of those, then we are done with the regulatory process in the European Union. If we don't, then depending on which one, there's certain appeals process that you go through. 
And then still in the FTC, we expect a decision, as I said, in Q1 around the administrative process. Inevitably, there will be a re-review or appeal to the commissioners after that. And then you go -- if you -- if we don't prevail on any of those steps, then we go to a District Court probably in the back half of next year. So that's the process. And now I'll turn it over to Bob for any other color."

Illumina's third quarter was another exceptionally strong quarter with $1.108 billion in revenue, up 40% year-over-year and once again, significantly ahead of expectations. Our customer base continues to expand rapidly. And in the first 3 quarters of 2021, we added 50% more new customers than in all of 2020 or 2019. Because of this strength across our business, we're raising our full year revenue growth outlook for the third quarter in a row to approximately 36%. This is approximately double the growth rate and $567 million higher than the midpoint of the range we guided to at the beginning of the year. 
I will talk through the third quarter results for core Illumina as defined as Illumina other than GRAIL, and then I'll turn the call over to Bob Ragusa, the CEO of our GRAIL subsidiary to cover the GRAIL business. Core Illumina revenue was $1.106 billion. Sequencing instrument revenue was up 65% year-over-year, and we exited the quarter with a record instrument backlog, a positive leading indicator for future revenue. 
Sequencing activity in the quarter was also strong, with sequencing consumable revenue up 45% year-over-year, setting a new record. Our high throughput platform order volume is accelerating. Oncology testing, population sequencing and drug discovery initiatives drove record NovaSeq consumable and instrument shipments. Oncology testing customers represented the highest proportion of NovaSeq shipments for the quarter as large oncology testing labs added to their fleets to support expanded reimbursement for therapy selection testing. 
Drug discovery is emerging as a new application for high throughput sequencing with opportunities across common diseases ranging from obesity to aging. Our mid-throughput platforms also drove growth and expanded our installed base. In the third quarter, over 50% of NextSeq 1000 and 2000 placements were new-to-Illumina customers or to customers upgrading from low-throughput instruments. These instruments continue to unlock new applications. Researchers at Tulane School of Medicine are using the NextSeq 2000 for single cell experiments focused on infection and inflammation. The team is working to develop inhaled vaccines for pneumonia and use single-cell RNA-Seq on a NextSeq 2000 to study the immune cells elicited by this vaccine platform in a recent paper published in Science Immunology. 
Benchtop platforms also saw significant growth year-over-year, with the highest number of MiSeq shipments since Q4 2015. MiSeq, coupled with our COVIDSeq 96-sample assay, is enabling labs around the world to engage in local pathogen surveillance. This quarter, MiSeq placements in both Argentina and Brazil brought COVID surveillance to local communities in conjunction with broader national programs. 
Now turning to Clinical and Research and Applied segments, Oncology testing, our largest market segment, had another record quarter. Sequencing is becoming the standard of care and therapy selection, which is driving robust demand for Illumina sequencers, and our oncology testing customers are rapidly scaling their fleets in response. Reimbursement for genetic testing for therapy selection continues to expand with over 70% of insured lives in the U.S. now covered for these tests. 
Additionally, there are over 60 targeted and immunotherapy treatments currently on the market, highlighting the power of comprehensive genomic profiling in matching patients to treatment. TruSight Oncology 500, our research use-only comprehensive genomic profiling assay, had another record quarter, with over 340 customers now using the assay in their labs. 
In September, we announced a CDx partnership with Merck to develop and commercialize tests leveraging TSO 500 content and an HRD status based on Myriad's myChoice in patients with ovarian cancer. Approximately 300,000 women around the world will be diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer, the fifth deadliest cancer for women. This partnership will help these patients access additional treatment options with the goal of improving care. 
In reproductive health, we saw another quarter of strong year-over-year growth. Almost 80% of pregnancies in the U.S. are now covered for noninvasive prenatal testing. And we're seeing additional progress as states begin to incorporate the ACOG guideline revision from last year into their prenatal screening programs. In California, the prenatal screening program is being revised to include noninvasive prenatal testing, and the state has now issued a request for proposal. NIPT is increasingly being incorporated into guidelines outside the U.S. as well. 
In September, the Italian Ministry of Health issued new guidelines supporting the use of NIPT in a contingent model. With the continued momentum in coverage and guidelines, our end-to-end VeriSeq v2 solution is gaining traction across global markets. Genetic disease testing also posted another strong quarter, as broad reimbursement and compelling clinical utility data drive a shift to whole genome sequencing. 
This quarter, the results of the groundbreaking NICUSeq trial, co-authored by Illumina scientists were published in JAMA Pediatrics. The randomized time-delayed trial demonstrated that clinical whole genome sequencing drives a twofold improvement in both diagnostic efficacy and change of clinical management for acutely ill newborns. We are working to ensure that families and NICU patients around the world can access these tests. 
In the U.S., Michigan recently became the first state to offer rapid whole genome sequencing to acutely ill infants and children regardless of insurance and other states, like California and Florida, are making progress in this direction as well. Outside the U.S., last week, we announced the pilot program in Israel, to implement whole genome sequencing for critically ill infants suspected of having a genetic disorder in neonatal intensive care units. This program will accelerate time to diagnosis for these patients and support rapid clinical decision-making. 
Turning to our Research and Applied segments. We saw another strong quarter of sequential and year-over-year growth. The 30-plus population genomics initiatives that we support around the world drove growth in the quarter. The accuracy and scalability of our sequencing platforms, combined with our end-to-end solutions, like Illumina Connected Analytics make Illumina an ideal partner for large sequencing initiatives. The value of these population programs is expanding across clinical outcomes, research and drug discovery. This traction is generating significant interest and investment for additional programs like Our Future Health, the U.K.'s largest ever research program focused on developing new ways to detect, treat and prevent disease. 
Just yesterday, we announced that the Illumina-Connected Analytics solutions are being used by HostSeq, part of the Canadian COVID-19 Genomics network. Our sequencing and bioinformatics solutions will be used to identify biomarkers that can help predict potential risk of serious disease and support the development of novel therapeutics to combat COVID-19. We anticipate these types of population programs will become increasingly critical to innovation as their findings translate into greater use of sequencing in clinical workflows and actionable data for drug discovery. We're already seeing this with the initial data from the U.K. Biobank as the program concludes. 
Regeneron is utilizing the U.K. biobank data in multiple ways, including to find more than 500 genes with variant trade associations linked to higher risk of diseases, like hypertension, asthma and liver disease and as part of their data set to create new obesity medicines in partnership with AstraZeneca. And companies like Relay Therapeutics are utilizing genomic data along with AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery. 
COVID surveillance drove $55 million in sequencing shipments in the quarter, of which $15 million were instrument purchases, as concerns about variants continue to heighten the focus on surveillance efforts. We see the infrastructure for COVID surveillance as the foundation for broader pathogen surveillance to increase around the world. For example, CERI, a new genomics facility in South Africa, was launched this quarter with capabilities to bolster the pandemic and epidemic response across Africa. With resources like this in place, sequencing data from 51 of the 54 countries in Africa, is now available in GISAID. And a total of 50,000 SARS-CoV 2 genomes have been sequenced, 2 months ahead of Africa CDC's schedule. 
Turning to GRAIL. In August, we closed our acquisition, which we believe will help accelerate patient access and affordability for multi-cancer early detection screening. I am delighted to introduce Bob Ragusa on his first call as GRAIL's CEO. Bob most recently served as Illumina's Chief Operations Officer, and he has more than 30 years of experience in genomics. He played a critical role in providing the sequencing systems for the Human Genome Project and was responsible for significantly scaling Illumina's business in more than 140 countries and enabled the first NovaSeq shipments. With his decades of deep expertise, Bob is uniquely positioned to lead GRAIL during a time of extraordinary growth and discovery. I will now turn the call over to Bob to discuss GRAIL's business updates."

I am pleased to share a few thoughts on our recent progress. First, I want to highlight Galleri commercial progress. We see significant pre-reimbursement opportunities for Galleri and are encouraged with the momentum across our 3 primary channels. In the employer channel, we are gaining momentum and expect to announce notable new partnerships in the technology, industrial, professional services and transportation sectors. We are also successfully engaging with key high-cancer-risk area of public sector employers, such as firefighters. 
For health systems, we are focused on establishing strategic agreements with influential systems in the medical community to increase awareness and experience with Galleri. Health systems are also strategic partners to generate real-world evidence in key patient communities and regions. To date, we have signed agreements with several health partners who are planning to start providing access to Galleri in the fourth quarter. We're also in contract discussions with several additional influential health systems that we expect will begin offering Galleri to patients early next year. 
In addition, we are excited to see interest from progressive and innovative payers, including Medicare Advantage, where we expect to communicate our first partnership soon. Medical practices are an important driver of the Galleri launch. We have agreements with several of the largest primary care private practice networks and expect to continue to expand in this area. We are focused on onboarding physicians in these networks and see positive prescriber trends. 
We also recently partnered with Genome Medical, an independent health care provider to serve individuals who prefer a telemedicine option. We launched a service several weeks ago on galleri.com and believe this will be an important future pre-reimbursement growth driver. 
In addition, we partnered with PWNHealth, a national telehealth network to further extend our service capability for some employer programs. Additionally, in September, the State of New York granted approval for the Galleri test. The standards set by New York State represents one of the most rigorous levels of validation required for laboratory developed test. 
Finally, there is tremendous excitement around the recent start of the NHS Galleri study, a 140,000 participant real-world randomized controlled study that has generated widespread national and international media coverage. This is part of England's national priority to speed up earlier detection of cancer to improve survival. Enrollment has been robust and is on-track with our expectations. Based on data generated from this initial study, access to Galleri could expand to around 1 million people in 2024 and '25, and to a larger population after that time. 
Lastly, I would like to note that the reported GRAIL revenue represents both revenue recognized from the sale of our Galleri tests and generated from our MRD collaboration agreements with biopharmaceutical companies. We are encouraged by the initial test results generated with our partners and plan to expand a number of pilot studies to support development of MRD and PDX product opportunities. We also expect MRD and PDX collaboration income will continue as an important component of GRAIL's revenue mix and is an attractive future growth driver of our business. 
I look forward to sharing with you more about GRAIL's progress in the coming quarters. 
Now I'll turn it over to Sam."

As a reminder, our third quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL for the period beginning after the acquisition closed on August 18, 2021. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL then conclude with our outlook. I will be highlighting non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. 
Third quarter revenue once again significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 40% year-over-year to $1.108 billion, driven by core Illumina revenue growth of 39% and $2 million of revenue from GRAIL. For the third quarter, GAAP net income was $317 million or $2.08 per diluted share, which included a $900 million gain from our previously held investment in GRAIL as a part of the acquisition and $654 million in day 1 compensation expense related to the GRAIL acquisition. 
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $221 million or $1.45 per diluted share, which included $0.19 of dilution from GRAIL operating losses and $0.06 of incremental dilution from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 153 million. 
Moving to the rest of the consolidated P&L. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $528 million increased $57 million sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses of $50 million for the quarter and a $7 million increase in core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $163 million year-over-year, driven by $50 million of GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses and $113 million increase in core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses. 
Non-GAAP other expense of $6 million increased $4 million sequentially and was $13 million lower than other income in Q3 of last year as expected. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower interest income on short-term investments as we repositioned our investment portfolio and subsequently liquidated our holdings to fund the GRAIL acquisition as well as interest expense on the term notes issued in Q1 2021. 
The non-GAAP tax rate of 13.2% decreased from last quarter and year-over-year due to the tax impact of including GRAIL and Illumina's consolidated results of operations. The decrease in the non-GAAP tax rate year-over-year was partially offset by discrete tax benefits recorded in the third quarter of 2020 related to prior year return adjustments and tax reserve releases. 
Moving to segment results. I will start by highlighting the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue grew 39% year-over-year to $1.106 billion driven by record shipments for both clinical and research. Core Illumina sequencing revenue of $1.013 billion grew 43% year-over-year and represented 92% of core Illumina revenue. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $723 million, led by record NovaSeq consumables shipments that grew over 50% year-over-year. 
Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina grew 65% year-over-year to $180 million, driven by record NovaSeq shipments that again more than doubled year-over-year due to accelerating demand in oncology testing. NextSeq 1000 and 2000 orders reached a new high in the quarter, and there was solid growth across all mid- and low-throughput systems year-over-year. 
We ended the quarter with record sequencing instrument backlog that is almost double the backlog entering the year. Revenue from COVID-19 surveillance, again, exceeded our expectations due to the sustained focus on variant tracking and surveillance infrastructure scaling in the quarter, contributing approximately $40 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $15 million in incremental instrument revenue. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $110 million, driven by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as gel sample growth. 
Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas region was $581 million, growing 33% compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by record oncology testing shipments and ongoing population genomics initiatives, such as All of Us. The regional performance was also driven by COVID surveillance strength due to expanded public health network adoption of NGS in Latin America. EMEA delivered revenue of $313 million, representing 47% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by significant growth across all clinical markets and strength in emerging markets; population genomics initiatives partially driven by UK Biobank, which concluded in Q3 and COVID surveillance testing also contributed to the stronger quarter performance in the region. 
Greater China revenue was $122 million, representing growth of 47% year-over-year due to continued clinical strength in the region, led by NextSeqDx demand in hospitals and oncology testing growth. Almost half of the NextSeqDx shipments were to new-to-Illumina hospital customers and the expanding footprint in hospitals is helping drive growth in infectious disease testing, which more than doubled year-over-year. 
Finally, APJ revenue of $90 million grew 45% year-over-year, driven by sequencing instrument growth from clinical demand for NextSeq 2000 as well as consumables revenue growth across oncology testing and research. 
Moving to the rest of the core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 71.3% declined sequentially by 50 basis points, due primarily to onetime revenue from the NIPT patent litigation settlement recorded in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 390 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes, partially offset by higher freight costs as a result of the pandemic. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $478 million were up $7 million sequentially, but overall were lower than expected due to the timing of hiring and project spend shifting into Q4. 
As expected, non-GAAP operating expenses were up $113 million year-over-year due to increased performance-based compensation expenses and headcount growth as well as additional investments to support the significant growth of our business. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 28% compared to 30% in the second quarter of 2021. Operating margins declined sequentially as expected, mostly due to $20 million of onetime patent litigation settlement revenue recognized in the prior quarter.
Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue was $2 million for the quarter consisting primarily of Galleri test fees, the multi-cancer early detection test that commercially launched in June, as well as moderate MRD partnership revenue. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $50 million for the quarter, which consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. As a reminder, GRAIL's third quarter financial results are for the period beginning after the acquisition closed on August 18. 
Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items for consolidated Illumina. Cash flow used in operations was $272 million, which was a net outflow for the quarter due to expenses related to the GRAIL acquisition. DSO of 50 days compared to 44 days last quarter, driven by revenue linearity. Third quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $52 million, and free cash flow was a negative $324 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
During the third quarter, we used $2.9 billion to fund the GRAIL acquisition. Before I discuss guidance, I wanted to acknowledge that I'm especially proud of our team's strong execution to fulfill surging demand and deliver another record quarter in a challenging global environment. While there were some small pockets of supply constraints for certain products in specific geographies this quarter, there was no material impact, thanks to our team's incredible efforts. We will continue to source, produce and operate with agility to enable further growth and support our customers. 
Moving now to 2021 guidance. We now expect full year 2021 consolidated and core Illumina revenue to grow approximately 36%. This represents consolidated revenue of approximately $4.41 billion for 2021 or revenue growth of approximately $1.17 billion compared to 2020 and an increase of approximately $100 million compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance. 
For fiscal 2021, we now expect core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 39% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum in our base business. We now expect core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin to be between 27.5% to 28%, which reflects our higher revenue expectations. We expect core Illumina operating expenses for Q4 2021 and to increase by approximately $50 million compared to Q3 2021 due to the timing of expenses shifting from Q3 into Q4, increased investments to support the robust growth of our business, as well as expected payments in Q4 2021 related to certain partnerships. 
Our focus continues to be on improving the core Illumina operating margin leverage over time. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $5.50 to $5.60, which includes dilution from GRAIL operating loss of approximately $1 and incremental dilution of $0.15 from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition. 
We now expect GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4.41 to $4.51. We now expect diluted shares outstanding in fiscal 2021 to be approximately 151 million. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.35 to $0.45 and GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.10 to $0.20. We expect diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2021 of approximately 158 million.
Now I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks."

Our third quarter performance reflects the strength of our business, the talent and dedication of our people and the enduring value of our mission. Before I close, I would like to highlight how we're furthering this mission through our ESG work. Human health and the health of the environment are intertwined as are our company mission and our commitment to operating responsibly and sustainably. 
In the third quarter, we announced aggressive environmental goals, including our Net 0 commitment to advance the climate component of our ESG strategy. Sam and I will discuss this strategy in greater detail at our inaugural ESG Investor event on November 16, and we hope you will join us. 
To close, we saw a remarkable performance and broad-based strength across our business in the third quarter and we are both inspired and excited to see this momentum continuing into Q4. We again raised our annual revenue guidance. And with our record instrument backlog, we are on-pace for a strong finish to an exceptional 2021. We will build upon this strength as we seize opportunities to expand existing markets, including oncology testing and infectious disease along with new applications. Sequencing data will enable this expansion as we usher in the era of genomic medicine. And Illumina will be at the forefront of these innovations, supporting our customers as we collectively advance human.

And given the easy comp and given the backlog and the momentum, I'm just wondering why the fourth quarter outlook might not be stronger? And then I have a follow-up."
29753,1685065058,2426611,"Illumina, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Illumina, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Thank you, Dan. This is Sam. So for Q4, first of all, let me talk about the full year. We are, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, Dan, we are raising our revenue guide to approximately 36%. For Q4, I think there's a couple of areas that you",300,"Yes. Thank you, Dan. This is Sam. So for Q4, first of all, let me talk about the full year. We are, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, Dan, we are raising our revenue guide to approximately 36%. For Q4, I think there's a couple of areas that you need to keep in mind. One is the conclusion of the UK Biobank initiatives. This has been an incredibly productive; incredibly, I would say, very important initiative from a population genomics standpoint that we talked a little bit about the outcomes from that and the next step. But that will likely present a $20 million quarter-to-quarter headwind or reduction in terms of revenue in terms of Q4 versus Q3. So that's one area. 
And then the second area, and I think you touched on that in your question in regards to COVID surveillance. So COVID surveillance has been strong for the year. We've seen, obviously, with the pandemic, the way it is, that there's continued testing and sequencing of positive samples across the globe. 
For Q3, we have $55 million of COVID surveillance revenue in the quarter. That represented $15 million of instruments and $40 million of consumables. For Q4, our expectation is that we will have $35 million of COVID surveillance revenue, which represents a modest amount of instrument revenue, about $5 million and then approximately $30 million of COVID consumables. That represents, again, another $20 million reduction from Q3 into Q4. 
So when we think about that sequential momentum, the core business is really strong. And when I say the core business, I mean our clinical business, research business, you heard comments from Bob around GRAIL, but there is that reduction associated with those 2 items, which is COVID surveillance as well as the UK Biobank concluding."

Thanks, Dan, and I'll have my welcome to Cowen, and it's great to see you covering us again. So I did talk a lot about the strength in the oncology segment, specifically oncology therapy selection testing because that really has been one of the breakout stories, frankly, for the whole year. And what's really driving that story is a few things. One, we saw significant expansion in reimbursements for genomic testing for therapy selection play out in the U.S. And so now we have a significant base in the U.S. that has coverage for genomic testing. And at the same time, we've seen a move towards larger panels as comprehensive genomic profiling really gets traction in the market. And so those who have created a powerful force in oncology therapy selection testing and we're seeing our customers expanding their fleets. Now in terms of how that's playing out, you're seeing that play out across all segments. You're seeing some of our larger customers significantly expanding their fleets and expanding their NovaSeqs specifically because of the demand that they're seeing as well as the anticipated demand going forward. But you're also seeing new customers and some of our smaller customers getting into oncology therapy selection. One of the interesting metrics to look at, and it takes into account more than oncology. 
Like I said, oncology is one of the biggest drivers of it, is if you look at the strength in the NovaSeq instrument, you see we're placing a lot of NovaSeq instruments and we're having a very strong backlog of NovaSeq instruments. And at the same time, we're seeing really strong pull-through into NovaSeqs. And so that's sort of the pot of gold at the end of the double rainbow right, because you're seeing they're putting a lot of instruments out there and yet, pull-through remains high, at the high end of the range we talked about. And so to your question about what's the outlook going forward, I'd say that's a really good, positive indicator for what people are experiencing today and what they're expecting going forward."

Or is that something abnormal happening because that's an annualized run rate of $1.60. I don't think that sounds like, I just want to make sure I had the Q4 assumptions, right. 
And for fiscal '22, should comps matter because most of your peers are assuming normalized growth. And given your comments on backlog I understand you have surveillance being a big component this year, but the 36%, should comps matter and how should we think about it?"

So as I talked about on the call, there are -- in Q4, there's $0.80 roughly a dilution $1 for the year, but in Q4, about $0.80 related to GRAIL dilution. And then there's about $0.09 of dilution related to the weighted average share count as a result of the shares that we issued to finance the GRAIL acquisition. So those are specific to GRAIL. That obviously impacts the $0.35 to $0.45 non-GAAP EPS for Q4. 
In terms of the core Illumina business, I talked to answer to Dan's question, I talked a little bit about a couple of dynamics around revenues. In terms of OpEx, yes, there are some costs that I also mentioned in our prepared remarks. First of all, we have timing of expenses that shifted from Q3 to Q4. That's why Q3 was lower than our expectations in terms of operating expenses. Q4 now has increased in terms of our expectations to spend there. And then I talked about also partnership OpEx that is expected in Q4. So we do have some expenses associated with certain partnerships that's somewhat significant in Q4, that's discrete to Q4. 
In terms of 2022 guidance, we're not going to talk about guidance on this call, except to say the fundamentals of the business are incredibly strong. We have talked before about the GRAIL dilution of $3.25 to $3.75 for 2022, that remains the case. That has not changed.

So any time we have such a big beat playing out against the backdrop of a pandemic, the first thing you look at is the supply chain, your ability to serve. 
And as we said on the call, I'm incredibly proud of the work the team has done in terms of demand capacity planning to make sure that we're able to stay ahead of this big demand we're seeing. And as we pointed out, we started to see this demand build at the tail end of last year. And so the team did a lot of work on a number of fronts. 
First, they did work around making sure that our inbound suppliers will be able to cope with the demand that was coming. And that meant things like building safety stock internally of supplies coming in, ordering items that would have long lead times, sometimes up to a year-plus in advance for things like resins, where we knew there might be shortages. But then also, we started to invest in increasing our own production capacity, and that was true across the board. So whether it's cartridges flow cells or [ rigs ] across the board, we started certainly by the first half of this year, we were significantly increasing capacity to build the supplies. 
And then in addition to that, we started to invest starting last year in increasing our ability to move production. So specifically, for example, we expanded our warehousing capacity in Eindhoven and opened up a new center in Eindhoven and that's our regional distribution for EMEA, as you might know. And we doubled the capacity we had in Eindhoven. Similarly, we expanded capacity in Japan this year. From a warehousing perspective, we put a new warehouse in Brazil this year. And we also continue to invest in and strengthen the transportation links between these hubs. 
And then we started to build safety stock on the outbound side to make sure that we had enough inventory on site to cope with what we knew was going to be strong demand ended up being much stronger than even we had expected. And so for the vast majority of our core consumables now, we have safety stock on hand of 6 to 8 weeks of supply. And so our team did a really terrific job sort of calling it early and then jumping on it end to end to make sure that we have the capacity to supply the demand coming in."

And so we're seeing progress there. A lot of it is driven by the terrific partner ecosystem that we've built up over the years in China. That's really paying off. 
In addition, we're actually seeing a tailwind associated with some regulations that have emerged that allow the use of LDTs in Shanghai. And so that has been -- that's fairly recent, but has already started to pay dividends as you see more labs being stood up to generate their own LDT testing capability.

So one of the things that has been really great to see is the broadening of the base of population sequencing customers. So we've talked about the fact that we've been cultivating over 50 of these opportunities, and we're now at the stage where over 30 of these opportunities are already generating revenue. So that's really good to see from a diversification perspective. 
What's also really great about it is a lot of these population sequencing initiatives are driven from a national health perspective. So they aren't research projects. What you're seeing is countries embrace genomic testing as part of the standard of care in a health system. 
And that's terrific, first of all, because of the very human impact it allows you to have because you're in the pathway of delivering valuable information to patients. But it also is a place that's very durable, right? So it means once you've built into the health care system, then you just get ramped up as your population scales and it goes year after year. And so that's another really exciting thing to see. 
The other thing that's playing out, we're starting to see the emergence of cohorts, a lot of them involving pharma partners that are looking to generate data from -- population level data from some of the Big Data repositories out there around the world, like Biobanks. And so that's an emerging, sort of, building part of the population sequencing ecosystem right now too."

Listen, in general, there is really no fundamental change at all in terms of instrument demand from Q3 -- or Q2 into Q3. In general, we do have sometimes some ebb and flows between the quarters in terms of instrument revenues. NovaSeq had record revenues for the quarter, record placements in terms of volumes doubling the placements that we had last year. 
As we said, we exited the quarter with record backlog in terms of instruments. So I would say there's probably some very small movements here and there, but nothing really that's anything significant in terms of why we were slightly down in terms of Q2 versus -- Q3 versus Q2. 
In terms of sequencing instruments as well for COVID surveillance, I would say that was a minor factor as well from Q2 into Q3. There was a few less sequencing instruments that were placed in Q3 compared to Q2. So that has a little bit of an impact there as well. But in general, demand is exceptionally strong, as we talked about with doubling the NextSeq 2000, 1000 and 550 placements versus prior years, not just last year, but prior -- historically, what we used to place in the mid-throughput category, and then the NovaSeq demand is exceptionally strong."

And the pull-through on NovaSeq, even with all the instruments we just placed, and you expect a lot of them are still in their ramp-up mode, where they should be at the low-end of total. But even with that, the total average pull-through on NovaSeq as at the high end of the range we've talked about. So it's been pegged there. And so there's just a lot of activity happening on our NovaSeqs out in the field. and that's causing customers to place the orders that are driving the record backlog that we have walking into Q4. And so we really feel that it's a really fantastically strong position to be."

Just if you could walk us through that, what -- what are you doing to progress towards that? What's the timing of it? What is that trial? Is U.K. NHS that trial? Or is it any other trial or bank samples that you have already collected that you can potentially run and submit that data?

I would say what we said before continues to be -- continues to be true today, which is in the U.S., this test is going to be -- has been rolled out as an LDT. And it doesn't need anything more. It's on the market today. It's a self-pay test. You can order today. Some employers are already covering it. There are some health systems that are looking to roll it out. And if it's a concierge system, it could be, for example, as far as the subscription model or our models. And so nothing in the U.S. is needed for the test to continue to be on the market. It's been in the market since June. And nothing in terms of trials that are needed for the existing revenue sources that Bob talked about to be real. 
So everything in terms of studies and data is all out there. In fact, the -- you heard the studies that were published earlier this year just reinforced already the huge amount of data that's been put out onto the market so far. So nothing more is needed there. 
And what we said about NHS is, the NHS is sort of a self-contained trial in the sense that it has designed the milestones and the product that would get it comfortable rolling it out at a population scale. And they were the ones who rolled out the path that started 140,000, then scale up to 1 million in the next couple of years and then go population scale. And so it's a fully self-contained process. They have identified what they need to see. They are partnering with GRAIL. And so that's what we've said before, and that's what we continue to see. And I'll turn it over to Bob."

Really, 3 key elements driving towards that, one that is the NHS that we've talked about with 140,000 participants and then that expanding over the years. So that will provide enormous set of data. We also have the PATHFINDER study, which will conclude in the middle of next year. And so far, the data to date has shown generally consistent with the early validation data. So that's been very positive to this point. And then also a reflection -- the Galleri REFLECTION Registry study, where we'll look at the experience in clinical outcomes of 35,000 screening eligible patients over the age of 50, who were prescribed the test from a health care provider. And that enrollment began this quarter, and that will also provide significant data on the march to reimbursement. Want to amplify also the way Francis said, though is, even without reimbursement, there is a tremendous amount of [ free ] reimbursement activity and pre-reimbursement opportunity for Galleri. And so while the march to reimbursement is incredibly important, it's not the only factor to look at."

So I just wanted to kind of ask how much clarity will be provided when these events conclude? And obviously, it's been a pretty polarizing topic. I just think it would be helpful to understand the level of visibility regarding, I guess, the regulatory outcome that you expect to have beyond the first quarter of '22? 
And just one other thing to tack on here. The GRAIL revenue performance in the quarter. It looks like it was maybe $5 million-or-so if you kind of spread out throughout the 3 months that annualized $20 million. I just want to understand what the maybe test volume trends are and maybe even reimbursement as well? That would be helpful."

Maybe I'll start and say, look, as we think about GRAIL and sort of the path forward in terms of clarity, I know it's been a question that investors have asked. And so our perspective is obviously, we're going to continue to work through the trial process, and I'll give you an update on that. But what we want to do is make sure that GRAIL continues to create value because what that means is that no matter what scenario plays out in the event that we get done and we have GRAIL and we can grow it, that's a huge, huge success, obviously, and hugely valuable for our shareholders. But we know that if we create a lot of value in GRAIL, then no matter what the regulatory outcome is, it's still a big win, not only for people who are getting screened but also for our shareholders because we'll have an asset significantly appreciated. 
And even if you look at the progress that's been made at GRAIL since we announced the deal, right? So since we announced the deal, they've published some of their study results. They have launched a product on the schedule they set in June. They have initiated -- not only signed the NHS deal but started the rollout to 140,000 customers and signed up some other health care systems and employers in the U.S. So it's clear the business has created significant value from maybe 12, 15 months ago when we announced the deal. And so our focus is going to be partially also just to make sure that Bob and his team have everything they need to go create a hugely valuable business. And what that does is it ensures our shareholders in some ways, no matter what the outcome is, it's a win for our shareholders. So I want to make sure that I feel very clear that, that's continuing to happen while we talk a lot about the trial. 
From a trial perspective, we expect the decisions we expect out in Europe to come on 2 fronts, right? So as you pointed out, the Phase II result, right now the date is February 24, it may slip a little, but we expect to results from Phase II around that time frame. So late Q1, maybe early Q2. We are also looking for a date in the trial, around jurisdiction in Brussels, and that's also a first half thing, maybe sort of mid-Q1, maybe Q2. Should we prevail in either of those, then we are done with the regulatory process in the European Union. If we don't, then depending on which one, there's certain appeals process that you go through. 
And then still in the FTC, we expect a decision, as I said, in Q1 around the administrative process. Inevitably, there will be a re-review or appeal to the commissioners after that. And then you go -- if you -- if we don't prevail on any of those steps, then we go to a District Court probably in the back half of next year. So that's the process. And now I'll turn it over to Bob for any other color."
