And good morning to everyone. During our Investor Day this past December, we unveiled our strategy to take advantage of our organic growth and increased capital spending opportunities t",2364,"Thank you, Phil, and I want to welcome you to our CenterPoint team. 
And good morning to everyone. During our Investor Day this past December, we unveiled our strategy to take advantage of our organic growth and increased capital spending opportunities to deliver consistent earnings growth, offer industry-leading rate base growth, reduce costs to invest in the future, take a leading stance on ESG, and minimize our exposure to the midstream. We focus on core Utility Operations and most importantly, continue to provide a resilient grid for our customers. We are excited to share our significant progress against those objectives with you today. 
Before we start, I want to update you on the impacts of last week's devastating winter storm event that struck Texas in our broader service territories. It was undoubtedly an extremely difficult week across our service territories, especially for Texans. We know many of our customers faced very difficult conditions, and our hearts go out to those in our communities who have faced substantial hardship and loss. I am really proud of how our employees worked in very harsh conditions to help customers, even as their own homes and families were without power or experiencing damage from busted pipes. 
As you know, I like to lead things off with headlines, so let me give you the storm headlines. First and foremost, our CenterPoint electric and gas systems worked as designed and proved to be very resilient despite the impact of ice, snow, freezing temperatures and the fluctuating power loads provided to us by ERCOT during the week. All of these factors are tough on equipment, but our system did its job and was able to be quickly reenergized.  Our decision to increase utilities' earnings guidance is an expression of our confidence that the storm will not impact our 6% to 8% utility EPS annual growth rate and our ability to ramp up our capital spending efforts and grow our rate base at a 10% compound annual growth rate. 
As you know, in Texas we are not a generator of electricity and are dependent on a power supply dispatched to us by the ERCOT system. Once we finally receive adequate power from third-party generators to transmit and distribute across our service territory, the resiliency of our system proved itself in over 98% of our 2.6 million electric customers had electricity within about 12 hours. I believe that's pretty amazing, and I'm very proud of our employees that worked tirelessly. 
Our gas system was equally tested and proved resilient as the storm and cold weather simultaneously impacted our 8-state gas footprint, including very cold temperatures in Minnesota. And despite a constant [search] for gas supply, we kept our line pressures up and were able to serve our customers throughout the system. 
We saw natural gas price spiking very high throughout our system and electric pricing getting very high in Texas. In all of our gas jurisdictions, we are fortunate to have regulatory mechanisms already in place and additional tools now at our disposal to recover these costs in a timely manner and to mitigate impacts to our customers' bills. 
As you well know, our electric business transmits and distributes power. In our markets, the local retail electric providers, or REPs, are responsible for purchasing electricity and take on the inherent risk of power pricing, customer billing and collecting. If an REP was to cease to operate, you should know and be confident that the existing regulatory mechanisms allow for us to recover any cost exposure we might have due to bad debt expense. These events once again point out the benefit we have of operating in states that have favorable and supportive regulatory processes. 
More importantly for our investors, we will not have to seek any incremental equity to handle our increased storm-related liquidity needs. As we have mentioned many times, we are fortunate to work in constructive regulatory jurisdictions and fully expect these costs to be recoverable in a timely manner. And in many of our jurisdictions where these costs are the largest, we already have the ability to recover some carrying costs. We are in the process of working with all of our regulators on that. 
From an overall financial standpoint, we expect to incur incremental spend in 2021 related to the February winter storm, including additional operational expenses and purchased gas costs. At this time, we expect the total amount of incremental gas purchase costs to be about $2.5 billion spread across all of our jurisdictions. 
Jason will speak in further detail about this. But before anyone becomes concerned, I want to remind everyone that we believe we have ample liquidity from our credit facilities, particularly given our recently announced committed short-term financing that will help bridge our near-term working capital needs as well as strong capital markets access and strong and timely recovery mechanisms. Therefore to put your minds at ease, while we don't expect direct impact of the storm event on our guidance based utility EPS range, we will incur modest additional interest expense related to some of these excess costs until they can be recovered. We view this more as an addressable working capital management challenge, which we will manage our way through. As we have emphasized, we will sweat the details so you don't have to. This is a perfect example of where that comes into play. 
Finally, I've been asked by the mayor of Houston to head up the fundraising for families of Houstonians who may need additional help to recover from this storm, especially around home repairs and basic needs. CenterPoint was proud to provide the lead contribution to this fund, and I look forward to working in my capacity as Chair of the effort to build upon this contribution. And I thank the mayor for the trust and confidence he has placed in me, the company and our employees by asking us to lead this important endeavor. 
Now let's move on to the results of our business. This call is also an opportunity for us to demonstrate to you that we are in fact now executing on the key objectives that we outlined during our December 7 Investor Day. I will review the underlying elements of our core plan and share with you how we are making meaningful inroads in each functional area. 
Let me start with the next set of headlines we are presenting to you today. We delivered $0.29 per share for the fourth quarter and $1.40 per share for the year on a guidance basis, beating consensus in our previous guidance. More importantly, even factoring in the disruptions to our operations last week, we are raising our 2021 guidance based utility EPS range to $1.24 to $1.26. This will now be the new and higher baseline for our future 6% to 8% guidance growth target. 
We are, of course, also maintaining our $16 billion-plus capital spend program and 10% compound annual rate base growth. Our gas LDC sales process is on track, and we are moving to minimize our midstream exposure. So as you can see, we have been very busy since our Investor Day. 
Turning to Enable. Let me tell you how excited I was about the announcement of the transaction between Enable and Energy Transfer on February 17. We said to you on our Investor Day that we are absolutely focused on reducing and eventually eliminating our midstream exposure through a disciplined financial approach, all done in a thoughtful way with the objective to optimize the long-term benefit to our shareholders. We followed that approach and now have a transaction that we expect to achieve the following: an accelerated path towards a fully regulated utility business model; improvement in our business risk profile by having our midstream investment anchored to a larger, more diversified entity; exchanging our interest into a more liquid security, which will facilitate an accelerated exit; increased autonomy through the dissolution of the Enable partnership, giving us flexibility to make decisions about our exit strategy. And of course, it reduces risk to distributions while we wind down our position. As to our exit strategy, we intend to exit in an accelerated but highly managed and sophisticated way that will not disrupt the trading of Energy Transfer. 
Jason will talk to you more about the transaction itself. But I want to say to you loud and clear, so there is no confusion or concern about it. This transaction will have 0 impact on our broader strategic goals. In fact, we believe it supports our guidance and rate base growth targets and our higher 2021 guidance based utility EPS range. 
As I stated previously, we will continue to expect no additional equity issuance in 2021 beyond the DRIP process we described in our Investor Day. The fact that we will have to absorb increased corporate allocations and the costs associated with the debt currently allocated to Enable as we reduce our midstream exposure are just headwinds to manage. Managing these Enable-related headwinds were anticipated and have been in our thinking all along. We clearly will not back away from the financial goals we have shared with you because of these headwinds. 
We sweat the details so you don't have to. Does that sound familiar? It should be as it applies here too. 
Since we last talked, I am excited that we have added 2 high-caliber financial leaders to our team. Stacey Peterson now leads our treasury, financial planning and analysis efforts. And Phil Holder, from whom you heard earlier, now leads our Strategic Planning and Investor Relations teams. 
Our entire executive team is hard at work to deliver on our stated objectives, which begins with industry leading, robust organic growth and continues with disciplined operations and financial management. In addition to our industry-leading organic growth, our management team is committed to making CenterPoint the utility industry leader in ESG and environmental stewardship. During our Investor Day, we elaborated on the beginnings of our carbon reduction strategy with our call retirements in Indiana as well as adding renewable and green hydrogen initiatives across our LDC service territories. Let me share our early thinking on CenterPoint's role in a net zero economy. 
First, we are focused on reducing the carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet in Indiana, work that is already well underway and supported by our filing for the CPCNs and for the solar elements of our IRP plants earlier this week. Secondly, we are focused on minimizing our emissions from our core operations by adopting electric vehicles for our fleet, utilizing state-of-the-art technology to detect and eliminate methane emissions from leaks on our gas system, and by embracing energy efficiency in the buildings we own. Third, we are focused on reducing the carbon intensity of the gas we supply our customers and continue to evaluate ways to expand our renewable natural gas and green hydrogen pilots. Fourth, we are focused on enabling carbon reduction of others, either through connecting new renewable energy sources to our grid in Texas, facilitating the adoption of electric vehicles, or helping customers adopt higher efficiency standards. 
We understand the importance of reducing our carbon footprint, as evidenced by the adoption of our carbon policy last year. Recognizing that there is still more work to do, we plan to release an enhanced ESG plan later this year. 
I want to thank you all for spending your time with CenterPoint today. And before I hand it over to Jason, let me reiterate what it means to be invested in CenterPoint and why we are a uniquely attractive value proposition. 
Number one, we are moving toward a fully regulated business with fantastic utilities in highly attractive jurisdictions. Our utilities have the potential to deliver to you robust rate base and earnings growth relative to other opportunities that you have in the sector. 
Two, we are committed to keeping our service affordable for our customers by reducing O&M expense and continuously improving our processes to create the necessary headroom to support our robust organic utility growth while remaining focused on our commitment to safety. Tom Webb, whose expertise on that we have enjoyed over the past months, will be joining us shortly and share what work we have done so far. 
Number three, we are focused on delivering consistently on our industry-leading earnings growth. We don't want you to have surprises or elements you don't understand as you evaluate our business. 
Number four, we have promised you that we will take steps to minimize our midstream exposure and are now on a clear path to deliver on that. I want to emphasize what a big step this is for us. We are working toward a point where midstream is no longer a topic of these calls. Then we can all solely focus on what a great utility business we have. Trust that we will continue to work on that. 
Number five, we are proactively working to strengthen our relationship with our regulators. We are committed to doing right by our customers so that our regulators can rest easy. I have personally visited most of our regulators during my short tenure as CEO and plan to engage with all of them on a regular basis. We are privileged to serve under some of the most constructive regulatory authorities in the country, and we are working tirelessly to maintain those relationships. 
Number six, we are committed to balance sheet efficiency and high credit quality. We will continue to work to recycle capital efficiently, as we are doing with our gas LDC sales to further support our organic growth from a credit and financial perspective. We are working to simplify our balance sheet and continue to improve our credit profile over time. Just recently, S&P and Fitch's decision to remove CenterPoint from negative watch confirmed that we are headed down the right path, and we are not going to stop there. 
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Jason, so he can talk to you about our financial results and provide more detail on what I have outlined. I will be back at the end to share my closing comments and to answer your questions. Jason?"

And thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call. 
As Dave pointed out, we shared many goals with you on our Investor Day, and our team here is laser-focused on delivering on them despite what is thrown our way. The winter storm this past week challenged the communities we have the privilege to serve in extraordinary ways. Our thoughts remain with our customers as they recover from the impact of the storm. But I want to add, I too am proud of how our teams responded to the call for action, the resiliency of our gas and electric systems during the storm, and our ability to continue to deliver on our commitments to you, our shareholders, during these extraordinary events. 
Let me get started with our key takeaways from today's call, starting on Slide 3. First, we are pleased to report that for both the fourth quarter and the full year results for 2020, we beat both consensus and our most recent guidance. Given our ability to also pull forward some additional work into 2020, (sic) we have the confidence in increasing our guidance basis utility EPS range for 2021 to $1.24 to $1.26. This will be the basis for our consistent 6% to 8% guidance basis utility EPS growth year after year, like we've committed to you. 
Second, we have recently shared that Enable has entered into a merger agreement with Energy Transfer that would result in Energy Transfer acquiring Enable upon the closing of the transaction, including all of CenterPoint's interest in Enable. That's a big step towards CenterPoint's promise to minimize our midstream exposure, and I'll talk more about this in a little bit. 
Third, we have shared our $16 billion-plus CapEx plan and our industry-leading rate base compound annual growth rate target of 10%. Now that we are in 2021, we have already started to execute on that growth and remain confident in our ability to complete the work efficiently this year. 
Fourth, as David touched on, both he and I are taking a hard look at our ESG effort. We have multiple work streams underway in 2021 as it relates to transitioning our generation fleet in Indiana to be greener and cleaner, beginning with a filing for the CPCNs for our solar generation component of our IRP this week. We are also looking at expanding our renewable natural gas and green hydrogen pilots to offset the carbon intensity of our gas system. These things are already underway today. We plan to do more, and we plan to deliver an improved ESG-focused strategy in the coming months. 
Last but not least, we will give you an update regarding our gas LDC sale process. 
Looking back at 2020, we had a strong financial performance across our utilities during the quarter and on a full year guidance basis, despite many of the challenges 2020 presented. This only goes to show how fortunate we are that we operate in such high-growth constructive regulatory jurisdictions. 
As shown on Slide 4, for the quarter our diluted earnings per share was $0.27. Guidance basis EPS was $0.29, a good margin above analyst estimates. We delivered $0.22 of guidance basis utility EPS for the quarter. 
Full year 2020 guidance basis utility EPS comes in at $1.17 per share. We ended the year with $1.40 of guidance basis consolidated EPS versus a loss of $1.79 per share on a GAAP basis, primarily due to midstream-related impairments recorded earlier in the year. 
Looking at Slide 5, you can see our primary drivers for the fourth quarter and year-end results. The notable drivers are net customer growth and rate relief as well as disciplined O&M management. The unfavorable impact was largely driven by share dilution due to the large equity issuance back in May 2020. 
Before we take a look at 2021, I want to cover our recent announcement with respect to our investment in Enable. Turning to Slide 6, I want to emphasize that the announced merger between Energy Transfer and Enable now puts us firmly on a path to deliver on our promise to minimize our exposure to midstream. What's better is that through this transaction, we will reduce the risk of our future distributions and improve our business risk profile due to Energy Transfer's scale and desirable portfolio of long-term take-or-pay contracts. Once we terminate our partnership agreement with OG&E upon consummation of the transaction, we will also gain increased autonomy to exit our midstream investment with better economics and at a faster pace, given the enhanced liquidity. 
We want to be thoughtful on how best to maximize the value of our interest in Energy Transfer, so we're not providing a time frame for exiting our exposure to midstream. But as Dave has mentioned, we will continue to use a disciplined approach, and we will move at a pace that we believe our shareholders will appreciate. 
Going forward, we are moving towards having almost 100% of our earnings come from our regulated businesses. And we continue to feel confident in our ability to maintain our 6% to 8% guidance basis utility EPS growth target and the 10% rate base growth target we've shared before. 
Now it's time to look forward to 2021. We continue to see 2021 as a transition year as we move to a more fully regulated utility. Accordingly, we will continue to provide guidance for and focus on our utility segment to provide clarity around the long-term earnings power of the company. The main value drivers remain our impressive customer growth, our enhanced capital investment plan, and the hard work we're putting in to build around that O&M discipline. With those 3 things, we believe our plan can weather the ups and downs, as we've illustrated with our 2020 results. 
In fact, our O&M discipline in 2020 allowed us to accelerate some incremental work on our gas and electric systems, which allows us to increase our guidance basis utility EPS range to $1.24 to $1.26, as you can see on Slide 7. Due to the fact that Enable has suspended initiating earnings guidance as well as the announced transaction between Enable and energy transfer, we are not in a position to provide guidance for the midstream segment at this time. 
As a reminder, for the midstream segment, we will continue to record our share of Enable's earnings as well as the basis difference accretion, earnings from the Enable preferred distributions net of the associated amount of debt, interest on the midstream note, and an allocation of corporate overhead based on midstream's relative earnings contribution until the transaction closes. The transaction will be accounted for as a gain on sale of our investment in Enable, and our investment in Energy Transfer will be recorded at fair value, resulting in a net gain on the sale. Upon closing of the Enable transaction with Energy Transfer, our investment in Energy Transfer common units will be accounted for at fair value going forward. 
Once we achieve more clarity following a transaction close, we will establish guidance for the midstream segment based on the distributions from our Energy Transfer investments and the debt and corporate allocations previously described as a component of our midstream investment. We will exclude mark-to-market gains or losses recorded for the Energy Transfer investments similar to the way that we treat our ZENs investments today. 
To give you a sense of what we're looking at on a GAAP versus guidance basis for 2021 EPS, I want to highlight some of the big adjustments related to the execution of our strategic plan this year. First, upon consummation of the transaction between Enable and Energy Transfer, we anticipate recording a large onetime gain net of transaction costs on the exchange of our Enable common units for Energy Transfer common units as we recognize the investment at fair value, eliminating the basis differential we previously recorded. 
Second, we anticipate recording a large onetime gain on the sale of our gas LDC businesses. Again, this gain will include the costs of the transaction. 
Finally, in January 2021 we recorded a $26 million loss on the early redemption of 250 million of 3.85% senior notes maturing in 2024. The redemption is consistent with our liability management goals. 
These are big steps we are taking in this transition year to reposition CenterPoint as a premium regulated utility. We will also continue to exclude from our guidance basis results mark-to-market gains or losses on ZENS and Energy Transfer securities as well as costs to achieve the integration of [BREC]. 
Before I go through our financing plan for the year, I want to briefly touch upon the impacts of the recent winter storm on our financials. And like Dave, I want to express my personal sympathy for those affected. 
When we think about liquidity and credit metrics near term, we have to address the recent 2021 February  storm event that affected customers in many jurisdictions, especially here in Texas. There is no denying that the tightening in the natural gas market led to a surge in gas prices for our gas LDCs during those few days. Let me be clear, though, we believe costs to be fully recoverable for CenterPoint.
Turning to Slide 8. At this time, there is about $2.5 billion of total incremental gas purchasing costs that we incurred last week. But this is pretty well spread across our various service territories, except for perhaps our hardest-hit Texas territory. We are already in touch with regulators and are working on a path towards timely recovery of these costs, but also understanding that we need to be sensitive to the burdens that our customers are incurring during these difficult times. 
Recently, the Texas Railroad Commission issued an order allowing utilities to record any extraordinary expenses related to the winter storm event as a regulatory asset and confirming that we may seek future recovery of these extraordinary costs. Following that order, we are already in conversations to explore recovery options with the Texas Railroad Commission and regulators and other impacted jurisdictions. We are confident in our actions as we fulfill our duty to serve, and our strong regulatory relationships will be highlighted here. 
From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we just received an additional $1.7 billion of short-term financing commitments. This, along with our strong balance sheet, provides a sufficient level of liquidity to support an anticipated increase in our near-term working capital needs due to the February storm event. We expect cost recovery to begin in the third quarter of 2021 following the normal recovery time lines, and only a very modest impact to interest expense as a number of our jurisdictions provide for recovery of the financing costs associated with unrecoverable balances. 
Moving on to our financing plan on Slide 9. We remain disciplined on the balance sheet and in addressing our near-term maturities. Earlier this month, we completed a refinancing of our revolving credit facilities and extended the maturity to February 2024. In addition, we have some near-term 2021 maturities at CEHE and at the parent that we will actively address over the coming months. 
Our liquidity remains strong with liquidity of $2.1 billion as of February 22 and before our recently received commitments on an additional short-term financing of $1.7 billion. We continue to engage with our rating agencies and discuss the key credit enhancing actions taken in 2020 and our progress on strategic initiatives, such as our recent announcement with our Enable investment. 
With the announcement of the pending merger between Enable and Energy Transfer, Fitch and S&P have acknowledged our improved business risk profile by revising CenterPoint's credit outlook from negative to stable. Fitch also upgraded the rating at CERC from BBB+ to A-. 
As it relates to equity, we've already shared with you our plan, and we plan on sticking to it: only a small direct program here in 2021, an introduction of a modest annual ATM program in 2022. No large block equity is needed. 
Before I conclude, let me provide a brief update regarding the potential sale of our 2 gas LDC businesses in Arkansas and Oklahoma. We continue to be very pleased with the robust level of interest we've received and are even more confident that this is an efficient way for us to recycle capital and invest in our growth accretive utility businesses. We expect to have a transition to announce in early second quarter of this year and complete the transaction by the end of the year. We don't anticipate that the recent winter storm-related events will impact our sale process. The regulatory mechanisms in Arkansas and Oklahoma are strong. And if anything, this event should further highlight the value of these utilities. 
These are the updates. Dave and I believe in the importance of the regular cadence we have with you, and we will continue to share our progress. We know we have a lot more to show you as we move through 2021. And I have every confidence in our team here at CenterPoint that we will deliver on all of our promises. 
Now both Dave and I touched on our commitment to reducing O&M expense while maintaining our focus on safety. As many of you know, this is an area about which Tom Webb is very passionate and in which he is certainly an expert. Tom has been working very closely with our continuous improvement team. So let me turn this over to Tom so he can share with you the work that we have done. I'll be back with you at the end of the call and look forward to answering your questions. Tom?"

Please let me share an example of what operational excellence can do. 
As shown on the right of Slide 10, 2020 provided an early example of our commitment to our customers. Our guidance basis utility EPS outlook was challenged by COVID, weather conditions, unanticipated share dilution, and more. It's all shown in red. 
With a no-excuses commitment in the second half, management embarked on actions to right the ship and meet our guidance. However, coupled with better-than-anticipated economic recovery and good cost reduction performance, we were going to surpass our EPS guidance. This permitted us to put more resources to work back for our customers, our reason for being. 
Not many companies do this. We sweat the details to maximize resources for our customers and for you, our investors. This management team together with empowered, talented employees are executing on a tremendous opportunity to make substantial capital investment for customers. In my opinion, it will result in one of the highest rate base growth clips in the industry. With top-tier organic growth and sector-leading cost reductions, a good portion of this investment will be funded for our customers. 
But do you believe our cost reductions, our net reductions are real? I do. Take a look at Slide 11. In December, we showed you this slide highlighting our 5-year plan, including O&M cost reductions of 1% to 2% a year, $110 million over the next 5 years. We've added a column to show 2021 compared with 2020. It's highlighted in green. 
We plan a fast start with O&M costs down $44 million or about 3%. Some of this is already on cruise control. For example, what we call attrition is simply anticipated turnover of about 150 people, retirements with 1-for-1 replacements with savings of about $25,000 each or $4 million in total. And this assumes that everyone will be replaced. Hm. 
How about enhanced capitalization, merely replacing O&M expenses with smart capital investment where it's appropriate? This reduces cost to our customers, moving from immediate expensing to capital recovery over time. There's no magic here. And further, because we were ahead of plan in 2020, we maximize resources for our customers pulling work ahead from 2021 into 2020. No magic here either. 
Importantly, our continuous improvement work is ramping up during 2021. Even in this ramp-up year, we expect savings of about $15 million. Please don't misunderstand or underestimate the value of continuous improvement. It provides the basics, the building blocks of a safe, reliable, affordable clean and resilient systems. It's process-driven rather than people dependent. I suspect, however, you're thinking if we can reduce costs by 3% in 2021, why can't we do it every year? Especially since we have big savings ahead as we seek to convert from coal to gas to renewables in a couple of years. Hm. 
Clearly, there's a lot of work to do. The team here is capable. The team here is committed to no-excuses performance. We are committed to continuous improvement; process improvement that accelerates safety, reliability, quality, delivery, waste elimination and morale. Process changes simplify how we do our work. 
The costs fall out. They fall out. How? We eliminate human struggle. I'm honored to be a very small part of this world-class approach to delivering for customers and investors. 
Now on that note, for a wrap-up, back to one of the most extraordinary CEOs in our business, Dave."

Enhancing our ESG strategy and becoming a key enabler for a net zero economy in places we operate. Strengthening our balance sheet and credit profile, focusing on Utility Operations and improving the customer experience. Executing our capital recycling strategy. And finally, delivering an economically viable path to minimize the impact of our midstream exposure and then eventually eliminate it.

As you can imagine, there's a lot of dialogue going in Austin even as we speak here. The legislature is in session, so everyone in the political sphere is in Austin at this point in time. 
But I guess as I look back at it from a CenterPoint standpoint, obviously our #1 goal is to serve our customers to the best way we can. 
If you think about last week, clearly for us, more control over some of our assets in our grid would have been a positive. So we're thinking about looking at opportunities, which we of course would have to get through the legislature. Of things like getting batteries and fuel cells and the like actually into our rate base, so we could provide sort of more in territory stability to the grid if anything like this ever happened again. 
So as I said, the gamut of things being discussed in Austin right now is pretty wide. I think everybody is looking for the right solution for the state of Texas so this doesn't happen again. It will be part of that dialogue. 
Jason, do you want to handle the second part of the question?"

I really think that there's a low risk of that, of any financial impact associated with any financial challenges with the generators or retail energy providers.

We also have and do collect from the retail energy providers on a daily basis, and so have a good handle on those that continue to perform with respect to their obligations. 
And maybe the final point that I would highlight is that to the extent that any of the large generators or retail energy providers experience financial challenge, it will likely be a reorganization event. And one of the first areas of focus in the first day motions of any reorganization would be the continuity of business that will allow the retail energy providers to continue to pay the associated T&D charges. And so in short, we see this as a really low-risk issue for the company."

And that's balancing the financial health of the utilities with the impact of collecting this on customer bills. I think we've seen some very strong signals come out of the various jurisdictions we have the privilege to operate in. As I highlighted, the Texas Railroad Commission made it clear that these are recoverable costs. 
And so I think what we are all doing, and I use that term sort of broadly because this is not a CenterPoint issue but a gas LDC issue, is we're working to find and strike that right balance of short-term recovery of these costs, while not unnecessarily burdening the impact to customer bills. More work needs to be done. Hearings are underway this week, but I am confident we will strike that right balance here."

And so as you think about sort of both the tax bill as well as the allocated debt that we have to the midstream segment, we are timing our exit from midstream, so that as Dave pointed out, we are not impacting our utility segment. 
That 50% sort of rule of thumb for the tax component of the Enable sales is what I would consider to be a status quo rule of thumb. We are working on various tax strategies to help improve that position. In addition, whatever remaining debt that exists after disposition of those units, paydown of the associated tax, paydown of the associated debt, we believe we have sufficient O&M levers to offset.

I think there has been a lot of dialogue across the state about a lot of the reason the generation went down is because it was not properly winterized. And that includes both the sort of wind, solar and gas generators. But in fact at one point, the big nuclear plant also went down at one point last week. 
As you know, the state's sort of electric grid is constructed for sort of peak summer air conditioning time. And therefore, this concept of winterizing your equipment, winterizing the generators, it's going to be difficult to do. Because obviously by closing them and insulating them and winterizing them, it means you just put more stress on it during the summer when it's really hot. 
So I think there are ways to do it. And companies are going to have to find ways to do it because I suspect that's one of the things that's going to come out of Austin from a regulatory standpoint. 
But specifically to your question, we actually have winterized our equipment. It really protected it from both the hot and the cold weather. But there are some incremental opportunities for us to do certain things, really more as a resiliency and hardening our system standpoint. I wouldn't think of it as winterizing it. It's more or less hardening and making the system more resilient. 
And of course, we'll be able to get that into rate base. And I would view it as sort of a slight potential increment to our capital spend."

Jason is the third CFO within a year. We had issues around dividend. We had the activist investor in us. We had COVID. We had a hurricane that skirted us last summer. 
And I would say that I think people are really bought into the new CenterPoint. And certainly in my engagement with, and I think I can speak more broadly for our executive team, their people are motivated. They like what's happening. They did not like what happened early last year. 
And so I think they see a really happening company, a management team that is taking the organization in the right way. They're excited about it. They understand that everybody has a part to play. 
And I think the other thing is a focus on O&M isn't always a focus on people reduction. As Tom has said, it's a focus on doing things better. It's getting your vendors to participate with you in doing things more efficiently, buying things cheaper and that kind of thing. 
So I think at the end of the day, morale is really, really good here. And I expect it to even get better."

And good morning to everyone. During our Investor Day this past December, we unveiled our strategy to take advantage of our organic growth and increased capital spending opportunities",2363,"Thank you, Phil, and I want to welcome you to our CenterPoint team.  
And good morning to everyone. During our Investor Day this past December, we unveiled our strategy to take advantage of our organic growth and increased capital spending opportunities to deliver consistent earnings growth, offer industry-leading rate base growth, reduce costs to invest in the future, take a leading stance on ESG, and minimize our exposure to the midstream. We focus on core Utility Operations and most importantly, continue to provide a resilient grid for our customers. We are excited to share our significant progress against those objectives with you today.  
Before we start, I want to update you on the impacts of last week's devastating winter storm event that struck Texas in our broader service territories. It was undoubtedly an extremely difficult week across our service territories, especially for Texans. We know many of our customers faced very difficult conditions, and our hearts go out to those in our communities who have faced substantial hardship and loss. I am really proud of how our employees worked in very harsh conditions to help customers, even as their own homes and families were without power or experiencing damage from busted pipes.  
As you know, I like to lead things off with headlines. So let me give you the storm headlines. First and foremost, our CenterPoint electric and gas systems worked as designed and proved to be very resilient despite the impact of ice, snow, freezing temperatures and the fluctuating power loads provided to us by ERCOT during the week. All of these factors are tough on equipment, but our system did its job and was able to be quickly reenergized.  
Our decision to increase utilities' earnings guidance is an expression of our confidence that the storm will not impact our 6% to 8% utility EPS annual growth rate and our ability to ramp up our capital spending efforts and grow our rate base at a 10% compound annual growth rate. As you know, in Texas we are not a generator of electricity and are dependent on a power supply dispatched to us by the ERCOT system. Once we finally received adequate power from third-party generators to transmit and distribute across our service territory, the resiliency of our system proved itself in over 98% of our 2.6 million electric customers had electricity within about 12 hours. I believe that's pretty amazing, and I'm very proud of our employees that worked tirelessly.  
Our gas system was equally tested and proved resilient as the storm and cold weather simultaneously impacted our 8-state gas footprint, including very cold temperatures in Minnesota. And despite a constant search for gas supply, we kept our line pressures up and were able to serve our customers throughout the system.  
We saw natural gas price spiking very high throughout our system and electric pricing getting very high in Texas. In all of our gas jurisdictions, we are fortunate to have regulatory mechanisms already in place and additional tools now at our disposal to recover these costs in a timely manner and to mitigate impacts to our customers' bills.  
As you well know, our electric business transmits and distributes power. In our markets, the local retail electric providers, or REPs, are responsible for purchasing electricity and take on the inherent risk of power pricing, customer billing and collecting. If an REP was to cease to operate, you should know and be confident that the existing regulatory mechanisms allow for us to recover any cost exposure we might have due to bad debt expense. These events once again point out the benefit we have of operating in states that have favorable and supportive regulatory processes.  
More importantly for our investors, we will not have to seek any incremental equity to handle our increased storm-related liquidity needs. As we have mentioned many times, we are fortunate to work in constructive regulatory jurisdictions and fully expect these costs to be recoverable in a timely manner. And in many of our jurisdictions where these costs are the largest, we already have the ability to recover some carrying costs. We are in the process of working with all of our regulators on that.  
From an overall financial standpoint, we expect to incur incremental spend in 2021 related to the February winter storm, including additional operational expenses and purchased gas costs. At this time, we expect the total amount of incremental gas purchase costs to be about $2.5 billion spread across all of our jurisdictions. Jason will speak in further detail about this. But before anyone becomes concerned, I want to remind everyone that we believe we have ample liquidity from our credit facilities, particularly given our recently announced committed short-term financing that will help bridge our near-term working capital needs as well as strong capital markets access and strong and timely recovery mechanisms. Therefore to put your minds at ease, while we don't expect direct impact of the storm event on our guidance based utility EPS range, we will incur modest additional interest expense related to some of these excess costs until they can be recovered. We view this more as an addressable working capital management challenge, which we will manage our way through. As we have emphasized, we will sweat the details, so you don't have to. This is a perfect example of where that comes into play.  
Finally, I've been asked by the mayor of Houston to head up the fundraising for families of Houstonians who may need additional help to recover from this storm, especially around home repairs and basic needs. CenterPoint was proud to provide the lead contribution to this fund, and I look forward to working in my capacity as Chair of the effort to build upon this contribution, and I thank the mayor for the trust and confidence he has placed in me, the company and our employees by asking us to lead this important endeavor.  
Now let's move on to the results of our business. This call is also an opportunity for us to demonstrate to you that we are in fact now executing on the key objectives that we outlined during our December 7 Investor Day. I will review the underlying elements of our core plan and share with you how we are  making meaningful inroads in each functional area.  
Let me start with the next set of headlines we are presenting to you today. We delivered $0.29 per share for the fourth quarter and $1.40 per share for the year on a guidance basis, beating consensus in our previous guidance. More importantly, even factoring in the disruptions to our operations last week, we are raising our 2021 guidance based utility EPS range to $1.24 to $1.26. This will now be the new and higher baseline for our future 6% to 8% guidance growth target.  
We are, of course, also maintaining our $16 billion-plus capital spend program and 10% compound annual rate base growth. Our gas LDC sales process is on track, and we are moving to minimize our midstream exposure. So as you can see, we have been very busy since our Investor Day.  
Turning to Enable. Let me tell you how excited I was about the announcement of the transaction between Enable and Energy Transfer on February 17. We said to you on our Investor Day that we are absolutely focused on reducing and eventually eliminating our midstream exposure through a disciplined financial approach, all done in a thoughtful way with the objective to optimize the long-term benefit to our shareholders. We followed that approach and now have a transaction that we expect to achieve the following: an accelerated path towards a fully regulated utility business model, improvement in our business risk profile by having our midstream investment anchored to a larger, more diversified entity; exchanging our interest into a more liquid security, which will facilitate an accelerated exit; increased autonomy through the dissolution of the Enable partnership, giving us flexibility to make decisions about our exit strategy. And of course, it reduces risk to distributions while we wind down our position.  
As to our exit strategy, we intend to exit in an accelerated but highly managed and sophisticated way that will not disrupt the trading of Energy Transfer.  
Jason will talk to you more about the transaction itself. But I want to say to you loud and clear, so there is no confusion or concern about it. This transaction will have 0 impact on our broader strategic goals. In fact, we believe it supports our guidance and rate base growth targets and our higher 2021 guidance based utility EPS range.  
As I stated previously, we will continue to expect no additional equity issuance in 2021 beyond the DRIP process we described in our Investor Day. The fact that we will have to absorb increased corporate allocations and the costs associated with the debt currently allocated to Enable as we reduce our midstream exposure are just headwinds to manage. Managing these Enable-related headwinds were anticipated and have been in our thinking all along. We clearly will not back away from the financial goals we have shared with you because of these headwinds.
We sweat the details so you don't have to. Does that sound familiar? It should be as it applies here too.  
Since we last talked, I am excited that we have added 2 high-caliber financial leaders to our team. Stacey Peterson now leads our treasury, financial planning and analysis efforts. And Phil Holder, from whom you heard earlier, now leads our Strategic Planning and Investor Relations teams. Our entire executive team is hard at work to deliver on our stated objectives, which begins with industry leading robust organic growth and continues with disciplined operations and financial management. 
In addition to our industry-leading organic growth, our management team is committed to making CenterPoint the utility industry leader in ESG and environmental stewardship. During our Investor Day, we elaborated on the beginnings of our carbon reduction strategy with our coal retirements in Indiana as well as adding renewable and green hydrogen initiatives across our LDC service territories. Let me share our early thinking on CenterPoint's role in a net zero economy.  
First, we are focused on reducing the carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet in Indiana, work that is already well underway and supported by our filing for the CPCNs for the solar elements of our IRP plants earlier this week. 
Secondly, we are focused on minimizing our emissions from our core operations by adopting electric vehicles for our fleet, utilizing state-of-the-art technology to detect and eliminate methane emissions from leaks on our gas system, and by embracing energy efficiency in the buildings we own. Third, we are focused on reducing the carbon intensity of the gas we supply our customers and continue to evaluate ways to expand our renewable natural gas and green hydrogen pilots. Fourth, we are focused on enabling carbon reduction of others, either through connecting new renewable energy sources to our grid in Texas, facilitating the adoption of electric vehicles, or helping customers adopt higher efficiency standards.  
We understand the importance of reducing our carbon footprint, as evidenced by the adoption of our carbon policy last year. Recognizing that there is still more work to do, we plan to release an enhanced ESG plan later this year.  
I want to thank you all for spending your time with CenterPoint today. And before I hand it over to Jason, let me reiterate what it means to be invested in CenterPoint and why we are a uniquely attractive value proposition.  
Number one, we are moving toward a fully regulated business with fantastic utilities in highly attractive jurisdictions. Our utilities have the potential to deliver to you robust rate base and earnings growth relative to other opportunities that you have in the sector.  
Two, we are committed to keeping our service affordable for our customers by reducing O&M expense and continuously improving our processes to create the necessary headroom to support our robust organic utility growth while remaining focused on our commitment to safety. Tom Webb, whose expertise on that we have enjoyed over the past months, will be joining us shortly and share what work we have done so far.  
Number three, we are focused on delivering consistently on our industry-leading earnings growth. We don't want you to have surprises or elements you don't understand as you evaluate our business.  
Number four, we have promised you that we will take steps to minimize our midstream exposure and are now on a clear path to deliver on that. I want to emphasize what a big step this is for us. We are working toward a point where midstream is no longer a topic of these calls. Then we can all solely focus on what a great utility business we have. Trust that we will continue to work on that.  
Number five, we are proactively working to strengthen our relationship with our regulators. We are committed to doing right by our customers, so that our regulators can rest easy. I have personally visited most of our regulators during my short tenure as CEO and plan to engage with all of them on a regular basis. We are privileged to serve under some of the most constructive regulatory authorities in the country, and we are working tirelessly to maintain those relationships.  
Number six, we are committed to balance sheet efficiency and high credit quality. We will continue to work to recycle capital efficiently, as we are doing with our gas LDC sales to further support our organic growth from a credit and financial perspective. We are working to simplify our balance sheet and continue to improve our credit profile over time. Just recently, S&P and Fitch's decision to remove CenterPoint from negative watch confirmed that we are headed down the right path, and we are not going to stop there.  
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Jason, so he can talk to you about our financial results and provide more detail on what I have outlined. I will be back at the end to share my closing comments and to answer your questions. Jason?"

As Dave pointed out, we shared many goals with you on our Investor Day, and our team here is laser-focused on delivering on them despite what",2284,"Thank you, Dave. And thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call. 
As Dave pointed out, we shared many goals with you on our Investor Day, and our team here is laser-focused on delivering on them despite what is thrown our way. The winter storm this past week challenged the communities we have the privilege to serve in extraordinary ways. Our thoughts remain with our customers as they recover from the impact of the storm. But I want to add, I too am proud of how our teams responded to the call for action, the resiliency of our gas and electric systems during the storm, and our ability to continue to deliver on our commitments to you, our shareholders, during these extraordinary events. 
Let me get started with our key takeaways from today's call, starting on Slide 3. First, we are pleased to report that for both the fourth quarter and the full year results for 2020, we beat both consensus and our most recent guidance. Given our ability to also pull forward some additional work into 2020, we have the confidence in increasing our guidance basis utility EPS range for 2021 to $1.24 to $1.26. This will be the basis for our consistent 6% to 8% guidance basis utility EPS growth year after year, like we've committed to you. 
Second, we have recently shared that Enable has entered into a merger agreement with Energy Transfer that would result in Energy Transfer acquiring Enable upon the closing of the transaction, including all of CenterPoint's interest in Enable. That's a big step towards CenterPoint's promise to minimize our midstream exposure, and I'll talk more about this in a little bit. 
Third, we have shared our $16 billion-plus CapEx plan and our industry-leading rate base compound annual growth rate target of 10%. Now that we are in 2021, we have already started to execute on that growth and remain confident in our ability to complete the work efficiently this year. 
Fourth, as David touched on, both he and I are taking a hard look at our ESG effort. We have multiple work streams underway in 2021 as it relates to transitioning our generation fleet in Indiana to be greener and cleaner, beginning with a filing for the CPCNs for our solar generation component of our IRP this week. We are also looking at expanding our renewable natural gas and green hydrogen pilots to offset the carbon intensity of our gas system. These things are already underway today. We plan to do more, and we plan to deliver an improved ESG-focused strategy in the coming months. 
Last but not least, we will give you an update regarding our gas LDC sale process. 
Looking back at 2020, we had a strong financial performance across our utilities during the quarter and on a full year guidance basis, despite many of the challenges 2020 presented. This only goes to show how fortunate we are that we operate in such high-growth constructive regulatory jurisdictions. 
As shown on Slide 4, for the quarter our diluted earnings per share was $0.27. Guidance basis EPS was $0.29, a good margin above analyst estimates. We delivered $0.22 of guidance basis utility EPS for the quarter. 
Full year 2020 guidance basis utility EPS comes in at $1.17 per share. We ended the year with $1.40 of guidance basis consolidated EPS versus a loss of $1.79 per share on a GAAP basis, primarily due to midstream-related impairments recorded earlier in the year. 
Looking at Slide 5, you can see our primary drivers for the fourth quarter and year-end results. The notable drivers are net customer growth and rate relief as well as disciplined O&M management. The unfavorable impact was largely driven by share dilution due to the large equity issuance back in May 2020. 
Before we take a look at 2021, I want to cover our recent announcement with respect to our investment in Enable. Turning to Slide 6, I want to emphasize that the announced merger between Energy Transfer and Enable now puts us firmly on a path to deliver on our promise to minimize our exposure to midstream. What's better is that through this transaction, we will reduce the risk of our future distributions and improve our business risk profile due to Energy Transfer's scale and desirable portfolio of long-term take-or-pay contracts. Once we terminate our partnership agreement with OGE upon consummation of the transaction, we will also gain increased autonomy to exit our midstream investment with better economics and at a faster pace, given the enhanced liquidity. 
We want to be thoughtful on how best to maximize the value of our interest in Energy Transfer, so we're not providing a time frame for exiting our exposure to midstream. But as Dave has mentioned, we will continue to use a disciplined approach, and we will move at a pace that we believe our shareholders will appreciate. 
Going forward, we are moving towards having almost 100% of our earnings come from our regulated businesses. And we continue to feel confident in our ability to maintain our 6% to 8% guidance basis utility EPS growth target and the 10% rate base growth target we've shared before. 
Now it's time to look forward to 2021. We continue to see 2021 as a transition year as we move to a more fully regulated utility. Accordingly, we will continue to provide guidance for and focus on our utility segment to provide clarity around the long-term earnings power of the company. The main value drivers remain our impressive customer growth, our enhanced capital investment plan, and the hard work we're putting in to build around that O&M discipline. With those 3 things, we believe our plan can weather the ups and downs, as we've illustrated with our 2020 results. 
In fact, our O&M discipline in 2020 allowed us to accelerate some incremental work on our gas and electric systems, which allows us to increase our guidance basis utility EPS range to $1.24 to $1.26, as you can see on Slide 7. Due to the fact that Enable has suspended initiating earnings guidance as well as the announced transaction between Enable and Energy Transfer, we are not in a position to provide guidance for the midstream segment at this time. 
As a reminder, for the midstream segment, we will continue to record our share of Enable's earnings as well as the basis difference accretion, earnings from the Enable preferred distributions net of the associated amount of debt, interest on the midstream note, and an allocation of corporate overhead based on midstream's relative earnings contribution until the transaction closes. The transaction will be accounted for as a gain on sale of our investment in Enable, and our investment in Energy Transfer will be recorded at fair value, resulting in a net gain on the sale. Upon closing of the Enable transaction with Energy Transfer, our investment in Energy Transfer common units will be accounted for at fair value going forward. 
Once we achieve more clarity following a transaction close, we will establish guidance for the midstream segment based on the distributions from our Energy Transfer investments and the debt and corporate allocations previously described as a component of our midstream investment. We will exclude mark-to-market gains or losses recorded for the Energy Transfer investments similar to the way that we treat our ZENS investments today. 
To give you a sense of what we're looking at on a GAAP versus guidance basis for 2021 EPS, I want to highlight some of the big adjustments related to the execution of our strategic plan this year: first, upon consummation of the transaction between Enable and Energy Transfer, we anticipate recording a large onetime gain net of transaction costs on the exchange of our Enable common units for Energy Transfer common units as we recognize the investment at fair value, eliminating the basis differential we previously recorded. 
Second, we anticipate recording a large onetime gain on the sale of our gas LDC businesses. Again, this gain will include the costs of the transaction. 
Finally, in January 2021 we recorded a $26 million loss on the early redemption of 250 million of 3.85% senior notes maturing in 2024. The redemption is consistent with our liability management goals. 
These are big steps we are taking in this transition year to reposition CenterPoint as a premium regulated utility. We will also continue to exclude from our guidance basis results mark-to-market gains or losses on ZENS and Energy Transfer securities as well as costs to achieve the integration of Vectren.
Before I go through our financing plan for the year, I want to briefly touch upon the impacts of the recent winter storm on our financials. And like Dave, I want to express my personal sympathy for those affected. 
When we think about liquidity and credit metrics near term, we have to address the recent 2021 February storm event that affected customers in many jurisdictions, especially here in Texas. There is no denying that the tightening in the natural gas market led to a surge in gas prices for our gas LDCs during those few days. Let me be clear, though, we believe these costs to be fully recoverable for CenterPoint.
Turning to Slide 8. At this time, there is about $2.5 billion of total incremental gas purchasing costs that we incurred last week. But this is pretty well spread across our various service territories, except for perhaps our hardest-hit Texas territory. We are already in touch with regulators and are working on a path towards timely recovery of these costs, but also understanding that we need to be sensitive to the burdens that our customers are incurring during these difficult times. 
Recently, the Texas Railroad Commission issued an order allowing utilities to record any extraordinary expenses related to the winter storm event as a regulatory asset and confirming that we may seek future recovery of these extraordinary costs. Following that order, we are already in conversations to explore recovery options with the Texas Railroad Commission and regulators and other impacted jurisdictions. We are confident in our actions as we fulfill our duty to serve, and our strong regulatory relationships will be highlighted here. 
From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we just received an additional $1.7 billion of short-term financing commitments. This, along with our strong balance sheet, provides a sufficient level of liquidity to support an anticipated increase in our near-term working capital needs due to the February storm event. We expect cost recovery to begin in the third quarter of 2021 following the normal recovery time lines, and only a very modest impact to interest expense as a number of our jurisdictions provide for recovery of the financing costs associated with unrecoverable balances. 
Moving on to our financing plan on Slide 9. We remain disciplined on the balance sheet and in addressing our near-term maturities. Earlier this month, we completed a refinancing of our revolving credit facilities and extended the maturity to February 2024. In addition, we have some near-term 2021 maturities at CEHE and at the parent that we will actively address over the coming months. 
Our liquidity remains strong with liquidity of $2.1 billion as of February 22 and before our recently received commitments on an additional short-term financing of $1.7 billion. We continue to engage with our rating agencies and discuss the key credit enhancing actions taken in 2020 and our progress on strategic initiatives, such as our recent announcement with our Enable investment. 
With the announcement of the pending merger between Enable and Energy Transfer, Fitch and S&P have acknowledged our improved business risk profile by revising CenterPoint's credit outlook from negative to stable. Fitch also upgraded the rating at CERC from BBB+ to A-. 
As it relates to equity, we've already shared with you our plan, and we plan on sticking to it: only a small DRIP program here in 2021, an introduction of a modest annual ATM program in 2022. No large block equity is needed. 
Before I conclude, let me provide a brief update regarding the potential sale of our 2 gas LDC businesses in Arkansas and Oklahoma. We continue to be very pleased with the robust level of interest we've received and are even more confident that this is an efficient way for us to recycle capital and invest in our growth accretive utility businesses. We expect to have a transition to announce in early second quarter of this year and complete the transaction by the end of the year. We don't anticipate that the recent winter storm-related events will impact our sale process. The regulatory mechanisms in Arkansas and Oklahoma are strong. And if anything, this event should further highlight the value of these utilities. 
These are the updates. Dave and I believe in the importance of the regular cadence we have with you, and we will continue to share our progress. We know we have a lot more to show you as we move through 2021. And I have every confidence in our team here at CenterPoint that we will deliver on all of our promises. 
Now both Dave and I touched on our commitment to reducing O&M expense while maintaining our focus on safety.

Please let me share an example of what operational excellence can do. 
As shown on the right of Slide 10, 2020 provided an early example of our commitment to our customers. Our guidance basis utility EPS outlook was challenged by COVID, weather conditions, unanticipated share dilution, and more. It's all shown in red. 
With a no-excuses commitment in the second half, management embarked on actions to right the ship, meet our guidance. However, coupled with better-than-anticipated economic recovery and good cost reduction performance, we were going to surpass our EPS guidance. This permitted us to put more resources to work back for our customers, our reason for being. 
Not many companies do this. We sweat the details to maximize resources for our customers and for you, our investors. This management team together with empowered, talented employees are executing on a tremendous opportunity to make substantial capital investment for customers. In my opinion, it will result in one of the highest rate base growth clips in the industry. With top-tier organic growth and sector-leading cost reductions, a good portion of this investment will be funded for our customers. 
But do you believe our cost reductions, our net reductions are real? I do. Take a look at Slide 11. In December, we showed you this slide highlighting our 5-year plan, including O&M cost reductions of 1% to 2% a year, $110 million over the next 5 years. We've added a column to show 2021 compared with 2020. It's highlighted in green. 
We plan a fast start with O&M costs down $44 million or about 3%. Some of this is already on cruise control. For example, what we call attrition is simply anticipated turnover of about 150 people, retirements with 1-for-1 replacements with savings of about $25,000 each or $4 million in total. And this assumes that everyone will be replaced.
How about enhanced capitalization, merely replacing O&M expenses with smart capital investment where it's appropriate? This reduces cost to our customers, moving from immediate expensing to capital recovery over time. There's no magic here. And further, because we were ahead of plan in 2020, we maximized resources for our customers pulling work ahead from 2021 into 2020. No magic here either. 
Importantly, our continuous improvement work is ramping up during 2021. Even in this ramp-up year, we expect savings of about $15 million. Please don't misunderstand or underestimate the value of continuous improvement. It provides the basics, the building blocks of a safe, reliable, affordable clean and resilient systems. It's process-driven rather than people dependent. I suspect, however, you're thinking if we can reduce costs by 3% in 2021, why can't we do it every year, especially since we have big savings ahead as we seek to convert from coal to gas to renewables in a couple of years. 
Clearly, there's a lot of work to do. The team here is capable. The team here is committed to no-excuses performance. We are committed to continuous improvement; process improvement that accelerates safety, reliability, quality, delivery, waste elimination and morale. Process changes simplify how we do our work. 
The costs fall out. They fall out. How? We eliminate human struggle. I'm honored to be a very small part of this world-class approach to delivering for customers and investors. 
Now on that note, for a wrap-up, back to one of the most extraordinary CEOs in our business, Dave."

Converting our industry-leading customer growth and O&M discipline into outsized rate base and CapEx growth; while maintaining our commitment to safety. Enhancing our ESG strategy and becoming a key enabler for a net zero economy in places we operate. Strengthening our balance sheet and credit profile. Focusing on Utility Operations and improving the customer experience. Executing our capital recycling strategy.

As you can imagine, there's a lot of dialogue going in Austin even as we speak here. The legislature is in session, so everyone in the political sphere is in Austin at this point in time. 
But I guess as I look back at it from a CenterPoint standpoint, obviously our #1 goal is to serve our customers to the best way we can. 
If you think about last week, clearly for us, more control over some of our assets in our grid would have been a positive. So we're thinking about looking at opportunities, which we of course would have to get through the legislature. Of things like getting batteries and fuel cells and the like actually into our rate base, so we could provide sort of more in territory stability to the grid if anything like this ever happened again. 
So as I said, the gamut of things being discussed in Austin right now is pretty wide. I think everybody is looking for the right solution for the state of Texas so this doesn't happen again. It will be part of that dialogue.

We also have and do collect from the retail energy providers on a daily basis, and so have a good handle on those that continue to perform with respect to their obligations. 
And maybe the final point that I would highlight is that to the extent that any of the large generators or retail energy providers experience financial challenge, it will likely be a reorganization event. And one of the first areas of focus in the first day motions of any reorganization would be the continuity of business that will allow the retail energy providers to continue to pay the associated T&D charges. And so in short, we see this as a really low-risk issue for the company."

There will be a short delay upon the close of the transaction for the common units to be registered.

And that's balancing the financial health of the utilities with the impact of collecting this on customer bills. I think we've seen some very strong signals come out of the various jurisdictions we have the privilege to operate in. As I highlighted, the Texas Railroad Commission made it clear that these are recoverable costs. 
And so I think what we are all doing, and I use that term sort of broadly because this is not a CenterPoint issue but a gas LDC issue, is we're working to find and strike that right balance of short-term recovery of these costs, while not unnecessarily burdening the impact on customer bills. More work needs to be done. Hearings are underway this week, but I am confident we will strike that right balance here."

And so as you think about sort of both the tax bill as well as the allocated debt that we have to the midstream segment, we are timing our exit from midstream, so that as Dave pointed out, we are not impacting our utility segment. 
That 50% sort of rule of thumb for the tax component of the Enable sales is what I would consider to be a status quo rule of thumb. We are working on various tax strategies to help improve that position. In addition, whatever remaining debt that exists after disposition of those units, paydown of the associated tax, paydown of the associated debt, we believe we have sufficient O&M levers to offset, which is why we are fully confident that as we exit midstream, we'll be able to do so in a manner that has no impact on our stated 6% to 8% utility growth rate."

I think there has been a lot of dialogue across the state about a lot of the reason the generation went down is because it was not properly winterized. And that includes both the sort of wind, solar and gas generators. But in fact at one point, the big nuclear plant, SPP also went down at one point last week. 
As you know, the state's sort of electric grid is constructed for sort of peak summer air conditioning time. And therefore, this concept of winterizing your equipment, winterizing the generators, it's going to be difficult to do because obviously by enclosing them and insulating them and winterizing them, it means you just put more stress on it during the summer when it's really hot. 
So I think there are ways to do it. And companies are going to have to find ways to do it because I suspect that's one of the things that's going to come out of Austin from a regulatory standpoint. 
But specifically to your question, we actually have winterized our equipment. It really protected it from both the hot and the cold weather. But there are some incremental opportunities for us to do certain things, really more as a resiliency and hardening our system standpoint. I wouldn't think of it as winterizing it. It's more or less hardening and making the system more resilient. 
And of course, we'll be able to get that into rate base. And I would view it as sort of a slight potential increment to our capital spend."

We were very aggressive in our communication last week, putting out sometimes -- always one and sometimes 2 press releases every day trying to inform people about what the state of play was. 
Clearly state-wide, there was a lot of frustration. As you can imagine, there is finger pointing going on. 
But I would say that we did a pretty good job getting out in front of the story. And really essentially what we told our customers is listen, when we get electricity, we will begin to restore it. 
Our system is resilient, which it proved to be. We got power back into the homes of our customers very, very quickly after we got it. And the reality is that this was a sort of a system-wide failure across the state, as has well been written. 
And so as I said earlier, there will be something that comes out of Austin on this. But I think people have done a good job understanding our role in it. That doesn't mean that ultimately some fingers don't get pointed here and there. We'll just have to address those as they come at us."

And so I think they see a really happening company, a management team that is taking the organization in the right way. They're excited about it. They understand that everybody has a part to play. 
And I think the other thing is a focus on O&M isn't always a focus on people reduction. As Tom has said, it's a focus on doing things better. It's getting your vendors to participate with you in doing things more efficiently, buying things cheaper and that kind of thing. 
So I think at the end of the day, morale is really, really good here. And I expect it to even get better."

We are observing a sense of normalcy starting to return here in Texas and in many of our other jurisdictions. Just as important to me is that I look forward to an opportunity to meet you in person and tell you about the amazing things we have accomplished in less than a year and what our strategy entails moving forward. 
I want to share with everyone our excitement about the progress CenterPoint is making and our continued belief in the utility assets that we operate. We believe they are premium assets and want you to believe that too. Today, we will provide an update on the continued disciplined execution of our strategy that we outlined during our Investor Day just 5 short months ago. 
I hope you see that we are developing a track record of being consistent and accountable against the goals that we set. As you know, I'd like to lead with headlines, and we have some worthy ones to cover this quarter. First, we delivered very strong results for the first quarter of 2021, including $0.47 of utility EPS. Because the higher natural gas prices are pass-through costs for our business, they did not impact this quarter's utility results. 
In addition, our first quarter results are in line with recent historical trends in which the first quarter contributed close to 40% of the full year utility EPS. We are, of course, reaffirming our full year utility EPS range for 2021 of $1.24 to $1.26 and our long-term 6% to 8% utility EPS annual growth target. We are off to a great start for the year, so let's check the utility earnings box as being on track. 
The second big headline is, of course, the announced agreement to sell our Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDCs, which is anticipated to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approvals. These are premium assets, and this was demonstrated by the level of interest we saw and, of course, in the price we got for them. 
The landmark valuation was 2.5x 2020 rate base. This outcome was well beyond what even the most optimistic observers thought we would achieve. We saw extraordinary interest from over 40 parties, 17 of which made bids, including strategics, infrastructure funds and PE firms. 
There are a number of key takeaways from this great outcome. First, it validates our strong and stated belief that our remaining gas LDCs are significantly undervalued, and investors should rethink their position as to the value of our remaining gas LDCs in our share price. This also illustrates the strength, viability and value of the broader gas LDC industry. The premium multiple these assets garnered in the marketplace shows that investors continue to see natural gas as an essential fuel that is efficient, valuable and affordable energy source. 
This transaction demonstrates how we can efficiently finance our industry-leading rate base growth. This is a perfect example of the efficient capital recycling strategy we committed to you on our Investor Day. It's a simple model. You sell at 2.5x rate base and invest at 1x rate base. Naturally, this begs the question if we would consider more LDC sales in the future. Currently, we're content with our utility portfolio mix. But that being said, if we see another opportunity to recycle capital in a similarly attractive way, we would explore it as part of our broader strategy. 
Our Investor Day plan highlighted that we had the opportunity to spend an additional $1 billion over our current $16 billion 5-year capital plan. At this price, the LDC transaction will provide us with $300 million of incremental proceeds on an after-tax basis compared to the 5-year plan we showed you on our Analyst Day. We will first look to deploy this $300 million in incremental proceeds into high-value utility capital spend opportunities that are part of those additional $1 billion in capital opportunities. 
This incremental capital spending is likely to be spent in 2022 and begin to flow into earnings in 2023 and allow us to continue to provide reliable, essential services to our customers. Therefore, this transaction will not impact our long-term growth plans or earnings trajectory. On the contrary, we believe this will even more strongly support consistent 6% to 8% utility earnings annual growth rate in our industry-leading 10% rate-based CAGR targets. 
We previously committed to you a 2Q sales announcement, and we delivered on that. So let's also check that box as being done. 
Turning now to the Enable transaction. We anticipate the transaction between Enable and Energy Transfer to close in the second half of the year. We remain absolutely focused on reducing and eliminating our midstream exposure through a disciplined approach. And to reiterate what we said when we announced the news of a transaction back in February, completing this transaction also will not change our 6% to 8% utility EPS annual growth target or our 10% rate base CAGR. So that box stays checked as we remain on track to reduce midstream exposure. 
Turning to the impacts from the winter storm Yuri. Last quarter, many of you questioned the incremental gas costs and the likelihood and timing of recovery. We said that the storms impacts won't change the utility EPS target range and they will not. We also said we believe we had a handle on the issue but needed some time to work through it with our regulators. 
Let me give you an update on what progress we have made on that front. First, in part by actively engaging, auditing and challenging our gas suppliers, we have reduced our incremental gas costs by over $300 million since our initial estimates, resulting in reduced customer incremental gas cost exposure of $2.2 billion. We won't stop pursuing these actions, because we believe this is the right thing to do for our customers. 
We are also beginning to seek the timely recovery of these costs through early adjustments to our normal cost recovery mechanisms. We have started recovery in Arkansas and Louisiana, including some carrying costs. Both Arkansas and Oklahoma have also passed legislation for securitization. 
In Minnesota, we are pursuing recovery of storm-related costs, including some carrying costs due to the existing gas cost recovery mechanism over a 2-year period. And in Texas, a state-sponsored securitization bill on incremental gas cost has already passed through the house and is being considered by the Senate. We believe there is good momentum behind this bill. The gas price recovery process has been well supported politically in each of these jurisdictions, thanks to the constructive nature of our jurisdictions and our legislatures. 
So while not completely behind us, we are getting closer to checking the incremental gas cost box. We have said all along that we have strong regulatory relationships, and that belief is supported by our progress in working through this event. On the electric side, the Texas PUC is undergoing a complete turnover, and we look forward to building our relationships with the new team. There's also been some legislative progress around the proposal to increase grid resiliency in Texas. 
In Texas, several proposed bills have been moving that are intended to protect systems and customers from a repeat of the electric disruption we saw in February. We are very encouraged by the progress, and we see this as an opportunity for the system as a whole to find better ways to serve our community. We remain on course for a $16 billion-plus capital spending program and industry-leading 10% compounded annual rate base growth target over the next 5 years. 
For 2021, we are on track to spend the full $3.4 billion outlined on our Investor Day. Similar to our earnings, there is a seasonality to our capital spend where we typically ramp up spending as the year progresses. As stated previously, we have opportunities above our current $16 billion 5-year plan and the $300 million in incremental proceeds from the ultimate sale of our Arkansas and Oklahoma LDC assets transaction will provide additional capacity for us to pursue some of these, if we so choose. So let's check the capital spending box as being on track. 
We have talked about our industry-leading organic customer growth rates. Despite the impact of COVID, we again saw about 2% growth rates quarter-over-quarter, reinforcing the value of the fast-growing markets that we serve. That organic growth plays a part in keeping our service costs reasonable for our customers. In addition, we take a disciplined approach to reducing our O&M expenses to benefit our customers. We are on track to reduce O&M by 2% to 3% in 2021. However, given the incremental opportunity set we see to reinvest in our business, we may take the decision to reinvest some O&M savings back into our utility assets this year. 
This is a great luxury to have. So for 2021 on O&M, let's check that box as being on track. 
Next up is our commitment to environmental stewardship. We are well underway in developing and then announcing what we believe will be an industry-leading carbon strategy. On that front, a critical constructive piece of news was recently received in Indiana, where we received a very positive Indiana Director's report for our IRP. Though our Indiana IRP does not require approval, the directors report has provided us with the confidence that we are headed down the right renewable path with both regulators and our communities. 
Since our last earnings call, we have reviewed our updated ESG plans with our Board and are preparing a rollout of our transition to net zero. We should be in a place to disclose these exciting plans in the third quarter. Since this is still a work in progress, we cannot check the box here, but I am very happy with the progress that we are making. 
So thank you all for spending your time with CenterPoint this morning. I've been looking forward to these calls every quarter, because we have so many exciting things to share with you as we execute our long-term strategy that we outlined on Investor Day. 
I strongly believe that the strategy we laid out and the progress we have made so far more than demonstrates what a unique value proposition CenterPoint offers. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jason."

Just to echo Dave's sentiment, we're looking forward to seeing more of you in person in 2021. To continue the theme of execution and delivery, I",1511,"Thank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call. Just to echo Dave's sentiment, we're looking forward to seeing more of you in person in 2021. To continue the theme of execution and delivery, I want to start by reviewing our quarterly results with you as well as provide some incremental details on a few events Dave highlighted. 
Let me get started with our first quarter earnings. On a GAAP basis, we reported $0.56 for the first quarter of 2021 compared to a loss of $2.44 for the first quarter of 2020. 
Looking at Slide 4. We reported $0.59 of non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.60 for the first quarter of 2020. Our utility EPS was $0.47 for the first quarter of 2021, while midstream investments contributed another $0.12 of EPS. The notable drivers when comparing the quarters are strong customer growth across all of our jurisdictions and rate recovery, which makes up $0.05 of the favorable impact. 
Our disciplined O&M management contributed another $0.03 of positive variance for the quarter. The growth drivers were partially offset by the $0.09 from share dilution due to the large equity issuance back in May 2020 and $0.03 due to the nonrecurring CARES Act benefit we received last year. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are very pleased with the high level of interest we received for our Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDCs as we've conveyed through the entire process. As Dave said, there were interested parties across the spectrum, which drive a highly competitive auction process. The successful outcome emphasizes the high-quality nature and supportive regulatory frameworks that are present in all of our businesses. We're preparing to commence the regulatory approval process and anticipate a close by the end of the year. The integrated nature of the operations between these 2 jurisdictions will also accelerate the carve-out integration process with the new owners as we work towards closing and will facilitate delivering on our commitment of reducing any remaining allocated O&M. 
As shown on the slide, this transaction priced at $2.15 billion, inclusive of $425 million of incremental gas cost recovery. The $1.725 billion in proceeds, after the natural gas cost recovery, represents a multiple of 2.5x 2020 rate base and a multiple of 38x 2020 earnings for those businesses. 
This earnings multiple is based on the purchase price of $1.725 billion, reduced by approximately $340 million of implied regulatory debt compared to $36 million of 2020 full year earnings. This transaction multiple, consistent with some of the highest multiples paid for gas LDCs, demonstrates that the market continues to see gas LDCs playing a pivotal role in our country's energy supply by providing affordable, efficient and lower carbon energy sources for our customers. 
The net proceeds from this sale are estimated to be $1.3 billion after tax and closing costs as our Arkansas and Oklahoma assets have a relatively low tax basis of approximately $300 million. While there's been a lot of focus on tax leakage, we were clear at our Investor Day that our 5-year plan assumed full tax on the gain on sale for these assets given the low tax basis. Therefore, the headline is the competitive auction process will, at close, result in generating an additional $300 million in after-tax proceeds than what was assumed in the original 5-year plan. 
To zero in on the use of the incremental $300 million of proceeds, we will prioritize funding an increase in our capital investment plan. It is important to note this incremental capital will be deployed in 2022, and as a result, will likely impact 2023 earnings and beyond once the capital has been approved in rate base. 
We will also evaluate using some of the excess proceeds to delay the start of our at-the-market equity program that was originally slated for 2022. We're grateful I have these options. 
I'd also like to reiterate that this disposition will not change our 2021 utility earnings guidance range. It is also important to reiterate Dave's point that the premium multiple achieved through this transaction as well as the performance of the systems through the recent winter storms reinforces that there are many states that see natural gas as a viable low carbon fuel source and the market has been undervaluing these assets. And as renewable fuels continue to advance, our systems will have the proven capabilities to adapt and evolve along with them. 
Turning to Slide 6. Dave discussed that we are still on pace to close the Enable and Energy Transfer merger in the second half of this year, and then we'll look to liquidate our midstream position in a disciplined but efficient manner. As a reminder, we will have $385 million of energy transfer preferred units that we can liquidate at any time after the merger closes. The $200 million of energy transfer common units we will receive in the merger will be registered through a process that will likely take 2 to 3 months after close. 
We will have the flexibility to either dribble those units into the marketplace or sell through up to 5 block offerings. As we've noted in the past, our negative tax bases at Enable will carry over to Energy Transfer units and will result in an effective 50% tax on the sale. As previously discussed, we continue to explore tax mitigation strategies across the company to offset the burden that may come with a common unit sales and continue to have confidence we can reduce the tax leakage. 
As a result, I'd like to reaffirm that the sale of the energy transfer units will not change our utility EPS growth target of 6% to 8% annually. As Dave mentioned, we have actively worked with suppliers, which has, in part, helped to reduce the overall incremental gas costs from the winter storm to $2.2 billion, down from $2.5 billion we signaled last quarter. 
In addition, CenterPoint regulators and legislators have all been working over the past few months to align on cost recovery methods that suit the needs of all of our stakeholders. 
As laid out on Slide 7, we have multiple mechanisms available to us for cost recovery. 2 states have already initiated interim recovery. Another 2 states have enacted a legislation enabling securitization, and Texas has a securitization bill pending. Between the securitization, the sale of the gas LDCs and the interim rate recovery, we now expect between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion of the total incremental gas costs to be recovered before the 1-year anniversary of the storm, assuming the Texas securitization bill is signed into law. 
We are grateful for the diligence of our regulatory team and the constructive support of our commissions across our jurisdictions for getting us to this point. 
Turning to our financing updates. We closed our $1.7 billion CERC senior notes offering on March 2, which included $1 billion of floating rate notes and $700 million of fixed rate notes, both due in 2023. The proceeds for the $1.7 billion issuance were used to pay for the incremental gas costs for the winter storm and the notes have an optional redemption date at any time on or after September 2 of this year, giving us full flexibility to pay down this debt consistent with our regulatory recoveries. 
Recovery of the carrying costs and the majority of the impacted states such as Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma will help offset the incremental interest cost from this debt issuance. 
Our current liquidity remains strong at approximately $2.1 billion after the issuance of the senior notes proceeds and the payments made for the incremental gas costs. Our long-term FFO to debt objective is between 14% and 14.5% and is consistent with the expectations of the rating agencies. We continue to actively engage with them, and they are comfortable with the outlook and thresholds we've indicated. 
I'd like to reiterate, we have no large equity issuance needs over our current planning horizon and can now reevaluate the need for our ATM program in 2022, depending on how we utilize the expected proceeds from our LDC asset sale. I hope it's becoming clear that our story is streamlining nicely as we prove to you, our investors, that we're delivering on our plan as outlined. We are reducing our exposure to nonutility businesses, realigning our balance sheet to reduce our reliance between intercompany borrowings and parent debt and committing to efficiently fund our industry-leading rate base growth. 
These are the updates for the quarter. Both Dave and I are excited about the direction CenterPoint is taking, and we cannot wait to share more good news with you as we continue to execute on our plan throughout 2021 and beyond. 
I'd like to now turn the call over to Tom Webb, our Senior Adviser, to discuss one of the important pieces of our plan through which he has been closely advising us: the O&M cost savings and continuous improvement deliverables here at CenterPoint. Over to you, Tom."

Five months after our strategy-revealing Investor Day, CenterPoint, as you just heard, is well underway executing its strategy. It's dispensing with volatile noncore nonutility businesses, think Enable; implementing efficient financing, think gas LDC sales; introducing clean energy, think coal closures, renewable additions and much more; and improving performance, think continuous improvement, a whole new culture. 
Dave and Jason already have highlighted details about each of these as strategic changes are nearing completion, our premium utility operation is humming. I hope you see it. I hope you feel it. We really sweat the details, so you don't have to. We have superior rate base growth, delivering needed capital investment. 
Our growth rate target of 10% outstrips the peer average of about 7%. Our resulting utility EPS growth target at 6% to 8% every year is well above the peer average of 5%. And our customer growth at 2% is something we would celebrate at my own company with top quartile customer satisfaction, we still seek to hold down customer price increases, reducing our O&M cost by 1% to 2% every year. Coupled with customer growth, this creates a lot of headroom for the needed capital investment. 
On Slide 8, please look at the box on the left. Five months ago, we showed you our 5-year plan to reduce costs 1% to 2% each year. We added the detail for 2021 during our last call. And here, you can see our progress in the first quarter. We plan for a fast start with 2021, down 2% to 3%, with results in the first quarter faster yet. 
Please keep in mind, some of this is timing. We still expect to reduce costs by about 2% to 3% for the year. As you know, one of our tools is our continuous improvement initiative. We improve our processes from the ground up to enhance safety every day; quality, doing things right the first time; delivery, doing things on time; cost, we see and eliminate waste; and morale, higher and higher every day. Yes, morale. Each day, I observe more who are proud to wear the colors. 
Continuous improvement takes time to ramp up. It's a powerful process. It shifts dependence from heroic individual work to better processes that can be repeated. As we succeeded eliminating human struggle, the cost will fall out. My favorite chart is on the right. We take on the headwinds. We take advantage of the tailwinds. We deliver our EPS commitment consistently every year. We really do sweat the details, so you don't have to. 
As I have experienced elsewhere, this management team may do so well on cost reductions that it can pull ahead work from next year, reinvesting savings to benefit our customers sooner. We did this last year. We maximize resources for customers and deliver our commitment to you, our investors. No more, no less, a win-win. 
Dave, Jason and this superb leadership team know the secret sauce. They are working for both our customers and our investors, no ors here. Thank you for letting me play a small role on the team. Back to you, Dave."

With our industry-leading organic customer growth and in our disciplined O&M management, we believe we can generate robust CapEx and 10% rate base growth while continuing our focus on safety. 
We also look forward to unveiling our enhanced ESG strategy that will put us as an industry leader for a net zero economy. We will continue to keep our eyes on maintaining and enhancing our balance sheet and credit profile. We have executed on our capital recycling strategy through our announced gas LDC sale at 2.5x rate base and investing at 1x rate base, and we will continue to explore opportunities to do more of this. 
We remain absolutely committed to delivering an economically viable path to minimize the impact of our midstream exposure and eventually eliminate it. And finally, as we work to move towards a fully regulated business model, we continue to stay focused on our utility operations and improving the experience for our customers. 
I hope you will join us on this path of transitioning CenterPoint into a premium utility. While myself, our team and our employees are only 10 months into this new journey, I could not be more pleased by the momentum we have, what we've accomplished and the bright future we see for CenterPoint. 
What you see is the new CenterPoint, where you can expect consistent and predictable earnings and rate base growth, world-class operations and growing service territories and a commitment to delivering on our promises to you, our investors. We sweat the details, so you don't have to."

At the end of the day, it's probably the most constructive outcome for all stakeholders. It minimizes or reduces the bill impact for customers by spreading the recovery out over a much longer period of time, and it helps keep the debt off the balance sheet of the gas LDCs. And I think the constructive nature of this tool is sort of well understood by all. 
And while we remain optimistic that it will be signed into law, to your point, it is important to note that the Texas Railroad Commission has been very constructive signaling that the gas LDCs will be eligible to recovery -- sorry, will be eligible to recover carrying costs as we look to probably recover these costs over about a 3-year period of time, again, in the event that the securitization bill is not signed into law, but we remain optimistic, as I mentioned.

But I think as we said in our Analyst Day, we have significant capital spend opportunities in our remaining gas LDCs. We like those LDCs. We like the markets that we're in. But if we find an opportunity to look at monetizing them as I indicated, we have an obligation to do so, but we would certainly not do that unless we saw an opportunity to reinvest it back in our business, in our regulated business, something that would have to be accretive to our current 6% to 8% growth rate and really have an impact on the balance sheet. So we're still sort of digesting the level of interest that was there, the price we got. But I can tell you, it is a great place to be right now."

I mean, we clearly, as we've signaled, have $1 billion of capital spend on top of the $16 billion we discussed at our Analyst Day. 
But I always sort of fall back to what is your base strategy. And I said it when I answered the last question, we're not going to do anything that is not accretive to our 6% to 8% growth rate. So I think that sort of signals the timing that we would want to do. We're not going to do anything that impacts the fixing up of our balance sheet and getting to the credit metrics that we want. That would signal, I think, the timing. And it has to be consistent with our strategy of becoming more and more regulated. So I think there is a way to thread that needle. But as I said earlier, we're still digesting the opportunity that has been put in front of us with the price that we got for these LDCs. So give us a chance to digest it, and then we'll see what -- how to take advantage of this great opportunity. It's either going to show up in the share price or we'll look at other options."

Obviously, we're incredibly pleased with the continued performance of the O&M discipline here. The team has really embraced continuous improvement delivered well last year, and that's carrying through our first quarter results. In terms of the enhanced capitalization that's referenced on the slide, I think that's sort of a natural byproduct of the increase in our capital investment plan that we announced as part of the Analyst Day presentation where we signaled $3 billion of incremental capital over the 5-year plan. 
Effectively, that gives us the opportunity to allocate more overhead to capital than expense just given sort of the ratio of capital to O&M. And so I wouldn't fundamentally see that category significantly changing. It might modestly change as we fold some of the capital investment opportunities that Dave has been alluding to in.

There's been a lot of focus on grid resiliency, things like introducing economic criteria for building incremental electric transmission lines, things like making sure that there's greater levels of grid control in the event that there are outages and helping minimize the impact of extended outages to communities. I think to the extent that those bills are passed by the state legislature and signed into law, I think that, that could create incremental capital opportunity for us to redeploy in. And then we continue to look at the coal transition in Indiana as a possibility for owning incremental amounts of renewables as opposed to securing that transition through a power purchase agreement.

That said, as we think about a premium valuation for the company, we think that, that really materializes with consistent delivery on our earnings. And so in years where we maybe accelerate some of the continuous improvement opportunities or we had better-than-expected weather. We will look to reinvest some of that savings back into the business for the benefit of our customers. We think long term, that creates the best possible service for our customers and the path to a premium utility valuation. 
And so as we make progress on O&M and if we are doing better than expected, we will likely, as I said, reinvest that back in the business. As Dave mentioned, the capital investment opportunities, I really think about that as sort of more of a '23 earnings impact, just given the time period between executing that capital and then putting it into rates for recovery.

We are actively working to develop the next round of pilot projects. to make sure that we can efficiently generate the hydrogen we can -- that our system responds well to that introduction. 
We are working with suppliers on the RNG front, and I think the learnings that we have in Minnesota are certainly experiences that we can utilize more broadly in our gas footprint. And so I think that there is certainly more to come with respect to RNG and green hydrogen for the company. And as you said, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity to play a role in the electrification of the transportation sector. 
Thinking about here in Houston, it's obviously the fourth largest city in the U.S., but it is a very commuter-focused city. And so we see the opportunity to help with the build-out of distributed charging networks that will help with the conversion of electric vehicles here in Houston and, for that matter, hopefully up in Evansville. 
And so I don't see these as materially changing kind of our rate base profile in the next couple of years, but the work that we're doing to gain experience, understanding and the support of the regulators, I think, will help support the long-term CapEx plan for the company. So there's certainly a lot more to come on these 2 fronts."

So that when you spend $1, you're spending it wisely, you're spending it on behalf of your customer as you put it into your rate base. 
Second is finding the sort of capital to spend that $1 billion on. The LDC clearly helps there. The O&M savings help there. With sort of the market reaction on the ET sale, with Enable sale to ET, there could be more proceeds there. So I really just want to reiterate something I said earlier, and I hope you're getting a flavor for it here today is we have great capital spending opportunities in front of us, which is why as we sort of accumulate capital maybe above and beyond what we thought we would have in our Analyst Day. To grow the company, we're not forced toward doing M&A. We are going to be able to invest it on a onetime investment basis in our business, in our territories and grow and protect and serve our customers here. 
So as I said a number of times, this is such a great position for us to be in because you throw organic growth on top of all that, that's going to create additional capital spending opportunities.

So 1 classic example would be tax repairs where you have the opportunity to essentially expense or deduct immediately some investments that otherwise would have historically been capitalized. I don't think we are fully taking advantage of that. We are currently in the process of conducting our study to support what would be a higher level of deductions. I'm confident it will result in an increase in available tax deductions for the company, not yet at the point where we're ready to quantify it as the study is not complete. But again, just given the progress that we've made, we're confident that, that will meaningfully help reduce some of the tax burden that you mentioned from the ET sales.

We are observing a sense of normalcy starting to return here in Texas and in many of our other jurisdictions. Just as important to me is that I look forward to an opportunity to meet you in person and tell you about the amazing things we have accomplished in less than a year and what our strategy entails moving forward. 
I want to share with everyone our excitement about the progress CenterPoint is making and our continued belief in the utility assets that we operate. We believe they are premium assets and want you to believe that too. Today, we will provide an update on the continued disciplined execution of our strategy that we outlined during our Investor Day just 5 short months ago. 
I hope you see that we are developing a track record of being consistent and accountable against the goals that we set. As you know, I'd like to lead with headlines, and we have some worthy ones to cover this quarter. First, we delivered very strong results for the first quarter of 2021, including $0.47 of utility EPS. Because the higher natural gas prices are pass-through costs for our business, they did not impact this quarter's utility results. 
In addition, our first quarter results are in line with recent historical trends in which the first quarter contributed close to 40% of the full year utility EPS. We are, of course, reaffirming our full year utility EPS range for 2021 of $1.24 to $1.26 and our long-term 6% to 8% utility EPS annual growth target. We are off to a great start for the year, so let's check the utility earnings box as being on track. 
The second big headline is, of course, the announced agreement to sell our Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDCs, which is anticipated to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approvals. These are premium assets, and this was demonstrated by the level of interest we saw and, of course, in the price we got for them. 
The landmark valuation was 2.5x 2020 rate base. This outcome was well beyond what even the most optimistic observers thought we would achieve. We saw extraordinary interest from over 40 parties, 17 of which made bids, including strategics, infrastructure funds and PE firms. 
There are a number of key takeaways from this great outcome. First, it validates our strong and stated belief that our remaining gas LDCs are significantly undervalued, and investors should rethink their position as to the value of our remaining gas LDCs in our share price. This also illustrates the strength, viability and value of the broader gas LDC industry. The premium multiple these assets garnered in the marketplace shows that investors continue to see natural gas as an essential fuel that is efficient, valuable and affordable energy source. 
This transaction demonstrates how we can efficiently finance our industry-leading rate base growth. This is a perfect example of the efficient capital recycling strategy we committed to you on our Investor Day. It's a simple model. You sell at 2.5x rate base and invest at 1x rate base. Naturally, this begs the question if we would consider more LDC sales in the future. Currently, we're content with our utility portfolio mix. But that being said, if we see another opportunity to recycle capital in a similarly attractive way, we would explore it as part of our broader strategy. 
Our Investor Day plan highlighted that we had the opportunity to spend an additional $1 billion over our current $16 billion 5-year capital plan. At this price, the LDC transaction will provide us with $300 million of incremental proceeds on an after-tax basis compared to the 5-year plan we showed you on our Analyst Day. We will first look to deploy this $300 million in incremental proceeds into high-value utility capital spend opportunities that are part of those additional $1 billion in capital opportunities. 
This incremental capital spending is likely to be spent in 2022 and begin to flow into earnings in 2023 and allow us to continue to provide reliable, essential services to our customers. Therefore, this transaction will not impact our long-term growth plans or earnings trajectory. On the contrary, we believe this will even more strongly support consistent 6% to 8% utility earnings annual growth rate in our industry-leading 10% rate-based CAGR targets. 
We previously committed to you a 2Q sales announcement, and we delivered on that. So let's also check that box as being done. 
Turning now to the Enable transaction. We anticipate the transaction between Enable and Energy Transfer to close in the second half of the year. We remain absolutely focused on reducing and eliminating our midstream exposure through a disciplined approach. And to reiterate what we said when we announced the news of a transaction back in February, completing this transaction also will not change our 6% to 8% utility EPS annual growth target or our 10% rate base CAGR. So that box stays checked as we remain on track to reduce midstream exposure. 
Turning to the impacts from the winter storm, Uri. Last quarter, many of you questioned the incremental gas costs and the likelihood and timing of recovery. We said that the storms impacts won't change the utility EPS target range and they will not. We also said we believe we had a handle on the issue but needed some time to work through it with our regulators. 
Let me give you an update on what progress we have made on that front. First, in part by actively engaging, auditing and challenging our gas suppliers, we have reduced our incremental gas costs by over $300 million since our initial estimates, resulting in reduced customer incremental gas cost exposure of $2.2 billion. We won't stop pursuing these actions, because we believe this is the right thing to do for our customers. 
We are also beginning to seek the timely recovery of these costs through early adjustments to our normal cost recovery mechanisms. We have started recovery in Arkansas and Louisiana, including some carrying costs. Both Arkansas and Oklahoma have also passed legislation for securitization. 
In Minnesota, we are pursuing recovery of storm-related costs, including some carrying costs due to the existing gas cost recovery mechanism over a 2-year period. And in Texas, a state-sponsored securitization bill on incremental gas cost has already passed through the house and is being considered by the Senate. We believe there is good momentum behind this bill. The gas price recovery process has been well supported politically in each of these jurisdictions, thanks to the constructive nature of our jurisdictions and our legislatures. So while not completely behind us, we are getting closer to checking the incremental gas cost box. 
We have said all along that we have strong regulatory relationships, and that belief is supported by our progress in working through this event. On the electric side, the Texas PUC is undergoing a complete turnover, and we look forward to building our relationships with the new team. There's also been some legislative progress around the proposal to increase grid resiliency in Texas. 
In Texas, several proposed bills have been moving that are intended to protect systems and customers from a repeat of the electric disruption we saw in February. We are very encouraged by the progress, and we see this as an opportunity for the system as a whole to find better ways to serve our community. We remain on course for a $16 billion-plus capital spending program and industry-leading 10% compounded annual rate base growth target over the next 5 years. 
For 2021, we are on track to spend the full $3.4 billion outlined on our Investor Day. Similar to our earnings, there is a seasonality to our capital spend where we typically ramp up spending as the year progresses. As stated previously, we have opportunities above our current $16 billion 5-year plan and the $300 million in incremental proceeds from the ultimate sale of our Arkansas and Oklahoma LDC assets transaction will provide additional capacity for us to pursue some of these, if we so choose. So let's check the capital spending box as being on track. 
We have talked about our industry-leading organic customer growth rates. Despite the impact of COVID, we again saw about 2% growth rates quarter-over-quarter, reinforcing the value of the fast-growing markets that we serve. That organic growth plays a part in keeping our service costs reasonable for our customers. In addition, we take a disciplined approach to reducing our O&M expenses to benefit our customers. We are on track to reduce O&M by 2% to 3% in 2021. However, given the incremental opportunity set we see to reinvest in our business, we may take the decision to reinvest some O&M savings back into our utility assets this year. 
This is a great luxury to have. So for 2021 on O&M, let's check that box as being on track. 
Next up is our commitment to environmental stewardship. We are well underway in developing and then announcing what we believe will be an industry-leading carbon strategy. On that front, a critical constructive piece of news was recently received in Indiana, where we received a very positive Indiana Director's report for our IRP. Though our Indiana IRP does not require approval, the directors report has provided us with the confidence that we are headed down the right renewable path with both regulators and our communities. 
Since our last earnings call, we have reviewed our updated ESG plans with our Board and are preparing a rollout of our transition to net zero. We should be in a place to disclose these exciting plans in the third quarter. Since this is still a work in progress, we cannot check the box here, but I am very happy with the progress that we are making. 
So thank you all for spending your time with CenterPoint this morning. I've been looking forward to these calls every quarter, because we have so many exciting things to share with you as we execute our long-term strategy that we outlined on Investor Day. 
I strongly believe that the strategy we laid out and the progress we have made so far more than demonstrates what a unique value proposition CenterPoint offers. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jason."

Just to echo Dave's sentiment, we're looking forward to seeing more of you in person in 2021. To continue the theme of execution and delivery, I",1512,"Thank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call. Just to echo Dave's sentiment, we're looking forward to seeing more of you in person in 2021. To continue the theme of execution and delivery, I want to start by reviewing our quarterly results with you as well as provide some incremental details on a few events Dave highlighted. 
Let me get started with our first quarter earnings. On a GAAP basis, we reported $0.56 for the first quarter of 2021 compared to a loss of $2.44 for the first quarter of 2020. 
Looking at Slide 4. We reported $0.59 of non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.60 for the first quarter of 2020. Our utility EPS was $0.47 for the first quarter of 2021, while midstream investments contributed another $0.12 of EPS. The notable drivers when comparing the quarters are strong customer growth across all of our jurisdictions and rate recovery, which makes up $0.05 of the favorable impact. 
Our disciplined O&M management contributed another $0.03 of positive variance for the quarter. The growth drivers were partially offset by the $0.09 from share dilution due to the large equity issuance back in May 2020 and $0.03 due to the nonrecurring CARES Act benefit we received last year. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are very pleased with the high level of interest we received for our Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDCs as we've conveyed through the entire process. As Dave said, there were interested parties across the spectrum, which drive a highly competitive auction process. The successful outcome emphasizes the high-quality nature and supportive regulatory frameworks that are present in all of our businesses. We're preparing to commence the regulatory approval process and anticipate a close by the end of the year. The integrated nature of the operations between these 2 jurisdictions will also accelerate the carve-out in integration process with the new owners as we work towards closing and will facilitate delivering on our commitment of reducing any remaining allocated O&M. 
As shown on the slide, this transaction priced at $2.15 billion, inclusive of $425 million of incremental gas cost recovery. The $1.725 billion in proceeds, after the natural gas cost recovery, represents a multiple of 2.5x 2020 rate base and a multiple of 38x 2020 earnings for those businesses. 
This earnings multiple is based on the purchase price of $1.725 billion, reduced by approximately $340 million of implied regulatory debt compared to $36 million of 2020 full year earnings. This transaction multiple, consistent with some of the highest multiples paid for gas LDCs, demonstrates that the market continues to see gas LDCs playing a pivotal role in our country's energy supply by providing affordable, efficient and lower carbon energy sources for our customers. 
The net proceeds from this sale are estimated to be $1.3 billion after tax and closing costs as our Arkansas and Oklahoma assets have a relatively low tax basis of approximately $300 million. While there's been a lot of focus on tax leakage, we were clear at our Investor Day that our 5-year plan assumed full tax on the gain on sale for these assets given the low tax basis. Therefore, the headline is the competitive auction process will, at close, result in generating an additional $300 million in after-tax proceeds than what was assumed in the original 5-year plan. 
To zero in on the use of the incremental $300 million of proceeds, we will prioritize funding an increase in our capital investment plan. It is important to note this incremental capital will be deployed in 2022, and as a result, will likely impact 2023 earnings and beyond once the capital has been approved in rate base. 
We will also evaluate using some of the excess proceeds to delay the start of our at-the-market equity program that was originally slated for 2022. We're grateful I have these options. 
I'd also like to reiterate that this disposition will not change our 2021 utility earnings guidance range. It is also important to reiterate Dave's point that the premium multiple achieved through this transaction as well as the performance of the systems through the recent winter storms reinforces that there are many states that see natural gas as a viable low carbon fuel source and the market has been undervaluing these assets. And as renewable fuels continue to advance, our systems will have the proven capabilities to adapt and evolve along with them. 
Turning to Slide 6. Dave discussed that we are still on pace to close the Enable and Energy Transfer merger in the second half of this year, and then we'll look to liquidate our midstream position in a disciplined but efficient manner. As a reminder, we will have $385 million of energy transfer preferred units that we can liquidate at any time after the merger closes. The $200 million of Energy Transfer common units we will receive in the merger will be registered through a process that will likely take 2 to 3 months after close. 
We will have the flexibility to either dribble those units into the marketplace or sell through up to 5 block offerings. As we've noted in the past, our negative tax bases at Enable will carry over to Energy Transfer units and will result in an effective 50% tax on the sale. As previously discussed, we continue to explore tax mitigation strategies across the company to offset the burden that may come with a common unit sales and continue to have confidence we can reduce the tax leakage. 
As a result, I'd like to reaffirm that the sale of the Energy Transfer units will not change our utility EPS growth target of 6% to 8% annually. As Dave mentioned, we have actively worked with suppliers, which has, in part, helped to reduce the overall incremental gas costs from the winter storm to $2.2 billion, down from $2.5 billion we signaled last quarter. 
In addition, CenterPoint regulators and legislators have all been working over the past few months to align on cost recovery methods that suit the needs of all of our stakeholders. 
As laid out on Slide 7, we have multiple mechanisms available to us for cost recovery. 2 states have already initiated interim recovery. Another 2 states have enacted a legislation enabling securitization, and Texas has a securitization bill pending. Between the securitization, the sale of the gas LDCs and the interim rate recovery, we now expect between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion of the total incremental gas costs to be recovered before the 1-year anniversary of the storm, assuming the Texas securitization bill is signed into law. 
We are grateful for the diligence of our regulatory team and the constructive support of our commissions across our jurisdictions for getting us to this point. 
Turning to our financing updates. We closed our $1.7 billion CERC senior notes offering on March 2, which included $1 billion of floating rate notes and $700 million of fixed rate notes, both due in 2023. The proceeds for the $1.7 billion issuance were used to pay for the incremental gas costs for the winter storm and the notes have an optional redemption date at any time on or after September 2 of this year, giving us full flexibility to pay down this debt consistent with our regulatory recoveries. 
Recovery of the carrying costs and the majority of the impacted states such as Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma will help offset the incremental interest cost from this debt issuance. 
Our current liquidity remains strong at approximately $2.1 billion after the issuance of the senior notes proceeds and the payments made for the incremental gas costs. Our long-term FFO to debt objective is between 14% and 14.5% and is consistent with the expectations of the rating agencies. We continue to actively engage with them, and they are comfortable with the outlook and thresholds we've indicated. 
I'd like to reiterate, we have no large equity issuance needs over our current planning horizon and can now reevaluate the need for our ATM program in 2022, depending on how we utilize the expected proceeds from our LDC asset sale. I hope it's becoming clear that our story is streamlining nicely as we prove to you, our investors, that we're delivering on our plan as outlined. We are reducing our exposure to nonutility businesses, realigning our balance sheet to reduce our reliance between intercompany borrowings and parent debt and committing to efficiently fund our industry-leading rate base growth. 
These are the updates for the quarter. Both Dave and I are excited about the direction CenterPoint is taking, and we cannot wait to share more good news with you as we continue to execute on our plan throughout 2021 and beyond. 
I'd like to now turn the call over to Tom Webb, our Senior Adviser, to discuss one of the important pieces of our plan through which he has been closely advising us: the O&M cost savings and continuous improvement deliverables here at CenterPoint. Over to you, Tom."

Five months after our strategy-revealing Investor Day, CenterPoint, as you just heard, is well underway executing its strategy. It's dispensing with volatile noncore nonutility businesses, think Enable; implementing efficient financing, think gas LDC sales; introducing clean energy, think coal closures, renewable additions and much more; and improving performance, think continuous improvement, a whole new culture. 
Dave and Jason already have highlighted details about each of these as strategic changes are nearing completion, our premium utility operation is humming. I hope you see it. I hope you feel it. We really sweat the details, so you don't have to. We have superior rate base growth, delivering needed capital investment. 
Our growth rate target of 10% outstrips the peer average of about 7%. Our resulting utility EPS growth target at 6% to 8% every year is well above the peer average of 5%. And our customer growth at 2% is something we would celebrate at my old company, with top quartile customer satisfaction, we still seek to hold down customer price increases, reducing our O&M cost by 1% to 2% every year. Coupled with customer growth, this creates a lot of headroom for the needed capital investment. 
On Slide 8, please look at the box on the left. Five months ago, we showed you our 5-year plan to reduce costs 1% to 2% each year. We added the detail for 2021 during our last call. And here, you can see our progress in the first quarter. We plan for a fast start with 2021, down 2% to 3%, with results in the first quarter faster yet. 
Please keep in mind, some of this is timing. We still expect to reduce costs by about 2% to 3% for the year. As you know, one of our tools is our continuous improvement initiative. We improve our processes from the ground up to enhance safety every day; quality, doing things right the first time; delivery, doing things on time; cost, we see and eliminate waste; and morale, higher and higher every day. Yes, morale. Each day, I observe more who are proud to wear the colors. 
Continuous improvement takes time to ramp up. It's a powerful process. It shifts dependence from heroic individual work to better processes that can be repeated. As we succeeded eliminating human struggle, the cost will fall out. My favorite chart is on the right. We take on the headwinds. We take advantage of the tailwinds. We deliver our EPS commitment consistently every year. We really do sweat the details, so you don't have to. 
As I have experienced elsewhere, this management team may do so well on cost reductions that it can pull ahead work from next year, reinvesting savings to benefit our customers sooner. We did this last year. We maximize resources for customers and deliver our commitment to you, our investors. No more, no less, a win-win. 
Dave, Jason and this superb leadership team know the secret sauce. They are working for both our customers and our investors, no or's here. Thank you for letting me play a small role on the team. Back to you, Dave."

With our industry-leading organic customer growth and our disciplined O&M management, we believe we can generate robust CapEx and 10% rate base growth while continuing our focus on safety. 
We also look forward to unveiling our enhanced ESG strategy that will put us as an industry leader for a net-zero economy. We will continue to keep our eyes on maintaining and enhancing our balance sheet and credit profile. We have executed on our capital recycling strategy through our announced gas LDC sale at 2.5x rate base and investing at 1x rate base, and we will continue to explore opportunities to do more of this. 
We remain absolutely committed to delivering an economically viable path to minimize the impact of our midstream exposure and eventually eliminate it. And finally, as we work to move towards a fully regulated business model, we continue to stay focused on our utility operations and improving the experience for our customers. 
I hope you will join us on this path of transitioning CenterPoint into a premium utility. While myself, our team and our employees are only 10 months into this new journey, I could not be more pleased by the momentum we have, what we've accomplished and the bright future we see for CenterPoint.

At the end of the day, it's probably the most constructive outcome for all stakeholders. It minimizes or reduces the bill impact for customers by spreading the recovery out over a much longer period of time, and it helps keep the debt off the balance sheet of the gas LDCs. And I think the constructive nature of this tool is sort of well understood by all. 
And while we remain optimistic that it will be signed into law, to your point, it is important to note that the Texas Railroad Commission has been very constructive signaling that the gas LDCs will be eligible to recovery -- sorry, will be eligible to recover carrying costs as we look to probably recover these costs over about a 3-year period of time, again, in the event that the securitization bill is not signed into law, but we remain optimistic, as I mentioned.

But I think as we said in our Analyst Day, we have significant capital spend opportunities in our remaining gas LDCs. We like those LDCs. We like the markets that we're in. But if we find an opportunity to look at monetizing them as I indicated, we have an obligation to do so, but we would certainly not do that unless we saw an opportunity to reinvest it back in our business, in our regulated business, something that would have to be accretive to our current 6% to 8% growth rate and really have an impact on the balance sheet.

I mean, we clearly, as we've signaled, have $1 billion of capital spend on top of the $16 billion we discussed at our Analyst Day. 
But I always sort of fall back to what is your base strategy. And I said it when I answered the last question, we're not going to do anything that is not accretive to our 6% to 8% growth rate. So I think that sort of signals the timing that we would want to do. We're not going to do anything that impacts the fixing up of our balance sheet and getting to the credit metrics that we want. That would signal, I think, the timing. And it has to be consistent with our strategy of becoming more and more regulated. So I think there is a way to thread that needle. 
But as I said earlier, we're still digesting the opportunity that has been put in front of us with the price that we got for these LDCs.

Effectively, that gives us the opportunity to allocate more overhead to capital than expense just given sort of the ratio of capital to O&M.

Obviously, we're pleased with the organic growth opportunities that are present here. We've talked a lot about this $1 billion of incremental capital that we have, but there are, to your point, Steve, other opportunities that may materialize, and as I think the state of Texas here looks at different ways to minimize the risk of a future winter storm. 
There's been a lot of focus on grid resiliency, things like introducing economic criteria for building incremental electric transmission lines, things like making sure that there's greater levels of grid control in the event that there are outages and helping minimize the impact of extended outages to communities. I think to the extent that those bills are passed by the state legislature and signed into law, I think that, that could create incremental capital opportunity for us to redeploy in. And then we continue to look at the coal transition in Indiana as a possibility for owning incremental amounts of renewables as opposed to securing that transition through a power purchase agreement. 
So I think on top of the $1 billion that we've been discussing, we do have the potential for increased capital deployment opportunities."

That said, as we think about a premium valuation for the company, we think that, that really materializes with consistent delivery on our earnings. And so in years where we maybe accelerate some of the continuous improvement opportunities or we had better-than-expected weather. We will look to reinvest some of that savings back into the business for the benefit of our customers. We think long term, that creates the best possible service for our customers and the path to a premium utility valuation. 
And so as we make progress on O&M and if we are doing better than expected, we will likely, as I said, reinvest that back in the business. As Dave mentioned, the capital investment opportunities, I really think about that as sort of more of a '23 earnings impact, just given the time period between executing that capital and then putting it into rates for recovery.

I think on the gas side, we're really fortunate to work in very constructive jurisdictions. We've highlighted our green hydrogen pilot up in Minnesota, the work that we've done on the renewable natural gas tariff. We clearly see that as a start to what is a long-term focus. We are actively working to develop the next round of pilot projects to make sure that we can efficiently generate the hydrogen we can -- that our system responds well to that introduction. 
We are working with suppliers on the RNG front, and I think the learnings that we have in Minnesota are certainly experiences that we can utilize more broadly in our gas footprint. And so I think that there is certainly more to come with respect to RNG and green hydrogen for the company. And as you said, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity to play a role in the electrification of the transportation sector. 
Thinking about here in Houston, it's obviously the fourth largest city in the U.S., but it is a very commuter-focused city. And so we see the opportunity to help with the build-out of distributed charging networks that will help with the conversion of electric vehicles here in Houston and, for that matter, hopefully up in Evansville. 
And so I don't see these as materially changing kind of our rate base profile in the next couple of years, but the work that we're doing to gain experience, understanding and the support of the regulators, I think, will help support the long-term CapEx plan for the company.

So that when you spend $1, you're spending it wisely, you're spending it on behalf of your customer as you put it into your rate base. 
Second is finding the sort of capital to spend that $1 billion on. The LDC clearly helps there. The O&M savings help there. With sort of the market reaction on the ET sale, with Enable sale to ET, there could be more proceeds there. So I really just want to reiterate something I said earlier, and I hope you're getting a flavor for it here today is we have great capital spending opportunities in front of us, which is why as we sort of accumulate capital maybe above and beyond what we thought we would have in our Analyst Day. To grow the company, we're not forced toward doing M&A. We are going to be able to invest it on a onetime investment basis in our business, in our territories and grow and protect and serve our customers here. 
So as I said a number of times, this is such a great position for us to be in because you throw organic growth on top of all that, that's going to create additional capital spending opportunities.

And I think what has become obvious as we've dug into the situation is we have not necessarily availed ourselves of all of the, what I would say, to the common utility deductions. 
So 1 classic example would be tax repairs where you have the opportunity to essentially expense or deduct immediately some investments that otherwise would have historically been capitalized. I don't think we are fully taking advantage of that. We are currently in the process of conducting our study to support what would be a higher level of deductions. I'm confident it will result in an increase in available tax deductions for the company, not yet at the point where we're ready to quantify it as the study is not complete. But again, just given the progress that we've made, we're confident that, that will meaningfully help reduce some of the tax burden that you mentioned from the ET sales.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings call. This call marks my 1-year anniversary as CEO of CenterPoint, and I am excited to update everyone on our results this morning. 
We are now hitting the fast-paced organizational stride I want us to have, and the length of today's prepared remarks will be more in line with the template I want to follow going forward. Now while we are always keen to discuss our great future, we are planning to discuss our exciting longer-term strategy updates at our Analyst Day which will take place on September 23 here in Houston. Though this is our second Analyst Day in less than 12 months, we feel that it is warranted as we are now well into our strategic transition and we want to use that forum to update our investors on our longer-term business plan, earnings capacity, financial metrics and the net zero emissions target that we will be sharing with you. We are also excited for the opportunity to spend more time with you in our hometown here in Houston and to see you in person. 
Let me quickly remind you of just how far we have come in the last year. A year ago, CenterPoint was going through a strategic review at the direction of our Business Review and Evaluation Committee or BREC. The goal of the review was to optimize shareholder value and address specific shareholder concerns. Initially, in my role as Chairman of the BREC, and then later when I became CEO, it was crystal clear to me that while the company had a great asset base and talented employees, we have not unlocked all of our potential, and certainly had not taken full advantage of all of our inherent opportunities. Before the BREC process, CenterPoint was targeting modest EPS growth and had reduced capital spending in our regulated businesses. We had work to do to strengthen our regulatory relationships. The company had previously announced a strategic review of Enable, but had not found an executable opportunity to actually reduce exposure to its midstream investments. This frustrated investors. 
Our O&M expenses were historically growing, and we needed a stronger balance sheet. We had minimal renewables opportunities on our radar screen, and we were in search of a permanent CFO. So yes, the list of challenges was long. I mentioned these not to revisit the adversities our investors and company we're experiencing, but to highlight for you the aggressive speed and approach used by our new team to attack and resolve the challenges and headwinds we faced. Let me quickly recap our progress. By substantially refreshed and diversified our Executive Committee, and we now have what I believe is a best-in-class management team. We announced an updated 5-year strategy that prioritizes investment in our regulated businesses and boosted our planned capital spending by about 25% to $16 billion. We instituted a 10% utility rate base CAGR, well above our peer group average of 8%. That rate base growth then supported an increased long-term utility EPS target growth rate of 6% to 8%, which is also above the consensus peer average of 6%. To efficiently fund our growth while repairing our balance sheet, we announced the sale of our Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDCs at a landmark earnings multiple of 2.5x rate base. We were instrumental in the Enable and Energy Transfer merger which, once closed, will provide us a pathway to eliminate our exposure to midstream. And we announced a commitment to a 1% to 2% annual reduction in O&M over the 5 years to keep our customer rate growth manageable. 
We recently announced changes to our Board leadership to bring our governance structure in line with best practices and shareholder expectations, and we will be announcing a commitment to an industry-leading net zero carbon commitment at our Analyst Day. So in my view, we certainly have walked the talk, and through timely and aggressive actions overcome many of the headwinds we faced. Now it's time for CenterPoint to switch gears. We are going to use the same aggressive approach and organizational speed to take advantage of the tailwinds we have today. Our strong execution, coupled with a privilege to serve some of the fastest-growing regions in our country, have created the foundation for CenterPoint to trade as 1 of the premium utilities in the U.S. Believe me, we are just getting started. 
Our 6-month financial performance in 2021 has been strong. Today, we are raising our 2021 Utility EPS guidance range to $1.25 to $1.27. This 8% growth projection in '21 puts us at the high end of our 6% to 8% Utility EPS annual growth target. And as a reminder, this increase in guidance is after the dilution impact of the 18% increase in our share count that we experienced in 2020. When we compare our Utility EPS growth to analysts' long-term consensus growth for our peers, we are now in the top decile. And as you would expect, we are also reaffirming both our long-term 6% to 8% Utility EPS annual growth target and 10% rate base compound annual growth rate target. This 10% rate base growth also exceeds the average 8% rate base growth of our peer group. 
For the second quarter of 2021, we reported strong results, including $0.28 of Utility EPS compared to $0.18 for the second quarter of 2020. The comparison to Q2 2020 is a bit noisy, and I believe essentially irrelevant as both quarters included a number of one-off items. Q2 2020 results also reflected the impact of COVID on our business. The bottom line for me is to focus on the reality that our Utility EPS is expected to grow 8% this year over last year, and then target 6% to 8% growth from there. Jason will go into more detail on the quarterly results a little later in this call. 
Our O&M continuous improvement programs have strengthened our results for the first 6 months of 2021. We are already on track to save over $40 million in total O&M costs this year alone, while maintaining our focus on safety. This is almost 3% of our annual O&M cost. However, when compared to last year's second quarter, our O&M costs are actually up a bit. Again, this is just more noise that I don't worry about as last year's second quarter O&M costs were artificially depressed by the impact of COVID and disconnect moratoriums. We are still absolutely committed to our continuous improvement cost management efforts in our target of 1% to 2% annual reductions in O&M. In fact, as a result of our excellent 2021 results to date, we were in the fortunate place to be able to already make a management decision and begin pulling recurring O&M work forward from 2022 into the last 6 months of this year and still be able to hit the 8% Utility EPS growth for this year. This allows us the luxury of reducing near-term run rate O&M costs today, and immediately reinvesting them for the future long-term benefit of our customers and investors. 
We continue to see industry-leading organic customer growth rates. Despite COVID,  our Houston service territory continues its 30-plus years of consistent growth. Overall, we saw about 2% customer growth for electric and 1% for natural gas for the first 6 months of the year when compared to the prior year. The growth is supported by the highest level of new home starts in Houston since 2005. This continued and consistent growth reinforces the value of the fast-growing markets that we serve. This organic growth plays a key role in keeping our service costs reasonable for our customers. 
Moving to capital investments. We have invested approximately $1.5 billion for the first 6 months of this year and are still on track to invest approximately $3.4 billion for the full year 2021. More importantly, we now have better line of sight to additional capital investment opportunities beyond the 5-year $16 billion investment plan we outlined on our Analyst Day. New Texas legislation provides more tools to transmission and distribution utilities to improve the resiliency of the electric grid and helps minimize the risk of prolonged outages and allows us to put all of this into rate base. Some of these laws include the ability to lease and put into rate base backup battery storage capacity for resiliency and to assist with restoring power. Next, the ability to lease and put into rate base emergency generation, which may include mobile generation capabilities. The ability to immediately procure, store and put into rate base long lead time items related to restoring power and the allowing of economic versus resiliency justifications for new transmission projects. Based on initial analysis, these legislative changes provide support to increase our 5-year capital investment plan by at least $500 million. Now this is on top of the $1 billion in reserve capital investment opportunities we previously identified during our last Analyst Day, but were not incorporated into that plan. 
Just as important, we will have the ability to efficiently fund $1.1 billion of these incremental opportunities. This is primarily due to the incremental proceeds expected from the sale of our gas LDCs and the execution of tax mitigation strategies, which Jason will discuss shortly as well as additional debt, assuming a roughly 50-50 cap structure. Even better, all of this is before the additional proceeds we anticipate from the sale of Energy Transfer units given the significant appreciation in value since the Enable and Energy Transfer merger was announced. 
We are in the midst of quantifying what the whole new slate of organic opportunities will look like, and we'll be in a position to provide more detail at our Analyst Day in September.  Just as a teaser, we are confident that we will be in a position to announce an increase to our previous 5-year investment plan, fund that increase with no incremental equity and execute on projects that will continue to improve the resiliency and safety of our systems for the benefit of our customers, a very nice trifecta. 
Now I will briefly touch on strategic initiatives, which we have announced over the recent months, including our gas LDC sale and our planned exit of our midstream investment. We know that investors are highly focused on the ultimate completion of these initiatives, and we believe we will achieve our timing expectations. We continue to make progress on the gas LDC sale and still anticipate closing by the end of the year. We are working closely each day with [ Summit ] to secure regulatory approvals for the sale and to successfully transition that business. 
Turning to the Enable transaction. We still anticipate the transaction between Enable and Energy Transfer to close in the second half of the year. We remain absolutely focused on reducing and then eliminating our midstream exposure through a disciplined approach. Now to be clear,  it would be very unlikely for either of these transactions to close prior to our September Analyst Day. And finally, to reiterate what we said when we announced the news of these 2 transactions in our last quarterly call, completing these transactions will not change our industry-leading 6% to 8% Utility EPS growth target or 10% rate base compound annual growth rate target. 
Finally, I want to highlight the Natural Gas Innovation Act that recently passed in Minnesota. This is a landmark law that establishes a new state regulatory policy that creates additional opportunities for a natural gas utility to invest in innovative clean energy resources and technologies, including renewable natural gas, green hydrogen and carbon capture and further demonstrates the forward-thinking mindset of the jurisdictions that we serve. This is a successful outcome for all stakeholders as we work to collectively achieve lower greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. With the approval from the Minnesota Public Utility Commission, a utility can invest up to 1.75% of our gross operating revenue in the state annually. This opportunity increases up to 4% of gross operating revenues by 2033. Under the new law, we expect to submit our first innovation plan to the PUC next year. This law aligns with our steadfast commitment to environmental stewardship and more specifically, our carbon reduction goals. Our customers are asking for ways in which we can deliver not only safe and reliable, but cleaner electricity and gas, and we are working to achieve that. Across jurisdictions, we are collaborating to find ways to introduce more renewable fuels into our systems as we firm up our goal to achieve a net zero target. We look forward to unveiling this in September during our Analyst Day. 
For now, I'll just remind everyone how thrilled I am to be able to deliver these messages. As I've said,  this marks 1 year for me as CEO, and a lot has changed. I look forward to the calls every quarter, so I can proudly share our team's accomplishments with you. I strongly believe the strategy we have laid out and the progress we have made so far more than demonstrates what a unique value proposition CenterPoint offers. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jason."
279513,718784254,2364314,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our second quarter earnings call. While I don't quite have a full year with CenterPoint under my belt, I am just as energized as Dave by our recent execution and more importantly",1386,"Thank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our second quarter earnings call. While I don't quite have a full year with CenterPoint under my belt, I am just as energized as Dave by our recent execution and more importantly, about the path we are on to becoming a premium utility. 
Let me get started by discussing our earnings for the second quarter of 2021. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.37 for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.11 for the second quarter of 2020. Looking at Slide 4, we reported $0.36 of non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.21 for the second quarter of 2020.  Our Utility EPS was $0.28 for the second quarter of 2021, while Midstream investments contributed another $0.08. As Dave mentioned, there were a few onetime items for both quarters that made the comparison a bit noisy. This included favorable impacts for the second quarter of 2021, inclusive of $0.05 attributable to deferred state tax benefits. Of this $0.05 in total, $0.03 of the benefit was related to legislation in Louisiana that eliminated the NOL carryforward limitation period. This amount is included in our Utility EPS results. The remaining $0.02 of benefit was due to Oklahoma's revision of the corporate tax rate, which is a favorable driver in our midstream segment. 
Our [ 2020 ] Utility EPS included a negative $0.06 impact due to COVID. Beyond those onetime items, other notable drivers for the second quarter of 2021 include customer growth and rate recovery, which contributed about $0.04 of favorable impacts as well as miscellaneous revenue contributing another $0.02 of favorable impacts. These were partially offset by a negative $0.02 impact from the share dilution resulting from the May 2020 issuance and a negative $0.03 for unfavorable O&M variance. So there's a lot of noise when comparing to second quarter of 2020 as that was the quarter most impacted by COVID worldwide. I look through that noise, and I think you should, too. The bottom line is we expect to grow our Utility EPS 8% this year and target 6% to 8% thereafter. And that's what we should all focus on. 
As Dave mentioned, O&M is a bit noisy this quarter as well. The key takeaway is we are delivering on our planned efficiencies of over $40 million in cost reductions for the year, and are now beginning to accelerate O&M work from 2022. This will help improve reliability of our service for our customers while sustaining growth for our shareholders. 
With 2 quarters of financial results behind us, we have good line of sight to our full year 2021 earnings per share outperformance. Our disciplined execution and tailwinds led us to raise our Utility EPS guidance range to $1.25 to $1.27 per share for the full year, which is at the high end of our 6% to 8% annual Utility EPS growth target. Beyond 2021, I want to reiterate, we are focused on growing Utility EPS at 6% to 8% each and every year. No CAGRs here. And we look forward to discussing incremental drivers over a longer-term horizon during our September Analyst Day. 
Moving to a discussion of future capital opportunities as shown on Page 5. We are currently developing our full analysis of additional capital opportunities resulting from bill signed into effect in Texas during the last legislative session. There will be some shorter-dated opportunities that develop such as the ability to procure long lead time items or to lease a portion of battery storage or backup generation across our footprint, and then some longer-dated projects such as transmission opportunities through economic justification. Based on our first look, we have confidence that new Texas legislation will support at least $500 million of incremental capital investment opportunities over just our current 5-year plan. This number will likely increase as we work with stakeholders to refine the implementation of this new legislation and develop the longer-dated plan to incorporate some of these opportunities. We are confident the new tools we have been providing will help create a more resilient electric grid and help reduce the risk of prolonged outages. 
Regarding the previously identified incremental $1 billion, we may be able to deploy above our 2020 Analyst Day plan of $16 billion. This incremental capital spending is likely to be allocated towards recurring system improvements to accelerate the improvement in resiliency, reliability and safety of our services. We will provide a more comprehensive update on this additional capital spend in our upcoming Analyst Day, but it is important to highlight any incremental capital we include in this plan won't begin contributing to earnings until 2023 at the earliest. as we will begin recovering incremental spend the year following the investment. 
As far as the funding sources for these incremental capital opportunities,  we continue to take advantage of a number of tailwinds that will allow us to incorporate additional capital spend. As we reported last quarter, and Dave reinforced, we will receive an incremental $300 million of proceeds above our original plan once the gas LDC sale closes. Additionally, we have continued to refine the estimate of the incremental benefit for the method we use to determine the amount of repairs expense that can be deducted for tax purposes. While we are still refining this study, we have confidence that the benefit will generate at least $1 billion in incremental tax deductions, resulting in at least $250 million in additional cash to us and likely more. This enhanced method for determining repairs expense is an efficient way for us to fund these capital investment opportunities, which improve the resiliency and safety of our systems for the benefits of our customers. 
The combination of these improved sources of funding, coupled with debt that will be authorized under our regulatory capital structure supports incremental investments of at least $1.1 billion. And importantly, this amount is before we consider any additional proceeds due to the unit appreciation of Energy Transfer. 
Moving to the financing updates. We closed our $1.7 billion debt issuance in May, which was comprised of $700 million of 3-year floating rate notes, $500 million of 5-year fixed rate notes at 1.45% and $500 million of 10-year fixed rate notes at 2.65%. The proceeds was to refinance $1.2 billion of near-term maturities at the parent as well as to pay down commercial paper. Based on our current financing plans, we have no further issuance needs for 2021. Our current liquidity remains strong at $2.2 billion, including available borrowings under our short-term credit facilities and unrestricted cash. Our long-term FFO to debt objective is between 14% and 15%, aligning with the Moody's methodology and is consistent with the expectations of the rating agencies. We continue to actively engage with them and they have informed us that they are comfortable with the outlook and thresholds we've indicated. Based on our current financing plans, we will not issue any incremental equity through an aftermarket equity program in 2022, as previously discussed, and are evaluating if or when we would initiate it beyond that. 
As we've said in the past, we take our commitment to be good stewards of your investment very seriously and realize our obligation to optimize stakeholder value. I am energized with our execution over the last year, and I am confident we are positioning CenterPoint to be a premium utility moving forward. 
Those are the updates for the quarter. As mentioned, we'll be hosting an Analyst Day here in Houston on September 23. We look forward to the opportunity to engage and introduce you to the depth of the CenterPoint team then. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Tom Webb, our Senior Advisor. This will be Tom's last call with us, as Tom's work here at CenterPoint is winding down. I want to extend our sincerest appreciation to Tom for his counsel and support over the past year. I have, and I know we all have benefited greatly from his time here. Tom will be joining us in September for our Analyst Day for a final event with CenterPoint, and I hope you can all join us for a celebratory toast in person to acknowledge all that Tom has done for CenterPoint."

Thank you, Jason. Thank you for taking the challenge. You already have made immediate critical improvements that will be lasting. CenterPoint has transformed in less than a year, selling noncore, nonutility businesses think enable securing more efficient financing, think LDC sales, driving clean energy, think coal closures, renewable growth and a lot more to come, and accelerating performance, think continuous improvement. We are witnessing the emergence of a premium utility with sustainable, predictable EPS growth every year. I trust you see it, feel it. We truly do sweat the details so you don't have to. You'll see bumps in the road, serious challenges like the winter storm that impacted many utilities. I bet you had doubts. But watch CenterPoint. This team promptly addresses challenges to protect our customers and deliver for you, our investors. With important capital investment to deliver needed improvements for our customers, our rate base growth target at 10% substantially outstrips the peer average at about 8%. Our resulting annual Utility EPS growth target of 6% to 8% is strong. We expect it to be at the high end of the range this year. And as Dave mentioned, that's top decile. Customer growth of 2% is just the level our peers would celebrate, coupled with O&M reduction of 1% to 2% a year, this creates a lot of headroom for needed capital investment. Our 5-year plan includes 1% to 2% cost reduction every year. Our plan for this year is for a fast start, down more than $40 million or 3%. And with a fast start, we already are pulling work ahead from 2022. The cost reductions, favorable tax changes, lower financing cost, economic recovery and more allow us to reinvest $20 million for our customers now and possibly more later. This performance reflects good business decisions and continuous improvement. It comes from management commitment, experienced teams and ground-up process improvements that enhance safety every day; quality, doing things right the first time delivery, doing things on time; cost, we see; and eliminate waste and morale higher every day. This continuous improvement process is powerful. It's just dependence from heroic individual work to better processes that are repeatable as we eliminate human struggle, the cost fall out. And one of my favorite charts is on the right. As Dave often observes, we take on the headwinds, we take advantage of the tailwinds. We deliver our earnings per share commitment consistently every year. We deploy surplus resources to our customers. It is all about our customers and our investors. We did this last year. We're doing it again now. No ors just ans here. It's fun to be part of a premium winning utility. Thank you, Dave. Thank you, Jason, and thank you, team. Thank you for allowing me to join the ride. CenterPoint is a great company with wonderful people and a huge investment opportunity. Godspeed."

As we said in the call, the initial view is at least another $500 million in capital. I'll maybe let Jason give a little color on what those -- what -- where that $500 may land and sort of what the timing might be."

I would say we're obviously very appreciative of all the work the legislature went through to give us tools to reduce the risk of a widespread outage. In terms of timing, I would say about half of that $500 million will likely to be deployed over the next, call it, about 2 years with the remainder over the back half of the 5-year plan. We see the tools coming through in sort of a couple of different ways. Our system was designed to shed about 3 gigawatts of load in sort of widespread outage events.  This past winter storm, we were asked to reduce about 5 gigawatts of load. And so what we see sort of as an immediate opportunity for us is the opportunity to own emergency generation for outages that are expected to be longer than 8 hours. We will be deploying mobile generation at the substation that within combination with a year-round demand management program will give us the flexibility to shed much more significant load for ERCOT yet still provide power on a rolling basis for our customers. And that's some of the work that we will pursue aggressively. There were then some additional opportunities related to owning battery storage kind of as a grid level resource as well as a bill that introduced an economic dimension to citing new electric transmission lines. Those tools will help provide congestion relief and ensure even better reliability of our electric grid. But those programs will likely take a couple of years to site and build. And so I would think about half of the $500 million is coming in over the next couple of years with the remainder of the back half of the 5-year plan."

As you pointed out, we outlined back in December a 5-year capital investment plan of $16 billion. At that time,  we acknowledge that we held back about $1 billion of what I would consider to be sort of routine capital investment spend. We really wanted to make sure that we could efficiently grow into the increased level of CapEx as well as funded efficiently, and we're gaining that level of confidence. And then as I just mentioned, we just discussed, we see the opportunity for at least $500 million of incremental capital investment related to the recently passed legislation here in Texas. And so the combination of those factors allow us to at least increase our 5-year CapEx plan up to about $17.5 billion. And back to the central part of your question around funding it. We've had a couple of strong tailwinds that give us the ability to fund it without any incremental equity. First, as we announced on the first quarter call,  we have about $300 million in incremental proceeds above our original plan from the sale of our gas LDCs. And as we talked about on today's call in our prepared remarks, we're seeing at least $250 million in after-tax cash benefits from the implementation of the tax repairs method change that we will put in place. Think about that as providing $550 million of equity-related financing. And so we can effectively double that with debt that we authorized under our regulated capital structure. And so it gives us at least $1.1 billion to fund that capital investment increase. And these figures are all before we take into consideration any of the significant unit appreciation from Energy Transfer. So in short, we have significant capital investment opportunities above that $16 billion plan that we outlined in December. And we have confidence we'll be able to fund that without any incremental equity as we move forward."

We've talked about some big opportunities, things like -- we're finally integrating the legacy companies onto our SAP platform. We went live with that integration this summer. And so as we tackle big events like that, that allows us to reduce significant costs. But importantly, what we're seeing is the real beginning of adoption of a continuous improvement mindset. On previous calls, we've highlighted a focus on reducing truck rolls in the field. And we had some success in the second quarter this year in our electric business by bundling some of our major underground work, bundling both the capital and the expense work we executed at the same time. And so we saw not only the benefit of reducing truck rolls, but also reducing a lot of the support cost behind the scenes. And so we are very pleased with the continuous improvement mindset that is building giving us confidence in '22. I know you also asked about sort of post Enable parent. We see some opportunity for parent costs coming down as we use the proceeds from the sale of the -- what will be the Energy Transfer units to delever at the parent level as well as the reset of the preferred dividends on our Series A preferred stock in 2023. So we do see an opportunity over the next few years as well to see sort of those parent company costs also come down and help further support an overall reduction in our cost structure."

It effectively allows us to expense upfront what otherwise would be a capital addition on our system. We will claim that method change essentially starting back after bonus depreciation was phased out. So back to about 2018. And the real benefit here is obviously, it gives us this onetime cash tax benefit. But going forward, it's really a very efficient way for us to fund the incremental capital investment for the benefit of our customers. Because it is a temporary difference, it will reduce rate base modestly in the form of increased deferred tax liability.

But the way that we read it is it would provide incremental rate base opportunity for our utility there to help invest in the decarbonization of the gas that we provide our customers up there. And so we do see this as a potential additional driver of incremental CapEx in the future. And sort of more broadly, yes, we are working with our other jurisdictions in a focused effort to help reduce the carbon intensity of the gas we supply to our customers across our footprint. And obviously, that we've got a green hydrogen pilot that will come online here in Minnesota at the end of the year. It gives us a great opportunity to kind of understand that technology, how our system responds to green hydrogen, and we're looking to take those learnings and see if we can expand it across the broader part of our gas system as well as working on renewable gas -- renewable natural gas opportunities. And so I think Minnesota is taking a leadership position with respect to helping reduce carbon intensity of the gas we provide our customers, and we're looking to take that beyond the work we're doing there."

Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings call. This call marks my 1-year anniversary as CEO of CenterPoint, and I am excited to update everyone on our results this morning. 
We are now hitting the fast-paced organizational stride I want us to have, and the length of today's prepared remarks will be more in line with the template I want to follow going forward. Now while we are always keen to discuss our great future, we are planning to discuss our exciting longer-term strategy updates at our Analyst Day, which will take place on September 23 here in Houston. 
Though this is our second Analyst Day in less than 12 months, we feel that it is warranted as we are now well into our strategic transition and we want to use that forum to update our investors on our longer-term business plan, earnings capacity, financial metrics and the net zero emissions target that we will be sharing with you. We are also excited for the opportunity to spend more time with you in our hometown here in Houston and to see you in person. 
Let me quickly remind you of just how far we have come in the last year. A year ago, CenterPoint was going through a strategic review at the direction of our Business Review and Evaluation Committee or BREC. The goal of the review was to optimize shareholder value and address specific shareholder concerns. Initially, in my role as Chairman of the BREC, and then later when I became CEO, it was crystal clear to me that while the company had a great asset base and talented employees, we have not unlocked all of our potential, and certainly had not taken full advantage of all of our inherent opportunities. 
Before the BREC process, CenterPoint was targeting modest EPS growth and had reduced capital spending in our regulated businesses. We had work to do to strengthen our regulatory relationships. The company had previously announced a strategic review of Enable, but had not found an executable opportunity to actually reduce exposure to its midstream investments. This frustrated investors. 
Our O&M expenses were historically growing, and we needed a stronger balance sheet. We had minimal renewables opportunities on our radar screen, and we were in search of a permanent CFO. So yes, the list of challenges was long. I mentioned these not to revisit the adversities our investors and company we're experiencing, but to highlight for you the aggressive speed and approach used by our new team to attack and resolve the challenges and headwinds we faced. 
Let me quickly recap our progress. I substantially refreshed and diversified our Executive Committee, and we now have what I believe is a best-in-class management team. We announced an updated 5-year strategy that prioritizes investment in our regulated businesses and boosted our planned capital spending by about 25% to $16 billion. We instituted a 10% utility rate base CAGR, well above our peer group average of 8%. That rate base growth then supported an increased long-term utility EPS target growth rate of 6% to 8%, which is also above the consensus peer average of 6%. 
To efficiently fund our growth, while repairing our balance sheet, we announced the sale of our Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDCs at a landmark earnings multiple of 2.5x rate base. We were instrumental in the Enable and Energy Transfer merger which, once closed, will provide us a pathway to eliminate our exposure to midstream. And we announced a commitment to a 1% to 2% annual reduction in O&M over the 5 years to keep our customer rate growth manageable. 
We recently announced changes to our Board leadership to bring our governance structure in line with best practices and shareholder expectations, and we will be announcing a commitment to an industry-leading net zero carbon commitment at our Analyst Day. So in my view, we certainly have walked the talk, and through timely and aggressive actions overcome many of the headwinds we faced. Now it's time for CenterPoint to switch gears. We are going to use the same aggressive approach and organizational speed to take advantage of the tailwinds we have today. Our strong execution, coupled with a privilege to serve some of the fastest-growing regions in our country, have created the foundation for CenterPoint to trade as one of the premium utilities in the U.S. Believe me, we are just getting started.  
Our 6-month financial performance in 2021 has been strong. Today, we are raising our 2021 Utility EPS guidance range to $1.25 to $1.27. This 8% growth projection in '21 puts us at the high end of our 6% to 8% Utility EPS annual growth target. And as a reminder, this increase in guidance is after the dilution impact of the 18% increase in our share count that we experienced in 2020. When we compare our Utility EPS growth to analysts' long-term consensus growth for our peers, we are now in the top decile. And as you would expect, we are also reaffirming both our long-term 6% to 8% Utility EPS annual growth target and 10% rate base compound annual growth rate target. This 10% rate base growth also exceeds the average 8% rate base growth of our peer group.  
For the second quarter of 2021, we reported strong results, including $0.28 of Utility EPS compared to $0.18 for the second quarter of 2020. The comparison to Q2 2020 is a bit noisy, and I believe essentially irrelevant as both quarters included a number of one-off items. Q2 2020 results also reflected the impact of COVID on our business. 
The bottom line for me is to focus on the reality that our Utility EPS is expected to grow 8% this year over last year, and then target 6% to 8% growth from there. Jason will go into more detail on the quarterly results a little later in this call.  
Our O&M continuous improvement programs have strengthened our results for the first 6 months of 2021. We are already on track to save over $40 million in total O&M costs this year alone, while maintaining our focus on safety. This is almost 3% of our annual O&M cost. However, when compared to last year's second quarter, our O&M costs are actually up a bit. Again, this is just more noise that I don't worry about as last year's second quarter O&M costs were artificially depressed by the impact of COVID and disconnect moratoriums. 
We are still absolutely committed to our continuous improvement cost management efforts in our target of 1% to 2% annual reductions in O&M. In fact, as a result of our excellent 2021 results to date, we were in the fortunate place to be able to already make a management decision and begin pulling recurring O&M work forward from 2022 into the last 6 months of this year and still be able to hit the 8% Utility EPS growth for this year. This allows us the luxury of reducing near-term run rate O&M costs today, and immediately reinvesting them for the future long-term benefit of our customers and investors.  
We continue to see industry-leading organic customer growth rates. Despite COVID,  our Houston service territory continues its 30-plus years of consistent growth. Overall, we saw about 2% customer growth for electric and 1% for natural gas for the first 6 months of the year when compared to the prior year. The growth is supported by the highest level of new home starts in Houston since 2005.  This continued and consistent growth reinforces the value of the fast-growing markets that we serve. This organic growth plays a key role in keeping our service costs reasonable for our customers.  
Moving to capital investments. We have invested approximately $1.5 billion for the first 6 months of this year and are still on track to invest approximately $3.4 billion for the full year 2021. More importantly, we now have better line of sight to additional capital investment opportunities beyond the 5-year $16 billion investment plan we outlined on our Analyst Day. New Texas legislation provides more tools to transmission and distribution utilities to improve the resiliency of the electric grid and helps minimize the risk of prolonged outages and allows us to put all of this into rate base. 
Some of these laws include the ability to lease and put into rate base, backup battery storage capacity for resiliency and to assist with restoring power. Next, the ability to lease and put into rate base emergency generation, which may include mobile generation capabilities. The ability to immediately procure, store and put into rate base long lead time items related to restoring power, and the allowing of economic versus resiliency justifications for new transmission projects. 
Based on initial analysis, these legislative changes provide support to increase our 5-year capital investment plan by at least $500 million. Now this is on top of the $1 billion in reserve capital investment opportunities we previously identified during our last Analyst Day, but were not incorporated into that plan.  
Just as important, we will have the ability to efficiently fund $1.1 billion of these incremental opportunities. This is primarily due to the incremental proceeds expected from the sale of our gas LDCs and the execution of tax mitigation strategies, which Jason will discuss shortly as well as additional debt, assuming a roughly 50-50 cap structure. 
Even better, all of this is before the additional proceeds we anticipate from the sale of Energy Transfer units given the significant appreciation in value since the Enable and Energy Transfer merger was announced.  
We are in the midst of quantifying what the whole new slate of organic opportunities will look like, and we'll be in a position to provide more detail at our Analyst Day in September.  However, just as a teaser, we are confident that we will be in a position to announce an increase to our previous 5-year investment plan, fund that increase with no incremental equity and execute on projects that will continue to improve the resiliency and safety of our systems for the benefit of our customers, a very nice trifecta.  
Now I will briefly touch on strategic initiatives, which we have announced over the recent months, including our gas LDC sale and our planned exit of our midstream investment. We know that investors are highly focused on the ultimate completion of these initiatives, and we believe we will achieve our timing expectations. 
We continue to make progress on the gas LDC sale and still anticipate closing by the end of the year. We are working closely each day with Summit to secure regulatory approvals for the sale and to successfully transition that business. 
Turning to the Enable transaction. We still anticipate the transaction between Enable and Energy Transfer to close in the second half of the year. We remain absolutely focused on reducing and then eliminating our midstream exposure through a disciplined approach. Now to be clear,  it would be very unlikely for either of these transactions to close prior to our September Analyst Day. And finally, to reiterate what we said when we announced the news of these two transactions in our last quarterly call, completing these transactions will not change our industry-leading 6% to 8% Utility EPS growth target or 10% rate base compound annual growth rate target. 
Finally, I want to highlight the Natural Gas Innovation Act that recently passed in Minnesota. This is a landmark law that establishes a new state regulatory policy that creates additional opportunities for a natural gas utility to invest in innovative, clean energy resources and technologies, including renewable natural gas, green hydrogen and carbon capture and further demonstrates the forward-thinking mindset of the jurisdictions that we serve. This is a successful outcome for all stakeholders as we work to collectively achieve lower greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. 
With the approval from the Minnesota Public Utility Commission, a utility can invest up to 1.75% of our gross operating revenue in the state annually. This opportunity increases up to 4% of gross operating revenues by 2033. Under the new law, we expect to submit our first innovation plan to the PUC next year. This law aligns with our steadfast commitment to environmental stewardship and more specifically, our carbon reduction goals. 
Our customers are asking for ways in which we can deliver not only safe and reliable, but cleaner electricity and gas, and we are working to achieve that. Across jurisdictions, we are collaborating to find ways to introduce more renewable fuels into our systems as we firm up our goal to achieve a net zero target. We look forward to unveiling this in September during our Analyst Day. 
For now, I'll just remind everyone how thrilled I am to be able to deliver these messages. As I've said,  this marks 1 year for me as CEO, and a lot has changed. I look forward to the calls every quarter, so I can proudly share our team's accomplishments with you. I strongly believe the strategy we have laid out and the progress we have made so far more than demonstrates what a unique value proposition CenterPoint offers. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jason."
279513,718784254,2364609,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our second quarter earnings call. While I don't quite have a full year with CenterPoint under my belt, I am just as energized as Dave by our recent execution and more importantly",1385,"Thank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our second quarter earnings call. While I don't quite have a full year with CenterPoint under my belt, I am just as energized as Dave by our recent execution and more importantly, about the path we are on to becoming a premium utility. 
Let me get started by discussing our earnings for the second quarter of 2021. On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.37 for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.11 for the second quarter of 2020. Looking at Slide 4, we reported $0.36 of non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.21 for the second quarter of 2020.  Our Utility EPS was $0.28 for the second quarter of 2021, while Midstream investments contributed another $0.08. As Dave mentioned, there were a few onetime items for both quarters that made the comparison a bit noisy. This included favorable impacts for the second quarter of 2021, inclusive of $0.05 attributable to deferred state tax benefits. Of this $0.05 in total, $0.03 of the benefit was related to legislation in Louisiana that eliminated the NOL carryforward limitation period. This amount is included in our Utility EPS results. The remaining $0.02 of benefit was due to Oklahoma's revision of the corporate tax rate, which is a favorable driver in our midstream segment. 
Our 2020 Utility EPS included a negative $0.06 impact due to COVID. Beyond those onetime items, other notable drivers for the second quarter of 2021 include customer growth and rate recovery, which contributed about $0.04 of favorable impacts as well as miscellaneous revenue contributing another $0.02 of favorable impacts. These were partially offset by a negative $0.02 impact from the share dilution resulting from the May 2020 issuance and a negative $0.03 for unfavorable O&M variance. So there's a lot of noise when comparing to second quarter of 2020 as that was the quarter that most impacted by COVID worldwide. 
I look through that noise, and I think you should, too. The bottom line is we expect to grow our Utility EPS 8% this year and target 6% to 8% thereafter. And that's what we should all focus on. 
As Dave mentioned, O&M is a bit noisy this quarter as well. The key takeaway is we are delivering on our planned efficiencies of over $40 million in cost reductions for the year, and are now beginning to accelerate O&M work from 2022. This will help improve reliability of our service for our customers while sustaining growth for our shareholders. 
With two quarters of financial results behind us, we have good line of sight to our full year 2021 earnings per share outperformance. Our disciplined execution and tailwinds led us to raise our Utility EPS guidance range to $1.25 to $1.27 per share for the full year, which is at the high end of our 6% to 8% annual Utility EPS growth target. 
Beyond 2021, I want to reiterate, we are focused on growing Utility EPS at 6% to 8% each and every year. No CAGRs here. And we look forward to discussing incremental drivers over a longer-term horizon during our September Analyst Day. 
Moving to a discussion of future capital opportunities as shown on Page 5. We are currently developing our full analysis of additional capital opportunities resulting from bill signed into effect in Texas during the last legislative session. There will be some shorter-dated opportunities that develop such as the ability to procure long lead time items or to lease a portion of battery storage or backup generation across our footprint, and then some longer-dated projects such as transmission opportunities through economic justification. Based on our first look, we have confidence that new Texas legislation will support at least $500 million of incremental capital investment opportunities over just our current 5-year plan. 
This number will likely increase as we work with stakeholders to refine the implementation of this new legislation and develop the longer-dated plan to incorporate some of these opportunities. We are confident the new tools we have been providing will help create a more resilient electric grid and help reduce the risk of prolonged outages. 
Regarding the previously identified incremental $1 billion, we may be able to deploy above our 2020 Analyst Day plan of $16 billion. This incremental capital spending is likely to be allocated towards recurring system improvements to accelerate the improvement in resiliency, reliability and safety of our services. We will provide a more comprehensive update on this additional capital spend in our upcoming Analyst Day, but it is important to highlight any incremental capital we include in this plan won't begin contributing to earnings until 2023 at the earliest, as we will begin recovering incremental spend the year following the investment. 
As far as the funding sources for these incremental capital opportunities, we continue to take advantage of a number of tailwinds that will allow us to incorporate additional capital spend. As we reported last quarter, and Dave reinforced, we will receive an incremental $300 million of proceeds above our original plan once the gas LDC sale closes. Additionally, we have continued to refine the estimate of the incremental benefit for the method we use to determine the amount of repairs expense that can be deducted for tax purposes. 
While we are still refining this study, we have confidence that the benefit will generate at least $1 billion in incremental tax deductions, resulting in at least $250 million in additional cash to us and likely more. This enhanced method for determining repairs expense is an efficient way for us to fund these capital investment opportunities, which improve the resiliency and safety of our systems for the benefits of our customers. 
The combination of these improved sources of funding, coupled with debt, that will be authorized under our regulatory capital structure, supports incremental investments of at least $1.1 billion. And importantly, this amount is before we consider any additional proceeds due to the unit appreciation of Energy Transfer. 
Moving to the financing updates. We closed our $1.7 billion debt issuance in May, which was comprised of $700 million of 3-year floating rate notes, $500 million of 5-year fixed rate notes at 1.45% and $500 million of 10-year fixed rate notes at 2.65%. The proceeds was to refinance $1.2 billion of near-term maturities at the parent as well as to pay down commercial paper. Based on our current financing plans, we have no further issuance needs for 2021. 
Our current liquidity remains strong at $2.2 billion, including available borrowings under our short-term credit facilities and unrestricted cash. Our long-term FFO to debt objective is between 14% and 15%, aligning with the Moody's methodology and is consistent with the expectations of the rating agencies. We continue to actively engage with them and they have informed us that they are comfortable with the outlook and thresholds we've indicated. 
Based on our current financing plans, we will not issue any incremental equity through an aftermarket equity program in 2022, as previously discussed, and are evaluating if or when we would initiate it beyond that. 
As we've said in the past, we take our commitment to be good stewards of your investment very seriously and realize our obligation to optimize stakeholder value. I am energized with our execution over the last year, and I am confident we are positioning CenterPoint to be a premium utility moving forward. 
Those are the updates for the quarter. As mentioned, we'll be hosting an Analyst Day here in Houston on September 23. We look forward to the opportunity to engage and introduce you to the depth of the CenterPoint team then. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Tom Webb, our Senior Advisor. This will be Tom's last call with us, as Tom's work here at CenterPoint is winding down. I want to extend our sincerest appreciation to Tom for his counsel and support over the past year. I have, and I know we all have benefited greatly from his time here. Tom will be joining us in September for our Analyst Day for a final event with CenterPoint, and I hope you can all join us for a celebratory toast in person to acknowledge all that Tom has done for CenterPoint."

I finally remember your visit to Kalamazoo a year ago, went over Dana's cooking in a bottle of nicely aged Bordeaux wine, I explained how I was busy and retired. You were persuasive. I was humbled to be asked and honored to help in a very small way on your extensive checklist.  Top of your list was identifying and attracting one of the very best CFOs in the business. Check. Thank you, Jason. Thank you for taking the challenge. You already have made immediate critical improvements that will be lasting. 
CenterPoint has transformed in less than a year, selling noncore, nonutility businesses, think Enable securing more efficient financing, think LDC sales, driving clean energy, think coal closures, renewable growth and a lot more to come, and accelerating performance, think continuous improvement. We are witnessing the emergence of a premium utility with sustainable, predictable EPS growth every year. 
I trust you see it, feel it. We truly do sweat the details so you don't have to. You'll see bumps in the road, serious challenges like the winter storm that impacted many utilities. I bet you had doubts. But watch CenterPoint, this team promptly addresses challenges to protect our customers and deliver for you, our investors. With important capital investment to deliver needed improvements for our customers, our rate base growth target at 10% substantially outstrips the peer average at about 8%. 
Our resulting annual Utility EPS growth target of 6% to 8% is strong. We expect it to be at the high end of the range this year. And as Dave mentioned, that's top decile. Customer growth of 2% is just the level our peers would celebrate. Coupled with O&M reduction of 1% to 2% a year, this creates a lot of headroom for needed capital investment. Our 5-year plan includes 1% to 2% cost reduction every year.  Our plan for this year is for a fast start, down more than $40 million or 3%. And with a fast start, we already are pulling work ahead from 2022.
The cost reductions, favorable tax changes, lower financing cost, economic recovery and more allow us to reinvest $20 million for our customers now and possibly more later. This performance reflects good business decisions and continuous improvement. It comes from management commitment, experienced teams and ground-up process improvements that enhance safety every day; quality, doing things right the first time; delivery, doing things on time; cost, we see; and eliminate waste and morale higher every day. 
This continuous improvement process is powerful. It's just dependence from heroic individual work to better processes that are repeatable; as we eliminate human struggle, the cost fall out. And one of my favorite charts is on the right. As Dave often observes, we take on the headwinds, we take advantage of the tailwinds. We deliver our earnings per share commitment consistently every year. 
We deploy surplus resources to our customers. It is all about our customers and our investors. We did this last year. We're doing it again now. No ors, just ands here. It's fun to be part of a premium winning utility. Thank you, Dave. Thank you, Jason, and thank you, team. Thank you for allowing me to join the ride. CenterPoint is a great company with wonderful people and a huge investment opportunity. Godspeed."

I mean certainly, We're not going to front run our Analyst Day. And we -- and for one main reason is we're still trying to assess the -- all the details in the bills, when they go effective and what is essentially a practical time when they can come into effect. I think another thing to focus on, a lot of people think that these were tools put in our tool kit basically to face a winter storm. In reality, what they really help us more for is hurricane season. And that's more likely that we'll have a hurricane before we'll have another year in terms of the territories that we serve. So I think it's a good set. As we said in the call, the initial view is at least another $500 million in capital. I'll maybe let Jason give a little color on what those -- what -- where that $500 may land and sort of what the timing might be."

I would say we're obviously very appreciative of all the work the legislature went through to give us tools to reduce the risk of a widespread outage. In terms of timing, I would say about half of that $500 million will likely to be deployed over the next, call it, about 2 years with the remainder over the back half of the 5-year plan. 
We see the tools coming through in sort of a couple of different ways. Our system was designed to shed about 3 gigawatts of load in sort of widespread outage events.  This past winter storm, we were asked to reduce about 5 gigawatts of load. And so what we see sort of as an immediate opportunity for us is the opportunity to own emergency generation for outages that are expected to be longer than 8 hours. We will be deploying mobile generation at the substation that within combination with a year-round demand management program will give us the flexibility to shed much more significant load for ERCOT, yet still provide power on a rolling basis for our customers. And that's some of the work that we will pursue aggressively. 
There were then some additional opportunities related to owning battery storage kind of as a grid level resource as well as a bill that introduced an economic dimension to citing new electric transmission lines. Those tools will help provide congestion relief and ensure even better reliability of our electric grid. But those programs will likely take a couple of years to site and build. And so I would think about half of the $500 million is coming in over the next couple of years with the remainder of the back half of the 5-year plan."

As you pointed out, we outlined back in December a 5-year capital investment plan of $16 billion. At that time, we acknowledged that we held back about $1 billion of what I would consider to be sort of routine capital investment spend. We really wanted to make sure that we could efficiently grow into the increased level of CapEx as well as funded efficiently, and we're gaining that level of confidence. And then as I just mentioned, we just discussed, we see the opportunity for at least $500 million of incremental capital investment related to the recently passed legislation here in Texas. 
And so the combination of those factors allow us to at least increase our 5-year CapEx plan up to about $17.5 billion. And back to the central part of your question around funding it. We've had a couple of strong tailwinds that give us the ability to fund it without any incremental equity. First, as we announced on the first quarter call, we have about $300 million in incremental proceeds above our original plan from the sale of our gas LDCs. 
And as we talked about on today's call in our prepared remarks, we're seeing at least $250 million in after-tax cash benefits from the implementation of the tax repairs method change that we will put in place. Think about that as providing $550 million of equity-related financing. And so we can effectively double that with debt that authorized under our regulated capital structure. And so it gives us at least $1.1 billion to fund that capital investment increase. And these figures are all before we take into consideration any of the significant unit appreciation from Energy Transfer. So in short, we have significant capital investment opportunities above that $16 billion plan that we outlined in December. And we have confidence we'll be able to fund that without any incremental equity as we move forward."

We've talked about some big opportunities, things like -- we're finally integrating the legacy Vectren companies onto our SAP platform. We went live with that integration this summer. And so as we tackle big events like that, that allows us to reduce significant costs. But importantly, what we're seeing is the real beginning of adoption of a continuous improvement mindset. On previous calls, we've highlighted our focus on reducing truck rolls in the field. And we had some success in the second quarter this year in our electric business by bundling some of our major underground work, bundling both the capital and the expense work we executed at the same time. And so we saw not only the benefit of reducing truck rolls, but also reducing a lot of the support cost behind the scenes. 
And so we are very pleased with the continuous improved at mindset that is building giving us confidence in '22. I know you also asked about sort of post Enable parent. We see some opportunity for parent costs coming down as we use the proceeds from the sale of the -- what will be the Energy Transfer units to delever at the parent level as well as the reset of the preferred dividends on our Series A preferred stock in 2023.

As we've tried to highlight here and we've tried to highlight on previous calls, our focus is on consistently growing our utility earnings at the top of the peer group. And when we have the ability to pull forward incremental work for the benefit of our customers, we'll do so.

It effectively allows us to expense upfront, what otherwise, would be a capital addition on our system. We will claim that method change essentially starting back after bonus depreciation was phased out. So back to about 2018. And the real benefit here is obviously, it gives us this onetime cash tax benefit. But going forward, it's really a very efficient way for us to fund the incremental capital investment for the benefit of our customers. Because it is a temporary difference, it will reduce rate base modestly in the form of increased deferred tax liability.

We'll work with the Minnesota Commission, obviously, on the implementation of the Innovation Act. But the way that we read it is it would provide incremental rate base opportunity for our utility there to help invest in the decarbonization of the gas that we provide our customers up there. And so we do see this as a potential additional driver of incremental CapEx in the future. And sort of more broadly, yes, we are working with our other jurisdictions in a focused effort to help reduce the carbon intensity of the gas we supply to our customers across our footprint. 
And obviously, that we've got a green hydrogen pilot that will come online here in Minnesota at the end of the year. It gives us a great opportunity to begin to kind of understand that technology, how our system responds to green hydrogen, and we're looking to take those learnings and see if we can expand it across the broader part of our gas system as well as working on renewable gas -- renewable natural gas opportunities. And so I think Minnesota is taking a leadership position with respect to helping reduce carbon intensity of the gas we provide our customers, and we're looking to take that beyond the work we're doing there."

Because we recently hosted our Analyst Day, we will keep our prepared remarks brief today. As you know, we laid out our first ever 10-year plan back at our Analyst Day. We expressed that and are reiterating today that we are a management team who can execute. We believe we will continue to demonstrate that for you. 
This marks my sixth quarter with CenterPoint and Jason's fifth. I'd like to first start by laying out how we are building a consistent track record of delivery. First, if you recall, the CenterPoint value proposition we laid out at our recent Analyst Day focused on our efforts to achieve sustainable earnings growth for our shareholders, sustainable, resilient and affordable rates for our customers and a sustainable positive impact on the environment for our communities. I believe we are continuing down the path of achieving this value proposition. 
Each quarter under the new CenterPoint leadership, we have met or exceeded quarterly utility EPS and dividend expectations. We have increased our annual utility EPS guidance for both 2020 and 2021. And as I will discuss shortly, today, we are increasing our 2021 utility EPS guidance once again. 
Our 2021 through 2024 annual utility EPS growth rates of 8% are top decile among our peers, and we also expect to achieve at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% utility EPS guidance range each year from 2025 to 2030. I am confident in our team's ability to achieve that growth. 
Last year, we had a $13 billion 5-year capital plan. We increased that to $16 billion in our 2020 Analyst Day. In this year, we increased it yet again to $18 billion plus. We introduced our first ever 10-year capital plan. CenterPoint remains ripe with opportunities across our footprint to expand and harden our system to benefit customers and shareholders. Our current 10-year plan contains no external equity issuances. We will fund the equity portion of our capital needs to internally generated operating cash flows and our already announced strategic transactions. 
We are also executing on our plan to become a pure-play regulated utility as we approach the closing of the Enable ET merger expected by the end of this year and then our subsequent sell-down of our midstream stake. With the recent settlement agreement among the parties in Arkansas, we are also moving toward the completion of our LDC asset sale. The remaining steps include the Oklahoma approval, which is anticipated to be received in November and the all-party settlement in Arkansas is expected to be approved by mid-December. 
And with our newest announcement around our industry-leading ESG targets, we are on the path to executing our goals to be net 0 on direct emissions by 2035. We continue to believe that this is an achievable path delivering for customers, regulators, investors and the environment. 
In the third quarter of 2020, I said that I will not be satisfied until we are recognized as a premium utility. In the theme of our Analyst Day was again establishing a path toward a premium. I believe we are making tremendous strides down that path. 
Before I get into the headlines for this quarter, I want to thank all of the crews for their hard work to restore power after hurricane Nicolas down here in the Texas Gulf Coast. The storm headwinds of up to 90 miles an hour, leaving 470,000 of our Houston Electric customers without power. Within 3 days, we had 95% of the power restored for those customers. And within 5 days, the whole system was back online. 
Now for this quarter's headlines. Our year-to-date financial progress has been strong. We are reporting a utility EPS beat and are raising our full year outlook this quarter. For the third time this year, we are increasing our 2021 utility EPS guidance this time to $1.26 to $1.28 for the full year. And for the first 9 months, we've already achieved nearly 80% of that full year goal. More importantly, we are still targeting an 8% annual growth rate for 2022 to 2024. So this raises our guidance for 2022 utility EPS to $1.36 to $1.38. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported $0.25 of utility EPS, which compares to $0.29 in the third quarter of 2020. 
In the third quarter of this year, we had a onetime impact to earnings of $0.04 per share related to our most recent Board implemented governance changes. Jason will get into more detail on the variances shortly. 
Capital investments. As I mentioned earlier, we have increased our 5-year capital plans to $18 billion plus over the next 5 years and $40 billion plus over the next 10 years. This is nearly a 40% increase in our 5-year capital investment plan since the third quarter of 2020. This includes new opportunities that stem from the latest legislative session in Texas. One of those opportunities was the ability to lease and put into rate base mobile generation units. We move quickly on this opportunity and procured 5 5-megawatt and 3 30-megawatt mobile generation units, some of which we were able to deploy during Hurricane Nicolas as backup while crews worked to repair our system. 
And recently, during an ERCOT forecasted Texas wide load-shutting event, the Texas PUC asked us to make sure our units were ready to support customers. We were the first utility in the state to act on this legislative opportunity and had them in place to utilize them in the way the law intended. We look forward to mobilize quickly on the other tools provided to us by the Texas legislature to improve the resiliency of the electric grid and help reduce the risk of prolonged outages. We already have an outstanding RFP for additional mobile generation, which could bring our total up to 500 megawatts and hope to have this procured in the coming months. We believe that with the deployment of these additional tools, we will be able to mitigate some of the impacts of future extreme weather events on our customers. 
Due to recent weather events in both Louisiana and Texas, we are running slightly behind on our capital spending plans on a year-to-date basis. These weather events pulled away many of our contract crews, so they could provide mutual assistance to our fellow utilities, especially in Louisiana. Therefore, while deployed elsewhere, they cannot work on our capital projects, but we have a catch-up plan in place and anticipate making the short fall of. 
In anticipation of continued labor shortages and as we ramp up our capital plans in the coming years, we have now moved to procure additional contractor resources from multiple suppliers. We believe that this will help to support continuity and crews on a long-term basis and reduce the impact of any labor disruptions in executing our $40 billion-plus capital spend over the next 10 years. 
O&M. Turning to O&M. We remain committed to our continuous improvement cost management efforts and our target of 1% to 2% average annual reductions. We've already realized the benefit of some of these improvements this year. We stated in the second quarter that we could accelerate approximately $20 million of recurring O&M work forward from 2022 into this year if we had the available resources. 
So far, we've achieved approximately 20% of this goal year-to-date and remain confident around our team's ability to continue to execute towards this goal for the balance of the year. This allows us the luxury of reducing near-term run rate O&M costs which helps to mitigate rate pressures while maintaining continued focus on reliability and safety of our service for customers, all while sustaining growth for our shareholders. 
Organic growth. In addition to O&M continuous improvement efforts, we are fortunate to operate in growing jurisdictions. This combination plays a key role in keeping our growth plans affordable for our customers. As we discussed during our Analyst Day, Houston is the fourth largest city in the U.S. and the only 1 of those 4 that's growing. Houston's organic growth has been multi-decades long. That organic growth rate continued for yet another quarter. We are also seeing strong growth in many of our other jurisdictions as well. On a year-over-year basis, we saw about 2% customer growth for electric and 1% for natural gas through September. Again, this organic growth is the luxury, most other utilities just do not have. 
Now let me shift gears and give a brief regulatory update. A recent highlight in Indiana happened just this past week. As part of our long-term electric generation transition plan, we received the CPCN approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for the first tranche of solar generation, 75% of which we expect to own and 25% due a PPA. 
This approval shows the commission's alignment and support of our 2020 IRP, which bridges our coal generation into a mix of lower carbon and renewable sources. We anticipate the CPCN decisions for our Gas CT plant in the second or third quarter of 2022 and the incremental solar PPA in the third quarter of 2022. As outlined in our IRP, we are targeting to own approximately 50% of our total solar generation portfolio. Our continued build-out of renewables is a key driver in achieving our net zero direct emissions goal by 2035. 
Shifting to gas cost recovery from the February winter storm. We continue to make progress. And as we previously mentioned, we have mechanisms in place or have begun recovery in all jurisdictions. We are happy to report that just this past week, we reached a settlement on the prudence proceedings supporting securitization of 100% of gas costs in Texas, including all of related carrying costs. We look forward to the commission approval of the agreement. We anticipate a financing order for the securitization bonds by the end of the year. With this time line, we anticipate receiving the proceeds sometime mid next year. 
In Minnesota, we started a recovery as of December and are working with stakeholders on ways to reduce the impact on our customers. We filed a rate case earlier this week, and also proposed an alternative rate stabilization plan to address the unique set of circumstances customers are experiencing. The full rate case requests $67.1 million per year, while the rate stabilization plan requests $39.7 million per year and an extended recovery period for winter storm costs. The proposed rate stabilization plan would resolve the rate case and limit the bill impact on customers, in part by recovering the winter storm costs over a 63-month period. We're asking the PUC to review and approve the stabilization plan by the end of this year, which would allow rates to take effect on January 1. To summarize, we are working with stakeholders to align our focus on safety and related investments while minimizing the burden to our customers. 
Largely as a result of mechanisms in our Houston Electric in Indiana South gas jurisdictions, we have recently received approval for $40 million of increased incremental annual revenue. As discussed in our Analyst Day, we anticipate approximately 80% of our 10-year capital plans to be recovered through interim mechanisms, which demonstrates the constructive jurisdictions in which we operate. 
In Texas, our PUC is now appointed a fourth commissioner. Jason and I have now had the opportunity to meet all 4 commissioners and are very encouraged by the dialogue and expertise that all of these commissioners bring to the PUC. We look forward to continued engagement with the commissions in all of our jurisdictions. 
So those are the headlines for the quarter. I remain excited about what's to come for CenterPoint. We have a growing track of execution and believe it more than demonstrates what we can do in the near future and the unique value proposition that CenterPoint offers to you. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jason."
279513,1682958473,2424674,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our third quarter earnings call.

This marks my 1 year of earnings calls with CenterPoint and the story keeps getting better. 
To reemphasize Dave's message, we are focused on establishing a track record of consistent execution, and I fully believe the best is yet to come here at CenterPoint. I'll start this morning with the earnings for the third quarter of 2021. 
On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.32 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.13 for the third quarter of 2020. 
Looking at Slide 5, we reported $0.33 of non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.34 for the third quarter of 2020. Our utility EPS was $0.25 for the third quarter of 2021, while midstream investments contributed another $0.08. Favorable growth in rate recovery, lower interest expense and reversal of the net impacts from COVID last year, each contributed $0.01 of favorability. These amounts were offset by $0.04 related to our onetime Board implemented governance changes recorded this quarter and another $0.03 of unfavorable variance attributable to weather and usage. 
For context, we experienced 73 fewer cooling degree days in Houston for the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. We estimate that each cooling degree day above normal has approximately a $70,000 a day impact in our Houston Electric business. 
Turning to Slide 6. For the first 9 months, we've achieved nearly 80% of our full year 2021 utility EPS guidance, which we are now raising to $1.26 to $1.28. And as Dave said, we are also raising our utility EPS guidance for 2022 to $1.36 to $1.38, which is an 8% increase from our new 2021 estimates. 
Looking beyond that, we are focused on delivering 8% annual utility EPS growth through 2024 and at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% annual utility EPS range over the remainder of our 10-year plan, strong growth each year and every year, no CAGRs for earnings. 
The last thing I'll mention for this quarter is the share count. Our preferred Series B shares converted into 36 million common shares as of September 1, further reducing the number of share classes outstanding. We expect the conversion will have no impact on earnings as the increase in shares is effectively offset by the termination of our Series B dividends. Going forward, I want to reiterate we have no external equity included in our current and only expect our share count to modestly increase from dividend reinvestment or incentive plans. 
Now I want to offer some color on the capital plans supporting our rate base and utility EPS growth. We've spent approximately $2.3 billion year-to-date on capital investments. As Dave mentioned, we had some slight delays due to recent weather events and are focused on making that up over the coming months. We outlined on our Analyst Day the 3 buckets that we are investing in, safety, reliability and growth and enabling clean investments that are included in our $40 billion plus 10-year capital investment plan. 
This investment profile should benefit our shareholders, our customers and the environment. We see those opportunities weighted nearly 60% towards investments in our electric business throughout the plan. While we are slightly behind the capital plan on a year-to-date basis, we are in the midst of ramping up to a sustained increase in our capital investments and we are restructuring contract crews in a way that helps support our labor needs to execute this level of investment. We are confident we will make up the shortfall by early 2022. 
Moving to the financing updates. Our current liquidity remains strong at $1.8 billion, including available borrowings under our short-term credit facilities and unrestricted cash. Our long-term FFO to debt objective remains between 14% and 15%, aligning with Moody's methodology and is consistent with the expectations of the rating agencies. As mentioned during the Analyst Day, it's our intention to stay within this range throughout the course of our long-term plan. 
Lastly, as we near the end of the calendar year, we are getting incrementally closer to the expected closing of the strategic transactions we've announced. We recently filed a settlement in Arkansas that represents an agreement amongst all parties. We anticipate that Arkansas Commission will issue its final approval by mid-December. In Oklahoma, a hearing was held on November 3, and we expect a final order soon. 
Finally, as Energy Transfer expressed on their earnings call earlier this week, the Enable and Energy Transfer merger is also expected to close before year-end. Once that transaction closes, we will remain absolutely focused on reducing and then eliminating our exposure to midstream through a disciplined approach. As said on our Analyst Day, we anticipate being fully exited from the midstream sector by the end of 2022. We will then be nearly a pure-play regulated utility. 
As we continue to express, we take our commitment to be good stewards of your investment very seriously and realize our obligation to optimize stakeholder value. And with that, we look forward to more of these shorter earnings calls in the future. I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Part of it is the coal transition certainly helps that because of the capital that it is going to absorb. And as we've said at our Analyst Day and we've said it in some of our prior calls, we don't need equity to execute this 10-year plan. But if other opportunities did come up, we know the inherent value of the remaining gas LDCs. 
And you could look to them as a source of liquidity. But I think bottom line is we're biased toward electric, and that is the way we will continue to drift. I'm not going to put a prediction out there as to what that ratio will be over time. But directionally, that's where we're headed."

One is just getting sort of final resolution and clarity around the new tools in the toolbox with respect to the Texas legislative process. We highlighted today, the temporary generation. For instance, we've moved very, very quickly on. Those kinds of things would absorb some of that additional $1 billion in sort of contingent capital that we laid out on our Analyst Day. 
And the other -- just the other issue is going to be just finding sufficient crews and labor and parts and inventory and those kinds of things out there to accelerate it. So I think the message we tried to leave at Analyst Day is we have $18 billion plus to spend in the next 5 years, $40 billion plus to spend in the next 10 years. And we will spend that capital as fast as we can reasonably do so as long as it's consistent with sort of rate pressures that we will have and to spend it efficiently. So again, we've got the wind at our back on many, many things, and our capital spend opportunities is certainly one of those."

But I don't think that we have seen it to such an extent that we're going to say that we can't meet the capital plan. We have every intention, and we have every confidence we're going to meet the capital plan. We tried to give a little color with respect to that on the call today. We have moved aggressively to tie up more construction crews. We have expanded our vendor base in and around that area. One of the tools that we got in the new legislative process is the ability to put long lead time items into inventory and into rate base. So we're looking at all of those. 
I think the sort of small slip in capital spend this year really was unrelated to any of that. It really was related to the storms that really pounded into Louisiana. And as all utilities do, we help each other when those sort of situations arise. And we released a number of our crews that were focused on capital build for us to help the people in Louisiana get back on their feet. Those crews are now coming back. And as Jason said, we've got a short-term plan in place to catch up on that capital spend, but our longer-term view of tying up crews and making sure we have the long lead time items ordered give us a great deal of confidence that the capital plan we have is and it's going to be achievable."

Because we recently hosted our Analyst Day, we will keep our prepared remarks brief today. As you know, we laid out our first ever 10-year plan back at our Analyst Day. We expressed that and are reiterating today that we are a management team who can execute. We believe we will continue to demonstrate that for you. 
This marks my sixth quarter with CenterPoint and Jason's fifth. I'd like to first start by laying out how we are building a consistent track record of delivery. First, if you recall, the CenterPoint value proposition we laid out at our recent Analyst Day focused on our efforts to achieve sustainable earnings growth for our shareholders, sustainable, resilient and affordable rates for our customers and a sustainable positive impact on the environment for our communities. I believe we are continuing down the path of achieving this value proposition. 
Each quarter under the new CenterPoint leadership, we have met or exceeded quarterly utility EPS and dividend expectations. We have increased our annual utility EPS guidance for both 2020 and 2021. And as I will discuss shortly, today, we are increasing our 2021 utility EPS guidance once again. 
Our 2021 through 2024 annual utility EPS growth rates of 8% are top decile among our peers, and we also expect to achieve at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% utility EPS guidance range each year from 2025 to 2030. I am confident in our team's ability to achieve that growth. 
Last year, we had a [ $13 ] billion 5-year capital plan. We increased that to [ $16 ] billion in our 2020 Analyst Day. In this year, we increased it yet again to $18 billion plus. We introduced our first ever 10-year capital plan. CenterPoint remains ripe with opportunities across our footprint to expand and harden our system to benefit customers and shareholders. Our current 10-year plan contains no external equity issuances. We will fund the equity portion of our capital needs to internally generated operating cash flows and our already announced strategic transactions. 
We are also executing on our plan to become a pure-play regulated utility as we approach the closing of the Enable ET merger expected by the end of this year and then our subsequent sell-down of our midstream stake. With the recent settlement agreement among the parties in Arkansas, we are also moving toward the completion of our LDC asset sale. The remaining steps include the Oklahoma approval, which is anticipated to be received in November and the all-party settlement in Arkansas is expected to be approved by mid-December. 
And with our newest announcement around our industry-leading ESG targets, we are on the path to executing our goals to be net 0 on direct emissions by 2035. We continue to believe that this is an achievable path delivering for customers, regulators, investors and the environment. 
In the third quarter of 2020, I said that I will not be satisfied until we are recognized as a premium utility. In the theme of our Analyst Day was again establishing a path toward a premium. I believe we are making tremendous strides down that path. 
Before I get into the headlines for this quarter, I want to thank all of the crews for their hard work to restore power after hurricane Nicholas down here in the Texas Gulf Coast. The storm headwinds of up to 90 miles an hour, leaving 470,000 of our Houston Electric customers without power. Within 3 days, we had 95% of the power restored for those customers. And within 5 days, the whole system was back online. 
Now for this quarter's headlines. Our year-to-date financial progress has been strong. We are reporting a utility EPS beat and are raising our full year outlook this quarter. For the third time this year, we are increasing our 2021 utility EPS guidance this time to $1.26 to $1.28 for the full year. And for the first 9 months, we've already achieved nearly 80% of that full year goal. More importantly, we are still targeting an 8% annual growth rate for 2022 to 2024. So this raises our guidance for 2022 utility EPS to $1.36 to $1.38. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported $0.25 of utility EPS, which compares to $0.29 in the third quarter of 2020. 
In the third quarter of this year, we had a onetime impact to earnings of $0.04 per share related to our most recent Board implemented governance changes. Jason will get into more detail on the variances shortly. 
Capital investments. As I mentioned earlier, we have increased our 5-year capital plans to $18 billion plus over the next 5 years and $40 billion plus over the next 10 years. This is nearly a 40% increase in our 5-year capital investment plan since the third quarter of 2020. This includes new opportunities that stem from the latest legislative session in Texas. One of those opportunities was the ability to lease and put into rate base mobile generation units. We move quickly on this opportunity and procured [indiscernible] 5-megawatt and [ 3 30-megawatt ] mobile generation units, some of which we were able to deploy during Hurricane Nicholas as backup while crews worked to repair our system. 
And recently, during an ERCOT forecasted Texas [ wide load-shedding event ], the Texas PUC [indiscernible] to make sure our units were ready to support customers. We were the first the utility in the state to act on this legislative opportunity and had them in place to utilize them in the way the law intended. We look forward to mobilize quickly on the other tools provided to us by the Texas legislature to improve the resiliency of the electric grid and help reduce the risk of prolonged outages. We already have an outstanding RFP for additional mobile generation, which could bring our total up to 500 megawatts and hope to have this procured in the coming months. We believe that with the deployment of these additional tools, we will be able to mitigate some of the impacts of future extreme weather events on our customers. 
Due to recent weather events in both Louisiana and Texas, we are running slightly behind on our capital spending plans on a year-to-date basis. These weather events pulled away many of our contract crews, so they could provide mutual assistance to our fellow utilities, especially in Louisiana. Therefore, while deployed elsewhere, they cannot work on our capital projects, but we have a catch-up plan in place and anticipate making the short fall of. 
In anticipation of continued labor shortages and as we ramp up our capital plans in the coming years, we have now moved to procure additional contractor resources from multiple suppliers. We believe that this will help to support continuity and crews on a long-term basis and reduce the impact of any labor disruptions in executing our $40 billion-plus capital spend over the next 10 years. 
O&M. Turning to O&M. We remain committed to our continuous improvement cost management efforts and our target of 1% to 2% average annual reductions. We've already realized the benefit of some of these improvements this year. We stated in the second quarter that we could accelerate approximately $20 million of recurring O&M work forward from 2022 into this year if we had the available resources. 
So far, we've achieved approximately 20% of this goal year-to-date and remain confident around our team's ability to continue to execute towards this goal for the balance of the year. This allows us the luxury of reducing near-term run rate O&M costs which helps to mitigate rate pressures while maintaining continued focus on reliability and safety of our service for customers, all while sustaining growth for our shareholders. 
Organic growth. In addition to O&M continuous improvement efforts, we are fortunate to operate in growing jurisdictions. This combination plays a key role in keeping our growth plans affordable for our customers. As we discussed during our Analyst Day, Houston is the fourth largest city in the U.S. and the only 1 of those 4 that's growing. Houston's organic growth has been multi-decades long. That organic growth rate continued for yet another quarter. We are also seeing strong growth in many of our other jurisdictions as well. On a year-over-year basis, we saw about 2% customer growth for electric and 1% for natural gas through September. Again, this organic growth is the luxury, most other utilities just do not have. 
Now let me shift gears and give a brief regulatory update. A recent highlight in Indiana happened just this past week. As part of our long-term electric generation transition plan, we received the CPCN approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for the first tranche of solar generation, 75% of which we expect to own and 25% due a PPA. 
This approval shows the commission's alignment and support of our 2020 IRP, which bridges our coal generation into a mix of lower carbon and renewable sources. We anticipate the CPCN decisions for our Gas CT plant in the second or third quarter of 2022 and the incremental solar PPA in the third quarter of 2022. As outlined in our IRP, we are targeting to own approximately 50% of our total solar generation portfolio. Our continued build-out of renewables is a key driver in achieving our net zero direct emissions goal by 2035. 
Shifting to gas cost recovery from the February winter storm. We continue to make progress. And as we previously mentioned, we have mechanisms in place or have begun recovery in all jurisdictions. We are happy to report that just this past week, we reached a settlement on the prudence proceedings supporting securitization of 100% of gas costs in Texas, including all of related carrying costs. We look forward to the commission approval of the agreement. We anticipate a financing order for the securitization bonds by the end of the year. With this time line, we anticipate receiving the proceeds sometime mid next year. 
In Minnesota, we started a recovery as of December and are working with stakeholders on ways to reduce the impact on our customers. We filed a rate case earlier this week, and also proposed an alternative rate stabilization plan to address the unique set of circumstances customers are experiencing. The full rate case requests $67.1 million per year, while the rate stabilization plan requests $39.7 million per year and an extended recovery period for winter storm costs. The proposed rate stabilization plan would resolve the rate case and limit the bill impact on customers, in part by recovering the winter storm costs over a 63-month period. We're asking the PUC to review and approve the stabilization plan by the end of this year, which would allow rates to take effect on January 1. To summarize, we are working with stakeholders to align our focus on safety and related investments while minimizing the burden to our customers. 
Largely as a result of mechanisms in our Houston Electric in Indiana South gas jurisdictions, we have recently received approval for $40 million of increased incremental annual revenue. As discussed in our Analyst Day, we anticipate approximately 80% of our 10-year capital plans to be recovered through interim mechanisms, which demonstrates the constructive jurisdictions in which we operate. 
In Texas, our PUC is now appointed a fourth commissioner. Jason and I have now had the opportunity to meet all 4 commissioners and are very encouraged by the dialogue and expertise that all of these commissioners bring to the PUC. We look forward to continued engagement with the commissions in all of our jurisdictions. 
So those are the headlines for the quarter. I remain excited about what's to come for CenterPoint. We have a growing track of execution and believe it more than demonstrates what we can do in the near future and the unique value proposition that CenterPoint offers to you. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jason."
279513,1682958473,2425094,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our third quarter earnings call. This marks my 1 year of earnings calls with CenterPoint and the story keeps getting better.

This marks my 1 year of earnings calls with CenterPoint and the story keeps getting better. 
To reemphasize Dave's message, we are focused on establishing a track record of consistent execution, and I fully believe the best is yet to come here at CenterPoint. I'll start this morning with the earnings for the third quarter of 2021. 
On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.32 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.13 for the third quarter of 2020. 
Looking at Slide 5, we reported $0.33 of non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.34 for the third quarter of 2020. Our utility EPS was $0.25 for the third quarter of 2021, while midstream investments contributed another $0.08. Favorable growth in rate recovery, lower interest expense and reversal of the net impacts from COVID last year, each contributed $0.01 of favorability. These amounts were offset by $0.04 related to our onetime Board implemented governance changes recorded this quarter and another $0.03 of unfavorable variance attributable to weather and usage. 
For context, we experienced 73 [ fewer ] cooling degree day  in Houston for the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. We estimate that each cooling degree day above normal has approximately a $70,000 a day impact in our Houston Electric business. 
Turning to Slide 6. For the first 9 months, we've achieved nearly 80% of our full year 2021 utility EPS guidance, which we are now raising to $1.26 to $1.28. And as Dave said, we are also raising our utility EPS guidance for 2022 to $1.36 to $1.38, which is an 8% increase from our new 2021 estimates. 
Looking beyond that, we are focused on delivering 8% annual utility EPS growth through 2024 and at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% annual utility EPS range over the remainder of our 10-year plan, strong growth each year and every year, no CAGRs for earnings. 
The last thing I'll mention for this quarter is the share count. Our preferred Series [ B ] shares converted into 36 million common shares as of September 1, further reducing the number of share classes outstanding. We expect the conversion will have no impact on earnings as the increase in shares is effectively offset by the termination of our Series B dividends. Going forward, I want to reiterate we have no external equity included in our current [indiscernible]  and only expect our share count to modestly increase from dividend reinvestment or incentive plans. 
Now I want to offer some color on the capital plans supporting our rate base and utility EPS growth. We've spent approximately $2.3 billion year-to-date on capital investments. As Dave mentioned, we had some slight delays due to recent weather events and are focused on making that up over the coming months. We outlined on our Analyst Day the 3 buckets that we are investing in, safety, reliability and growth and enabling clean investments that are included in our $40 billion plus 10-year capital investment plan. 
This investment profile should benefit our shareholders, our customers and the environment. We see those opportunities weighted nearly 60% towards investments in our electric business throughout the plan. While we are slightly behind the capital plan on a year-to-date basis, we are in the midst of ramping up to a sustained increase in our capital investments and we are restructuring contract crews in a way that helps support our labor needs to execute this level of investment. We are confident we will make up the shortfall by early 2022. 
Moving to the financing updates. Our current liquidity remains strong at $1.8 billion, including available borrowings under our short-term credit facilities and unrestricted cash. Our long-term FFO to debt objective remains between 14% and 15%, aligning with Moody's methodology and is consistent with the expectations of the rating agencies. As mentioned during the Analyst Day, it's our intention to stay within this range throughout the course of our long-term plan. 
Lastly, as we near the end of the calendar year, we are getting incrementally closer to the expected closing of the strategic transactions we've announced. We recently filed a settlement in Arkansas that represents an agreement amongst all parties. We anticipate that Arkansas Commission will issue its final approval by mid-December. In Oklahoma, a hearing was held on November 3, and we expect a final order soon. 
Finally, as Energy Transfer expressed on their earnings call earlier this week, the Enable and Energy Transfer merger is also expected to close before year-end. Once that transaction closes, we will remain absolutely focused on reducing and then eliminating our exposure to midstream through a disciplined approach. As said on our Analyst Day, we anticipate being fully exited from the midstream sector by the end of 2022. We will then be nearly a pure-play regulated utility. 
As we continue to express, we take our commitment to be good stewards of your investment very seriously and realize our obligation to optimize stakeholder value. And with that, we look forward to more of these shorter earnings calls in the future. I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Obviously, we continue to look at what we can do across the business to ease the burden on our customers.

But I don't think that we have seen it to such an extent that we're going to say that we can't meet the capital plan. We have every intention, and we have every confidence we're going to meet the capital plan. We tried to give a little color with respect to that on the call today. We have moved aggressively to tie up more construction crews. We have expanded our vendor base in and around that area. One of the tools that we got in the new legislative process is the ability to put long lead time items into inventory and into rate base. So we're looking at all of those. 
I think the sort of small slip in capital spend this year really was unrelated to any of that. It really was related to the storms that really pounded into Louisiana. And as all utilities do, we help each other when those sort of situations arise. And we released a number of our crews that were focused on capital build for us to help the people in Louisiana get back on their feet. Those crews are now coming back. And as Jason said, we've got a short-term plan in place to catch up on that capital spend, but our longer-term view of tying up crews and making sure we have the long lead time items ordered give us a great deal of confidence that the capital plan we have is and it's going to be achievable."

Because we recently hosted our Analyst Day, we will keep our prepared remarks brief today. As you know, we laid out our first ever 10-year plan back at our Analyst Day. We expressed that and are reiterating today that we are a management team who can execute. We believe we will continue to demonstrate that for you. 
This marks my sixth quarter with CenterPoint and Jason's fifth. I'd like to first start by laying out how we are building a consistent track record of delivery. First, if you recall, the CenterPoint value proposition we laid out at our recent Analyst Day focused on our efforts to achieve sustainable earnings growth for our shareholders; sustainable, resilient and affordable rates for our customers; and a sustainable positive impact on the environment for our communities. I believe we are continuing down the path of achieving this value proposition. 
Each quarter, under the new CenterPoint leadership, we have met or exceeded quarterly utility EPS and dividend expectations. We have increased our annual utility EPS guidance for both 2020 and 2021. And as I will discuss shortly, today, we are increasing our 2021 utility EPS guidance once again. 
Our 2021 through 2024 annual utility EPS growth rates of 8% are top decile among our peers, and we also expect to achieve at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% utility EPS guidance range each year from 2025 to 2030. I am confident in our team's ability to achieve that growth. 
Last year, we had a $13 billion 5-year capital plan. We increased that to $16 billion in our 2020 Analyst Day. In this year, we increased it yet again to $18 billion plus. We introduced our first ever 10-year capital plan. CenterPoint remains ripe with opportunities across our footprint to expand and harden our system to benefit customers and shareholders. Our current 10-year plan contains no external equity issuances. We will fund the equity portion of our capital needs to internally generated operating cash flows and our already announced strategic transactions. 
We are also executing on our plan to become a pure-play regulated utility as we approach the closing of the Enable ET merger expected by the end of this year and then our subsequent sell-down of our midstream stake. With the recent settlement agreement among the parties in Arkansas, we are also moving toward the completion of our LDC asset sale. The remaining steps include the Oklahoma approval, which is anticipated to be received in November, and the all-party settlement in Arkansas is expected to be approved by mid-December. 
And with our newest announcement around our industry-leading ESG targets, we are on the path to executing our goals to be net-zero on direct emissions by 2035. We continue to believe that this is an achievable path delivering for customers, regulators, investors and the environment. 
In the third quarter of 2020, I said that I will not be satisfied until we are recognized as a premium utility, and the theme of our Analyst Day was again establishing a path toward a premium. I believe we are making tremendous strides down that path. 
Before I get into the headlines for this quarter, I want to thank all of the crews for their hard work to restore power after hurricane Nicholas down here in the Texas Gulf Coast. The storm headwinds of up to 90 miles an hour, leaving 470,000 of our Houston Electric customers without power. Within 3 days, we had 95% of the power restored for those customers. And within 5 days, the whole system was back online. 
Now for this quarter's headlines. Our year-to-date financial progress has been strong. We are reporting a utility EPS beat and are raising our full year outlook this quarter. For the third time this year, we are increasing our 2021 utility EPS guidance this time to $1.26 to $1.28 for the full year. And for the first 9 months, we've already achieved nearly 80% of that full year goal. More importantly, we are still targeting an 8% annual growth rate for 2022 to 2024. So this raises our guidance for 2022 utility EPS to $1.36 to $1.38. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported $0.25 of utility EPS, which compares to $0.29 in the third quarter of 2020. 
In the third quarter of this year, we had a onetime impact to earnings of $0.04 per share related to our most recent Board implemented governance changes. Jason will get into more detail on the variances shortly. 
Capital investments. As I mentioned earlier, we have increased our 5-year capital plans to $18 billion plus over the next 5 years and $40 billion plus over the next 10 years. This is nearly a 40% increase in our 5-year capital investment plan since the third quarter of 2020. This includes new opportunities that stem from the latest legislative session in Texas. One of those opportunities was the ability to lease and put into rate base mobile generation units. We moved quickly on this opportunity and procured five 5-megawatt and three 30-megawatt mobile generation units, some of which we were able to deploy during Hurricane Nicholas as backup while crews worked to repair our system. 
And recently, during an ERCOT forecasted Texas-wide load-shedding event, the Texas PUC asked us to make sure our units were ready to support customers. We were the first utility in the state to act on this legislative opportunity and had them in place to utilize them in the way the law intended. We look forward to mobilize quickly on the other tools provided to us by the Texas legislature to improve the resiliency of the electric grid and help reduce the risk of prolonged outages. We already have an outstanding RFP for additional mobile generation, which could bring our total up to 500 megawatts and hope to have this procured in the coming months. We believe that with the deployment of these additional tools, we will be able to mitigate some of the impacts of future extreme weather events on our customers. 
Due to recent weather events in both Louisiana and Texas, we are running slightly behind on our capital spending plans on a year-to-date basis. These weather events pulled away many of our contract crews, so they could provide mutual assistance to our fellow utilities, especially in Louisiana. Therefore, while deployed elsewhere, they cannot work on our capital projects, but we have a catch-up plan in place and anticipate making the shortfall up. 
In anticipation of continued labor shortages and as we ramp up our capital plans in the coming years, we have now moved to procure additional contractor resources from multiple suppliers. We believe that this will help to support continuity and crews on a long-term basis and reduce the impact of any labor disruptions in executing our $40 billion-plus capital spend over the next 10 years. 
O&M. Turning to O&M. We remain committed to our continuous improvement cost management efforts and our target of 1% to 2% average annual reductions. We've already realized the benefit of some of these improvements this year. We stated in the second quarter that we could accelerate approximately $20 million of recurring O&M work forward from 2022 into this year if we had the available resources. 
So far, we've achieved approximately 20% of this goal year-to-date and remain confident around our team's ability to continue to execute towards this goal for the balance of the year. This allows us the luxury of reducing near-term run rate O&M costs, which helps to mitigate rate pressures, while maintaining continued focus on reliability and safety of our service for customers, all while sustaining growth for our shareholders. 
Organic growth. In addition to O&M continuous improvement efforts, we are fortunate to operate in growing jurisdictions. This combination plays a key role in keeping our growth plans affordable for our customers. As we discussed during our Analyst Day, Houston is the fourth largest city in the U.S. and the only 1 of those 4 that's growing. Houston's organic growth has been multi-decades long. That organic growth rate continued for yet another quarter. We are also seeing strong growth in many of our other jurisdictions as well. On a year-over-year basis, we saw about 2% customer growth for electric and 1% for natural gas through September. Again, this organic growth is the luxury most other utilities just do not have. 
Now let me shift gears and give a brief regulatory update. A recent highlight in Indiana happened just this past week. As part of our long-term electric generation transition plan, we received the CPCN approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for the first tranche of solar generation, 75% of which we expect to own and 25% to a PPA. 
This approval shows the commission's alignment and support of our 2020 IRP, which bridges our coal generation into a mix of lower carbon and renewable sources. We anticipate the CPCN decisions for our Gas CT plant in the second or third quarter of 2022, and the incremental solar PPA in the third quarter of 2022. As outlined in our IRP, we are targeting to own approximately 50% of our total solar generation portfolio. Our continued build-out of renewables is a key driver in achieving our net zero direct emissions goal by 2035. 
Shifting to gas cost recovery from the February winter storm. We continue to make progress. And as we previously mentioned, we have mechanisms in place or have begun recovery in all jurisdictions. We are happy to report that just this past week, we reached a settlement on the prudence proceedings supporting securitization of 100% of gas costs in Texas, including all of related carrying costs. We look forward to the commission approval of the agreement. We anticipate a financing order for the securitization bonds by the end of the year. With this time line, we anticipate receiving the proceeds sometime mid next year. 
In Minnesota, we started recovery as of September and are working with stakeholders on ways to reduce the impact on our customers. We filed a rate case earlier this week, and also proposed an alternative rate stabilization plan to address the unique set of circumstances customers are experiencing. The full rate case requests $67.1 million per year, while the rate stabilization plan requests $39.7 million per year and an extended recovery period for winter storm costs. The proposed rate stabilization plan would resolve the rate case and limit the bill impact on customers, in part by recovering the winter storm costs over a 63-month period. We're asking the PUC to review and approve the stabilization plan by the end of this year, which would allow rates to take effect on January 1. To summarize, we are working with stakeholders to align our focus on safety and related investments, while minimizing the burden to our customers. 
Largely as a result of mechanisms in our Houston Electric and Indiana South gas jurisdictions, we have recently received approval for $40 million of increased incremental annual revenue. As discussed in our Analyst Day, we anticipate approximately 80% of our 10-year capital plans to be recovered through interim mechanisms, which demonstrates the constructive jurisdictions in which we operate. 
In Texas, our PUC is now appointed a fourth commissioner. Jason and I have now had the opportunity to meet all 4 commissioners and are very encouraged by the dialogue and expertise that all of these commissioners bring to the PUC. We look forward to continued engagement with the commissions in all of our jurisdictions. 
So those are the headlines for the quarter. I remain excited about what's to come for CenterPoint. We have a growing track record of execution and believe it more than demonstrates what we can do in the near future and the unique value proposition that CenterPoint offers to you. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jason."
279513,1682958473,2461157,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our third quarter earnings call. This marks my 1 year of earnings calls with CenterPoint and the story keeps getting better.

This marks my 1 year of earnings calls with CenterPoint and the story keeps getting better. 
To reemphasize Dave's message, we are focused on establishing a track record of consistent execution, and I fully believe the best is yet to come here at CenterPoint. I'll start this morning with the earnings for the third quarter of 2021. 
On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.32 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.13 for the third quarter of 2020. 
Looking at Slide 5, we reported $0.33 of non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.34 for the third quarter of 2020. Our utility EPS was $0.25 for the third quarter of 2021, while midstream investments contributed another $0.08. Favorable growth in rate recovery, lower interest expense and reversal of the net impacts from COVID last year, each contributed $0.01 of favorability. These amounts were offset by $0.04 related to our onetime Board implemented governance changes recorded this quarter and another $0.03 of unfavorable variance attributable to weather and usage. 
For context, we experienced 73 fewer cooling degree days in Houston for the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. We estimate that each cooling degree day above normal has approximately $70,000 a day impact in our Houston Electric business. 
Turning to Slide 6. For the first 9 months, we've achieved nearly 80% of our full year 2021 utility EPS guidance, which we are now raising to $1.26 to $1.28. And as Dave said, we are also raising our utility EPS guidance for 2022 to $1.36 to $1.38, which is an 8% increase from our new 2021 estimates. 
Looking beyond that, we are focused on delivering 8% annual utility EPS growth through 2024 and at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% annual utility EPS range over the remainder of our 10-year plan, strong growth each year and every year, no CAGRs for earnings. 
The last thing I'll mention for this quarter is the share count. Our preferred Series B shares converted into 36 million common shares as of September 1, further reducing the number of share classes outstanding. We expect the conversion will have no impact on earnings as the increase in shares is effectively offset by the termination of our Series B dividends. Going forward, I want to reiterate we have no external equity included in our current growth plans and only expect our share count to modestly increase from dividend reinvestment or incentive plans. 
Now I want to offer some color on the capital plans supporting our rate base and utility EPS growth. We've spent approximately $2.3 billion year-to-date on capital investments. As Dave mentioned, we had some slight delays due to recent weather events and are focused on making that up over the coming months. We outlined on our Analyst Day the 3 buckets that we are investing in; safety, reliability and growth, and enabling clean investments that are included in our $40 billion plus 10-year capital investment plan. 
This investment profile should benefit our shareholders, our customers, and the environment. We see those opportunities weighted nearly 60% towards investments in our electric business throughout the plan. While we are slightly behind the capital plan on a year-to-date basis, we are in the midst of ramping up to a sustained increase in our capital investments and we are restructuring contract crews in a way that helps support our labor needs to execute this level of investment. We are confident we will make up the shortfall by early 2022. 
Moving to the financing updates. Our current liquidity remains strong at $1.8 billion, including available borrowings under our short-term credit facilities and unrestricted cash. Our long-term FFO to debt objective remains between 14% and 15%, aligning with Moody's methodology and is consistent with the expectations of the rating agencies. As mentioned during the Analyst Day, it's our intention to stay within this range throughout the course of our long-term plan. 
Lastly, as we near the end of the calendar year, we are getting incrementally closer to the expected closing of the strategic transactions we've announced. We recently filed a settlement in Arkansas that represents an agreement amongst all parties. We anticipate that Arkansas Commission will issue its final approval by mid-December. In Oklahoma, a hearing was held on November 3, and we expect a final order soon. 
Finally, as Energy Transfer expressed on their earnings call earlier this week, the Enable and Energy Transfer merger is also expected to close before year-end. Once that transaction closes, we will remain absolutely focused on reducing and then eliminating our exposure to midstream through a disciplined approach. As said on our Analyst Day, we anticipate being fully exited from the midstream sector by the end of 2022. We will then be nearly a pure-play regulated utility. 
As we continue to express, we take our commitment to be good stewards of your investment very seriously and realize our obligation to optimize stakeholder value. And with that, we look forward to more of these shorter earnings calls in the future. I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

And as of today, looking across all of our jurisdictions, we're roughly 60% hedged now that we're going into the upcoming winter season. And for almost all of those jurisdictions, we locked in kind of a weighted average cost of gas, so somewhere between sort of the mid-$3s and high $3; $3 per MMBTU in the majority of our jurisdictions. And so feel well positioned for this upcoming winter season. 
Obviously, we continue to look at what we can do across the business to ease the burden on our customers. And I think one example of that was the creative -- alternative rate stabilization plan that we just recently filed in Minnesota. So we'll continue to look for ways to minimize the bill impact, but feel like we're well prepared coming into this upcoming winter season."

Part of it is the coal transition certainly helps that because of the capital that it is going to absorb. And as we've said at our Analyst Day, and we've said it in some of our prior calls, we don't need equity to execute this 10-year plan. But if other opportunities did come up, we know the inherent value of the remaining gas LDCs. 
And you could look to them as a source of liquidity. But I think bottom line is we're biased toward electric and that is the way we will continue to drift. I'm not going to put a prediction out there as to what that ratio will be over time. But directionally, that's where we're headed."

And the other issue is going to be just finding sufficient crews and labor and parts and inventory and those kinds of things out there to accelerate it. So I think the message we tried to leave at Analyst Day is we have $18 billion plus to spend in the next 5 years, $40 billion plus to spend in the next 10 years. And we will spend that capital as fast as we can reasonably do so, as long as it's consistent with sort of rate pressures that we will have and to spend it efficiently.

We have every intention and we have every confidence we're going to meet the capital plan. We tried to give a little color with respect to that on the call today. We have moved aggressively to tie up more construction crews. We have expanded our vendor base in and around that area. One of the tools that we got in the new legislative process is the ability to put long lead time items into inventory and into rate base. So we're looking at all of those. 
I think the sort of small slip in capital spend this year really was unrelated to any of that. It really was related to the storms that really pounded into Louisiana. And as all utilities do, we help each other when those sort of situations arise. And we released a number of our crews that were focused on capital build for us to help the people in Louisiana get back on their feet. Those crews are now coming back. And as Jason said, we've got a short-term plan in place to catch up on that capital spend, but our longer-term view of tying up crews and making sure we have the long lead time items ordered give us a great deal of confidence that the capital plan we have is and is going to be achievable."

It's a really unique situation, obviously, in Minnesota with the incremental gas costs from winter storm Uri, the fact that we've got a regular rate case schedule there. And so while we filed a typical rate case, we thought it was prudent to bring forward what we've deemed a rate stabilization plan. And I think what it tries to do is build off of what was just a recent settlement of the last rate case filed in Minnesota. So keeping similar terms on depreciation rates, cost of capital allows us to recover the capital that we will be spending over the next couple of years to improve the safety of our gas systems. 
It differs a little bit of the amortization of some regulatory assets for things like COVID-related costs and some of the incremental O&M that we had anticipated. But we think it puts us in a really good position to continue to improve system safety with our capital investment plans while recognizing the rate impact and trying to moderate that for our customers there in Minnesota. And so early days in terms of the conversations with stakeholders, but we hope that it is seen as a constructive solution in the backdrop of what is a unique situation there in Minnesota."

And as you look at that, I know that's subject to change and who knows what the final version will look like. But I was thinking in particular about, I guess, 2 elements. One would be a tax policy and impacts in terms of cash flow, customer bills, et cetera.

You got to just sort of watch the process happen, but you don't want to do anything sort of concrete until it is set in law and then you can react to it. 
I think directionally, if you look at sort of the renewables and the ESG aspects of it, it's certainly supportive of the direction that we're going. But based on what we see right now, I don't see it accelerating or decelerating anything that we've got on plans. We have, as you know, sort of an industry-leading goal out there of net direct emissions to 0 by 2035. And I think that's a good plan. We're going to stick with it. That's the direction we're headed. If we get some incremental help with what comes out of D.C., we'll take advantage of it. But it isn't going to bump us off course from the direction we're headed right now.

Thanks for the question, Stephen. From a tax standpoint, we are a federal cash taxpayer. Right now as you kind of cut through sort of our financials, there's a lot of sort of onetime items as we've executed on this transition to a pure play regulated utility and we'll continue to see that. As you've kind of cut through that, for us, our effective tax rate from a cash tax standpoint is somewhere between 8% to 10%. So clearly, a minimum tax of 15% would put a little bit of an impact or headwind on the financing plan. We don't think it's certainly something that we can overcome. We don't think it's an impediment to the CapEx plan that we outlined and still feel like we can continue to maintain a strong balance sheet as we outlined and deliver on our $40 billion capital investment plan. 
So early days, we'll follow it, probably not as big an impact to us as maybe some of our peers just given the fact that we have been a federal cash taxpayer, but obviously something we'll continue to monitor."
