Let's begin on Slide 2. We finished a challenging year of a very strong quarter, driving sequential improvements from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and robust free cash",952,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. We finished a challenging year of a very strong quarter, driving sequential improvements from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and robust free cash flow. 
In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, flat year-over-year and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. This result was up 33% sequentially from adjusted EPS of $1.56 in the third quarter. 
Organic sales were down 7% year-over-year, 4 percentage points better than the high end of our guidance range and 7 percentage point sequential improvement from the 14% organic sales decline in the third quarter. We drove double-digit year-over-year organic sales growth in Defense and Space, Fluorine Products and recurring Connected Software sales as well as 27% organic growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions and outstanding results. 
Our cost plans delivered our full year commitment of $1.5 billion in savings and helped us protect margins, limiting our decremental margin in the quarter to only 26%, an improvement from Q3 29% decremental margin. Segment margin contracted 30 basis points year-over-year, a significant improvement from the 130 basis point contraction in the third quarter driven by margin expansion in Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up from $758 million in the third quarter and 9% above Q4 2019, achieving 170% adjusted conversion. 
In terms of capital, we deployed approximately $2.8 billion of cash to dividends, growth CapEx investments, share repurchases and M&A. We'll talk more about our recent M&A activity on the next page. 
For the full year, we deployed $3.7 billion to reduce shares outstanding by approximately 3%. With these strong fourth quarter results, we finished 2020 with $7.10 of adjusted earnings per share and an 11% organic sales decline, both above the high end of our expectations from October. For the full year, we generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow, resulting in adjusted conversion of 105% or 16% of revenue, a very strong result. 
There's no doubt that the COVID-19 crisis created significant challenges for the business and economies around the world. I'm very proud of Honeywell's ability to rise to the challenge to deliver strong execution and sequentially improving results throughout the year. 
Next, let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss our recent M&A activities. I'm pleased with the progress we made in actively shaping our portfolio, and our recent M&A announcements directly align with our ongoing transformation into a premier software industrial company. 
In the fourth quarter, we completed 3 acquisitions and announced the fourth, all of which meet the rigorous criteria in our M&A framework, which ensures that transactions are aligned with our portfolio strategy and meet our return expectations. We have previously discussed the acquisitions of Rocky Research and Ballard Unmanned Systems, which provide emerging technologies aligned to strategic initiatives in our Aerospace business as well as our strategic investment with path to full ownership in Trinity Mobility, which supports our smart cities breakthrough initiative in Honeywell Building Technologies. 
In mid-December, we acquired Sine Group, a technology and software-as-a-service or a SaaS company that provides digital management solutions that are readily accessible for mono devices. Sine's technology will enhance our connected building offerings and will also support a mobile platform for a broader portfolio of Honeywell Forge offerings. We will expand on Sine's features and solutions and make Sine's product available to customers globally. 
Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire Sparta Systems, a leading provider of enterprise quality management software, or QMS, with the life sciences industry for $1.3 billion. We previously highlighted the importance of the life sciences market as a breakthrough growth initiative. The acquisition of Sparta further bolsters our software, controls and analytics capabilities in this space. Sparta's AI-enabled SaaS offering will combine Honeywell Forge to provide greater value to our life sciences and pharma customers. Additionally, Sparta complements our growth strategies for the automation and visualization business within Honeywell Process Solutions, enabling greater penetration in life sciences and the pharma market segments. Sparta will further bolster Honeywell's portfolio of accretive, noncyclical, recurring connected software sales. 
I'm excited about the new technologies and adjacencies we have unlocked through our recent acquisitions and investments. We said before that we have an active M&A pipeline, and this series of acquisitions is further evidence that we are continuously developing our portfolio and investing in new opportunities. 
We also evaluate our portfolio for areas that are no longer core to our long-term objectives. Earlier this week, we signed an agreement to sell our performance and the lifestyle footwear business to a leading manufacturer of premium footwear and apparel, Rocky Brands. The transaction value is approximately $230 million and is scheduled to close by the end of the first quarter. Our SPS business will continue to provide industrial safety footwear for workers. 
M&A is just one important part of our broader capital deployment strategy, which also includes share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. Let's turn to the next slide to view our total capital deployment. 
In 2020, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to identifying and investing in high-return opportunities that help reshape the business to a software-oriented future. Over the past 3 years, we have consistently deployed more than 100% of operating cash flow to fund share repurchases, dividends, M&A and capital expenditure. 2020 was no exception. Even during a global pandemic, we deployed $7.5 billion of capital, essentially equal to the prior 2 years, demonstrating our commitment to investing in high-return opportunities in any environment. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5, where Greg will discuss our execution record in a downturn."

We showed a slide similar to this one during our December investor webcast. And I want to highlight it again here today because I think it nicely summarizes our ability to manage through tough times. Our ex",4061,"Thank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. We showed a slide similar to this one during our December investor webcast. And I want to highlight it again here today because I think it nicely summarizes our ability to manage through tough times. 
Our execution through this year's downturn clearly demonstrates our ability to move quickly and decisively to reduce fixed costs, to protect margins, to ensure liquidity, invest in growth and position ourselves for recovery while at the same time, we maintained focus on our pretransformation initiatives, Honeywell Connected Enterprise, Honeywell Digital and the integrated supply chain. At the beginning of the pandemic, we first acted quickly to address our liquidity and cost structure. Our strong balance sheet provides us with stability as well as the opportunity for investment during challenging times, and as you saw from Darius, we took advantage of that. 
Through a series of actions to further bolster our financial flexibility, we increased our cash and short-term investments from approximately $10 billion at the end of 2019 to over $15 billion by the end of the second quarter, which we maintained through the end of the year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong cash flow and efficiently access the capital markets during even the most disruptive times, all while protecting our debt rating. 
On the cost side, we responded fast and early to the crisis by identifying and delivering on a 2-phase cost program, which achieved $1.5 billion in year-over-year fixed cost savings as we had committed. Approximately 70% of these savings or about $1 billion represent a permanent reduction to our fixed cost base. 
To achieve this, we curtailed discretionary expenses, took temporary actions to reduce costs, including reducing executive and Board pay, and remove significant structural costs through our repositioning programs. Our streamlined cost base positions us well for 2021 recovery and will drive margin expansion across all 4 of our segments as well as capacity for investment as sales recover in 2021 and beyond. 
As Darius described on the previous page, we strategically deployed capital to drive returns and to position our business for future growth. Importantly, we also directed resources to address our customers' COVID-19 challenges around the world. We've deployed additional capital into high-return growth investments to address urgent customer needs, particularly in personal protective equipment and warehouse automation. We're also helping the world cope and recover from the effects of COVID-19 through our new portfolio of healthy solutions. We generated approximately $655 million in sales for our healthy solutions in 2020. And we have a pipeline of approximately $2.1 billion, which will drive growth again in '21. 
As a result of our swift actions during the downturn, 4Q decremental margins were limited to 26%, improving from 33% in 2Q and 29% in 3Q and demonstrating our ability to protect our margins in a very difficult environment. We are clearly well positioned for a variety of outcomes as the recovery progresses into 2021 and beyond. And our shareholders are benefiting from that with a total shareholder return of 23% in 2020, which was over 2x greater than the XLI. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our fourth quarter results in a bit more detail and our 2021 outlook. As Darius highlighted, we delivered a strong fourth quarter to end 2020 with sequential improvement from third quarter on all our key financial metrics. 
Sales declined by 7% organically due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is 4 percentage points better than the high end of our guidance and represents a 7 percentage point sequential improvement from the 14% organic sales decline in the third quarter driven by sequential sales growth from the third quarter in all 4 segments. 
Starting with Aerospace. Fourth quarter sales were down 19% organically, a 6 percentage point sequential improvement from the down 25% we had in the third quarter. Lower commercial aftermarket demand due to the ongoing impact of reduced flight hours and lower volumes in commercial OE equipment was partially offset by double-digit growth in Defense and Space. 
Though still down significantly year-over-year, our commercial aftermarket business did improve sequentially from the third quarter. Our air transport aftermarket business was down 48% organically in the quarter compared to 55% in Q3. And our business aviation aftermarket was down 6% organically compared to 28% in the third quarter. 
Moving on to Building Technologies. Sales declined 4% corporate organically, a 4 percentage point sequential improvement from the 8% down in 3Q. Global Solutions projects were impacted by timing due to the customer order pushouts we saw earlier in the year, which is partially offset by growth in services. Customers are now placing orders for projects that they had previously delayed. As a result, orders in Building Solutions grew 32% year-over-year, and the services backlog was up double digits year-over-year to finish the fourth quarter, position the business well for '21. On the building products side of the portfolio, sales and orders improved sequentially from the third quarter and the commercial fire business returned to year-over-year growth. 
In PMT, sales were down 12% organically, a 4 percentage point sequential improvement from the 16% organic decline in 3Q. Process Solutions was impacted by continued delays in projects and services as well as volume declines in thermal solutions and smart energy due to end market softness. However, Process Solutions orders were up 30% sequentially from Q3. UOP continued to be impacted by weakness in the energy end markets, though sales improved sequentially from the third quarter across the UOP portfolio. And orders were up 21% versus the third quarter as well. 
Finally, Advanced Materials sales increased 8% year-over-year organically driven by growth across the Fluorine Products portfolio, including strong auto and PON demand. 
In SPS, organic sales were up 27% year-over-year, a very strong result to end the year in which the SPS team stepped up to meet unprecedented demand for critical safety products. Intelligrated and personal protective equipment led the way with another quarter of double-digit organic growth, followed by high single-digit growth in productivity solutions and services. We are encouraged by the turnaround that team has orchestrated in 2020. SPS exited 2020 with a backlog of approximately $4 billion, which was nearly double our backlog at the end of 2019, placing the business in a very strong position to start 2021, where we expect to see a robust first half in particular. 
Overall, we expanded margins year-over-year in 3 of the 4 segments: Aerospace, HBT and SPS, limiting Honeywell's overall segment margin contraction to 30 basis points and ending the quarter with a segment margin of 21.1%. This was a sequential improvement of 120 basis points from 3Q segment margins of 19.9%, an improvement of 260 basis points from the 2Q trough, demonstrating the effectiveness of our response to the pandemic, in particular, our cost actions and operational rigor. 
We delivered cost actions in the fourth quarter that brought us to $1.5 billion of savings for the year, right at the stated range that we had highlighted earlier, limiting our full year margin contraction to 70 basis points despite the challenging operating environment. 
We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, flat year-over-year and up 33% sequentially from adjusted EPS of $1.56 in the third quarter. This result was $0.05 above the high end of our guidance driven by higher segment profit due to better-than-expected sales volumes in Aerospace, HBT and SPS. Given the strength we saw in the fourth quarter, we were able to make discrete investments in the business and our employees, including in IT, marketing spend for Forge and brand expansion in the Middle East and China as well as a special $500 recognition award for our IST frontline production and production support employees, who performed so greatly and well through this crisis. 
Repositioning was lower than in 4Q a year ago as expected, driving a $0.15 year-over-year tailwind below the line. Interest income and foreign currency were lower than 4Q '19, driving a $0.07 headwind below the line, which was offset by higher pension income. Our effective tax rate and share count were also lower than in the fourth quarter of '19, driving $0.02 and $0.04 of EPS [indiscernible], respectively. A bridge from 4Q '19 adjusted earnings per share to 4Q '20 can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
I am also proud to report that our fourth quarter cash flow generation is very strong. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow, up 9% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted free cash flow conversion of 170%. Free cash flow and conversion both improved year-over-year due to working capital improvements, including [ introduction ] and strong collections. Our teams put an extra focus on cash in the fourth quarter and really delivered, and we expect to continue this progress in '21, particularly on inventory. 
In terms of capital deployment, we paid approximately $670 million in dividends, repurchased $1.6 billion in Honeywell shares, over-delivering on our commitment of 1% share count reduction in 2020. We invested approximately $300 million in CapEx and deployed over $250 million to complete 3 acquisitions. So all in all, a very strong fourth quarter to close out 2020. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to talk about our 2021 planning assumptions. We hope and expect that the worse is behind us as we move on from 2020. We're seeing promising signs of the recovery unfolding, but there continue to be a few key uncertainties to be mindful of. 
Over the past couple of months, we've seen governments around the world approve multiple effective COVID-19 vaccines and begin rolling them out. Our current view of '21 assumes the vaccines are widely distributed, leading to lower manageable infection rates over time and allowing the global economy to largely be open and stabilize. 
However, many regions have recently been coping with a new wave of infections and lockdown, new COVID strains and vaccine distribution challenges. So it remains unclear when exactly infection rates will slow down materially and the economic recovery will really accelerate. 
As a macro planning assumption, we're expecting the recovery to be weighted to the second half of the year and are expecting to experience a little bit of a slower start in 1Q. We're assuming fiscal stimulus remain supportive of the economy in '21. We do expect passengers will begin flying more freely again as the vaccine rollout begins, leading to a modest improvement in global flight hours in the first half and acceleration in the second half. So this is one area where we are seeing some renewed softness, particularly in China and APAC, as the year begins. We also expect stability in defense budget spending. And finally, we assume improved macro conditions broadly will drive moderate increase in oil consumption in the second half of the year. 
Given that, let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss our markets and segment outlook. Starting in Aerospace. The previously mentioned increase in flight hours as the pandemic subsides will gradually lead to improvements in our commercial aerospace business as aftermarket demand accelerates, particularly in the second half. However, we expect recovery in the commercial OE business to lag the commercial aftermarket recovery due to a gradual ramp in commercial OEM build rates. 
Stable defense spending should support continued growth in our Defense and Space business at a reduced pace versus the double-digit growth we experienced in 2020. In total, we expect the Aerospace business to be flat to up low single digits in '21. 
In HBT, we expect the nonresidential market to remain relatively stable in '21. We anticipate solid demand for building products and management systems in key verticals, including data centers, warehousing and health care. However, in other verticals, including hospitality and commercial officers, we expect them to remain challenged as the world recovers from the effects of the pandemic. These challenges will be partially offset by the traction we have gaining over the past couple of quarters with our healthy building solutions with key wins in education, commercial offices, health care and some government verticals. 
Our solutions address key customer concerns, including air quality, social distancing and controlled and cautious access, and we expect continued demand through the year. Building Solutions ended 2020 with a quarter of strong year-over-year orders growth, which positions the business well for '21. And we expect customers to continue placing orders that they deferred in '20 as the macro economy recovers. 
We also have a robust services backlog that is up strong double digits year-over-year and will support 2021 growth. We don't expect building access to be a significant issue in '21, so we don't anticipate any material challenges getting on sites to complete projects. In total, we expect HBT to grow low single digits for the year. 
In PMT, we expect the oil and gas and petrochemical markets to remain relatively flat, with oil consumption picking up slightly in the second half. We expect the HPS recovery to be led by our large backlog of global mega projects and the product businesses. 
In UOP, we expect the energy markets to remain challenged through the year, particularly in the first half. However, we expect business conditions will recover sooner for petrochemical, oil and gas. We anticipate increasing investments in renewable fuels, which will drive demand for our new Sustainable Technology Solutions business and partially offset challenges in the oil and gas market. 
In addition, the specialty chemicals market is expected to grow modestly in '21, with strength in global health care, automotive and residential construction end markets driving demand for advanced materials. Overall, we expect TNT to be down slightly to up low single digits for the year. 
Lastly, in SPS, we expect continued strength in warehouse automation and personal protective equipment as we execute the delivery of our robust backlog. We also expect productivity solutions and services to grow as the strategic turnaround of the business drives market share gains, and we expect gas sensing to recover in line with the market. In total, we expect SPS to grow double digits in '21 with comps getting [indiscernible] in the back half as we lap strong growth from the back half of 2020. 
So overall, we see improvement across most of our key end markets in '21 and we have confidence in our continued operational execution. The pace of the recovery may vary due to the items we discussed on the prior slide, so we are taking a cautious approach as we begin the year. 
Now let's move to Slide 9 to discuss how these dynamics come together for our 2021 financial guidance. For 2021, we expect sales of $33.4 billion to $34.4 billion, which represents overall organic growth -- sales growth in the range of 1% to 4%, reflecting double-digit recurring connected software growth and the impact of our announced M&A divestitures. Segment margins are expected to expand 30 to 70 basis points, supported by higher sales volume and our streamlined fixed cost base following 2020 cost actions with investment for growth. 
While we expect margin expansion across all the businesses, SPS will lead the path as we scale up capacity and become more efficient, followed by aero driven by high-margin aftermarket recovery. These organic growth and segment margin expectations are consistent with our long-term commitments for low to mid-single-digit organic growth and 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion and give us flexibility to deliver earnings growth and invest for the future. 
2020 was a challenging year, but we'll be back on track to deliver our standard commitment to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. So net below the line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $130 million to positive $20 million, which includes capacity for $400 million to $525 million of repositioning. 
We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% and a weighted average share count of approximately 705 million for the year, representing our minimum 1% reduction in shares. As a result, we are guiding earnings per share of $7.60 to $8, up 7% to 13% adjusted. 
We see free cash flow in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion in 2021. That represents cash margins of 15% to 16% of sales commensurate with the 2019 and 2020 rates that we have demonstrated and a cash conversion in the 95% range. Keeping in mind that our conversion, excluding noncash pension income, would actually be approaching 115%, so very healthy on numbers overall. 
This range does include $375 million that we expect to receive in an upfront payment from Garrett, resulting from their proposed plan of reorganization. We'll continue to include cash receipts from Garrett going forward within free cash flow in order to be comparable to prior periods, where the cash proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreement were recognized. 
And just to spend a minute on that topic, we are pleased that Garrett has agreed to the plan of reorganization, under which they will be recapitalized and well positioned to meet their obligations, including those to Honeywell and will avoid costly litigation. We believe this is the right path forward that maximizes value for all stakeholders. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10 and walk through our 2021 EPS stage. Segment profit is expected to be the key driver of our earnings growth. Higher sales volumes, commercial excellence, continued productivity improvements and ongoing benefits from previously funded repositioning will contribute $0.54 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. 
The impact of our acquisitions of Sparta, Sine and Rocky Research and the divestiture of the retail footwear business will drive a $0.07 headwind at the midpoint. Below the line and other items are expected to be a $0.22 benefit per share at the midpoint of our guidance primarily driven by higher pension income in '21 compared to 2020. 
I'd like to take a moment to discuss those pension dynamics in a little bit more detail. We expect approximately $1.1 billion of pension and OPEB income in '21, up approximately $260 million from 2020 with the majority of this increase related to our U.S. country brand. 
We have derisked our U.S. pension plan to approximately 60% of planned assets being a more conservative fixed income-like assets and the remainder in return-seeking assets. As a result of another strong portfolio performance in 2020, our funds returned approximately 14% increase in our pension asset base compared to the prior year. This higher asset base, combined with lower discount rate, is driving higher income in 2021. Our diligent management and strong returns have been an important value driver for the company, putting us in a position where our pension-funded status continues to be robust, ending the year at 113%. 
For taxes, we expect an effective tax rate of 21% to 22%, which would result in a $0.06 headwind per share at the midpoint. And finally, our base case is that our share repurchase program will result in a benefit of $0.07 per share as we reduce our weighted outage share count from 711 million to at least 705 million shares. So in total, we expect 2021 earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $8, up 7% to 13% year-over-year adjusted, nearly back to 2019 levels. 
Now let's turn to Slide 11 for a preview of the first quarter. As I noted earlier, we're entering 1Q with a cautious stance as the environment continues to evolve real-time, which is driving a wider-than-usual range for a quarter. 
We expect organic growth in the first quarter in the range of down 10% to down 5% organically, which brackets our fourth quarter sales growth performance, recognizing market conditions could vary. The year-over-year sales decline will be driven by continued headwinds in commercial aerospace and UOP, partially offset by ongoing strength in warehouse automation, PPE and advanced materials as well as gradual recovery in other areas of the portfolio. 
Keep in mind, 1Q will be our toughest comp for the year across all 4 segments since the first quarter of last year was only partially disrupted by the COVID pandemic. We expect segment margins in the range of 20.4% to 20.9% in the first quarter, slightly below the fourth quarter based on lower sales leverage given our usual sequential step down in sales from 4Q, partially offset by ongoing productivity. That represents year-over-year segment margin contraction of 140 to 90 basis points. We have positioned ourselves with a streamlined fixed cost base for '21 and expect sequential segment margin improvement from the second quarter on. 
The net below-the-line impact is expected to be between a $40 million expense and a $5 million benefit with a range of repositioning between $100 million and $140 million as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring programs. We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%, and the average share count to be approximately 705 million shares. As a result, we expect first quarter earnings per share between $1.68 and $1.83, down 24% to 17% year-on-year. 
Now let's take a moment to walk through our expectations by segment. In Aerospace, we expect first quarter global flight hours to remain relatively flat from the fourth quarter. We could see a step back in 1Q in certain regions, given the flare-up in infection rates over the holidays. As a result, we expect current softness in flight hours to continue impacting our air transport and business aviation market sales in the first quarter. 
In addition, lower air transport OEM build rates and lower business jet demand will continue to impact our commercial original equipment business. We expect the sensing space to partially offset the challenges in commercial aerospace, supported by stable U.S. defense setting. 
In Building Technologies, we expect business conditions to remain similar to conditions in the fourth quarter. We don't expect significant issues accessing our customer sites, as I mentioned earlier, which will enable us to deliver projects as normal. 
Our strong Building Solutions services backlog should drive growth in the quarter, and we expect demand for building products to continue improving. In addition, we expect continued customer momentum with our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions. 
In PMT, we expect continued customer CapEx and OpEx budget reduction and project delays to impact the engineering and licensing business in UOP and projects and services in HPS. In UOP, we expect continued weakness in gas processing and lower catalyst shipments due to the lower production and refining volumes. However, we do expect to see some demand return in Process Solutions product businesses. And we expect another strong quarter in advanced materials driven by continued demand in Fluorine Products. 
Finally, we expect continued strength in STS with another quarter of double-digit growth in Intelligrated and personal protective equipment. Our personal protective equipment backlog remains up triple digits year-over-year, and our Intelligrated backlog is over $2.5 billion, giving us confidence for the first quarter and the full year. 
[indiscernible] to these solutions and services, we expect continued growth driven by market share gains and low inventory levels in the channel due to favorable sales out of distributors. While macro conditions continue to put pressure on the sensing and IoT and gas sensing businesses, we expect strong overall SPS sales growth for the first quarter. 
Now before I turn it back to Darius, let's look at Slide 12 and talk through the ultimate measure of our performance through this crisis: total shareholder return. We're creating shareholder value and outperforming the industry in the broader market in all environments. 
If you look at this chart, you'll see that Honeywell has shown remarkable consistency, outperforming both versus the SLI and the Dow Jones Industrial average, indicative of the outstanding resiliency of the company. Investors can depend on Honeywell to generate superior returns compared to the benchmarks regardless of market timing due to our rigorous and proven value creation framework as well as the Honeywell Operating System. 
This crisis reinforced the fact that our value creation framework, which we discussed at length in our December investor webcast, is highly effective in delivering consistent outperformance in all marketing conditions. In fact, this framework drove Honeywell's shareholder returns above both the XLI and Dow Jones Industrial average again in 2020. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius."

Honeywell's committed to corporate social responsibility and community involvement, which we demonstrate through unique global programs to look to improve lives and inspire change in the communities around the world. 
Beyond these programs, we acted quickly throughout the course of the pandemic to address the needs of our employees, communities and customers. A few of our more recent actions are shown on the slide. 
Most recently, we announced our participation in a unique public-private partnership, backed by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, to help support the goal of 1 million COVID-19 B vaccinations by July 4, 2021. We are partnered with Atrium Health, sports and entertainment, the Charlotte Motor Speedway, the State of North Carolina to administer the vaccine, manage complex logistics and to provide operational support for mass vaccination events. We're very proud to be part of this effort to prevent further spread of the virus by helping frontline workers and other members of our communities get vaccinated. 
Another recent example of Honeywell's contribution to our communities is the important mask delivery milestone we achieved in December. We [indiscernible] more than 225 million face masks that will protect workers in their response to COVID-19. We delivered N95 respirators and surgical face masks to multiple locations in the U.S. for health care systems, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
In addition, we shipped millions of masks to both state and local governments. We're proud of these contributions and our role in providing much-needed PPE to workers wound the country responding to the pandemic. 
Finally, we're also committed to recognizing and respond the needs of our employees. We recently recognized the dedication and strength of our own frontline integrated supply chain production teams, who have been instrumental in keeping our manufacturing sites running safely, enabling us to meet critical customer needs during these unprecedented times. To show our appreciation, we announced a special $500 recognition award for each of our frontline production and production support employees. We continue to be inspired by the members of our integrated supply chain team, who have truly gone above and beyond to support our customers throughout this dynamic. 
Now let's wrap on Slide 14. There's no doubt that 2020 was a challenging year.  However, we effectively managed through the downturn, the repercussions of the global pandemic by focusing on liquidity, cost management, strong operational execution and investment for the future. We drove sequential improvement from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow, creating good momentum into 2021. 
The past year was another proof point that the Honeywell value creation framework delivers outperformance even in the most challenging economic and market conditions. We continue to invest in organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the downturn to high-return CapEx and M&A, positioning ourselves for the future and the recovery to come. These growth investments will help us solve challenging problems for our customers, address critical global sustainability issues and drive superior shareholder returns. 
I am proud of Honeywell's rapid and effective response to the challenges of 2020. Our employees around the world worked hard to quickly adapt and deliver through the crisis, including ramping up production of critical PPE and developing a portfolio of healthy solutions and delivering growth in multiple areas of the portfolio. We are well positioned for a recovery in the second half of 2021 and beyond as demonstrated by our expectation to return to our key long-term growth commitments in 2021. 
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

As we know the UOP business particularly is lumpy, and the mix of the catalyst ship can vary dramatically. 
I think if you look at overall, COVID is a big play in this. And I would say, especially as you compare the COVID situation early in Q4 versus where we are now, we're in a much worse place. I mean, that's -- so obviously, that has some light on that. And frankly, we really thought about whether or not we should guide Q1 at all. I mean, I think that we're in a place that the level of infection throughout the world is the highest it's ever been right now, and there's a lot of uncertainty. But we thought we'd give sort of our best effort and provide a little wider range than normal to give our investors some of our best really educated view of where we think we're going to end up. But there's a lot -- there's more uncertainty this quarter. Greg, I don't know if you want to add?"

So yes, to Darius' point, I just think there are some things out there that are really kind of hard to predict. But as I said in my remarks, I mean, the down 10 to down 5 kind of brackets, the down 7 we had in the fourth quarter, the down 10 is in case something gets worse that we don't really can see at this moment. But it could be better than that if things progress. 
So no, nothing -- there's nothing strange. I mean, we always have a fourth quarter to 1Q decremental sequential sales. 4Q is always our strongest quarter. So nothing unusual in there."

And if sales actually turns to be better, I think 2 things can happen. One, we can convert at a bit of a higher rate. But two, we may invest more back in the business. We have some important things to get done in Aerospace from an R&D perspective. We are funding some of that already. If things get better than we think, then we could let the line out a little bit further. 
So if you look at our conversion in the last 3 quarters of this guide, it's really converting at like 37%. Just the math says, a 37% conversion rate in Q2 through 4 with this guide. So we think it's a pretty strong rating conversion as it stands right now, and we're trying to give ourselves optionality to both deliver earnings as well as make sure we've got some room for investments."

First of all, Steve, if you take a look at our conversion rate for 2021 versus that was deconversion or deleverage ratio is better, right? And it's -- and we project that in Q2 to Q4. 
The wildcard in a lot of this is aero aftermarket, right? I mean, that is probably the single hardest number for us to call because it is directly correlated to vaccinations and the speed of those vaccinations and rollout. If that comes in better than we're projecting, then obviously, there is upside to the margin rate. If it doesn't, well, then probably going to be [indiscernible] in the mid- to lower end. 
But I think it's really important to note something else, Steve, which is if you look at the upper end of our margin rate for 2021, I mean, we get back to 2019 levels. I mean, so basically, we're kind of taking a 1-year break. And initially, there were discussions about whether would take us 3 years or 2 years to get back to that. And we're kind of getting up on the EPS range and so on pretty much to 2019. And of course, so it's sort of a 1-year break. 
But as usual, we're trying to be prudent in our planning this early on in the year with these many unknowns with the vaccine at levels the world has never seen. So we're trying to net that into our guidance. And obviously, we're going to provide you more clarity as the year progresses."

The reason is that we're just booking an incredible amount of greenfield projects. 
You saw that there was another incredibly robust year in terms of bookings. We expect double-digit growth again. And particularly, what's really important is to look at the ratio of our aftermarket business to our projects business. And as you can imagine, it's not changing or if anything, probably the projects are growing that much faster than aftermarket. So obviously, that was going to see pressure on the margin. 
But we should view that as a good news thing because as I explained this before, eventually, when the growth slows down, the growth rate will be slower, but the margin rate will be higher. But we're still going to be very much in this greenfield expansion mode for the next [ 2 ] years, which means higher growth rates, lower margins, which over time is going to moderate to lower high top line growth rates and higher margins. So that's sort of how that business is going to grow. 
What's really encouraging here is the amount of share that we're gaining in the market. There's -- unquestionably, this business is winning and winning big in the market."

HP as we kind of know roughly what we're going to do, which is growth. 
UOP is a little bit of an unknown, right? Because what we've seen can happen is that a lot of the catalyst loads or reloads get pinched out or projects get pushed out. To give me some comfort is that our bookings in the backlog are a higher entering 2021 versus what they were 2020. So I am cautiously optimistic. It's -- we're going to see the growth piece. 
But we've also seen some pushouts of particularly catalyst roads and delay in projects. If that happens, obviously, we're going to have to see pressure from the UOP side. And frankly, the price of oil is at a reasonable number right now. It's not in the 30s or 40s. Now it's in the 50s, which is quite receptive to investment. 
What worries me is that a lot of the big oil and gas majors who are our customers set their budgets just like we do in Q4 of 2020. So -- and they've announced some pretty big cuts. So what we don't know fully is are those -- are there going to be adjustments made based on the economic conditions, based on adjustments to those budgets? There is a point, there is definitely a pent-up demand because you can't underfund this marketplace for too long. 
So whether that happens in the second half of this year or 2022, that story's yet to be told. But what we don't know is we still have a lot of sort of bookings that we expect for the second half that we have visibility to, but they need to land. And that's why we provided the guide we did because we don't know whether or not they will land or don't get pushed out to '22. 
But I have zeroed out, and I mean zeroed out because I was in this business in '15 and '16 that there will be a big reinvestment cycle because you can't starve this market for so long. And that's why it's sort of -- we can debate when it will come, but there's no -- undoubtedly what will happen."

So that's been an impact to the PMT margins when you take away the catalyst business. And that becomes a bigger share of the overall PMT -- or sorry, the PMT mix in UOP in particular."

I understand it probably varies by business. Obviously, a lot of different end markets there. But can you talk a little bit about how adoption has fared and customer conversations are going. I would imagine with folks starting to pivot back to growth or investment as they expect COVID to get resolved, that those should be accelerating. But as you mentioned a few times, Darius, there's an awful lot of complexity, and cases are actually worse. But how is that adoption going? And is that trend line moving higher as people are thinking about kind of post-COVID digital transformation?"

I wasn't -- I think we actually had a very reasonable year in 2020 despite some of the challenged markets we're in. But just to give you a couple of rough numbers, if you think about our overall software growth, it was mid-single-digit even in the 2020 environment. 
And then for recurring growth, because frankly, we're sacrificing some top line growth because we're really converting our entire Forge business, Forge software business is fully sold as a SaaS offer. That actually grew in the teens last year. So that was a very good year, and we actually -- we expect an acceleration on both of those figures for 2021. 
But 2020, for me, was a really good proof point. This business is acyclical. And as we continue, particularly to build that recurring revenue base, which is growing more than 2x our sort of traditional software base, it's going to be a great tailwind for the future of Honeywell and the future of that software business. And with offerings like we just talked about in connected buildings and our cyber offerings, I'm quite confident that it's going to continue to grow at that kind of base. So the short story is we're seeing more traction, and we're winning more accounts."

As it relates to working cap and what's happening there, yes, I mean, obviously, sales came down substantially this year and both with some transformation and effectiveness in our process as well as harvesting receivables. We had a very big cash flow from AR this year. We started to see some of the inventory come down in 4Q. For the year, it was still a build. 
And so when we think about next year, that's the area that I expect us to make more progress is on inventory and start seeing some inventory reductions, again, even in the face of sales growth. And so I think you're going to see we're world-class on payables. We'll continue to make some steady progress as we do each year. We'll make some progress on our programs around transforming on our credit to collections aspects. And so I would expect we'll make some more progress on past dues and DSO, but the big effort is really going to be focused around inventory in 2021."

Frankly, the receivables performance was outstanding. We're not sure if that can be replicated. We're certainly going to try, but we're going to focus on some other app elements. 
I'd also say we've done a nice job on advances on build, too, in terms of 2020. So I thought that this performance on cash was exceptional. 
And if you really take a look at, especially if you adjust for pension or take a look at our cash generation as a percent of our revenue, you'll find that we're in the top quartile performance. And that's certainly..."

I can't remember the last time we put anything substantive into our pension fund, which obviously would take away from our ability to deploy capital into things that are going to drive growth. 
So that's when I say it's a value driver, particularly vis-a-vis others, it's a huge value driver. And in that case, in particular, so that's -- and yes, it's 113% funded. I feel great about where that is. Even if we were to have a bit of a market down draft, we would still be in a very good position in terms of that funding level.

But I think what our investors should really remember is that when they think about pension, particularly given the derisking that we have and the amount of fixed instruments that we have there, this should be completely worry free for them because even a huge adjustment in the stock market is not going to put us in peril. So I just think that this is sort of a safe haven in terms of an area that, frankly, is a big question mark for a lot of companies out there. For us, it's a big positive, and it's going to stay that way for the foreseeable future."

And the direction of that is clear. It's going to be renewables. Energy is going to become much, much more prevalent part of the future. 
But it's also not going to be immediate. It's not going to happen in 2022 or '23, and it's going to be a slow, gradual progress. So a lot of the things that UOP still does will become relevant, particularly where a big part of that business being around gas, natural gas, which we know is the cleanness of the hydrocarbon. So that's Phase 1. 
So I think that we've got to continue to serve our customer base. And frankly, many of them will be transforming in terms of how they provide energy to the world. 
The second part, as you know, we've launched a new business within UOP called the Sustainability Technology Solutions business, which is going to become a bigger and bigger and bigger part of the UOP portfolio. And it really has 3 primary growth levers. One is energy storage, which is economically feasible and viable. And we're building and deploying our first prototype event this year. So it's not a dream. Two is 360-degree plastics recyclability, which also we're going to be deploying from technology this year. And then last one, where we're really the pioneers, which is eco finding, which is going to become a bigger, bigger part of the refining footprint. 
So we've got 3 sort of -- this is under one business umbrella, and that's going to become our growth engine for the future. So what I envision happening is potentially, longer term, some of the more hydrocarbon-oriented offerings will slowly, and I emphasize that, would very slowly decline while our Sustainability Technology Solutions business will grow very, very quickly. That's sort of how I see that business evolving. That's why we -- this is another place we're investing, put our dollars to work. 
And we're excited about the future and the kinds of solutions that we have. And as you know, we don't have better scientists anywhere in our company than in UOP when it comes to material science. So I'm quite confident that some of these technology breakthroughs will work and will really enable a path to the future energy footprint of the world."

Let's begin on Slide 2. We finished a challenging year of a very strong quarter, driving sequential improvements from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and robust free cash",953,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. We finished a challenging year of a very strong quarter, driving sequential improvements from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and robust free cash flow.  
In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, flat year-over-year and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. This result was up 33% sequentially from adjusted EPS of $1.56 in the third quarter.  
Organic sales were down 7% year-over-year, 4 percentage points better than the high end of our guidance range and 7 percentage point sequential improvement from the 14% organic sales decline in the third quarter. We drove double-digit year-over-year organic sales growth in Defense and Space, Fluorine Products and recurring Connected Software sales as well as 27% organic growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions and outstanding results.  
Our cost plans delivered our full year commitment of $1.5 billion in savings and helped us protect margins, limiting our decremental margin in the quarter to only 26%, an improvement from Q3 29% decremental margin. Segment margin contracted 30 basis points year-over-year, a significant improvement from the 130 basis point contraction in the third quarter, driven by margin expansion in Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up from $758 million in the third quarter and 9% above Q4 2019, achieving 170% adjusted conversion.  
In terms of capital, we deployed approximately $2.8 billion of cash to dividends, growth CapEx investments, share repurchases and M&A. We'll talk more about our recent M&A activity on the next page.  
For the full year, we deployed $3.7 billion to reduce shares outstanding by approximately 3%. With these strong fourth quarter results, we finished 2020 with $7.10 of adjusted earnings per share and an 11% organic sales decline, both above the high end of our expectations from October. For the full year, we generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow, resulting in adjusted conversion of 105% or 16% of revenue, a very strong result.  
There's no doubt that the COVID-19 crisis created significant challenges for the business and economies around the world. I'm very proud of Honeywell's ability to rise to the challenge to deliver strong execution and sequentially improving results throughout the year.  
Next, let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss our recent M&A activities. I'm pleased with the progress we made in actively shaping our portfolio, and our recent M&A announcements directly align with our ongoing transformation into a premier software industrial company.  
In the fourth quarter, we completed 3 acquisitions and announced the fourth, all of which meet the rigorous criteria in our M&A framework, which ensures that transactions are aligned with our portfolio strategy and meet our return expectations. We have previously discussed the acquisitions of Rocky Research and Ballard Unmanned Systems, which provide emerging technologies aligned to strategic initiatives in our Aerospace business as well as our strategic investment with path to full ownership in Trinity Mobility, which supports our smart cities breakthrough initiative in Honeywell Building Technologies.  
In mid-December, we acquired Sine Group, a technology and software-as-a-service or a SaaS company that provides digital management solutions that are readily accessible with mobile devices. Sine's technology will enhance our connected building offerings and will also support a mobile platform for a broader portfolio of Honeywell Forge offerings. We will expand on Sine's features and solutions and make Sine's product available to customers globally.  
Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire Sparta Systems, a leading provider of enterprise quality management software, or QMS, with the life sciences industry for $1.3 billion. We previously highlighted the importance of the life sciences market as a breakthrough growth initiative. The acquisition of Sparta further bolsters our software, controls and analytics capabilities in this space. Sparta's AI-enabled SaaS offering will combine with Honeywell Forge to provide greater value to our life sciences and pharma customers. Additionally, Sparta complements our growth strategies for the automation and visualization business within Honeywell Process Solutions, enabling greater penetration in life sciences and the pharma market segments. Sparta will further bolster Honeywell's portfolio of accretive, noncyclical, recurring connected software sales.  
I'm excited about the new technologies and adjacencies we have unlocked through our recent acquisitions and investments. We said before that we have an active M&A pipeline, and this series of acquisitions is further evidence that we are continuously developing our portfolio and investing in new opportunities.  
We also evaluate our portfolio for areas that are no longer core to our long-term objectives. Earlier this week, we signed an agreement to sell our performance and the lifestyle footwear business to a leading manufacturer of premium footwear and apparel, Rocky Brands. The transaction value is approximately $230 million and is scheduled to close by the end of the first quarter. Our SPS business will continue to provide industrial safety footwear for workers.  
M&A is just one important part of our broader capital deployment strategy, which also includes share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. Let's turn to the next slide to view our total capital deployment.  
In 2020, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to identifying and investing in high-return opportunities that help reshape the business for a software-oriented future. Over the past 3 years, we have consistently deployed more than 100% of operating cash flow to fund share repurchases, dividends, M&A and capital expenditure. 2020 was no exception.  
Even during a global pandemic, we deployed $7.5 billion of capital, essentially equal to the prior 2 years, demonstrating our commitment to investing in high-return opportunities in any environment.  
Now let's turn to Slide 5, where Greg will discuss our execution record in a downturn."

We showed a slide similar to this one during our December investor webcast. And I want to highlight it again here today because I think it nicely summarizes our ability to manage through tough times.  
Our execution through this year's downturn clearly demonstrates our ability to move quickly and decisively to reduce fixed costs, to protect margins, to ensure liquidity, invest in growth and position ourselves for recovery, while at the same time, we maintained focus on our pretransformation initiatives, Honeywell Connected Enterprise, Honeywell Digital and the integrated supply chain. At the beginning of the pandemic, we first acted quickly to address our liquidity and cost structure. Our strong balance sheet provides us with stability as well as the opportunity for investment during challenging times, and as you saw from Darius, we took advantage of that.  
Through a series of actions to further bolster our financial flexibility, we increased our cash and short-term investments from approximately $10 billion at the end of 2019 to over $15 billion by the end of the second quarter, which we maintained through the end of the year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong cash flow and efficiently access the capital markets during even the most disruptive times, all while protecting our debt rating.  
On the cost side, we responded fast and early to the crisis by identifying and delivering on a 2-phase cost program, which achieved $1.5 billion in year-over-year fixed cost savings as we had committed. Approximately 70% of these savings or about $1 billion represent a permanent reduction to our fixed cost base.  
To achieve this, we curtailed discretionary expenses, took temporary actions to reduce costs, including reducing executive and Board pay, and remove significant structural costs through our repositioning programs. Our streamlined cost base positions us well for 2021 recovery and will drive margin expansion across all 4 of our segments as well as capacity for investment as sales recover in 2021 and beyond.  
As Darius described on the previous page, we strategically deployed capital to drive returns and to position our business for future growth. Importantly, we also directed resources to address our customers' COVID-19 challenges around the world. We've deployed additional capital into high-return growth investments to address urgent customer needs, particularly in personal protective equipment and warehouse automation. We're also helping the world cope and recover from the effects of COVID-19 through our new portfolio of healthy solutions. We generated approximately $655 million in sales for our healthy solutions in 2020. And we have a pipeline of approximately $2.1 billion, which will drive growth again in '21.  
As a result of our swift actions during the downturn, 4Q decremental margins were limited to 26%, improving from 33% in 2Q and 29% in 3Q and demonstrating our ability to protect our margins in a very difficult environment. We are clearly well positioned for a variety of outcomes as the recovery progresses into 2021 and beyond. And our shareholders are benefiting from that with a total shareholder return of 23% in 2020, which was over 2x greater than the XLI.  
Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our fourth quarter results in a bit more detail and our 2021 outlook. As Darius highlighted, we delivered a strong fourth quarter to end 2020 with sequential improvement from third quarter on all our key financial metrics.  
Sales declined by 7% organically due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is 4 percentage points better than the high end of our guidance and represents a 7 percentage point sequential improvement from the 14% organic sales decline in the third quarter, driven by sequential sales growth from the third quarter in all 4 segments.  
Starting with Aerospace. Fourth quarter sales were down 19% organically, a 6 percentage point sequential improvement from the down 25% we had in the third quarter. Lower commercial aftermarket demand due to the ongoing impact of reduced flight hours and lower volumes in commercial OE equipment was partially offset by double-digit growth in Defense & Space.  
Though still down significantly year-over-year, our commercial aftermarket business did improve sequentially from the third quarter. Our air transport aftermarket business was down 48% organically in the quarter compared to 55% in Q3. And our business aviation aftermarket was down 6% organically compared to 28% in the third quarter.  
Moving on to Building Technologies. Sales declined 4% organically, a 4 percentage point sequential improvement from the 8% down in 3Q. Global solutions projects were impacted by timing due to the customer order pushouts we saw earlier in the year, which is partially offset by growth in services. Customers are now placing orders for projects that they had previously delayed. As a result, orders in Building Solutions grew 32% year-over-year, and the services backlog was up double digits year-over-year to finish the fourth quarter, position the business well for '21.  
On the building products side of the portfolio, sales and orders improved sequentially from the third quarter and the commercial fire business returned to year-over-year growth.  
In PMT, sales were down 12% organically, a 4 percentage point sequential improvement from the 16% organic decline in 3Q. Process Solutions was impacted by continued delays in projects and services as well as volume declines in thermal solutions and smart energy due to end market softness. However, process solutions orders were up 30% sequentially from Q3. UOP continued to be impacted by weakness in the energy end markets, though sales improved sequentially from the third quarter across the UOP portfolio. And orders were up 21% versus the third quarter as well.  
Finally, Advanced Materials sales increased 8% year-over-year organically, driven by growth across the Fluorine Products portfolio, including strong auto and on demand.  
In SPS, organic sales were up 27% year-over-year, a very strong result to end the year in which the SPS team stepped up to meet unprecedented demand for critical safety products. Intelligrated and personal protective equipment led the way with another quarter of double-digit organic growth, followed by high single-digit growth in productivity solutions and services. We are encouraged by the turnaround that team has orchestrated in 2020. SPS exited 2020 with a backlog of approximately $4 billion, which was nearly double our backlog at the end of 2019, placing the business in a very strong position to start 2021, where we expect to see a robust first half in particular.  
Overall, we expanded margins year-over-year in 3 of the 4 segments: Aerospace, HBT and SPS, limiting Honeywell's overall segment margin contraction to 30 basis points and ending the quarter with a segment margin of 21.1%. This was a sequential improvement of 120 basis points from 3Q segment margins of 19.9%, an improvement of 260 basis points from the 2Q trough, demonstrating the effectiveness of our response to the pandemic, in particular, our cost actions and operational rigor.  
We delivered cost actions in the fourth quarter that brought us to $1.5 billion of savings for the year, right at the stated range that we had highlighted earlier, limiting our full year margin contraction to 70 basis points despite the challenging operating environment. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, flat year-over-year and up 33% sequentially from adjusted EPS of $1.56 in the third quarter. This result was $0.05 above the high end of our guidance, driven by higher segment profit due to better-than-expected sales volumes in Aerospace, HBT and SPS. Given the strength we saw in the fourth quarter, we were able to make discrete investments in the business and our employees, including in IT, marketing spend for Forge and brand expansion in the Middle East and China as well as a special $500 recognition award for our IST frontline production and production support employees, who performed so greatly and well through this crisis.  
Repositioning was lower than in 4Q a year ago as expected, driving a $0.15 year-over-year tailwind below the line. Interest income and foreign currency were lower than 4Q '19, driving a $0.07 headwind below the line, which was offset by higher pension income. Our effective tax rate and share count were also lower than in the fourth quarter of '19, driving $0.02 and $0.04 of EPS benefit, respectively. A bridge from 4Q '19 adjusted earnings per share to 4Q '20 can be found in the appendix of this presentation.  
I am also proud to report that our fourth quarter cash flow generation is very strong. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow, up 9% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted free cash flow conversion of 170%. Free cash flow and conversion both improved year-over-year due to working capital improvements, including [ introduction ] and strong collections. Our teams put an extra focus on cash in the fourth quarter and really delivered, and we expect to continue this progress in '21, particularly on inventory.  
In terms of capital deployment, we paid approximately $670 million in dividends, repurchased $1.6 billion in Honeywell shares, over-delivering on our commitment of 1% share count reduction in 2020. We invested approximately $300 million in CapEx and deployed over $250 million to complete 3 acquisitions. So all in all, a very strong fourth quarter to close out 2020.  
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to talk about our 2021 planning assumptions. We hope and expect that the worse is behind us as we move on from 2020. We're seeing promising signs of the recovery unfolding, but there continue to be a few key uncertainties to be mindful of.  
Over the past couple of months, we've seen governments around the world approve multiple effective COVID-19 vaccines and begin rolling them out. Our current view of '21 assumes the vaccines are widely distributed, leading to lower manageable infection rates over time and allowing the global economy to largely be open and stabilize.  
However, many regions have recently been coping with a new wave of infections and lockdowns, new COVID strains and vaccine distribution challenges. So it remains unclear when exactly infection rates will slow down materially and the economic recovery will really accelerate.  
As a macro planning assumption, we're expecting the recovery to be weighted to the second half of the year and are expecting to experience a little bit of a slower start in 1Q. We're assuming fiscal stimulus to remain supportive of the economy in '21. We do expect passengers will begin flying more freely again as the vaccine rollout begins, leading to a modest improvement in global flight hours in the first half and acceleration in the second half. So this is one area where we are seeing some renewed softness, particularly in China and APAC, as the year begins. We also expect stability in defense budget spending. And finally, we assume improved macro conditions broadly will drive moderate increase in oil consumption in the second half of the year.  
Given that, let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss our markets and segment outlook. Starting in Aerospace. The previously mentioned increase in flight hours as the pandemic subsides will gradually lead to improvements in our commercial aerospace business as aftermarket demand accelerates, particularly in the second half. However, we expect recovery in the commercial OE business to lag the commercial aftermarket recovery due to a gradual ramp in commercial OEM build rates.  
Stable defense spending should support continued growth in our Defense & Space business at a rather reduced pace versus the double-digit growth we experienced in 2020. In total, we expect the Aerospace business to be flat to up low single digits in '21.  
In HBT, we expect the nonresidential market to remain relatively stable in '21. We anticipate solid demand for building products and management systems in key verticals, including data centers, warehousing and health care. However, in other verticals, including hospitality and commercial offices, we expect them to remain challenged as the world recovers from the effects of the pandemic. These challenges will be partially offset by the traction we have been gaining over the past couple of quarters with our healthy building solutions with key wins in education, commercial offices, health care and some government verticals.  
Our solutions address key customer concerns, including air quality, social distancing and controlled and cautious access, and we expect continued demand through the year. Building Solutions ended 2020 with a quarter of strong year-over-year orders growth, which positions the business well for '21. And we expect customers to continue placing orders that they deferred in '20 as the macro economy recovers.  
We also have a robust services backlog that is up strong double digits year-over-year and will support 2021 growth. We don't expect building access to be a significant issue in '21, so we don't anticipate any material challenges getting on sites to complete projects. In total, we expect HBT to grow low single digits for the year.  
In PMT, we expect the oil and gas and petrochemical markets to remain relatively flat, with oil consumption picking up slightly in the second half. We expect the HPS recovery to be led by our large backlog of global mega projects and the product businesses.  
In UOP, we expect the energy markets to remain challenged through the year, particularly in the first half. However, we expect business conditions will recover sooner for petrochemical than oil and gas. We anticipate increasing investments in renewable fuels, which will drive demand for our new sustainable Technology Solutions business and partially offset challenges in the oil and gas market.  
In addition, the specialty chemicals market is expected to grow modestly in '21, with strength in global health care, automotive and residential construction end markets driving demand for advanced materials. Overall, we expect TNT to be down slightly to up low single digits for the year.  
Lastly, in SPS, we expect continued strength in warehouse automation and personal protective equipment as we execute the delivery of our robust backlog. We also expect productivity solutions and services to grow as the strategic turnaround of the business drives market share gains, and we expect gas sensing to recover in line with the market. In total, we expect SPS to grow double digits in '21 with comps getting tougher in the back half as we lap strong growth in the back half of 2020.  
So overall, we see improvement across most of our key end markets in '21 and we have confidence in our continued operational execution. The pace of the recovery may vary due to the items we discussed on the prior slide, so we are taking a cautious approach as we begin the year.  
Now let's move to Slide 9 to discuss how these dynamics come together for our 2021 financial guidance. For 2021, we expect sales of $33.4 billion to $34.4 billion, which represents overall organic growth -- sales growth in the range of 1% to 4%, reflecting double-digit recurring connected software growth and the impact of our announced M&A divestitures. Segment margins are expected to expand 30 to 70 basis points, supported by higher sales volume and our streamlined fixed cost base following 2020 cost actions with investment for growth.  
While we expect margin expansion across all the businesses, SPS will lead the path as we scale up capacity and become more efficient, followed by Aero driven by high-margin aftermarket recovery. These organic growth and segment margin expectations are consistent with our long-term commitments for low to mid-single-digit organic growth and 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion and give us flexibility to deliver earnings growth and invest for the future.  
2020 was a challenging year, but we'll be back on track to deliver our standard commitment to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. So net below the line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $130 million to positive $20 million, which includes capacity for $400 million to $525 million of repositioning.  
We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% and a weighted average share count of approximately 705 million for the year, representing our minimum 1% reduction in shares. As a result, we are guiding earnings per share of $7.60 to $8, up 7% to 13% adjusted.  
We see free cash flow in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion in 2021. That represents cash margins of 15% to 16% of sales commensurate with the 2019 and 2020 rates that we have demonstrated and a cash conversion in the 95% range. Keeping in mind that our conversion, excluding noncash pension income, would actually be approaching 115%, so very healthy on numbers overall.  
This range does include $375 million that we expect to receive in an upfront payment from Garrett, resulting from their proposed plan of reorganization. We'll continue to include cash receipts from Garrett going forward within free cash flow in order to be comparable to prior periods, where the cash proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreement were recognized.  
And just to spend a minute on that topic, we are pleased that Garrett has agreed to the plan of reorganization, under which they will be recapitalized and well positioned to meet their obligations, including those to Honeywell and will avoid costly litigation. We believe this is the right path forward that maximizes value for all stakeholders.  
Now let's turn to Slide 10 and walk through our 2021 EPS bridge. Segment profit is expected to be the key driver of our earnings growth. Higher sales volumes, commercial excellence, continued productivity improvements and ongoing benefits from previously funded repositioning will contribute $0.54 per share at the midpoint of our guidance.  
The impact of our acquisitions of Sparta, Sine and Rocky Research and the divestiture of the retail footwear business will drive a $0.07 headwind at the midpoint. Below the line and other items are expected to be a $0.22 benefit per share at the midpoint of our guidance primarily driven by higher pension income in '21 compared to 2020.  
I'd like to take a moment to discuss those pension dynamics in a little bit more detail. We expect approximately $1.1 billion of pension and OPEB income in '21, up approximately $260 million from 2020 with the majority of this increase related to our U.S. pension plan.  
We have derisked our U.S. pension plan to approximately 60% of planned assets being a more conservative fixed income-like assets and the remainder in return-seeking assets. As a result of another strong portfolio performance in 2020, our funds returned approximately 14% increase in our pension asset base compared to the prior year. This higher asset base, combined with lower discount rate, is driving higher income in 2021. Our diligent management and strong returns have been an important value driver for the company, putting us in a position where our pension-funded status continues to be robust, ending the year at 113%.  
For taxes, we expect an effective tax rate of 21% to 22%, which would result in a $0.06 headwind per share at the midpoint. And finally, our base case is that our share repurchase program will result in a benefit of $0.07 per share as we reduce our weighted average share count from 711 million to at least 705 million shares. So in total, we expect 2021 earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $8, up 7% to 13% year-over-year adjusted, nearly back to 2019 levels.  
Now let's turn to Slide 11 for a preview of the first quarter. As I noted earlier, we're entering 1Q with a cautious stance as the environment continues to evolve real time, which is driving a wider-than-usual range for a quarter.  
We expect organic growth in the first quarter in the range of down 10% to down 5% organically, which brackets our fourth quarter sales growth performance, recognizing market conditions could vary. The year-over-year sales decline will be driven by continued headwinds in commercial aerospace and UOP, partially offset by ongoing strength in warehouse automation, PPE and advanced materials as well as gradual recovery in other areas of the portfolio.  
Keep in mind, 1Q will be our toughest comp for the year across all 4 segments since the first quarter of last year was only partially disrupted by the COVID pandemic. We expect segment margins in the range of 20.4% to 20.9% in the first quarter, slightly below the fourth quarter based on lower sales leverage given our usual sequential step down in sales from 4Q, partially offset by ongoing productivity. That represents year-over-year segment margin contraction of 140 to 90 basis points. We have positioned ourselves with a streamlined fixed cost base for '21 and expect sequential segment margin improvement from the second quarter on.  
The net below-the-line impact is expected to be between a $40 million expense and a $5 million benefit with a range of repositioning between $100 million and $140 million as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring programs. We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%, and the average share count to be approximately 705 million shares. As a result, we expect first quarter earnings per share between $1.68 and $1.83, down 24% to 17% year-on-year.  
Now let's take a moment to walk through our expectations by segment. In Aerospace, we expect first quarter global flight hours to remain relatively flat from the fourth quarter. We could see a step back in 1Q in certain regions, given the flare-up in infection rates over the holidays. As a result, we expect current softness in flight hours to continue impacting our air transport and business aviation market sales in the first quarter.  
In addition, lower air transport OEM build rates and lower business jet demand will continue to impact our commercial original equipment business. We expect the sensing space to partially offset the challenges in commercial aerospace, supported by stable U.S. defense setting.  
In Building Technologies, we expect business conditions to remain similar to conditions in the fourth quarter. We don't expect significant issues accessing our customer sites, as I mentioned earlier, which will enable us to deliver projects as normal.  
Our strong Building Solutions services backlog should drive growth in the quarter, and we expect demand for building products to continue improving. In addition, we expect continued customer momentum with our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions.  
In PMT, we expect continued customer CapEx and OpEx budget reduction and project delays to impact the engineering and licensing business in UOP and projects and services in HPS. In UOP, we expect continued weakness in gas processing and lower catalyst shipments due to the lower production and refining volumes. However, we do expect to see some demand return in Process Solutions product businesses. And we expect another strong quarter in Advanced Materials driven by continued demand in Fluorine Products.  
Finally, we expect continued strength in STS with another quarter of double-digit growth in Intelligrated and personal protective equipment. Our personal protective equipment backlog remains up triple digits year-over-year, and our Intelligrated backlog is over $2.5 billion, giving us confidence for the first quarter and the full year.  
For productivity solutions and services, we expect continued growth driven by market share gains and low inventory levels in the channel due to favorable sales-out of distributors. While macro conditions continue to put pressure on the sensing and IoT and gas-sensing businesses, we expect strong overall SPS sales growth for the first quarter.  
Now before I turn it back to Darius, let's look at Slide 12 and talk through the ultimate measure of our performance through this crisis: total shareholder return. We're creating shareholder value and outperforming the industry in the broader market in all environments.  
If you look at this chart, you'll see that Honeywell has shown remarkable consistency, outperforming both versus the SLI and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, indicative of the outstanding resiliency of the company. Investors can depend on Honeywell to generate superior returns compared to the benchmarks regardless of market timing due to our rigorous and proven value-creation framework as well as the Honeywell Operating System.  
This crisis reinforced the fact that our value-creation framework, which we discussed at length in our December investor webcast, is highly effective in delivering consistent outperformance in all marketing conditions. In fact, this framework drove Honeywell's shareholder returns above both the XLI and Dow Jones Industrial Average again in 2020.  
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius."

Before we wrap up, I'd like to take a minute on Slide 13 to discuss one of the key elements of our overall ESG story.  
Last quarter, we discussed Honeywell's commitment to shape a safer and more sustainable future. This time, I'd like to focus on another important topic, corporate social responsibility. Honeywell's committed to corporate social responsibility and community involvement, which we demonstrate through unique global programs to look to improve lives and inspire change in the communities around the world.  
Beyond these programs, we acted quickly throughout the course of the pandemic to address the needs of our employees, communities and customers. A few of our more recent actions are shown on the slide.  
Most recently, we announced our participation in a unique public-private partnership, backed by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, to help support the goal of 1 million COVID-19 vaccinations by July 4, 2021. We are partnered with Atrium Health, Tepper Sports & Entertainment, the Charlotte Motor Speedway and the state of North Carolina to administer the vaccine, manage complex logistics and to provide operational support for mass vaccination events. We're very proud to be part of this effort to prevent further spread of the virus by helping frontline workers and other members of our communities get vaccinated.  
Another recent example of Honeywell's contribution to our communities is the important mask delivery milestone we achieved in December, where we delivered more than 225 million face masks that will protect workers in their response to COVID-19. We delivered N95 respirators and surgical face masks to multiple locations in the U.S. for health care systems, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  
In addition, we shipped millions of masks to both state and local governments. We're proud of these contributions and our role in providing much-needed PPE to workers around the country responding to the pandemic.  
Finally, we're also committed to recognizing and respond to the needs of our employees. We recently recognized the dedication and strength of our own frontline integrated supply chain production teams, who have been instrumental in keeping our manufacturing sites running safely, enabling us to meet critical customer needs during these unprecedented times. To show our appreciation, we announced a special $500 recognition award for each of our frontline production and production support employees. We continue to be inspired by the members of our integrated supply chain team, who have truly gone above and beyond to support our customers throughout this dynamic.  
Now let's wrap on Slide 14. There's no doubt that 2020 was a challenging year. However, we effectively managed through the downturn, the repercussions of the global pandemic by focusing on liquidity, cost management, strong operational execution and investment for the future. We drove sequential improvement from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow, creating good momentum into 2021.  
The past year was another proof point that the Honeywell value-creation framework delivers outperformance even in the most challenging economic and market conditions. We continue to invest in organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the downturn to high-return CapEx and M&A, positioning ourselves for the future and the recovery to come. These growth investments will help us solve challenging problems for our customers, address critical global sustainability issues and drive superior shareholder returns.  
I am proud of Honeywell's rapid and effective response to the challenges of 2020. Our employees around the world worked hard to quickly adapt and deliver through the crisis, including ramping up production of critical PPE, developing a portfolio of healthy solutions and delivering growth in multiple areas of the portfolio. We are well positioned for a recovery in the second half of 2021 and beyond as demonstrated by our expectation to return to our key long-term growth commitments in 2021.  
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

But as I said in my remarks, I mean, the down 10 to down 5 kind of brackets, the down 7 we had in the fourth quarter, the down 10 is in case something gets worse that we don't really can see at this moment. But it could be better than that if things progress. 
So no, nothing -- there's nothing strange. I mean, we always have a fourth quarter to 1Q decremental sequential sales. 4Q is always our strongest quarter. So nothing unusual in there."

We have some important things to get done in Aerospace from an R&D perspective. We are funding some of that already. If things get better than we think, then we could let the line out a little bit further. 
So if you look at our conversion in the last 3 quarters of this guide, it's really converting at like 37%. Just the math says, a 37% conversion rate in Q2 through 4 with this guide.

First of all, Steve, if you take a look at our conversion rate for 2021 versus that deconversion or deleverage ratio, it's better, right? It's -- and we project that in Q2 to Q4. 
The wildcard in a lot of this is aero aftermarket, right? I mean, that is probably the single hardest number for us to call because it is directly correlated to vaccinations and the speed of those vaccinations and rollout. If that comes in better than we're projecting, then obviously, there is upside to the margin rate. If it doesn't, well, then probably going to be someplace in the mid- to lower end. 
But I think it's really important to note something else, Steve, which is if you look at the upper end of our margin rate for 2021, I mean, we get back to 2019 levels. I mean, so basically, we're kind of taking a 1-year break. And initially, there were discussions about whether it takes us 3 years or 2 years to get back to that. And we're kind of getting -- look on the EPS range and so on pretty much to 2019. And of course, so it's sort of a 1-year break. 
But as usual, we're trying to be prudent in our planning this early on in the year with these many unknowns with the vaccine at levels the world has never seen. So we're trying to net that into our guidance. And obviously, we're going to provide you more clarity as the year progresses."

As you know, I don't think we're expecting dramatic margin improvement in Intelligrated in 2021, and let me explain why. The reason is that we're just booking an incredible amount of greenfield projects. 
You saw that it was another incredibly robust year in terms of bookings. We expect double-digit growth again. And particularly, what's really important is to look at the ratio of our aftermarket business to our projects business. And as you can imagine, it's not changing, or if anything, probably the projects are growing that much faster than aftermarket. So obviously, that was going to keep pressure on the margin. 
But we should view that as a good news thing because as I explained this before, eventually, when the growth slows down, the growth rate will be slower, but the margin rate will be higher. But we're still going to be very much in this greenfield expansion mode for the next few years, which means higher growth rates, lower margins, which over time is going to moderate to lower high top line growth rates and higher margins. So that's sort of how that business is going to grow. 
What's really encouraging here is the amount of share that we're gaining in the marketplace. There's -- unquestionably, this business is winning and winning big in the market."

So that business is growing as fast as any business we currently have, getting traction on the SAP partnership, but we're also getting traction in the marketplace because, frankly, it's a gap that's unfilled.

HPS, we kind of know roughly what we're going to do, which is growth. 
UOP is a little bit of an unknown, right? Because what we've seen can happen is that a lot of the catalyst loads or reloads get pushed out or projects get pushed out. To give me some comfort is that our bookings in the backlog are higher entering 2021 versus what they were in 2020. So I am cautiously optimistic. It's -- we're going to see the growth piece. 
But we've also seen some pushouts of particularly catalyst roads and delay in projects. If that happens, obviously, we're going to have to see pressure from the UOP side. And frankly, the price of oil is at a reasonable number right now. It's not in the 30s or 40s. Now it's in the 50s, which is quite receptive to investment. 
What worries me is that a lot of the big oil and gas majors who are our customers set their budgets just like we do in Q4 of 2020. So -- and they've announced some pretty big cuts. So what we don't know fully is are those -- are there going to be adjustments made based on the economic conditions, based on adjustments to those budgets? There is a point, there is definitely a pent-up demand because you can't underfund this marketplace for too long. 
So whether that happens in the second half of this year or 2022, that story's yet to be told. But what we don't know is we still have a lot of sort of bookings that we expect for the second half that we have visibility to, but they need to land. And that's why we provided the guide we did because we don't know whether or not they will land or they'll only get pushed out to '22. 
But I have zeroed out, and I mean zeroed out because I was in this business in '15 and '16, that there will be a big reinvestment cycle because you can't starve this market for so long. And that's why it's sort of -- we can debate when it will come, but there's no -- undoubtedly it'll happen."

That actually grew in the teens last year. So that was a very good year, and we actually -- we expect an acceleration on both of those figures for 2021. 
But 2020, for me, was a really good proof point. This business is acyclical. And as we continue particularly to build that recurring revenue base, which is growing more than 2x our sort of traditional software base, it's going to be a great tailwind for the future of Honeywell and the future of that software business.

We had a very big cash flow from AR this year. We started to see some of the inventory come down in 4Q. For the year, it was still a build. 
And so when we think about next year, that's the area that I expect us to make more progress, is on inventory, and start seeing some inventory reductions, again, even in the face of sales growth.

Frankly, the receivables performance was outstanding. We're not sure if that can be replicated. We're certainly going to try, but we're going to focus on some other elements. 
I'd also say we've done a nice job on advances on build, too, in terms of 2020. So I thought that this performance on cash was exceptional. 
And if you really take a look at -- especially if you adjust for pension or take a look at our cash generation as a percent of our revenue, you'll find that we're in the top quartile performance. And that's certainly..."

I mean, we're always looking at options around the future of the pension plan. So that's something that we look at constantly. 
As far as value creation, I view it in 2 ways. Number one, it's a risk mitigator. I mean, other companies are having to pile cash into their pension plan because they're unfunded. We don't. I mean, I can't remember the last time we put anything substantive into our pension fund, which obviously would take away from our ability to deploy capital into things that are going to drive growth. 
So that's when I say it's a value driver, particularly vis-a-vis others, it's a huge value driver. And in that case, in particular, so that's -- and yes, it's 113% funded. I feel great about where that is. Even if we were to have a bit of a market down draft, we would still be in a very good position in terms of that funding level. 
So to me, the team has done a terrific job of managing the pension and the returns around it for a very long time. And it has absolutely been very good for us and to our balance sheet and our liquidity."

The one way is, obviously, if there is no more people in the pension plan anymore, which, frankly, with a couple of CEOs from now that -- the other way's you could sell it to potential insurance company and so on. But there's a big premium on that. So financially, that doesn't make a lot of sense to do that right now. 
But I think what our investors should really remember is that when they think about pension, particularly given the derisking that we have and the amount of fixed instruments that we have there, this should be completely worry-free for them because even a huge adjustment in the stock market is not going to put us in peril. So I just think that this is sort of a safe haven in terms of an area that, frankly, is a big question mark for a lot of companies out there. For us, it's a big positive, and it's going to stay that way for the foreseeable future."

And the direction of that is clear. It's going to be renewables. Energy is going to become much, much more prevalent part of the future. 
But it's also not going to be immediate. It's not going to happen in 2022 or '23, and it's going to be a slow, gradual progress. So a lot of the things that UOP still does will become relevant, particularly where a big part of that business being around gas, natural gas, which we know is the cleanness of the hydrocarbon. So that's Phase 1. 
So I think that we've got to continue to serve our customer base. And frankly, many of them will be transforming in terms of how they provide energy to the world. 
The second part, as you know, we've launched a new business within UOP called the Sustainability Technology Solutions business, which is going to become a bigger and bigger and bigger part of the UOP portfolio. And it really has 3 primary growth levers. One is energy storage, which is economically feasible and viable, and we're building and deploying our first prototype of that this year. So it's not a dream. Two is 360-degree plastics recyclability, which also we're going to be deploying some technology this year. And then the last one, where we're really the pioneers, which is Ecofining, which is going to become a bigger, bigger part of the refining footprint. 
So we've got 3 sort of -- this is under one business umbrella, and that's going to become our growth engine for the future. So what I envision happening is potentially, longer term, some of the more hydrocarbon-oriented offerings will slowly, and I emphasize the word very slowly decline while our Sustainability Technology Solutions business will grow very, very quickly. That's sort of how I see that business evolving. That's why we -- this is another place we're investing, put our dollars to work. 
And we're excited about the future and the kinds of solutions that we have. And as you know, we don't have better scientists anywhere in our company than in UOP when it comes to material science. So I'm quite confident that some of these technology breakthroughs will work and will really enable a path to the future energy footprint of the world."

Let's begin on Slide 2. We finished a challenging year of a very strong quarter, driving sequential improvements from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and robust free cash",953,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. We finished a challenging year of a very strong quarter, driving sequential improvements from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and robust free cash flow.  
In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, flat year-over-year and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. This result was up 33% sequentially from adjusted EPS of $1.56 in the third quarter.  
Organic sales were down 7% year-over-year, 4 percentage points better than the high end of our guidance range and 7 percentage point sequential improvement from the 14% organic sales decline in the third quarter. We drove double-digit year-over-year organic sales growth in Defense and Space, Fluorine Products and recurring Connected Software sales as well as 27% organic growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions and outstanding results.  
Our cost plans delivered our full year commitment of $1.5 billion in savings and helped us protect margins, limiting our decremental margin in the quarter to only 26%, an improvement from Q3 29% decremental margin. Segment margin contracted 30 basis points year-over-year, a significant improvement from the 130 basis point contraction in the third quarter, driven by margin expansion in Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up from $758 million in the third quarter and 9% above Q4 2019, achieving 170% adjusted conversion.  
In terms of capital, we deployed approximately $2.8 billion of cash to dividends, growth CapEx investments, share repurchases and M&A. We'll talk more about our recent M&A activity on the next page.  
For the full year, we deployed $3.7 billion to reduce shares outstanding by approximately 3%. With these strong fourth quarter results, we finished 2020 with $7.10 of adjusted earnings per share and an 11% organic sales decline, both above the high end of our expectations from October. For the full year, we generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow, resulting in adjusted conversion of 105% or 16% of revenue, a very strong result.  
There's no doubt that the COVID-19 crisis created significant challenges for the business and economies around the world. I'm very proud of Honeywell's ability to rise to the challenge to deliver strong execution and sequentially improving results throughout the year.  
Next, let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss our recent M&A activities. I'm pleased with the progress we made in actively shaping our portfolio, and our recent M&A announcements directly align with our ongoing transformation into a premier software industrial company.  
In the fourth quarter, we completed 3 acquisitions and announced the fourth, all of which meet the rigorous criteria in our M&A framework, which ensures that transactions are aligned with our portfolio strategy and meet our return expectations. We have previously discussed the acquisitions of Rocky Research and Ballard Unmanned Systems, which provide emerging technologies aligned to strategic initiatives in our Aerospace business as well as our strategic investment with path to full ownership in Trinity Mobility, which supports our smart cities breakthrough initiative in Honeywell Building Technologies.  
In mid-December, we acquired Sine Group, a technology and software-as-a-service or a SaaS company that provides digital management solutions that are readily accessible with mobile devices. Sine's technology will enhance our connected building offerings and will also support a mobile platform for a broader portfolio of Honeywell Forge offerings. We will expand on Sine's features and solutions and make Sine's product available to customers globally.  
Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire Sparta Systems, a leading provider of enterprise quality management software, or QMS, with the life sciences industry for $1.3 billion. We previously highlighted the importance of the life sciences market as a breakthrough growth initiative. The acquisition of Sparta further bolsters our software, controls and analytics capabilities in this space. Sparta's AI-enabled SaaS offering will combine with Honeywell Forge to provide greater value to our life sciences and pharma customers. Additionally, Sparta complements our growth strategies for the automation and visualization business within Honeywell Process Solutions, enabling greater penetration in life sciences and the pharma market segments. Sparta will further bolster Honeywell's portfolio of accretive, noncyclical, recurring connected software sales.  
I'm excited about the new technologies and adjacencies we have unlocked through our recent acquisitions and investments. We said before that we have an active M&A pipeline, and this series of acquisitions is further evidence that we are continuously developing our portfolio and investing in new opportunities.  
We also evaluate our portfolio for areas that are no longer core to our long-term objectives. Earlier this week, we signed an agreement to sell our performance and the lifestyle footwear business to a leading manufacturer of premium footwear and apparel, Rocky Brands. The transaction value is approximately $230 million and is scheduled to close by the end of the first quarter. Our SPS business will continue to provide industrial safety footwear for workers.  
M&A is just one important part of our broader capital deployment strategy, which also includes share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. Let's turn to the next slide to view our total capital deployment.  
In 2020, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to identifying and investing in high-return opportunities that help reshape the business for a software-oriented future. Over the past 3 years, we have consistently deployed more than 100% of operating cash flow to fund share repurchases, dividends, M&A and capital expenditure. 2020 was no exception.  
Even during a global pandemic, we deployed $7.5 billion of capital, essentially equal to the prior 2 years, demonstrating our commitment to investing in high-return opportunities in any environment.  
Now let's turn to Slide 5, where Greg will discuss our execution record in a downturn."

We showed a slide similar to this one during our December investor webcast.

We showed a slide similar to this one during our December investor webcast. And I want to highlight it again here today because I think it nicely summarizes our ability to manage through tough times.  
Our execution through this year's downturn clearly demonstrates our ability to move quickly and decisively to reduce fixed costs, to protect margins, to ensure liquidity, invest in growth and position ourselves for recovery, while at the same time, we maintained focus on our pretransformation initiatives, Honeywell Connected Enterprise, Honeywell Digital and the integrated supply chain. At the beginning of the pandemic, we first acted quickly to address our liquidity and cost structure. Our strong balance sheet provides us with stability as well as the opportunity for investment during challenging times, and as you saw from Darius, we took advantage of that.  
Through a series of actions to further bolster our financial flexibility, we increased our cash and short-term investments from approximately $10 billion at the end of 2019 to over $15 billion by the end of the second quarter, which we maintained through the end of the year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong cash flow and efficiently access the capital markets during even the most disruptive times, all while protecting our debt rating.  
On the cost side, we responded fast and early to the crisis by identifying and delivering on a 2-phase cost program, which achieved $1.5 billion in year-over-year fixed cost savings as we had committed. Approximately 70% of these savings or about $1 billion represent a permanent reduction to our fixed cost base.  
To achieve this, we curtailed discretionary expenses, took temporary actions to reduce costs, including reducing executive and Board pay, and remove significant structural costs through our repositioning programs. Our streamlined cost base positions us well for 2021 recovery and will drive margin expansion across all 4 of our segments as well as capacity for investment as sales recover in 2021 and beyond.  
As Darius described on the previous page, we strategically deployed capital to drive returns and to position our business for future growth. Importantly, we also directed resources to address our customers' COVID-19 challenges around the world. We've deployed additional capital into high-return growth investments to address urgent customer needs, particularly in personal protective equipment and warehouse automation. We're also helping the world cope and recover from the effects of COVID-19 through our new portfolio of healthy solutions. We generated approximately $655 million in sales for our healthy solutions in 2020. And we have a pipeline of approximately $2.1 billion, which will drive growth again in '21.  
As a result of our swift actions during the downturn, 4Q decremental margins were limited to 26%, improving from 33% in 2Q and 29% in 3Q and demonstrating our ability to protect our margins in a very difficult environment. We are clearly well positioned for a variety of outcomes as the recovery progresses into 2021 and beyond. And our shareholders are benefiting from that with a total shareholder return of 23% in 2020, which was over 2x greater than the XLI.  
Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our fourth quarter results in a bit more detail and our 2021 outlook. As Darius highlighted, we delivered a strong fourth quarter to end 2020 with sequential improvement from third quarter on all our key financial metrics.  
Sales declined by 7% organically due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is 4 percentage points better than the high end of our guidance and represents a 7 percentage point sequential improvement from the 14% organic sales decline in the third quarter, driven by sequential sales growth from the third quarter in all 4 segments.  
Starting with Aerospace. Fourth quarter sales were down 19% organically, a 6 percentage point sequential improvement from the down 25% we had in the third quarter. Lower commercial aftermarket demand due to the ongoing impact of reduced flight hours and lower volumes in commercial OE equipment was partially offset by double-digit growth in Defense & Space.  
Though still down significantly year-over-year, our commercial aftermarket business did improve sequentially from the third quarter. Our air transport aftermarket business was down 48% organically in the quarter compared to 55% in Q3. And our business aviation aftermarket was down 6% organically compared to 28% in the third quarter.  
Moving on to Building Technologies. Sales declined 4% organically, a 4 percentage point sequential improvement from the 8% down in 3Q. Global solutions projects were impacted by timing due to the customer order pushouts we saw earlier in the year, which is partially offset by growth in services. Customers are now placing orders for projects that they had previously delayed. As a result, orders in Building Solutions grew 32% year-over-year, and the services backlog was up double digits year-over-year to finish the fourth quarter, position the business well for '21.  
On the building products side of the portfolio, sales and orders improved sequentially from the third quarter and the commercial fire business returned to year-over-year growth.  
In PMT, sales were down 12% organically, a 4 percentage point sequential improvement from the 16% organic decline in 3Q. Process Solutions was impacted by continued delays in projects and services as well as volume declines in thermal solutions and smart energy due to end market softness. However, process solutions orders were up 30% sequentially from Q3. UOP continued to be impacted by weakness in the energy end markets, though sales improved sequentially from the third quarter across the UOP portfolio. And orders were up 21% versus the third quarter as well.  
Finally, Advanced Materials sales increased 8% year-over-year organically, driven by growth across the Fluorine Products portfolio, including strong auto and on demand.  
In SPS, organic sales were up 27% year-over-year, a very strong result to end the year in which the SPS team stepped up to meet unprecedented demand for critical safety products. Intelligrated and personal protective equipment led the way with another quarter of double-digit organic growth, followed by high single-digit growth in productivity solutions and services. We are encouraged by the turnaround that team has orchestrated in 2020. SPS exited 2020 with a backlog of approximately $4 billion, which was nearly double our backlog at the end of 2019, placing the business in a very strong position to start 2021, where we expect to see a robust first half in particular.  
Overall, we expanded margins year-over-year in 3 of the 4 segments: Aerospace, HBT and SPS, limiting Honeywell's overall segment margin contraction to 30 basis points and ending the quarter with a segment margin of 21.1%. This was a sequential improvement of 120 basis points from 3Q segment margins of 19.9%, an improvement of 260 basis points from the 2Q trough, demonstrating the effectiveness of our response to the pandemic, in particular, our cost actions and operational rigor.  
We delivered cost actions in the fourth quarter that brought us to $1.5 billion of savings for the year, right at the stated range that we had highlighted earlier, limiting our full year margin contraction to 70 basis points despite the challenging operating environment. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, flat year-over-year and up 33% sequentially from adjusted EPS of $1.56 in the third quarter. This result was $0.05 above the high end of our guidance, driven by higher segment profit due to better-than-expected sales volumes in Aerospace, HBT and SPS. Given the strength we saw in the fourth quarter, we were able to make discrete investments in the business and our employees, including in IT, marketing spend for Forge and brand expansion in the Middle East and China as well as a special $500 recognition award for our IST frontline production and production support employees, who performed so greatly and well through this crisis.  
Repositioning was lower than in 4Q a year ago as expected, driving a $0.15 year-over-year tailwind below the line. Interest income and foreign currency were lower than 4Q '19, driving a $0.07 headwind below the line, which was offset by higher pension income. Our effective tax rate and share count were also lower than in the fourth quarter of '19, driving $0.02 and $0.04 of EPS benefit, respectively. A bridge from 4Q '19 adjusted earnings per share to 4Q '20 can be found in the appendix of this presentation.  
I am also proud to report that our fourth quarter cash flow generation is very strong. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow, up 9% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted free cash flow conversion of 170%. Free cash flow and conversion both improved year-over-year due to working capital improvements, including [ introduction ] and strong collections. Our teams put an extra focus on cash in the fourth quarter and really delivered, and we expect to continue this progress in '21, particularly on inventory.  
In terms of capital deployment, we paid approximately $670 million in dividends, repurchased $1.6 billion in Honeywell shares, over-delivering on our commitment of 1% share count reduction in 2020. We invested approximately $300 million in CapEx and deployed over $250 million to complete 3 acquisitions. So all in all, a very strong fourth quarter to close out 2020.  
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to talk about our 2021 planning assumptions. We hope and expect that the worse is behind us as we move on from 2020. We're seeing promising signs of the recovery unfolding, but there continue to be a few key uncertainties to be mindful of.  
Over the past couple of months, we've seen governments around the world approve multiple effective COVID-19 vaccines and begin rolling them out. Our current view of '21 assumes the vaccines are widely distributed, leading to lower manageable infection rates over time and allowing the global economy to largely be open and stabilize.  
However, many regions have recently been coping with a new wave of infections and lockdowns, new COVID strains and vaccine distribution challenges. So it remains unclear when exactly infection rates will slow down materially and the economic recovery will really accelerate.  
As a macro planning assumption, we're expecting the recovery to be weighted to the second half of the year and are expecting to experience a little bit of a slower start in 1Q. We're assuming fiscal stimulus to remain supportive of the economy in '21. We do expect passengers will begin flying more freely again as the vaccine rollout begins, leading to a modest improvement in global flight hours in the first half and acceleration in the second half. So this is one area where we are seeing some renewed softness, particularly in China and APAC, as the year begins. We also expect stability in defense budget spending. And finally, we assume improved macro conditions broadly will drive moderate increase in oil consumption in the second half of the year.  
Given that, let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss our markets and segment outlook. Starting in Aerospace. The previously mentioned increase in flight hours as the pandemic subsides will gradually lead to improvements in our commercial aerospace business as aftermarket demand accelerates, particularly in the second half. However, we expect recovery in the commercial OE business to lag the commercial aftermarket recovery due to a gradual ramp in commercial OEM build rates.  
Stable defense spending should support continued growth in our Defense & Space business at a rather reduced pace versus the double-digit growth we experienced in 2020. In total, we expect the Aerospace business to be flat to up low single digits in '21.  
In HBT, we expect the nonresidential market to remain relatively stable in '21. We anticipate solid demand for building products and management systems in key verticals, including data centers, warehousing and health care. However, in other verticals, including hospitality and commercial offices, we expect them to remain challenged as the world recovers from the effects of the pandemic. These challenges will be partially offset by the traction we have been gaining over the past couple of quarters with our healthy building solutions with key wins in education, commercial offices, health care and some government verticals.  
Our solutions address key customer concerns, including air quality, social distancing and controlled and cautious access, and we expect continued demand through the year. Building Solutions ended 2020 with a quarter of strong year-over-year orders growth, which positions the business well for '21. And we expect customers to continue placing orders that they deferred in '20 as the macro economy recovers.  
We also have a robust services backlog that is up strong double digits year-over-year and will support 2021 growth. We don't expect building access to be a significant issue in '21, so we don't anticipate any material challenges getting on sites to complete projects. In total, we expect HBT to grow low single digits for the year.  
In PMT, we expect the oil and gas and petrochemical markets to remain relatively flat, with oil consumption picking up slightly in the second half. We expect the HPS recovery to be led by our large backlog of global mega projects and the product businesses.  
In UOP, we expect the energy markets to remain challenged through the year, particularly in the first half. However, we expect business conditions will recover sooner for petrochemical than oil and gas. We anticipate increasing investments in renewable fuels, which will drive demand for our new sustainable Technology Solutions business and partially offset challenges in the oil and gas market.  
In addition, the specialty chemicals market is expected to grow modestly in '21, with strength in global health care, automotive and residential construction end markets driving demand for advanced materials. Overall, we expect TNT to be down slightly to up low single digits for the year.  
Lastly, in SPS, we expect continued strength in warehouse automation and personal protective equipment as we execute the delivery of our robust backlog. We also expect productivity solutions and services to grow as the strategic turnaround of the business drives market share gains, and we expect gas sensing to recover in line with the market. In total, we expect SPS to grow double digits in '21 with comps getting tougher in the back half as we lap strong growth in the back half of 2020.  
So overall, we see improvement across most of our key end markets in '21 and we have confidence in our continued operational execution. The pace of the recovery may vary due to the items we discussed on the prior slide, so we are taking a cautious approach as we begin the year.  
Now let's move to Slide 9 to discuss how these dynamics come together for our 2021 financial guidance. For 2021, we expect sales of $33.4 billion to $34.4 billion, which represents overall organic growth -- sales growth in the range of 1% to 4%, reflecting double-digit recurring connected software growth and the impact of our announced M&A divestitures. Segment margins are expected to expand 30 to 70 basis points, supported by higher sales volume and our streamlined fixed cost base following 2020 cost actions with investment for growth.  
While we expect margin expansion across all the businesses, SPS will lead the path as we scale up capacity and become more efficient, followed by Aero driven by high-margin aftermarket recovery. These organic growth and segment margin expectations are consistent with our long-term commitments for low to mid-single-digit organic growth and 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion and give us flexibility to deliver earnings growth and invest for the future.  
2020 was a challenging year, but we'll be back on track to deliver our standard commitment to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. So net below the line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $130 million to positive $20 million, which includes capacity for $400 million to $525 million of repositioning.  
We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% and a weighted average share count of approximately 705 million for the year, representing our minimum 1% reduction in shares. As a result, we are guiding earnings per share of $7.60 to $8, up 7% to 13% adjusted.  
We see free cash flow in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion in 2021. That represents cash margins of 15% to 16% of sales commensurate with the 2019 and 2020 rates that we have demonstrated and a cash conversion in the 95% range. Keeping in mind that our conversion, excluding noncash pension income, would actually be approaching 115%, so very healthy on numbers overall.  
This range does include $375 million that we expect to receive in an upfront payment from Garrett, resulting from their proposed plan of reorganization. We'll continue to include cash receipts from Garrett going forward within free cash flow in order to be comparable to prior periods, where the cash proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreement were recognized.  
And just to spend a minute on that topic, we are pleased that Garrett has agreed to the plan of reorganization, under which they will be recapitalized and well positioned to meet their obligations, including those to Honeywell and will avoid costly litigation. We believe this is the right path forward that maximizes value for all stakeholders.  
Now let's turn to Slide 10 and walk through our 2021 EPS bridge. Segment profit is expected to be the key driver of our earnings growth. Higher sales volumes, commercial excellence, continued productivity improvements and ongoing benefits from previously funded repositioning will contribute $0.54 per share at the midpoint of our guidance.  
The impact of our acquisitions of Sparta, Sine and Rocky Research and the divestiture of the retail footwear business will drive a $0.07 headwind at the midpoint. Below the line and other items are expected to be a $0.22 benefit per share at the midpoint of our guidance primarily driven by higher pension income in '21 compared to 2020.  
I'd like to take a moment to discuss those pension dynamics in a little bit more detail. We expect approximately $1.1 billion of pension and OPEB income in '21, up approximately $260 million from 2020 with the majority of this increase related to our U.S. pension plan.  
We have derisked our U.S. pension plan to approximately 60% of planned assets being a more conservative fixed income-like assets and the remainder in return-seeking assets. As a result of another strong portfolio performance in 2020, our funds returned approximately 14% increase in our pension asset base compared to the prior year. This higher asset base, combined with lower discount rate, is driving higher income in 2021. Our diligent management and strong returns have been an important value driver for the company, putting us in a position where our pension-funded status continues to be robust, ending the year at 113%.  
For taxes, we expect an effective tax rate of 21% to 22%, which would result in a $0.06 headwind per share at the midpoint. And finally, our base case is that our share repurchase program will result in a benefit of $0.07 per share as we reduce our weighted average share count from 711 million to at least 705 million shares. So in total, we expect 2021 earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $8, up 7% to 13% year-over-year adjusted, nearly back to 2019 levels.  
Now let's turn to Slide 11 for a preview of the first quarter. As I noted earlier, we're entering 1Q with a cautious stance as the environment continues to evolve real time, which is driving a wider-than-usual range for a quarter.  
We expect organic growth in the first quarter in the range of down 10% to down 5% organically, which brackets our fourth quarter sales growth performance, recognizing market conditions could vary. The year-over-year sales decline will be driven by continued headwinds in commercial aerospace and UOP, partially offset by ongoing strength in warehouse automation, PPE and advanced materials as well as gradual recovery in other areas of the portfolio.  
Keep in mind, 1Q will be our toughest comp for the year across all 4 segments since the first quarter of last year was only partially disrupted by the COVID pandemic. We expect segment margins in the range of 20.4% to 20.9% in the first quarter, slightly below the fourth quarter based on lower sales leverage given our usual sequential step down in sales from 4Q, partially offset by ongoing productivity. That represents year-over-year segment margin contraction of 140 to 90 basis points. We have positioned ourselves with a streamlined fixed cost base for '21 and expect sequential segment margin improvement from the second quarter on.  
The net below-the-line impact is expected to be between a $40 million expense and a $5 million benefit with a range of repositioning between $100 million and $140 million as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring programs. We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%, and the average share count to be approximately 705 million shares. As a result, we expect first quarter earnings per share between $1.68 and $1.83, down 24% to 17% year-on-year.  
Now let's take a moment to walk through our expectations by segment. In Aerospace, we expect first quarter global flight hours to remain relatively flat from the fourth quarter. We could see a step back in 1Q in certain regions, given the flare-up in infection rates over the holidays. As a result, we expect current softness in flight hours to continue impacting our air transport and business aviation market sales in the first quarter.  
In addition, lower air transport OEM build rates and lower business jet demand will continue to impact our commercial original equipment business. We expect the sensing space to partially offset the challenges in commercial aerospace, supported by stable U.S. defense setting.  
In Building Technologies, we expect business conditions to remain similar to conditions in the fourth quarter. We don't expect significant issues accessing our customer sites, as I mentioned earlier, which will enable us to deliver projects as normal.  
Our strong Building Solutions services backlog should drive growth in the quarter, and we expect demand for building products to continue improving. In addition, we expect continued customer momentum with our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions.  
In PMT, we expect continued customer CapEx and OpEx budget reduction and project delays to impact the engineering and licensing business in UOP and projects and services in HPS. In UOP, we expect continued weakness in gas processing and lower catalyst shipments due to the lower production and refining volumes. However, we do expect to see some demand return in Process Solutions product businesses. And we expect another strong quarter in Advanced Materials driven by continued demand in Fluorine Products.  
Finally, we expect continued strength in STS with another quarter of double-digit growth in Intelligrated and personal protective equipment. Our personal protective equipment backlog remains up triple digits year-over-year, and our Intelligrated backlog is over $2.5 billion, giving us confidence for the first quarter and the full year.  
For productivity solutions and services, we expect continued growth driven by market share gains and low inventory levels in the channel due to favorable sales-out of distributors. While macro conditions continue to put pressure on the sensing and IoT and gas-sensing businesses, we expect strong overall SPS sales growth for the first quarter.  
Now before I turn it back to Darius, let's look at Slide 12 and talk through the ultimate measure of our performance through this crisis: total shareholder return. We're creating shareholder value and outperforming the industry in the broader market in all environments.  
If you look at this chart, you'll see that Honeywell has shown remarkable consistency, outperforming both versus the SLI and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, indicative of the outstanding resiliency of the company. Investors can depend on Honeywell to generate superior returns compared to the benchmarks regardless of market timing due to our rigorous and proven value-creation framework as well as the Honeywell Operating System.  
This crisis reinforced the fact that our value-creation framework, which we discussed at length in our December investor webcast, is highly effective in delivering consistent outperformance in all marketing conditions. In fact, this framework drove Honeywell's shareholder returns above both the XLI and Dow Jones Industrial Average again in 2020.  
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius."

Before we wrap up, I'd like to take a minute on Slide 13 to discuss one of the key elements of our overall ESG story.  
Last quarter, we discussed Honeywell's commitment to shape a safer and more sustainable future. This time, I'd like to focus on another important topic, corporate social responsibility. Honeywell's committed to corporate social responsibility and community involvement, which we demonstrate through unique global programs to look to improve lives and inspire change in the communities around the world.  
Beyond these programs, we acted quickly throughout the course of the pandemic to address the needs of our employees, communities and customers. A few of our more recent actions are shown on the slide.  
Most recently, we announced our participation in a unique public-private partnership, backed by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, to help support the goal of 1 million COVID-19 vaccinations by July 4, 2021. We are partnered with Atrium Health, Tepper Sports & Entertainment, the Charlotte Motor Speedway and the state of North Carolina to administer the vaccine, manage complex logistics and to provide operational support for mass vaccination events. We're very proud to be part of this effort to prevent further spread of the virus by helping frontline workers and other members of our communities get vaccinated.  
Another recent example of Honeywell's contribution to our communities is the important mask delivery milestone we achieved in December, where we delivered more than 225 million face masks that will protect workers in their response to COVID-19. We delivered N95 respirators and surgical face masks to multiple locations in the U.S. for health care systems, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  
In addition, we shipped millions of masks to both state and local governments. We're proud of these contributions and our role in providing much-needed PPE to workers around the country responding to the pandemic.  
Finally, we're also committed to recognizing and respond to the needs of our employees. We recently recognized the dedication and strength of our own frontline integrated supply chain production teams, who have been instrumental in keeping our manufacturing sites running safely, enabling us to meet critical customer needs during these unprecedented times. To show our appreciation, we announced a special $500 recognition award for each of our frontline production and production support employees. We continue to be inspired by the members of our integrated supply chain team, who have truly gone above and beyond to support our customers throughout this dynamic.  
Now let's wrap on Slide 14. There's no doubt that 2020 was a challenging year. However, we effectively managed through the downturn, the repercussions of the global pandemic by focusing on liquidity, cost management, strong operational execution and investment for the future. We drove sequential improvement from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow, creating good momentum into 2021.  
The past year was another proof point that the Honeywell value-creation framework delivers outperformance even in the most challenging economic and market conditions. We continue to invest in organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the downturn to high-return CapEx and M&A, positioning ourselves for the future and the recovery to come. These growth investments will help us solve challenging problems for our customers, address critical global sustainability issues and drive superior shareholder returns.  
I am proud of Honeywell's rapid and effective response to the challenges of 2020. Our employees around the world worked hard to quickly adapt and deliver through the crisis, including ramping up production of critical PPE, developing a portfolio of healthy solutions and delivering growth in multiple areas of the portfolio. We are well positioned for a recovery in the second half of 2021 and beyond as demonstrated by our expectation to return to our key long-term growth commitments in 2021.  
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

As we know, the UOP business particularly is lumpy, and the mix of the catalyst ship can vary dramatically. 
I think if you look at overall, COVID is a big play in this. And I would say, especially as you compare the COVID situation early in Q4 versus where we are now, we're in a much worse place. I mean, that's -- so obviously, that has some weight on that. And frankly, we really thought about whether or not we should guide Q1 at all. I mean, I think that we're in a place that the level of infection throughout the world is the highest it's ever been right now, and there's a lot of uncertainty. But we thought we'd give sort of our best effort and provide a little wider range than normal to give our investors some of our best really educated view of where we think we're going to end up.

So yes, to Darius' point, I just think there are some things out there that are really kind of hard to predict.

If things get better than we think, then we could let the line out a little bit further.

I mean, I think a couple of points. First of all, Steve, if you take a look at our conversion rate for 2021 versus that deconversion or deleverage ratio, it's better, right?

The wildcard in a lot of this is aero aftermarket, right? I mean, that is probably the single hardest number for us to call because it is directly correlated to vaccinations and the speed of those vaccinations and rollout. If that comes in better than we're projecting, then obviously, there is upside to the margin rate. If it doesn't, well, then probably going to be someplace in the mid- to lower end. 
But I think it's really important to note something else, Steve, which is if you look at the upper end of our margin rate for 2021, I mean, we get back to 2019 levels. I mean, so basically, we're kind of taking a 1-year break. And initially, there were discussions about whether it takes us 3 years or 2 years to get back to that. And we're kind of getting -- look on the EPS range and so on pretty much to 2019. And of course, so it's sort of a 1-year break. 
But as usual, we're trying to be prudent in our planning this early on in the year with these many unknowns with the vaccine at levels the world has never seen. So we're trying to net that into our guidance. And obviously, we're going to provide you more clarity as the year progresses."

As you know, I don't think we're expecting dramatic margin improvement in Intelligrated in 2021, and let me explain why. The reason is that we're just booking an incredible amount of greenfield projects. 
You saw that it was another incredibly robust year in terms of bookings. We expect double-digit growth again. And particularly, what's really important is to look at the ratio of our aftermarket business to our projects business. And as you can imagine, it's not changing, or if anything, probably the projects are growing that much faster than aftermarket. So obviously, that was going to keep pressure on the margin. 
But we should view that as a good news thing because as I explained this before, eventually, when the growth slows down, the growth rate will be slower, but the margin rate will be higher. But we're still going to be very much in this greenfield expansion mode for the next few years, which means higher growth rates, lower margins, which over time is going to moderate to lower high top line growth rates and higher margins. So that's sort of how that business is going to grow. 
What's really encouraging here is the amount of share that we're gaining in the marketplace. There's -- unquestionably, this business is winning and winning big in the market."

Just to give you a perspective across all of our business units, this will give you a hint as to how well this business did. Our Honeywell connected buildings business won the business unit of the year across all of Honeywell. So that will tell you a lot about its financial performance. 
So that business is growing as fast as any business we currently have, getting traction on the SAP partnership, but we're also getting traction in the marketplace because, frankly, it's a gap that's unfilled. And we don't think that there is anything out there that is comprehensive in terms of our connected building solutions than what we have, which really covers the full scope of energy management, occupant comfort, safety, overall maintenance footprint.

HPS, we kind of know roughly what we're going to do, which is growth. 
UOP is a little bit of an unknown, right? Because what we've seen can happen is that a lot of the catalyst loads or reloads get pushed out or projects get pushed out. To give me some comfort is that our bookings in the backlog are higher entering 2021 versus what they were in 2020. So I am cautiously optimistic. It's -- we're going to see the growth piece. 
But we've also seen some pushouts of particularly catalyst roads and delay in projects. If that happens, obviously, we're going to have to see pressure from the UOP side. And frankly, the price of oil is at a reasonable number right now. It's not in the 30s or 40s. Now it's in the 50s, which is quite receptive to investment. 
What worries me is that a lot of the big oil and gas majors who are our customers set their budgets just like we do in Q4 of 2020. So -- and they've announced some pretty big cuts. So what we don't know fully is are those -- are there going to be adjustments made based on the economic conditions, based on adjustments to those budgets? There is a point, there is definitely a pent-up demand because you can't underfund this marketplace for too long. 
So whether that happens in the second half of this year or 2022, that story's yet to be told. But what we don't know is we still have a lot of sort of bookings that we expect for the second half that we have visibility to, but they need to land. And that's why we provided the guide we did because we don't know whether or not they will land or they'll only get pushed out to '22. 
But I have zeroed out, and I mean zeroed out because I was in this business in '15 and '16, that there will be a big reinvestment cycle because you can't starve this market for so long. And that's why it's sort of -- we can debate when it will come, but there's no -- undoubtedly it'll happen."

And then the other thing is we are executing on a lot of the gas processing business that we had won back in 2019 and 2020. And a lot of that's in high-growth regions. So you can imagine there's a lower-margin aspect of some of that business as well that we're actually executing here through 2020. 
So that's been an impact to the PMT margins when you take away the catalyst business. And that becomes a bigger share of the overall PMT -- or sorry, yes, PMT mix and UOP in particular."

And then for recurring growth because, frankly, we're sacrificing some top line growth because we're really converting our entire Forge business, Forge software business that's only sold as a SaaS offering. That actually grew in the teens last year. So that was a very good year, and we actually -- we expect an acceleration on both of those figures for 2021. 
But 2020, for me, was a really good proof point. This business is acyclical. And as we continue particularly to build that recurring revenue base, which is growing more than 2x our sort of traditional software base, it's going to be a great tailwind for the future of Honeywell and the future of that software business. And with offerings like we just talked about in connected buildings and our cyber offerings, I'm quite confident that it's going to continue to grow at that kind of pace.

As it relates to working cap and what's happening there, yes, I mean, obviously, sales came down substantially this year and both with some transformation and effectiveness in our process as well as harvesting receivables. We had a very big cash flow from AR this year. We started to see some of the inventory come down in 4Q. For the year, it was still a build. 
And so when we think about next year, that's the area that I expect us to make more progress, is on inventory, and start seeing some inventory reductions, again, even in the face of sales growth. And so I think you're going to see we're world-class on payables. We'll continue to make some steady progress as we do each year. We'll make some progress on our programs around transforming on our credit to collections aspects.

Energy is going to become much, much more pr",405,"Yes. Good question. Twofold. The first one is the world, obviously, the world of energy and how energy is generated is going to change over time. And the direction of that is clear. It's going to be renewables. Energy is going to become much, much more prevalent part of the future. 
But it's also not going to be immediate. It's not going to happen in 2022 or '23, and it's going to be a slow, gradual progress. So a lot of the things that UOP still does will become relevant, particularly where a big part of that business being around gas, natural gas, which we know is the cleanness of the hydrocarbon. So that's Phase 1. 
So I think that we've got to continue to serve our customer base. And frankly, many of them will be transforming in terms of how they provide energy to the world. 
The second part, as you know, we've launched a new business within UOP called the Sustainability Technology Solutions business, which is going to become a bigger and bigger and bigger part of the UOP portfolio. And it really has 3 primary growth levers. One is energy storage, which is economically feasible and viable, and we're building and deploying our first prototype of that this year. So it's not a dream. Two is 360-degree plastics recyclability, which also we're going to be deploying some technology this year. And then the last one, where we're really the pioneers, which is Ecofining, which is going to become a bigger, bigger part of the refining footprint. 
So we've got 3 sort of -- this is under one business umbrella, and that's going to become our growth engine for the future. So what I envision happening is potentially, longer term, some of the more hydrocarbon-oriented offerings will slowly, and I emphasize the word very slowly decline while our Sustainability Technology Solutions business will grow very, very quickly. That's sort of how I see that business evolving. That's why we -- this is another place we're investing, put our dollars to work. 
And we're excited about the future and the kinds of solutions that we have. And as you know, we don't have better scientists anywhere in our company than in UOP when it comes to material science. So I'm quite confident that some of these technology breakthroughs will work and will really enable a path to the future energy footprint of the world."

Let's begin on Slide 2. We finished a challenging year of a very strong quarter, driving sequential improvements from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and robust free cash",953,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. We finished a challenging year of a very strong quarter, driving sequential improvements from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and robust free cash flow.  
In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, flat year-over-year and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. This result was up 33% sequentially from adjusted EPS of $1.56 in the third quarter.  
Organic sales were down 7% year-over-year, 4 percentage points better than the high end of our guidance range and 7 percentage point sequential improvement from the 14% organic sales decline in the third quarter. We drove double-digit year-over-year organic sales growth in Defense and Space, Fluorine Products and recurring Connected Software sales as well as 27% organic growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions and outstanding results.  
Our cost plans delivered our full year commitment of $1.5 billion in savings and helped us protect margins, limiting our decremental margin in the quarter to only 26%, an improvement from Q3 29% decremental margin. Segment margin contracted 30 basis points year-over-year, a significant improvement from the 130 basis point contraction in the third quarter, driven by margin expansion in Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up from $758 million in the third quarter and 9% above Q4 2019, achieving 170% adjusted conversion.  
In terms of capital, we deployed approximately $2.8 billion of cash to dividends, growth CapEx investments, share repurchases and M&A. We'll talk more about our recent M&A activity on the next page.  
For the full year, we deployed $3.7 billion to reduce shares outstanding by approximately 3%. With these strong fourth quarter results, we finished 2020 with $7.10 of adjusted earnings per share and an 11% organic sales decline, both above the high end of our expectations from October. For the full year, we generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow, resulting in adjusted conversion of 105% or 16% of revenue, a very strong result.  
There's no doubt that the COVID-19 crisis created significant challenges for the business and economies around the world. I'm very proud of Honeywell's ability to rise to the challenge to deliver strong execution and sequentially improving results throughout the year.  
Next, let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss our recent M&A activities. I'm pleased with the progress we made in actively shaping our portfolio, and our recent M&A announcements directly align with our ongoing transformation into a premier software industrial company.  
In the fourth quarter, we completed 3 acquisitions and announced the fourth, all of which meet the rigorous criteria in our M&A framework, which ensures that transactions are aligned with our portfolio strategy and meet our return expectations. We have previously discussed the acquisitions of Rocky Research and Ballard Unmanned Systems, which provide emerging technologies aligned to strategic initiatives in our Aerospace business as well as our strategic investment with path to full ownership in Trinity Mobility, which supports our smart cities breakthrough initiative in Honeywell Building Technologies.  
In mid-December, we acquired Sine Group, a technology and software-as-a-service or a SaaS company that provides digital management solutions that are readily accessible with mobile devices. Sine's technology will enhance our connected building offerings and will also support a mobile platform for a broader portfolio of Honeywell Forge offerings. We will expand on Sine's features and solutions and make Sine's product available to customers globally.  
Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire Sparta Systems, a leading provider of enterprise quality management software, or QMS, with the life sciences industry for $1.3 billion. We previously highlighted the importance of the life sciences market as a breakthrough growth initiative. The acquisition of Sparta further bolsters our software, controls and analytics capabilities in this space. Sparta's AI-enabled SaaS offering will combine with Honeywell Forge to provide greater value to our life sciences and pharma customers. Additionally, Sparta complements our growth strategies for the automation and visualization business within Honeywell Process Solutions, enabling greater penetration in life sciences and the pharma market segments. Sparta will further bolster Honeywell's portfolio of accretive, noncyclical, recurring connected software sales.  
I'm excited about the new technologies and adjacencies we have unlocked through our recent acquisitions and investments. We said before that we have an active M&A pipeline, and this series of acquisitions is further evidence that we are continuously developing our portfolio and investing in new opportunities.  
We also evaluate our portfolio for areas that are no longer core to our long-term objectives. Earlier this week, we signed an agreement to sell our performance and the lifestyle footwear business to a leading manufacturer of premium footwear and apparel, Rocky Brands. The transaction value is approximately $230 million and is scheduled to close by the end of the first quarter. Our SPS business will continue to provide industrial safety footwear for workers.  
M&A is just one important part of our broader capital deployment strategy, which also includes share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. Let's turn to the next slide to view our total capital deployment.  
In 2020, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to identifying and investing in high-return opportunities that help reshape the business for a software-oriented future. Over the past 3 years, we have consistently deployed more than 100% of operating cash flow to fund share repurchases, dividends, M&A and capital expenditure. 2020 was no exception.  
Even during a global pandemic, we deployed $7.5 billion of capital, essentially equal to the prior 2 years, demonstrating our commitment to investing in high-return opportunities in any environment.  
Now let's turn to Slide 5, where Greg will discuss our execution record in a downturn."

We showed a slide similar to this one during our December investor webcast. And I want to highlight it again here today because I think it nicely summarizes our ability to manage through tough times.  
Our execution through this year's downturn clearly demonstrates our ability to move quickly and decisively to reduce fixed costs, to protect margins, to ensure liquidity, invest in growth and position ourselves for recovery, while at the same time, we maintained focus on our pretransformation initiatives, Honeywell Connected Enterprise, Honeywell Digital and the integrated supply chain. At the beginning of the pandemic, we first acted quickly to address our liquidity and cost structure. Our strong balance sheet provides us with stability as well as the opportunity for investment during challenging times, and as you saw from Darius, we took advantage of that.  
Through a series of actions to further bolster our financial flexibility, we increased our cash and short-term investments from approximately $10 billion at the end of 2019 to over $15 billion by the end of the second quarter, which we maintained through the end of the year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong cash flow and efficiently access the capital markets during even the most disruptive times, all while protecting our debt rating.  
On the cost side, we responded fast and early to the crisis by identifying and delivering on a 2-phase cost program, which achieved $1.5 billion in year-over-year fixed cost savings as we had committed. Approximately 70% of these savings or about $1 billion represent a permanent reduction to our fixed cost base.  
To achieve this, we curtailed discretionary expenses, took temporary actions to reduce costs, including reducing executive and Board pay, and remove significant structural costs through our repositioning programs. Our streamlined cost base positions us well for 2021 recovery and will drive margin expansion across all 4 of our segments as well as capacity for investment as sales recover in 2021 and beyond.  
As Darius described on the previous page, we strategically deployed capital to drive returns and to position our business for future growth. Importantly, we also directed resources to address our customers' COVID-19 challenges around the world. We've deployed additional capital into high-return growth investments to address urgent customer needs, particularly in personal protective equipment and warehouse automation. We're also helping the world cope and recover from the effects of COVID-19 through our new portfolio of healthy solutions. We generated approximately $655 million in sales for our healthy solutions in 2020. And we have a pipeline of approximately $2.1 billion, which will drive growth again in '21.  
As a result of our swift actions during the downturn, 4Q decremental margins were limited to 26%, improving from 33% in 2Q and 29% in 3Q and demonstrating our ability to protect our margins in a very difficult environment. We are clearly well positioned for a variety of outcomes as the recovery progresses into 2021 and beyond. And our shareholders are benefiting from that with a total shareholder return of 23% in 2020, which was over 2x greater than the XLI.  
Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our fourth quarter results in a bit more detail and our 2021 outlook. As Darius highlighted, we delivered a strong fourth quarter to end 2020 with sequential improvement from third quarter on all our key financial metrics.  
Sales declined by 7% organically due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is 4 percentage points better than the high end of our guidance and represents a 7 percentage point sequential improvement from the 14% organic sales decline in the third quarter, driven by sequential sales growth from the third quarter in all 4 segments.  
Starting with Aerospace. Fourth quarter sales were down 19% organically, a 6 percentage point sequential improvement from the down 25% we had in the third quarter. Lower commercial aftermarket demand due to the ongoing impact of reduced flight hours and lower volumes in commercial OE equipment was partially offset by double-digit growth in Defense & Space.  
Though still down significantly year-over-year, our commercial aftermarket business did improve sequentially from the third quarter. Our air transport aftermarket business was down 48% organically in the quarter compared to 55% in Q3. And our business aviation aftermarket was down 6% organically compared to 28% in the third quarter.  
Moving on to Building Technologies. Sales declined 4% organically, a 4 percentage point sequential improvement from the 8% down in 3Q. Global solutions projects were impacted by timing due to the customer order pushouts we saw earlier in the year, which is partially offset by growth in services. Customers are now placing orders for projects that they had previously delayed. As a result, orders in Building Solutions grew 32% year-over-year, and the services backlog was up double digits year-over-year to finish the fourth quarter, position the business well for '21.  
On the building products side of the portfolio, sales and orders improved sequentially from the third quarter and the commercial fire business returned to year-over-year growth.  
In PMT, sales were down 12% organically, a 4 percentage point sequential improvement from the 16% organic decline in 3Q. Process Solutions was impacted by continued delays in projects and services as well as volume declines in thermal solutions and smart energy due to end market softness. However, process solutions orders were up 30% sequentially from Q3. UOP continued to be impacted by weakness in the energy end markets, though sales improved sequentially from the third quarter across the UOP portfolio. And orders were up 21% versus the third quarter as well.  
Finally, Advanced Materials sales increased 8% year-over-year organically, driven by growth across the Fluorine Products portfolio, including strong auto and on demand.  
In SPS, organic sales were up 27% year-over-year, a very strong result to end the year in which the SPS team stepped up to meet unprecedented demand for critical safety products. Intelligrated and personal protective equipment led the way with another quarter of double-digit organic growth, followed by high single-digit growth in productivity solutions and services. We are encouraged by the turnaround that team has orchestrated in 2020. SPS exited 2020 with a backlog of approximately $4 billion, which was nearly double our backlog at the end of 2019, placing the business in a very strong position to start 2021, where we expect to see a robust first half in particular.  
Overall, we expanded margins year-over-year in 3 of the 4 segments: Aerospace, HBT and SPS, limiting Honeywell's overall segment margin contraction to 30 basis points and ending the quarter with a segment margin of 21.1%. This was a sequential improvement of 120 basis points from 3Q segment margins of 19.9%, an improvement of 260 basis points from the 2Q trough, demonstrating the effectiveness of our response to the pandemic, in particular, our cost actions and operational rigor.  
We delivered cost actions in the fourth quarter that brought us to $1.5 billion of savings for the year, right at the stated range that we had highlighted earlier, limiting our full year margin contraction to 70 basis points despite the challenging operating environment. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, flat year-over-year and up 33% sequentially from adjusted EPS of $1.56 in the third quarter. This result was $0.05 above the high end of our guidance, driven by higher segment profit due to better-than-expected sales volumes in Aerospace, HBT and SPS. Given the strength we saw in the fourth quarter, we were able to make discrete investments in the business and our employees, including in IT, marketing spend for Forge and brand expansion in the Middle East and China as well as a special $500 recognition award for our IST frontline production and production support employees, who performed so greatly and well through this crisis.  
Repositioning was lower than in 4Q a year ago as expected, driving a $0.15 year-over-year tailwind below the line. Interest income and foreign currency were lower than 4Q '19, driving a $0.07 headwind below the line, which was offset by higher pension income. Our effective tax rate and share count were also lower than in the fourth quarter of '19, driving $0.02 and $0.04 of EPS benefit, respectively. A bridge from 4Q '19 adjusted earnings per share to 4Q '20 can be found in the appendix of this presentation.  
I am also proud to report that our fourth quarter cash flow generation is very strong. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow, up 9% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted free cash flow conversion of 170%. Free cash flow and conversion both improved year-over-year due to working capital improvements, including [ introduction ] and strong collections. Our teams put an extra focus on cash in the fourth quarter and really delivered, and we expect to continue this progress in '21, particularly on inventory.  
In terms of capital deployment, we paid approximately $670 million in dividends, repurchased $1.6 billion in Honeywell shares, over-delivering on our commitment of 1% share count reduction in 2020. We invested approximately $300 million in CapEx and deployed over $250 million to complete 3 acquisitions. So all in all, a very strong fourth quarter to close out 2020.  
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to talk about our 2021 planning assumptions. We hope and expect that the worse is behind us as we move on from 2020. We're seeing promising signs of the recovery unfolding, but there continue to be a few key uncertainties to be mindful of.  
Over the past couple of months, we've seen governments around the world approve multiple effective COVID-19 vaccines and begin rolling them out. Our current view of '21 assumes the vaccines are widely distributed, leading to lower manageable infection rates over time and allowing the global economy to largely be open and stabilize.  
However, many regions have recently been coping with a new wave of infections and lockdowns, new COVID strains and vaccine distribution challenges. So it remains unclear when exactly infection rates will slow down materially and the economic recovery will really accelerate.  
As a macro planning assumption, we're expecting the recovery to be weighted to the second half of the year and are expecting to experience a little bit of a slower start in 1Q. We're assuming fiscal stimulus to remain supportive of the economy in '21. We do expect passengers will begin flying more freely again as the vaccine rollout begins, leading to a modest improvement in global flight hours in the first half and acceleration in the second half. So this is one area where we are seeing some renewed softness, particularly in China and APAC, as the year begins. We also expect stability in defense budget spending. And finally, we assume improved macro conditions broadly will drive moderate increase in oil consumption in the second half of the year.  
Given that, let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss our markets and segment outlook. Starting in Aerospace. The previously mentioned increase in flight hours as the pandemic subsides will gradually lead to improvements in our commercial aerospace business as aftermarket demand accelerates, particularly in the second half. However, we expect recovery in the commercial OE business to lag the commercial aftermarket recovery due to a gradual ramp in commercial OEM build rates.  
Stable defense spending should support continued growth in our Defense & Space business at a rather reduced pace versus the double-digit growth we experienced in 2020. In total, we expect the Aerospace business to be flat to up low single digits in '21.  
In HBT, we expect the nonresidential market to remain relatively stable in '21. We anticipate solid demand for building products and management systems in key verticals, including data centers, warehousing and health care. However, in other verticals, including hospitality and commercial offices, we expect them to remain challenged as the world recovers from the effects of the pandemic. These challenges will be partially offset by the traction we have been gaining over the past couple of quarters with our healthy building solutions with key wins in education, commercial offices, health care and some government verticals.  
Our solutions address key customer concerns, including air quality, social distancing and controlled and cautious access, and we expect continued demand through the year. Building Solutions ended 2020 with a quarter of strong year-over-year orders growth, which positions the business well for '21. And we expect customers to continue placing orders that they deferred in '20 as the macro economy recovers.  
We also have a robust services backlog that is up strong double digits year-over-year and will support 2021 growth. We don't expect building access to be a significant issue in '21, so we don't anticipate any material challenges getting on sites to complete projects. In total, we expect HBT to grow low single digits for the year.  
In PMT, we expect the oil and gas and petrochemical markets to remain relatively flat, with oil consumption picking up slightly in the second half. We expect the HPS recovery to be led by our large backlog of global mega projects and the product businesses.  
In UOP, we expect the energy markets to remain challenged through the year, particularly in the first half. However, we expect business conditions will recover sooner for petrochemical than oil and gas. We anticipate increasing investments in renewable fuels, which will drive demand for our new sustainable Technology Solutions business and partially offset challenges in the oil and gas market.  
In addition, the specialty chemicals market is expected to grow modestly in '21, with strength in global health care, automotive and residential construction end markets driving demand for advanced materials. Overall, we expect TNT to be down slightly to up low single digits for the year.  
Lastly, in SPS, we expect continued strength in warehouse automation and personal protective equipment as we execute the delivery of our robust backlog. We also expect productivity solutions and services to grow as the strategic turnaround of the business drives market share gains, and we expect gas sensing to recover in line with the market. In total, we expect SPS to grow double digits in '21 with comps getting tougher in the back half as we lap strong growth in the back half of 2020.  
So overall, we see improvement across most of our key end markets in '21 and we have confidence in our continued operational execution. The pace of the recovery may vary due to the items we discussed on the prior slide, so we are taking a cautious approach as we begin the year.  
Now let's move to Slide 9 to discuss how these dynamics come together for our 2021 financial guidance. For 2021, we expect sales of $33.4 billion to $34.4 billion, which represents overall organic growth -- sales growth in the range of 1% to 4%, reflecting double-digit recurring connected software growth and the impact of our announced M&A divestitures. Segment margins are expected to expand 30 to 70 basis points, supported by higher sales volume and our streamlined fixed cost base following 2020 cost actions with investment for growth.  
While we expect margin expansion across all the businesses, SPS will lead the path as we scale up capacity and become more efficient, followed by Aero driven by high-margin aftermarket recovery. These organic growth and segment margin expectations are consistent with our long-term commitments for low to mid-single-digit organic growth and 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion and give us flexibility to deliver earnings growth and invest for the future.  
2020 was a challenging year, but we'll be back on track to deliver our standard commitment to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. So net below the line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $130 million to positive $20 million, which includes capacity for $400 million to $525 million of repositioning.  
We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% and a weighted average share count of approximately 705 million for the year, representing our minimum 1% reduction in shares. As a result, we are guiding earnings per share of $7.60 to $8, up 7% to 13% adjusted.  
We see free cash flow in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion in 2021. That represents cash margins of 15% to 16% of sales commensurate with the 2019 and 2020 rates that we have demonstrated and a cash conversion in the 95% range. Keeping in mind that our conversion, excluding noncash pension income, would actually be approaching 115%, so very healthy on numbers overall.  
This range does include $375 million that we expect to receive in an upfront payment from Garrett, resulting from their proposed plan of reorganization. We'll continue to include cash receipts from Garrett going forward within free cash flow in order to be comparable to prior periods, where the cash proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreement were recognized.  
And just to spend a minute on that topic, we are pleased that Garrett has agreed to the plan of reorganization, under which they will be recapitalized and well positioned to meet their obligations, including those to Honeywell and will avoid costly litigation. We believe this is the right path forward that maximizes value for all stakeholders.  
Now let's turn to Slide 10 and walk through our 2021 EPS bridge. Segment profit is expected to be the key driver of our earnings growth. Higher sales volumes, commercial excellence, continued productivity improvements and ongoing benefits from previously funded repositioning will contribute $0.54 per share at the midpoint of our guidance.  
The impact of our acquisitions of Sparta, Sine and Rocky Research and the divestiture of the retail footwear business will drive a $0.07 headwind at the midpoint. Below the line and other items are expected to be a $0.22 benefit per share at the midpoint of our guidance primarily driven by higher pension income in '21 compared to 2020.  
I'd like to take a moment to discuss those pension dynamics in a little bit more detail. We expect approximately $1.1 billion of pension and OPEB income in '21, up approximately $260 million from 2020 with the majority of this increase related to our U.S. pension plan.  
We have derisked our U.S. pension plan to approximately 60% of planned assets being a more conservative fixed income-like assets and the remainder in return-seeking assets. As a result of another strong portfolio performance in 2020, our funds returned approximately 14% increase in our pension asset base compared to the prior year. This higher asset base, combined with lower discount rate, is driving higher income in 2021. Our diligent management and strong returns have been an important value driver for the company, putting us in a position where our pension-funded status continues to be robust, ending the year at 113%.  
For taxes, we expect an effective tax rate of 21% to 22%, which would result in a $0.06 headwind per share at the midpoint. And finally, our base case is that our share repurchase program will result in a benefit of $0.07 per share as we reduce our weighted average share count from 711 million to at least 705 million shares. So in total, we expect 2021 earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $8, up 7% to 13% year-over-year adjusted, nearly back to 2019 levels.  
Now let's turn to Slide 11 for a preview of the first quarter. As I noted earlier, we're entering 1Q with a cautious stance as the environment continues to evolve real time, which is driving a wider-than-usual range for a quarter.  
We expect organic growth in the first quarter in the range of down 10% to down 5% organically, which brackets our fourth quarter sales growth performance, recognizing market conditions could vary. The year-over-year sales decline will be driven by continued headwinds in commercial aerospace and UOP, partially offset by ongoing strength in warehouse automation, PPE and advanced materials as well as gradual recovery in other areas of the portfolio.  
Keep in mind, 1Q will be our toughest comp for the year across all 4 segments since the first quarter of last year was only partially disrupted by the COVID pandemic. We expect segment margins in the range of 20.4% to 20.9% in the first quarter, slightly below the fourth quarter based on lower sales leverage given our usual sequential step down in sales from 4Q, partially offset by ongoing productivity. That represents year-over-year segment margin contraction of 140 to 90 basis points. We have positioned ourselves with a streamlined fixed cost base for '21 and expect sequential segment margin improvement from the second quarter on.  
The net below-the-line impact is expected to be between a $40 million expense and a $5 million benefit with a range of repositioning between $100 million and $140 million as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring programs. We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%, and the average share count to be approximately 705 million shares. As a result, we expect first quarter earnings per share between $1.68 and $1.83, down 24% to 17% year-on-year.  
Now let's take a moment to walk through our expectations by segment. In Aerospace, we expect first quarter global flight hours to remain relatively flat from the fourth quarter. We could see a step back in 1Q in certain regions, given the flare-up in infection rates over the holidays. As a result, we expect current softness in flight hours to continue impacting our air transport and business aviation market sales in the first quarter.  
In addition, lower air transport OEM build rates and lower business jet demand will continue to impact our commercial original equipment business. We expect the sensing space to partially offset the challenges in commercial aerospace, supported by stable U.S. defense setting.  
In Building Technologies, we expect business conditions to remain similar to conditions in the fourth quarter. We don't expect significant issues accessing our customer sites, as I mentioned earlier, which will enable us to deliver projects as normal.  
Our strong Building Solutions services backlog should drive growth in the quarter, and we expect demand for building products to continue improving. In addition, we expect continued customer momentum with our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions.  
In PMT, we expect continued customer CapEx and OpEx budget reduction and project delays to impact the engineering and licensing business in UOP and projects and services in HPS. In UOP, we expect continued weakness in gas processing and lower catalyst shipments due to the lower production and refining volumes. However, we do expect to see some demand return in Process Solutions product businesses. And we expect another strong quarter in Advanced Materials driven by continued demand in Fluorine Products.  
Finally, we expect continued strength in STS with another quarter of double-digit growth in Intelligrated and personal protective equipment. Our personal protective equipment backlog remains up triple digits year-over-year, and our Intelligrated backlog is over $2.5 billion, giving us confidence for the first quarter and the full year.  
For productivity solutions and services, we expect continued growth driven by market share gains and low inventory levels in the channel due to favorable sales-out of distributors. While macro conditions continue to put pressure on the sensing and IoT and gas-sensing businesses, we expect strong overall SPS sales growth for the first quarter.  
Now before I turn it back to Darius, let's look at Slide 12 and talk through the ultimate measure of our performance through this crisis: total shareholder return. We're creating shareholder value and outperforming the industry in the broader market in all environments.  
If you look at this chart, you'll see that Honeywell has shown remarkable consistency, outperforming both versus the SLI and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, indicative of the outstanding resiliency of the company. Investors can depend on Honeywell to generate superior returns compared to the benchmarks regardless of market timing due to our rigorous and proven value-creation framework as well as the Honeywell Operating System.  
This crisis reinforced the fact that our value-creation framework, which we discussed at length in our December investor webcast, is highly effective in delivering consistent outperformance in all marketing conditions. In fact, this framework drove Honeywell's shareholder returns above both the XLI and Dow Jones Industrial Average again in 2020.  
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius."

Before we wrap up, I'd like to take a minute on Slide 13 to discuss one of the key elements of our overall ESG story.  
Last quarter, we discussed Honeywell's commitment to shape a safer and more sustainable future. This time, I'd like to focus on another important topic, corporate social responsibility. Honeywell's committed to corporate social responsibility and community involvement, which we demonstrate through unique global programs to look to improve lives and inspire change in the communities around the world.  
Beyond these programs, we acted quickly throughout the course of the pandemic to address the needs of our employees, communities and customers. A few of our more recent actions are shown on the slide.  
Most recently, we announced our participation in a unique public-private partnership, backed by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, to help support the goal of 1 million COVID-19 vaccinations by July 4, 2021. We are partnered with Atrium Health, Tepper Sports & Entertainment, the Charlotte Motor Speedway and the state of North Carolina to administer the vaccine, manage complex logistics and to provide operational support for mass vaccination events. We're very proud to be part of this effort to prevent further spread of the virus by helping frontline workers and other members of our communities get vaccinated.  
Another recent example of Honeywell's contribution to our communities is the important mask delivery milestone we achieved in December, where we delivered more than 225 million face masks that will protect workers in their response to COVID-19. We delivered N95 respirators and surgical face masks to multiple locations in the U.S. for health care systems, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  
In addition, we shipped millions of masks to both state and local governments. We're proud of these contributions and our role in providing much-needed PPE to workers around the country responding to the pandemic.  
Finally, we're also committed to recognizing and respond to the needs of our employees. We recently recognized the dedication and strength of our own frontline integrated supply chain production teams, who have been instrumental in keeping our manufacturing sites running safely, enabling us to meet critical customer needs during these unprecedented times. To show our appreciation, we announced a special $500 recognition award for each of our frontline production and production support employees. We continue to be inspired by the members of our integrated supply chain team, who have truly gone above and beyond to support our customers throughout this dynamic.  
Now let's wrap on Slide 14. There's no doubt that 2020 was a challenging year. However, we effectively managed through the downturn, the repercussions of the global pandemic by focusing on liquidity, cost management, strong operational execution and investment for the future. We drove sequential improvement from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow, creating good momentum into 2021.  
The past year was another proof point that the Honeywell value-creation framework delivers outperformance even in the most challenging economic and market conditions. We continue to invest in organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the downturn to high-return CapEx and M&A, positioning ourselves for the future and the recovery to come. These growth investments will help us solve challenging problems for our customers, address critical global sustainability issues and drive superior shareholder returns.  
I am proud of Honeywell's rapid and effective response to the challenges of 2020. Our employees around the world worked hard to quickly adapt and deliver through the crisis, including ramping up production of critical PPE, developing a portfolio of healthy solutions and delivering growth in multiple areas of the portfolio. We are well positioned for a recovery in the second half of 2021 and beyond as demonstrated by our expectation to return to our key long-term growth commitments in 2021.  
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

As we know, the UOP business particularly is lumpy, and the mix of the catalyst ship can vary dramatically. 
I think if you look at overall, COVID is a big play in this. And I would say, especially as you compare the COVID situation early in Q4 versus where we are now, we're in a much worse place. I mean, that's -- so obviously, that has some weight on that. And frankly, we really thought about whether or not we should guide Q1 at all. I mean, I think that we're in a place that the level of infection throughout the world is the highest it's ever been right now, and there's a lot of uncertainty. But we thought we'd give sort of our best effort and provide a little wider range than normal to give our investors some of our best really educated view of where we think we're going to end up.

So yes, to Darius' point, I just think there are some things out there that are really kind of hard to predict. But as I said in my remarks, I mean, the down 10 to down 5 kind of brackets, the down 7 we had in the fourth quarter, the down 10 is in case something gets worse that we don't really can see at this moment. But it could be better than that if things progress. 
So no, nothing -- there's nothing strange. I mean, we always have a fourth quarter to 1Q decremental sequential sales. 4Q is always our strongest quarter. So nothing unusual in there."

We have some important things to get done in Aerospace from an R&D perspective. We are funding some of that already. If things get better than we think, then we could let the line out a little bit further. 
So if you look at our conversion in the last 3 quarters of this guide, it's really converting at like 37%. Just the math says, a 37% conversion rate in Q2 through 4 with this guide.

First of all, Steve, if you take a look at our conversion rate for 2021 versus that deconversion or deleverage ratio, it's better, right? It's -- and we project that in Q2 to Q4. 
The wildcard in a lot of this is aero aftermarket, right? I mean, that is probably the single hardest number for us to call because it is directly correlated to vaccinations and the speed of those vaccinations and rollout. If that comes in better than we're projecting, then obviously, there is upside to the margin rate. If it doesn't, well, then probably going to be someplace in the mid- to lower end. 
But I think it's really important to note something else, Steve, which is if you look at the upper end of our margin rate for 2021, I mean, we get back to 2019 levels. I mean, so basically, we're kind of taking a 1-year break. And initially, there were discussions about whether it takes us 3 years or 2 years to get back to that. And we're kind of getting -- look on the EPS range and so on pretty much to 2019. And of course, so it's sort of a 1-year break. 
But as usual, we're trying to be prudent in our planning this early on in the year with these many unknowns with the vaccine at levels the world has never seen. So we're trying to net that into our guidance. And obviously, we're going to provide you more clarity as the year progresses."

As you know, I don't think we're expecting dramatic margin improvement in Intelligrated in 2021, and let me explain why. The reason is that we're just booking an incredible amount of greenfield projects. 
You saw that it was another incredibly robust year in terms of bookings. We expect double-digit growth again. And particularly, what's really important is to look at the ratio of our aftermarket business to our projects business. And as you can imagine, it's not changing, or if anything, probably the projects are growing that much faster than aftermarket. So obviously, that was going to keep pressure on the margin. 
But we should view that as a good news thing because as I explained this before, eventually, when the growth slows down, the growth rate will be slower, but the margin rate will be higher. But we're still going to be very much in this greenfield expansion mode for the next few years, which means higher growth rates, lower margins, which over time is going to moderate to lower high top line growth rates and higher margins. So that's sort of how that business is going to grow.

You do have other build exposures in fluorines, which is going to be really good. I would think there's UOP catalyst reload likely next year based on pent-up demand. And then we've got commodity prices higher. I'm just wondering how that actually plays into your thinking for the segment, both in terms of sales and margins. And I think PMT detrimentals were about 50% or over that in the fourth quarter. So any color you can provide? I'm priming a bunch of stuff into my one question. So there you go."

HPS, we kind of know roughly what we're going to do, which is growth. 
UOP is a little bit of an unknown, right? Because what we've seen can happen is that a lot of the catalyst loads or reloads get pushed out or projects get pushed out. To give me some comfort is that our bookings in the backlog are higher entering 2021 versus what they were in 2020. So I am cautiously optimistic. It's -- we're going to see the growth piece. 
But we've also seen some pushouts of particularly catalyst roads and delay in projects. If that happens, obviously, we're going to have to see pressure from the UOP side. And frankly, the price of oil is at a reasonable number right now. It's not in the 30s or 40s. Now it's in the 50s, which is quite receptive to investment. 
What worries me is that a lot of the big oil and gas majors who are our customers set their budgets just like we do in Q4 of 2020. So -- and they've announced some pretty big cuts. So what we don't know fully is are those -- are there going to be adjustments made based on the economic conditions, based on adjustments to those budgets? There is a point, there is definitely a pent-up demand because you can't underfund this marketplace for too long. 
So whether that happens in the second half of this year or 2022, that story's yet to be told. But what we don't know is we still have a lot of sort of bookings that we expect for the second half that we have visibility to, but they need to land. And that's why we provided the guide we did because we don't know whether or not they will land or they'll only get pushed out to '22. 
But I have zeroed out, and I mean zeroed out because I was in this business in '15 and '16, that there will be a big reinvestment cycle because you can't starve this market for so long. And that's why it's sort of -- we can debate when it will come, but there's no -- undoubtedly it'll happen."

And then the other thing is we are executing on a lot of the gas processing business that we had won back in 2019 and 2020. And a lot of that's in high-growth regions. So you can imagine there's a lower-margin aspect of some of that business as well that we're actually executing here through 2020. 
So that's been an impact to the PMT margins when you take away the catalyst business. And that becomes a bigger share of the overall PMT -- or sorry, yes, PMT mix and UOP in particular."

I understand it probably varies by business. Obviously, a lot of different end markets there. But can you talk a little bit about how adoption has fared and customer conversations are going?

But just to give you a couple of rough numbers, if you think about our overall software growth, it was mid-single digit even in the 2020 environment. 
And then for recurring growth because, frankly, we're sacrificing some top line growth because we're really converting our entire Forge business, Forge software business that's only sold as a SaaS offering. That actually grew in the teens last year. So that was a very good year, and we actually -- we expect an acceleration on both of those figures for 2021. 
But 2020, for me, was a really good proof point. This business is acyclical. And as we continue particularly to build that recurring revenue base, which is growing more than 2x our sort of traditional software base, it's going to be a great tailwind for the future of Honeywell and the future of that software business. And with offerings like we just talked about in connected buildings and our cyber offerings, I'm quite confident that it's going to continue to grow at that kind of pace.

So approaching 100%, it's 113% to 115% conversion ex pension. So just keep in mind relative to the basic metrics, they're pretty healthy numbers. 
As it relates to working cap and what's happening there, yes, I mean, obviously, sales came down substantially this year and both with some transformation and effectiveness in our process as well as harvesting receivables. We had a very big cash flow from AR this year. We started to see some of the inventory come down in 4Q. For the year, it was still a build. 
And so when we think about next year, that's the area that I expect us to make more progress, is on inventory, and start seeing some inventory reductions, again, even in the face of sales growth. And so I think you're going to see we're world-class on payables. We'll continue to make some steady progress as we do each year. We'll make some progress on our programs around transforming on our credit to collections aspects. And so I would expect we'll make some more progress on past dues and DSO, but the big effort is really going to be focused around inventory in 2021."

I'd also say we've done a nice job on advances on build, too, in terms of 2020. So I thought that this performance on cash was exceptional.

I mean, I can't remember the last time we put anything substantive into our pension fund, which obviously would take away from our ability to deploy capital into things that are going to drive growth. 
So that's when I say it's a value driver, particularly vis-a-vis others, it's a huge value driver. And in that case, in particular, so that's -- and yes, it's 113% funded. I feel great about where that is. Even if we were to have a bit of a market down draft, we would still be in a very good position in terms of that funding level.

But I think what our investors should really remember is that when they think about pension, particularly given the derisking that we have and the amount of fixed instruments that we have there, this should be completely worry-free for them because even a huge adjustment in the stock market is not going to put us in peril. So I just think that this is sort of a safe haven in terms of an area that, frankly, is a big question mark for a lot of companies out there.

And the direction of that is clear. It's going to be renewables. Energy is going to become much, much more prevalent part of the future. 
But it's also not going to be immediate. It's not going to happen in 2022 or '23, and it's going to be a slow, gradual progress. So a lot of the things that UOP still does will become relevant, particularly where a big part of that business being around gas, natural gas, which we know is the cleanness of the hydrocarbon. So that's Phase 1. 
So I think that we've got to continue to serve our customer base. And frankly, many of them will be transforming in terms of how they provide energy to the world. 
The second part, as you know, we've launched a new business within UOP called the Sustainability Technology Solutions business, which is going to become a bigger and bigger and bigger part of the UOP portfolio. And it really has 3 primary growth levers. One is energy storage, which is economically feasible and viable, and we're building and deploying our first prototype of that this year. So it's not a dream. Two is 360-degree plastics recyclability, which also we're going to be deploying some technology this year. And then the last one, where we're really the pioneers, which is Ecofining, which is going to become a bigger, bigger part of the refining footprint. 
So we've got 3 sort of -- this is under one business umbrella, and that's going to become our growth engine for the future. So what I envision happening is potentially, longer term, some of the more hydrocarbon-oriented offerings will slowly, and I emphasize the word very slowly decline while our Sustainability Technology Solutions business will grow very, very quickly. That's sort of how I see that business evolving. That's why we -- this is another place we're investing, put our dollars to work. 
And we're excited about the future and the kinds of solutions that we have. And as you know, we don't have better scientists anywhere in our company than in UOP when it comes to material science. So I'm quite confident that some of these technology breakthroughs will work and will really enable a path to the future energy footprint of the world."

We delivered a very strong start to 2021, exceeding the high end of our first quarter organic sales growth, segment margin and adjusted earnings per share guidance range. 
In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.92, down 13% year-over-year and $0.09 above the high end of our guidance range. Organic sales were down 2% year-over-year, a 5 percentage point sequential improvement from the 7% organic sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
We drove year-over-year organic sales growth in 2 out of our 4 segments, HBT and SPS, despite facing difficult comps since the first quarter of 2020 wasn't fully impacted by the pandemic. Honeywell Building Technologies returned to growth, and Safety and Productivity Solutions achieved an outstanding 47% organic growth in the quarter. 
We also drove double-digit year-over-year organic growth in connected software sales driven by strong demand for our connected buildings and cyber solutions. We delivered a segment margin of 21%, 10 basis points above our guidance, with margin expansion in Aerospace, HBT and SPS. 
We generated $757 million of free cash flow in the quarter, a strong performance despite increased investments in high-return capital expenditures, which were up approximately $80 million year-over-year as we position ourselves for the recovery. Adjusted free cash flow conversion was 56%, up 500 basis points year-over-year and the strength of working capital improvements. 
In terms of capital, we deployed $3 billion to dividends, growth CapEx, share repurchases and M&A during the quarter. We opportunistically repurchased 4 million shares throughout the quarter, reducing our share count to 705 million. 
We're off to a strong start in 2021. And I'm very confident the continued improvement in our end markets, coupled with accelerated innovation and strong execution, will provide a long runway for continued business improvement and top-tier value creation for our shareholders. 
Next, let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss a few of our recent business highlights. I'm excited to share a few recent recognitions and partnerships that highlight our commitment to upholding the highest ethical standards and our focus on creating breakthrough innovations. 
First, Honeywell is one of only 8 companies in the industrial manufacturing category to be named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. Ethisphere is an organization that evaluates and honors businesses around the globe and across industries for their strong cultural, environmental, social governance and diversity practices. We are proud to have earned this prestigious ranking. 
Second, Honeywell's named to Fast Company's annual list of the World's Most Innovative Companies for '21. In addition to being recognized for a 100-year heritage of creating groundbreaking technologies like quantum computing that transform the way the world works, Honeywell was also recognized for mobilizing quickly to help people and businesses cope with the pandemic, including our launch of new N95 mask manufacturing and our introduction of UV treatment systems for airplanes, healthy building solutions and innovative aclar-edge bottles and vials. 
We also recently announced our partnership with musician and entrepreneur will.i.am to launch the XUPERMASK, a one-of-a-kind, innovative, smart face mask for the mid- and postpandemic world. The XUPERMASK is easily adjustable to fit a variety of face shapes and is enhanced with multiple functions for the modern lifestyle, including dual 3-speed fans and HEPA filters for enhanced breathability, active noise cancel and audio and microphone capabilities and Bluetooth connectivity. 
Finally, we're continuously evaluating our portfolio for M&A opportunities that can enhance our existing offerings. During the first quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in Fiplex Communications, a company that develops in-building communication systems, including bidirectional amplifiers that provide continuous and critical in-building radio coverage in challenging environments to improve the safety of first responders and building occupants. The addition of Fiplex products and software enhance our offering in the fast-growing in-building communication market and complement our innovative, industry-leading portfolio, enabling us towards creating the next generation of fire and life safety solutions. 
Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 4 to discuss our first quarter results in more detail and to provide an update on our 2021 outlook."

As Darius has highlighted, we're very pleased with our start to 2021. While the COVID pandemic continues to impact some of our end markets, our laser focus on demand generation, operational execution and cost managem",3264,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Darius has highlighted, we're very pleased with our start to 2021. While the COVID pandemic continues to impact some of our end markets, our laser focus on demand generation, operational execution and cost management enabled us to over-deliver on our commitments. 
First quarter sales declined by 2% organically due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which represents a 5 percentage point sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. As Darius mentioned, that was driven by robust double-digit growth in our warehouse automation solutions and personal protective equipment businesses as well as continued demand for our building products and services, advanced material strength and strength in our connected software. 
We expanded margins year-over-year in 3 out of 4 segments, Aerospace, HBT and SPS, for the second consecutive quarter, limiting Honeywell's overall segment margin contraction to 80 basis points and ending the quarter with a segment margin of 21%. Our commercial excellence and strong cost management as well as an approximately $30 million onetime benefit in Aerospace drove 10 basis points of outperformance in segment margin compared to the high end of our guidance range despite the mix headwind from much stronger sales in our lowest margin segment, SPS. 
We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.92, down 13% year-over-year. This was $0.09 above the high end of our guidance driven by segment profit improvement from higher sales volumes and by a lower-than-expected effective tax rate. 
From a year-over-year perspective, below-the-line items were an $0.11 headwind driven by lower interest income and FX and higher repositioning and interest expense, partially offset by higher pension income. Our effective tax rate was higher than the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to benefits realized in the prior year period from tax law changes in India and the resolution of certain U.S. tax matters, driving a $0.13 headwind. This was partially offset by a $0.03 EPS benefit from lower share count. A bridge of all this from 1Q '20 to 1Q '21 adjusted EPS can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
We generated $978 million of cash from operations, up 4% year-over-year despite lower net income. Free cash flow for the quarter was $757 million, down 5% year-over-year due to higher capital expenditures, particularly in SPS as we continue to expand PPE capacity. Working capital improvements, including strong collections, offset these headwinds during the quarter, driving adjusted free cash flow conversion of 56%, up 500 basis points from the prior year. 
As you know, the first quarter is historically our lowest from a cash perspective, and we remain on track to our full year cash guidance. I'll talk more about our full year outlook in a few minutes. 
We strategically deployed $3 billion to M&A, share repurchases, dividends and CapEx in the first quarter, which significantly exceeded our operating cash flow. We paid $640 million in dividends; deployed approximately $220 million in CapEx, up 60%; repurchased over $820 million of Honeywell shares, reducing our share count to 705 million; and also, we completed the purchase of Sparta Systems, deploying a total of $1.3 billion to further bolster our software controls and analytics capabilities in the attractive life sciences space. 
The integration of Sparta is progressing well. And in fact, we exceeded our first quarter financial expectations with sales of Sparta up 25% year-over-year, and bookings up approximately 75% year-over-year. 
In March, we also repaid $800 million in maturing senior notes as we began the process to repay debt taken on to provide incremental liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We maintained a strong balance of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter of $12.7 billion. 
So all in all, we had a very strong start to 2021. We are investing for the future, continuing to execute commercially and operationally with the discipline and rigor you have come to expect from Honeywell, positioning ourselves well for the recovery ahead. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 and talk about the individual segment results. Starting with Aerospace, first quarter sales were down 22% organically driven by lower commercial aerospace demand due to the ongoing impact of reduced flight hours and lower original equipment volumes. Our air transport aftermarket sales were down 48% organically year-over-year and down 7% sequentially from 4Q '20 as rising infection rates, the pace of vaccinations early in the quarter and the lack of the peak holiday travel contributed to flight hour declines as we messaged was possible in 4Q. 
Our business aviation aftermarket sales were down only 6% organically year-over-year as we see a faster recovery in this space. In original equipment, while still down year-over-year, our business aviation OE grew double digits sequentially from 4Q '20, driving a 6% sequential growth in the total commercial original equipment from 4Q. 
Defense and space was down 2% organically as demand for U.S. defense and space was offset by lower international defense volumes. Aerospace segment margin expanded 110 basis points to 29% driven by strong cost management in the face of organic sales declines and an approximate $30 million onetime benefit. 
Building Technologies returned to growth in 1Q despite facing the most difficult comps we'll see this year since 1Q '20 was only partially impacted by the pandemic. Sales were up 2% organically driven by demand for building management systems and security and commercial fire products as well as continued growth in Building Solutions services. 
Orders and backlog for Building Solutions services were both up double digits year-over-year, positioning the business for continued growth in '21. In addition, our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions maintain strong customer momentum with exciting wins with the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Pittsburgh Airport and Syracuse University. 
HBT segment margins expanded 200 basis points to 22.5% driven by commercial excellence and productivity net of inflation. PMT sales were down 47% -- excuse me, were down 6% organically, a 6 percentage point sequential improvement from the 12% organic sales decline we saw in 4Q. 
Process Solutions sales were down 9% organically driven by continued project delays and lower smart energy demand due to some softness in the end markets, partially offset by demand for field instruments. Orders for services, process measurement and control products and thermal solutions grew in the quarter, positioning the HCS service and products businesses for acceleration in the second quarter and beyond. 
And UOP, sales were down 14% organically driven by the ongoing weakness in the energy end markets. However, this was a 16-point sequential improvement from the 30% organic decline we saw in 4Q. UOP orders were up double digits driven by gas process and catalyst orders, so we are seeing some signs of growth potential for the future. 
Finally, Advanced Materials sales increased 8% year-over-year organically driven by growth broadly across the portfolio, including strong growth in fluorine products, specialty additives, chemicals and electronics materials demand. PMT segment margins contracted 290 basis points in the first quarter driven by the impact of sales mix, partially offset by commercial excellence and cost management. 
Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were up 47% organically as Darius mentioned earlier driven by strength across the portfolio, including double-digit organic growth in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, personal protective equipment and Productivity Solutions and Services, who drove market share gains due to strong demand in the U.S. and Europe. SPS orders were up double digits year-over-year for the sixth straight quarter driven by continued demand for personal protective equipment and Productivity Solutions and Services. 
SPS backlog was up approximately 70% year-over-year, remaining above $4 billion for the third consecutive quarter, including $2.1 billion of backlog for Warehouse and Workflow Solutions. SPS segment margins expanded 180 points in the first quarter due to -- to 14.3% driven by the impact of those higher sales volumes. 
So overall, we finished the first quarter with a return to sales growth in HBT and with continued growth in other areas of the portfolio as well as backlog strength in HBT, Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, Productivity Solutions and Services, PPE and UOP. We expanded margins in 3 of the 4 segments, while strategically investing in high-return growth CapEx and R&D, giving us confidence that our businesses are well positioned as demand recovers. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 6 and discuss our preview for the second quarter. As the timing and speed of the economic recovery continues to unfold, we entered the second quarter well positioned with strong momentum and some key areas of the portfolio continuing to make progress each quarter. 
For the second quarter, we expect organic growth in the range of 10% to 13% as we lap the first full quarter disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect some of the areas in the portfolio that have been most significantly impacted, particularly the commercial aerospace aftermarket and HPS businesses, to return to growth. 
We also expect ongoing strength in Safety and Productivity Solutions, Building Products and Advanced Materials. We would normally see a seasonal step-up from 1Q to 2Q, which this year will be somewhat dampened by the calendar impact of having more days in the first quarter than we do in 2Q. 
We will be facing some supply chain constraints as the sourcing environment for direct materials and components such as semiconductors and resins continues to be challenging. We have taken swift actions to partner with our distributors to mitigate those impacts, but our second quarter sales will be somewhat constrained as these shortages create higher lead times, primarily in SPS and, to a lesser extent, in HBT. 
As a reminder, during 2020, we responded fast and early to the pandemic by identifying and delivering on a 2-phase program that reduced our fixed cost base by $1.5 billion, and approximately 70% of these savings or about $1 billion were permanent reductions. As such, we'll see approximately $500 million of headwind in 2021 for the year from the temporary savings measures we implemented and as we resume some areas of spending, including business travel, merit increases and investments in growth, particularly in R&D. These impacts will begin to accelerate in 2Q, though we are confident our streamlined cost base gives us ample capacity to invest and positions us well to drive margin expansion across all 4 segments as sales recover. 
We expect sales -- excuse me, we expect segment margin in the range of 19.8% to 20.3% for the second quarter, which represents 130 to 180 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. From a sequential perspective, our second quarter segment margin expectations do result in contraction from the first quarter due to the mix impact of higher sales from lower-margin businesses, higher research and development expenses as we invest back into the business, particularly Aerospace and the cost impacts that I mentioned earlier as well as the first quarter benefit in Aerospace, which won't repeat. 
The net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be flat to a $55 million benefit, with a range of repositioning between $50 million and $100 million for the quarter as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring projects. We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the quarter, and our average share count should be flat to 1Q at approximately 705 million shares. As a result, we expect second quarter earnings per share between $1.86 and $1.96, up 48% to 56% year-on-year. 
Now let's take a moment just to talk through the segments. In Aerospace, we expect flight hours to improve in the second quarter, driving sequential and year-over-year improvement in commercial aftermarket sales as domestic travel improves. That will be tempered by ongoing softness in international travel as flight hours remain far below pre-COVID levels there. 
We still expect a slow ramp in commercial original equipment build rates. Moderate U.S. defense spending should continue in the second quarter, though this will be pressured by lower international defense volumes. 
In Building Technologies, as business conditions improve and as the world prepares to safely return to offices, schools and to travel, we expect continued demand for building products and management systems as well as sequential and year-over-year Building Solutions growth as we execute our projects and services backlog. In addition, we expect continued customer demand for our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions, which we began converting into sales in the first quarter. 
In PMT, we expect continued recovery in the Process Solutions products businesses as well as sequential improvement in automation projects. While UOP orders were up double digits year-over-year in the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we expect customer CapEx and OpEx budgets to remain tight in 2Q, limiting the delivery and execution of those opportunities in the near term. We expect continued strength in Advanced Materials in the second quarter driven by growth across the portfolio, particularly by strong demand for foreign products. 
Finally, we anticipate continued strength in SPS with another quarter of robust double-digit organic growth in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, personal protective equipment and Productivity Solutions and Services. Our Warehouse and Workflow Solutions backlog remains strong, over $2 billion as I mentioned previously, as customers make investments in advance of the busy holiday season, giving us confidence in continued growth. 
Our PPE and Productivity Solutions and Services backlogs are both up triple digits, which will drive growth in the second quarter though as I mentioned, we will be managing some supply constraints here. Overall, we expect another strong quarter for SPS. 
So with that foundation for 2Q, let's turn to Slide 7 and talk about the key changes to our 2021 outlook since the guidance we provided in January. Over the past few months, we've seen tremendous progress in the distribution administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, particularly in the U.S., the U.K. and the Middle East coupled with improvements in infection rates in many of those geographic areas. We're also encouraged by talks of fiscal stimulus that will further support economic growth, including funding for infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing investments. 
While the pace of recovery varies regionally with slower vaccine rollouts in India, Europe and Latin America and with the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, we will continue to navigate the recovery with a balanced approach of investment and cost management in order to drive value longer term. So let's take a moment to walk through what's changed since our prior guidance. 
Starting in Aerospace, we continue to expect gradual improvement in our commercial aerospace business as the pandemic subsides. The business aviation aftermarket is on track to recover as expected and perhaps at a somewhat faster pace than we thought. 
And air transport, the aftermarket business had a slow start to the year as I mentioned earlier, being down sequentially compared to the fourth quarter as virus outbreaks and challenges with vaccine rollouts tempered improvements in first quarter flight hours. The pace of this acceleration will vary regionally, with domestic travel clearly recovering faster than international travel. And country-by-country dynamics will make this difficult to predict. We remain cautious in our ramp expectations here as this unfolds. 
We continue to see moderate demand for U.S. defense and space, offset by lower-than-expected international defense volumes. As a result of these dynamics, we expect organic growth for the year in Aerospace to trend towards the low end of our flat to low single-digit guidance, which we provided in January, and overall, Aerospace segment margin expansion to be somewhat impacted by the slower ramp and high-margin commercial aftermarket sales. 
In HBT, we still expect organic sales growth to be up low single digits for the year. The business is seeing robust activity and is trending towards the upper end of the low single-digit range, with continued demand for building products and management systems and continued momentum in healthy Building Solutions fueling that growth. We continue to expect segment margin expansion driven by higher sales on a streamlined cost base. 
In PMT, our expectations have not changed materially from our initial guidance. We still expect organic sales growth to be slightly -- to be down slightly to up low single digits for the year. The recovery is progressing with strength in Advanced Materials and improvement in Process Solutions products and a slower recovery in HPS projects and UOP catalysts as customer spending has not materially changed, delaying projects and reloads, which contributes to our view that we are trending towards the low end of this -- at this time. 
We continue to expect sequential segment margin expansion throughout the year in PMT driven by cost management and some improved mix from UOP in the second half, though the specific timing of that remains uncertain. The recovery in oil and gas looks to be building momentum for a stronger 2022. 
Finally, in SPS, Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, PPE and Productivity Solutions and Services are all trending better than expected in January. We now expect higher double-digit organic sales growth than in our previous guidance as short-cycle sales accelerated in Productivity Solutions and Services and will be accelerating in our sensor businesses, though that will be somewhat tempered by the supply tightness I mentioned earlier. The increase in warehouse automation sales, which are lower margin as you know, will impact our overall SPS segment margins, though this will be partially offset by increased sales in the higher-margin PPE and Productivity Solutions businesses. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and talk about our updated guidance for the year. Given the macro and segment backdrop I just talked about, our strong outperformance in the first quarter and our confidence in our ability to deliver through the economic recovery, we are raising our full year sales, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. 
We now expect sales of $34.0 billion to $34.8 billion, which represents overall organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%, an increase of 2 points in the low end and 1 point on the high end compared to our previous guidance. Given that our strengthening sales outlook is heavily driven by our lower-margin SPS segment, we are maintaining our segment profit guidance in the range of 20.7% to 21.1%, an expansion of 30 to 70 basis points for the year. 
We still expect margin expansion in all of our segments as we carefully invest back into the business while managing the multispeed recovery across the portfolio. We do not expect material changes to our net below-the-line impact at this time, which we estimate to be in the range of negative $130 million to a positive $20 million for the year, including capacity for $400 million to $525 million of repositioning. 
We continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% and a weighted average share count of approximately 705 million for the year, representing our minimum 1% reduction in shares. As a result, we're raising the low end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance and now expect a range of $7.75 to $8, up 9% to 13%. This represents an increase of $0.15 in the low end, effectively increasing the midpoint of our guidance by approximately $0.08. We expect free cash flow in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.5 billion, which is higher than the low end of our previous guide by $100 million. 
So overall, a great start to the year and a meaningful upgrade to our full year view in sales, segment profit, cash and ultimately, adjusted EPS as we manage the initial stages of this recovery. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Darius."

Before we wrap up, I'd like to take a minute on Slide 8 to discuss ESG. At Honeywell, we consistently say and firmly believe that a robust environmental, social and government framework enables us long-term success. In fact, responsible corporate citizenship is an essential part of our value creation framework. 
Importantly, we announced a commitment earlier this month to become carbon neutral in our operations and facilities by 2035. This represents a continuation of our ongoing sustainability efforts, which have already reduced the greenhouse gas intensity of our operations and facilities by more than 90% since 2004. 
In addition, we work extensively to increase energy efficiency, conserve water, minimize waste and proactively champion responsible remediation projects that restore valuable community assets. We plan to achieve our commitment through a combination of further investments in energy savings projects, conversion to renewable energy sources, completion of capital improvement projects at our sites and in our fleet of company vehicles and utilization of credible carbon credits. 
We have a decades-long history of innovating to help customers meet their environmental and social goals. In fact, about half of Honeywell's new product introduction, research and development investment is directed towards products that improve environmental and social outcomes for customers. 
For example, the widespread adoption of Honeywell Solstice line of low global warming potential refrigerants, blowing agents and aerosols has already reduced the equivalent of more than 200 million metric tons of carbon dioxide to date, equal to eliminating emissions from more than 42 million cars. A few days ago, we announced that Whole Foods market has adopted the Solstice N40 lower global warming potential refrigerant in more than 100 of U.S. stores as it seeks to reduce refrigerant emissions under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's GreenChill Program. This is just one example of how our innovative products and services continue to improve customer sustainability profiles and how Honeywell is playing an active role in shaping a future that is safer and more sustainable for generations to come. 
Now let's wrap up on Slide 10. In summary, we delivered a strong start to 2021 and first quarter results that exceeded expectations. We're seeing promising signs of rapid recovery in some of our markets, and we're executing on our rigorous and proven value creation framework, which consistently delivers shareholder outperformance in all economic cycles and will continue to enable us to return to our key long-term growth commitments in 2021 and beyond. 
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

And then second of all, just in kind of the second half of the year, normally, things kind of level out from the second quarter. Is this year going to be a little bit different seasonally, given the later cycle nature of the company?

On the margins, the biggest thing that changes is the mix makeup of our Q2. And sort of the fastest-growing business for us is Intelligrated, which was going to be growing even faster than we anticipated. And think about",538,"So let me start with the margins. On the margins, the biggest thing that changes is the mix makeup of our Q2. And sort of the fastest-growing business for us is Intelligrated, which was going to be growing even faster than we anticipated. And think about sort of a mid- to high double-digit growth rate for that business. 
So we -- our bookings, our success, our output is growing. And frankly, it's mixing in at even more as part of the overall portfolio. So that is the #1 and primary reason that is a little bit of that change. Some of the headwinds, merits, that we anticipated that. So there's really no change in that. But the short answer is the Intelligrated business is growing even faster than we anticipated and continues to be a growth engine for us. 
In terms of the second half, I think the one thing to be -- to interpret it wrongly for our earnings releases that we're somehow less bullish on the second half. We're not. We're actually very excited about the second half. And -- but frankly, it's 1 quarter in, in a year where there are many, many unknowns, including COVID rates, in terms of infection rates and current supply chain and so on. We don't see anything in there that we're particularly worried about. But it is 1 quarter into a year, which probably has many more unknowns than most. 
I think your third question was around sort of what's up, what's down. I would say -- I would characterize the following in terms of our BGA flight hours are actually up vis-à-vis our initial assumptions. So that's what's up. 
What's down is our air transport, which obviously is a bigger number vis-à-vis BGA. So in total, we're about the same, but it's a little bit different. 
And then lastly, I would tell you that defense and space was roughly where we expected. The U.S. markets were strong. The internationals were a little bit weaker. We're sort of looking at that for the rest of the year. We don't know if there was some sort of channel loading that kind of happened at the end of the year, not that we drove it, but the distributors themselves. 
So those are sort of the puts and takes. But the framework that everybody ought to just fully understand is we are very bullish on our markets. And what we're seeing is the short cycles coming back very strongly compared -- you also add on at Intelligrated. I mean, when was the last time, Steve, you've seen any segment in any of our peers grow 47% year-over-year? I mean, that's remarkable. And now in the -- whether it's in the third or fourth quarter of this year, you're going to see some of our longer-cycle businesses coming back, whether it's PMT and Aerospace. I can't exactly call it, whether it's Q3 or Q4. There's a lot of moving pieces, but they're going to come back. And as you all know, those are higher-margin businesses. So we're -- I think we're on a really, really nice ramp here coming up for our future. Greg, I don't know if you have anything to add?"

I think what we were trying to highlight is simply it's at -- in the [ 4 teams ], it's the lowest one in the portfolio. And it's driving the biggest part of the growth. So it gives some pressure to the overall margin expansion for Honeywell. 
I think we're going to see margins improve modestly for SPS during the course of the year because even for Intelligrated, as an example, we're going to have our peak quarter most likely here in Q2 on the revenue side. And then that will start to abate a little bit as the year progresses as well. You know that, that business can be very lumpy on the install. That's not new news. So the movement of that will influence the margin progression. 
As it relates to your 20% target, we absolutely still have that in mind in the longer term. It's probably not 24 months from now. We've talked quite a bit about the -- trying to capture the installed base, particularly in the warehouse segment. And the whole point of that is then to follow with a terrific service and aftermarket business with software attached. And so as and when that shift occurs, then we'll see those margins mixing up. 
And then again, with the recovery that we've had in places like PSS, which I think Kevin Dayhoff and the team there have done a terrific job in that business, we start seeing margin accretion again in there. So we still have very much a line of sight to that 20% but with roughly, maybe even close to a $3 billion business in warehouse this year at the lower margin. That's going to give us some short-term pressure."

We've been -- that's not news. I think what is news is that we're continuing to take substantial market share in the marketplace. Building installed base and as the build-out of the warehouse infrastructure moderates, we're going to get higher-margin business because, obviously, then it's going to mix much more to the LSS. So there's really no bad news here. This is actually fantastic news that we're taking share, growing extraordinarily quickly. And as I've said all along, Intelligrated is the best acquisition we've ever done at Honeywell. Now it's more or less undeniable. 
And it's a business that continues to do well. And I see it being primarily a projects business for the next short to mid-term because the demand is still very, very high, whether it's North America and Europe. And we're going to capture that share. Ultimately, that's going to become our higher-margin business as it becomes a bit more installed base-centric."

Their services, their catalyst part of the business is coming back. Our sort of book-to-bill is in much better shape this year than versus our assumptions this year versus where it was last year. So that's also a promising sign. We're seeing some activity come back. 
And I also want to highlight maybe a very important part of that portfolio for our future, which is the Sustainability Technology Solutions business. Its quote log is in the 100 millions of dollars range now and growing very, very quickly. Its bookings were up 25%. And we're talking to literally tens of different energy producers today about our Sustainability Technology Solutions portfolio, which is highly expansive, I mean, from plastics recyclability to ecofining to energy storage to hydrogen energy to carbon capture. We have all these solutions. 
So I am very optimistic about that business. And it may look very different 3 to 4 years from now than it does today because we've overinvested into our Sustainability Technology Solutions. 
Now on the larger projects, and you know this, sort of the OpEx, CapEx budgets, now I sort of expect that, although that I would view the price of oil and gas to be very friendly towards investment. No, we think that, that still could be a couple of quarters away just because of where the budgets were set for a lot of the majors. And as you know, they were depressed for this year. However, they are investing in the refurbishment to catalyst and so on. 
And if you look at -- and lastly, on your question as it relates to HPS, if you look at the HPS, UOP cycle, HPS typically trails UOP by 2 to 4 quarters. That's sort of mathematically how things work. So we see some encouraging signs, and those signs are going to get better. And the business is going to get better for the next several quarters. So we're going to be patient, but we're very confident this environment is going to keep improving because, as you know, you have to reinvest. And although we're moving to a more noncarbon energy infrastructure, we're certainly going to need carbon for a while. 
And so we've got 2 different growth factors. Number one is to sustain the current, but also to help those businesses transition to the future."

But if you look at normal seasonality, the 1Q to 2Q step-up that Greg you talked about, it seems like it might be in the range of maybe $2 million, $3 million. Is that sort of the right range? And where are you seeing these constraints? Is it mainly on semi? Or is it broader than that? And do you think 2Q is sort of peak pain for this, and we're getting some semi [indiscernible] in the second half of the year?"

Yes. I mean, this maybe isn't a high point in sort of the investment profile of Aero. But I can tell you and as Greg pointed out, we are investing in Aero today on some of the major platforms and products. So I wouldn't say it's an all-time low, but -- and our R&D dollars are going up from 2020 to '21. And we still expect extraordinarily attractive margins for that business. 
So I think that it's -- we're investing. It's a great business, and better things are yet to come, which I think maybe gets misunderstood, which is a lot of the ATR aftermarket is not kicking in yet. I think the BGA is going to get better. I mean -- so we have some brighter things on the future. And even at this kind of business levels, we can print something in the upper 20s. So I just think that hopefully, people start believing that this is a very good business, which is going to get even better for the future. Greg?"

They did a terrific job on their cost management and realign their cost structure to the size of the business, and that's coming through.

So it's not like we see anything changing dramatically to the upside here imminently. 
So -- but not really unexpected for what we've seen. You see what's happening with the mass coming back into service and so on. So we feel like we're sized properly for that ramp as we head into the second quarter and the back half of the year. 
On BGA, certainly, that aftermarket stream, it's just going to grow at a faster pace than ATR. I mean, people are shifting. This is actually a question for the ATR business. People are shifting from commercial travel to business jet travel. That's happening. And so there may be some element of commercial first-class travel that actually, from a business perspective, doesn't fully come back. So we do feel bullish about what we're seeing in the BGA space, particularly. 
But as I said earlier, there are so many variables, as you know as well as we do. There are so many variables that go on to this between passenger behavior, airline behavior. That's a little bit as to why we're going to take this 1 quarter at a time."

And I think that, that's -- we have a fairly high degree of confidence in there throughout this year, particularly second half versus first half and then increasing even more in 2022. So that's sort of the math. 
I mean, I think we also forget that as recently as 3 months ago. I mean, some of the infection rates in the U.S. were very, very high, and we're in a dramatically different place. So the overall January and then part of February were fairly difficult. But we see the world slowly coming out of this. And it's -- there's going to be a direct correlation to aviation. And we think this is going to be manifested the second half this year then '22 and '23. And we're set up for some very, very nice quarters and years ahead of us, which are going to be slowly ramping up. 
So I -- we continue to be very bullish on aviation. We're investing in the business. But at the same time, 2020 was a good opportunity for us to really rationalize some cost structure, and I think we can lever up nicely as that business starts coming back. 
Okay. I'm proud of everyone at Honeywell. The consistent hard work and unwavering commitment enable us to outperform in this challenging environment.

Let's begin on Slide 2. We delivered a very strong start to 2021, exceeding the high end of our first quarter organic sales growth, segment margin and adjusted earnings per share guidance range.
In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.92, down 13% year-over-year and $0.09 above the high end of our guidance range. Organic sales were down 2% year-over-year, a 5 percentage point sequential improvement from the 7% organic sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We drove year-over-year organic sales growth in 2 out of our 4 segments, HBT and SPS, despite facing difficult comps since the first quarter of 2020 wasn't fully impacted by the pandemic. Honeywell Building Technologies returned to growth, and Safety and Productivity Solutions achieved an outstanding 47% organic growth in the quarter.
We also drove double-digit year-over-year organic growth in connected software sales driven by strong demand for our connected buildings and cyber solutions. We delivered a segment margin of 21%, 10 basis points above our guidance, with margin expansion in Aerospace, HBT and SPS.
We generated $757 million of free cash flow in the quarter, a strong performance despite increased investments in high-return capital expenditures, which were up approximately $80 million year-over-year as we position ourselves for the recovery. Adjusted free cash flow conversion was 56%, up 500 basis points year-over-year on the strength of working capital improvements.
In terms of capital, we deployed $3 billion to dividends, growth CapEx, share repurchases and M&A during the quarter. We opportunistically repurchased 4 million shares throughout the quarter, reducing our share count to 705 million.
We're off to a strong start in 2021. And I'm very confident that continued improvement in our end markets, coupled with accelerated innovation and strong execution, will provide a long runway for continued business improvement and top-tier value creation for our shareholders.
Next, let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss a few of our recent business highlights. I'm excited to share a few recent recognitions and partnerships that highlight our commitment to upholding the highest ethical standards and our focus on creating breakthrough innovations.
First, Honeywell is 1 of only 8 companies in the industrial manufacturing category to be named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. Ethisphere is an organization that evaluates and honors businesses around the globe and across industries for their strong cultural, environmental, social governance and diversity practices. We are proud to have earned this prestigious ranking.
Second, Honeywell's named to Fast Company's annual list of the World's Most Innovative Companies for '21. In addition to being recognized for a 100-year heritage of creating groundbreaking technologies like quantum computing that transform the way the world works, Honeywell was also recognized for mobilizing quickly to help people and businesses cope with the pandemic, including our launch of new N95 mask manufacturing and our introduction of UV treatment systems for airplanes, healthy building solutions and innovative Aclar Edge bottles and vials.
We also recently announced our partnership with musician and entrepreneur will.i.am to launch the XUPERMASK, a one-of-a-kind, innovative, smart face mask for the mid- and postpandemic world. The XUPERMASK is easily adjustable to fit a variety of face shapes and is enhanced with multiple functions for the modern lifestyle, including dual 3-speed fans and HEPA filters for enhanced breathability, active noise canceling audio and microphone capabilities and Bluetooth connectivity.
Finally, we're continuously evaluating our portfolio for M&A opportunities that can enhance our existing offerings. During the first quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in Fiplex Communications, a company that develops in-building communication systems, including bidirectional amplifiers that provide continuous and critical in-building radio coverage in challenging environments to improve the safety of first responders and building occupants. The addition of Fiplex products and software enhance our offering in the fast-growing in-building communication market and complement our innovative, industry-leading portfolio, enabling us towards creating the next generation of fire and life safety solutions.
Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 4 to discuss our first quarter results in more detail and to provide an update on our 2021 outlook."
1340740,710871049,2256490,"Honeywell International Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2021",2021-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Honeywell International Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Darius highlighted, we're very pleased with our start to 2021. While the COVID pandemic continues to impact some of our end markets, our laser focus on demand generation, operational execution and cost management",3264,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Darius highlighted, we're very pleased with our start to 2021. While the COVID pandemic continues to impact some of our end markets, our laser focus on demand generation, operational execution and cost management enabled us to over-deliver on our commitments.
First quarter sales declined by 2% organically due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which represents a 5 percentage point sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. As Darius mentioned, that was driven by robust double-digit growth in our warehouse automation solutions and personal protective equipment businesses as well as continued demand for our building products and services, advanced material strength and strength in our connected software.
We expanded margins year-over-year in 3 out of 4 segments, Aerospace, HBT and SPS, for the second consecutive quarter, limiting Honeywell's overall segment margin contraction to 80 basis points and ending the quarter with a segment margin of 21%. Our commercial excellence and strong cost management as well as an approximately $30 million onetime benefit in Aerospace drove 10 basis points of outperformance in segment margin compared to the high end of our guidance range despite the mix headwind from much stronger sales in our lowest margin segment, SPS.
We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.92, down 13% year-over-year. This was $0.09 above the high end of our guidance driven by segment profit improvement from higher sales volumes and by a lower-than-expected effective tax rate.
From a year-over-year perspective, below-the-line items were an $0.11 headwind driven by lower interest income and FX and higher repositioning and interest expense, partially offset by higher pension income. Our effective tax rate was higher than the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to benefits realized in the prior year period from tax law changes in India and the resolution of certain U.S. tax matters, driving a $0.13 headwind. This was partially offset by a $0.03 EPS benefit from lower share count. A bridge of all this from 1Q '20 to 1Q '21 adjusted EPS can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
We generated $978 million of cash from operations, up 4% year-over-year despite lower net income. Free cash flow for the quarter was $757 million, down 5% year-over-year due to higher capital expenditures, particularly in SPS as we continue to expand PPE capacity.
Working capital improvements, including strong collections, offset these headwinds during the quarter, driving adjusted free cash flow conversion of 56%, up 500 basis points from the prior year.
As you know, the first quarter is historically our lowest from a cash perspective, and we remain on track to our full year cash guidance. I'll talk more about our full year outlook in a few minutes.
We strategically deployed $3 billion to M&A, share repurchases, dividends and CapEx in the first quarter, which significantly exceeded our operating cash flow. We paid $640 million in dividends, deployed approximately $220 million in CapEx, up 60%; repurchased over $820 million of Honeywell shares, reducing our share count to 705 million. And also, we completed the purchase of Sparta Systems, deploying a total of $1.3 billion to further bolster our software, controls and analytics capabilities and in the attractive life sciences space.
The integration of Sparta is progressing well. And in fact, we exceeded our first quarter financial expectations, with sales of Sparta up 25% year-over-year and bookings up approximately 75% year-over-year. 
In March, we also repaid $800 million in maturing senior notes as we began the process to repay debt taken on to provide incremental liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We maintained a strong balance of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter of $12.7 billion.
So all in all, we had a very strong start to 2021. We are investing for the future, continuing to execute commercially and operationally with the discipline and rigor you have come to expect from Honeywell, positioning ourselves well for the recovery ahead. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 and talk about the individual segment results. Starting with Aerospace, first quarter sales were down 22% organically driven by lower commercial aerospace demand due to the ongoing impact of reduced flight hours and lower original equipment volumes. Our air transport aftermarket sales were down 48% organically year-over-year and down 7% sequentially from 4Q '20 as rising infection rates, the pace of vaccinations early in the quarter and the lack of the peak holiday travel contributed to flight hour declines as we messaged was possible in 4Q.
Our business aviation aftermarket sales were down only 6% organically year-over-year as we see a faster recovery in this space. And original equipment, while still down year-over-year, our business aviation OE grew double digits sequentially from 4Q '20, driving a 6% sequential growth in the total commercial original equipment from 4Q.
Defense and space was down 2% organically as demand for U.S. defense and space was offset by lower international defense volumes. Aerospace segment margin expanded 110 basis points to 29% driven by strong cost management in the face of organic sales declines and an approximate $30 million onetime benefit. 
Building Technologies returned to growth in 1Q despite facing the most difficult comps we'll see this year since 1Q '20 was only partially impacted by the pandemic. Sales were up 2% organically driven by demand for building management systems and security and commercial fire products as well as continued growth in Building Solutions services. 
Orders in backlog for Building Solutions services were both up double digits year-over-year, positioning the business for continued growth in '21. In addition, our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions maintain strong customer momentum, with exciting wins with the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Pittsburgh Airport and Syracuse University. 
HBT segment margins expanded 200 basis points to 22.5% driven by commercial excellence and productivity net of inflation. PMT sales were down 47% -- excuse me, were down 6% organically, a 6 percentage point sequential improvement from the 12% organic sales decline we saw in 4Q.
Process Solutions sales were down 9% organically driven by continued project delays and lower smart energy demand due to some softness in the end markets, partially offset by demand for field instruments. Orders for services, process measurement and control products and Thermal Solutions grew in the quarter, positioning the HPS service and products businesses for acceleration in the second quarter and beyond.
In UOP, sales were down 14% organically driven by the ongoing weakness in the energy end markets. However, this was a 16-point sequential improvement from the 30% organic decline we saw in 4Q. UOP orders were up double digits driven by gas process and catalyst orders. So we are seeing some signs of growth potential for the future.
Finally, Advanced Materials sales increased 8% year-over-year organically driven by growth broadly across the portfolio, including strong growth in fluorine products, specialty additives, chemicals and electronics materials demand. PMT segment margins contracted 290 basis points in the first quarter driven by the impact of sales mix, partially offset by commercial excellence and cost management.
Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were up 47% organically, as Darius mentioned earlier, driven by strength across the portfolio, including double-digit organic growth in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, personal protective equipment and Productivity Solutions and Services, who drove market share gains due to strong demand in the U.S. and Europe. SPS orders were up double digits year-over-year for the sixth straight quarter driven by continued demand for personal protective equipment and Productivity Solutions and Services.
SPS backlog was up approximately 70% year-over-year, remaining above $4 billion for the third consecutive quarter, including $2.1 billion of backlog for Warehouse and Workflow Solutions. SPS segment margins expanded 180 points in the first quarter due to -- to 14.3% driven by the impact of those higher sales volumes. 
So overall, we finished the first quarter with a return to sales growth in HBT and with continued growth in other areas of the portfolio as well as backlog strength in HBT, Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, Productivity Solutions and Services, PPE and UOP. We expanded margins in 3 of the 4 segments while strategically investing in high-return growth CapEx and R&D, giving us confidence that our businesses are well positioned as demand recovers.
With that, let's turn to Slide 6 and discuss our preview for the second quarter. As the timing and speed of the economic recovery continues to unfold, we entered the second quarter well positioned with strong momentum in some key areas of the portfolio continuing to make progress each quarter.
For the second quarter, we expect organic growth in the range of 10% to 13% as we lap the first full quarter disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect some of the areas in the portfolio that have been most significantly impacted, particularly the commercial aerospace aftermarket and HPS businesses, to return to growth.
We also expect ongoing strength in Safety and Productivity Solutions, Building Products and Advanced Materials. We would normally see a seasonal step-up from 1Q to 2Q, which this year will be somewhat dampened by the calendar impact of having more days in the first quarter than we do in 2Q.
We will be facing some supply chain constraints as the sourcing environment for direct materials and components such as semiconductors and resins continues to be challenging. We have taken swift actions to partner with our distributors to mitigate those impacts. But our second quarter sales will be somewhat constrained as these shortages create higher lead times primarily in SPS and, to a lesser extent, in HBT.
As a reminder, during 2020, we responded fast and early to the pandemic by identifying and delivering on a 2-phase program that reduced our fixed cost base by $1.5 billion, and approximately 70% of these savings or about $1 billion were permanent reductions. As such, we'll see approximately $500 million of headwind in 2021 for the year from the temporary savings measures we implemented and as we resume some areas of spending, including business travel, merit increases and investments in growth, particularly in R&D. These impacts will begin to accelerate in 2Q, though we are confident our streamlined cost base gives us ample capacity to invest and positions us well to drive margin expansion across all 4 segments as sales recover.
We expect sales -- excuse me, we expect segment margin in the range of 19.8% to 20.3% for the second quarter, which represents 130 to 180 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. From a sequential perspective, our second quarter segment margin expectations do result in contraction from the first quarter due to the mix impact of higher sales from lower-margin businesses, higher research and development expenses as we invest back into the business, particularly Aerospace, and the cost impacts that I mentioned earlier as well as the first quarter benefit in Aerospace, which won't repeat.
The net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be flat to a $55 million benefit, with a range of repositioning between $50 million and $100 million for the quarter as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring projects. We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the quarter. And our average share count should be flat to 1Q at approximately 705 million shares. As a result, we expect second quarter earnings per share between $1.86 and $1.96, up 48% to 56% year-on-year.
Now let's take a moment just to talk through the segments. In Aerospace, we expect flight hours to improve in the second quarter, driving sequential and year-over-year improvement in commercial aftermarket sales as domestic travel improves. That will be tempered by ongoing softness in international travel as flight hours remain far below pre-COVID levels there.
We still expect a slow ramp in commercial original equipment build rates. Moderate U.S. defense spending should continue in the second quarter, though this will be pressured by lower international defense volumes.
In Building Technologies, as business conditions improve and as the world prepares to safely return to offices, schools and to travel, we expect continued demand for building products and management systems as well as sequential and year-over-year Building Solutions growth as we execute our projects and services backlog. In addition, we expect continued customer demand for our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions, which we began converting into sales in the first quarter.
In PMT, we expect continued recovery in the Process Solutions products businesses as well as sequential improvement in automation projects. While UOP orders were up double digits year-over-year in the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we expect customer CapEx and OpEx budgets to remain tight in 2Q, limiting the delivery and execution of those opportunities in the near term. We expect continued strength in Advanced Materials in the second quarter driven by growth across the portfolio, particularly by strong demand for fluorine products.
Finally, we anticipate continued strength in SPS with another quarter of robust double-digit organic growth in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, personal protective equipment and Productivity Solutions and Services. Our Warehouse and Workflow Solutions backlog remains strong, over $2 billion as I mentioned previously, as customers make investments in advance of the busy holiday season, giving us confidence in continued growth.
Our PPE and Productivity Solutions and Services backlogs are both up triple digits, which will drive growth in the second quarter though as I mentioned, we will be managing some supply constraints here. Overall, we expect another strong quarter for SPS.
So with that foundation for 2Q, let's turn to Slide 7 and talk about the key changes to our 2021 outlook since the guidance we provided in January. Over the past few months, we've seen tremendous progress in the distribution administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, particularly in the U.S., the U.K. and the Middle East, coupled with improvements in infection rates in many of those geographic areas. We're also encouraged by talks of fiscal stimulus that will further support economic growth, including funding for infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing investments.
While the pace of recovery varies regionally, with slower vaccine rollouts in India, Europe and Latin America and with the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, we will continue to navigate the recovery with a balanced approach of investment and cost management in order to drive value longer term.
So let's take a moment to walk through what's changed since our prior guidance. Starting in Aerospace, we continue to expect gradual improvement in our commercial Aerospace business as the pandemic subsides. The business aviation aftermarket is on track to recover as expected and perhaps at a somewhat faster pace than we thought.
And air transport, the aftermarket business had a slow start to the year, as I mentioned earlier, being down sequentially compared to the fourth quarter as virus outbreaks and challenges with vaccine rollouts tempered improvements in first quarter flight hours. The pace of this acceleration will vary regionally, with domestic travel clearly recovering faster than international travel, and country-by-country dynamics will make this difficult to predict. We remain cautious in our ramp expectations here as this unfolds.
We continue to see moderate demand for U.S. defense and space offset by lower-than-expected international defense volumes. As a result of these dynamics, we expect organic growth for the year in Aerospace to trend towards the low end of our flat to low single-digit guidance, which we provided in January, and overall Aerospace segment margin expansion to be somewhat impacted by the slower ramp and high-margin commercial aftermarket sales.
In HBT, we still expect organic sales growth to be up low single digits for the year. The business is seeing robust activity and is trending towards the upper end of the low single-digit range, with continued demand for building products and management systems and continued momentum in healthy Building Solutions fueling that growth. We continue to expect segment margin expansion driven by higher sales on a streamlined cost base.
In PMT, our expectations have not changed materially from our initial guidance. We still expect organic sales growth to be slightly -- to be down slightly to up low single digits for the year. The recovery is progressing with strength in Advanced Materials and improvement in Process Solutions products and a slower recovery in HPS projects and UOP catalysts as customer spending has not materially changed, delaying projects and reloads, which contributes to our view that we are trending towards the low end of this -- at this time.
We continue to expect sequential segment margin expansion throughout the year in PMT driven by cost management and some improved mix from UOP in the second half, though the specific timing of that remains uncertain. The recovery in oil and gas looks to be building momentum for a stronger 2022.
Finally, in SPS, Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, PPE and Productivity Solutions and Services are all trending better than expected in January. We now expect higher double-digit organic sales growth than in our previous guidance as short-cycle sales accelerated in Productivity Solutions and Services and will be accelerating in our sensor businesses, though that will be somewhat tempered by the supply tightness I mentioned earlier.
The increase in warehouse automation sales, which are lower margin as you know, will impact our overall SPS segment margins, though this will be partially offset by increased sales in the higher-margin PPE and Productivity Solutions businesses.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and talk about our updated guidance for the year. Given the macro and segment backdrop I just talked about, our strong outperformance in the first quarter and our confidence in our ability to deliver through the economic recovery, we are raising our full year sales, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. We now expect sales of $34.0 billion to $34.8 billion, which represents overall organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%, an increase of 2 points on the low end and 1 point on the high end compared to our previous guidance.
Given that our strengthening sales outlook is heavily driven by our lower-margin SPS segment, we are maintaining our segment profit guidance in the range of 20.7% to 21.1%, an expansion of 30 to 70 basis points for the year. We still expect margin expansion in all of our segments as we carefully invest back into the business while managing the multispeed recovery across the portfolio.
We do not expect material changes to our net below-the-line impact at this time, which we estimate to be in the range of negative $130 million to a positive $20 million for the year, including capacity for $400 million to $525 million of repositioning. We continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% and a weighted average share count of approximately 705 million for the year, representing our minimum 1% reduction in shares.
As a result, we're raising the low end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance and now expect a range of $7.75 to $8, up 9% to 13%. This represents an increase of $0.15 in the low end, effectively increasing the midpoint of our guidance by approximately $0.08. We expect free cash flow in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.5 billion, which is higher than the low end of our previous guide by $100 million. So overall, a great start to the year and a meaningful upgrade to our full year view in sales, segment profit, cash and, ultimately, adjusted EPS as we manage the initial stages of this recovery.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Darius."

Before we wrap up, I'd like to take a minute on Slide 8 to discuss ESG. At Honeywell, we consistently say and firmly believe that a robust environmental, social and government framework enables us long-term success. In fact, responsible corporate citizenship is an essential part of our value creation framework.
Importantly, we announced a commitment earlier this month to become carbon neutral in our operations and facilities by 2035. This represents a continuation of our ongoing sustainability efforts, which have already reduced the greenhouse gas intensity of our operations and facilities by more than 90% since 2004.
In addition, we work extensively to increase energy efficiency, conserve water, minimize waste and proactively champion responsible remediation projects that restore valuable community assets. We plan to achieve our commitment through a combination of further investments in energy savings projects, conversion to renewable energy sources, completion of capital improvement projects at our sites and in our fleet of company vehicles and utilization of credible carbon credits.
We have a decades-long history of innovating to help customers meet their environmental and social goals. In fact, about half of Honeywell's new product introduction, research and development investment is directed towards products that improve environmental and social outcomes for customers.
For example, the widespread adoption of Honeywell Solstice line of low global warming potential refrigerants, blowing agents and aerosols has already reduced the equivalent of more than 200 million metric tons of carbon dioxide to date, equal to eliminating emissions from more than 42 million cars. A few days ago, we announced that Whole Foods market has adopted the Solstice N40 lower global warming potential refrigerant in more than 100 of U.S. stores as it seeks to reduce refrigerant emissions under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's GreenChill Program.
This is just one example of how our innovative products and services continue to improve customer sustainability profiles and how Honeywell is playing an active role in shaping a future that is safer and more sustainable for generations to come. 
Now let's wrap up on Slide 10. In summary, we delivered a strong start to 2021 with first quarter results that exceeded expectations. We're seeing promising signs of rapid recovery in some of our markets. And we're executing on our rigorous and proven value creation framework, which consistently delivers shareholder outperformance in all economic cycles and will continue to enable us to return to our key long-term growth commitments in 2021 and beyond.
With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A."

On the margins, the biggest thing that changes is the mix makeup of our Q2. And sort of the fastest-growing business for us is Intelligrated, which was going to be growing even faster than we anticipated. And think about",541,"So let me start with the margins. On the margins, the biggest thing that changes is the mix makeup of our Q2. And sort of the fastest-growing business for us is Intelligrated, which was going to be growing even faster than we anticipated. And think about sort of a mid- to high double-digit growth rate for that business. So we -- our bookings, our success, our output is growing. And frankly, it's mixing in at even more as part of the overall portfolio.
So that is the #1 and primary reason that there's a little bit of that change. Some of the headwinds, merits, the thing that -- we anticipated that. So there's really no change in that. But the short answer is the Intelligrated business is growing even faster than we anticipated and continues to be a growth engine for us.
In terms of the second half, I think the one thing to be -- to interpret it wrongly for our earnings releases that we're somehow less bullish on the second half, we're not. We're actually very excited about the second half. And -- but frankly, it's 1 quarter in, in a year where there are many, many unknowns, including COVID rates in terms of infection rates and current supply chain and so on. We don't see anything in there that we're particularly worried about, but it is 1 quarter into a year which probably has many more unknowns than most. 
I think your third question was around sort of what's up, what's down. I would say -- I would characterize the following in terms of our BGA flight hours are actually up vis-à-vis our initial assumptions. So that's what's up. What's down is our air transport, which obviously is a bigger number vis-à-vis BGA. So in total, we're about the same, but it's a little bit different. 
And then lastly, I would tell you that defense and space was roughly where we expected. The U.S. markets were strong. The internationals were a little bit weaker. We're sort of looking at that for the rest of the year. We don't know if there was some sort of channel loading that kind of happened at the end of the year, not that we drove it but the distributors themselves.
So those are sort of the puts and takes. But the framework that everybody ought to just fully understand is we are very bullish on our markets. And what we're seeing is the short cycles coming back very strongly compared -- you also add on that, Intelligrated. I mean when was the last time, Steve, you've seen any segment in any of our peers grow 47% year-over-year? I mean that's remarkable.
And now in the -- whether it's in the third or fourth quarter of this year, you're going to see some of our longer-cycle businesses coming back, whether it's PMT and Aerospace. I can't exactly call it, whether it's Q3 or Q4. There's a lot of moving pieces, but they're going to come back. And as you all know, those are higher-margin businesses. So we're -- I think we're on a really, really nice ramp here coming up for our future.
Greg, I don't know if you have anything to add."

So Julian, I don't think we said that margins contract in SPS sequentially. I think what we were trying to highlight is simply it's at -- in the 14, it's the lowest one in the portfolio.

I think what we were trying to highlight is simply it's at -- in the 14, it's the lowest one in the portfolio. And it's driving the biggest part of the growth. So it gives some pressure to the overall margin expansion for Honeywell.
I think we're going to see margins improve modestly for SPS during the course of the year because even for Intelligrated, as an example, we're going to have our peak quarter most likely here in Q2 on the revenue side. And then that will start to abate a little bit as the year progresses as well. You know that, that business can be very lumpy on the install. That's not new news. So the movement of that will influence the margin progression.
As it relates to your 20% target, we absolutely still have that in mind in the longer term. It's probably not 24 months from now. We talked quite a bit about the -- trying to capture the install base, particularly in the warehouse segment. And the whole point of that is then to follow with a terrific service and aftermarket business with software attached. And so as and when that shift occurs, then we'll see those margins mixing up.
And then again, with the recovery that we've had in places like PSS, which I think Kevin Dehoff and the team there have done a terrific job in that business, we start seeing margin accretion again in there. So we still have very much a line of sight to that 20%. But with roughly, maybe even close to a $3 billion business in warehouse this year at the lower margin, that's going to give us some short-term pressure."

We've been -- that's not news. I think what is news is that we're continuing to take substantial market share in the marketplace. Building install base and as the build-out of the warehouse infrastructure moderates, we're going to get higher-margin business because, obviously, then it's going to mix much more with the LSS.
So there's really no bad news here. This is actually fantastic news that we're taking share, growing extraordinarily quickly. And as I've said all along, Intelligrated is the best acquisition we've ever done at Honeywell. Now it's more or less undeniable.
And it's a business that continues to do well. And I see it being primarily a projects business for the next short to mid-term because the demand is still very, very high, whether it's North America and Europe. And we're going to capture that share. Ultimately, that's going to become our higher-margin business as it becomes a bit more installed base-centric."

I think they've done a terrific job on productivity, on footprint, new product introductions.
So I really think what Vimal and that team have been doing is quite good. And they're approaching their long-term targets here as we roll through 2021."

And sometimes when you acquire a business, you kind of hold your breath until you actually own it and say, ""Okay. Do we buy -- did we buy what we thought we bought?"" And I'm very, very happy to report that we're very excited about the business. We bought exactly what we thought we were going to buy.
The first quarter numbers speak for themselves. Strong double-digit growth, bookings that are sort of multiples of that. Being in the life sciences space and providing quality management solutions is, I think, going to have a very, very long runway for the future. We've got a great team in place there. We've augmented the team with some professionals as well. And we're extraordinarily well positioned to make that a big winner and then drive the synergies of our Honeywell Process Solutions business.
I mean we forget that, that business is now really growing, the life sciences segment of the business at a disproportionate rate, this will be a further catalyst to enable even more growth. And by the way, it's substantially margin accretive, too. 
So it wasn't kind of -- it wasn't maybe the typical Honeywell acquisition that we make, but we feel very, very good about it now, kind of being the proud owner for about a quarter. And it all looks good for Q2 and the rest of the year as well."

Their services, their catalyst part of the business is coming back. Our sort of book-to-bill is in much better shape this year than versus our assumptions this year versus where it was last year. So that's also a promising sign. We're seeing some activity come back.
And I also want to highlight maybe a very important part of that portfolio for our future, which is the Sustainability Technology Solutions (sic) [ Sustainable Technology Solutions ] business. Its quote log is in the hundred millions of dollars range now and growing very, very quickly. Its bookings were up 25%.
And we're talking to literally tens of different energy producers today about our Sustainability Technology Solutions portfolio, which is highly expansive. I mean from plastics recyclability to Ecofining to energy storage to hydrogen energy to carbon capture, we have all these solutions.
So I am very optimistic about that business. And it may look very different 3 to 4 years from now than it does today because we've overinvested into our Sustainability Technology Solutions portfolio.
Now on the larger projects, and you know this, sort of the OpEx, CapEx budgets, I sort of expect that, although I would view the price of oil and gas to be very friendly towards investment. We think that, that still could be a couple of quarters away just because of where the budgets were set for a lot of the majors. And as you know, they were depressed for this year. However, they are investing in the refurbishment, the catalyst and so on.
And if you look at -- and lastly, on your question as it relates to HPS. If you look at the HPS-UOP cycle, HPS typically trails UOP by 2 to 4 quarters. That's sort of mathematically how things work.
So we see some encouraging signs, and those signs are going to get better. And the business is going to get better for the next several quarters. So we're going to be patient. But we're very confident this environment is going to keep improving because, as you know, you have to reinvest. And although we're moving to a more noncarbon energy infrastructure, we're certainly going to need carbon for a while.
And so we've got 2 different growth factors. Number one is to sustain the current but also to help those businesses transition to the future."

But Europe -- sort of the leaders are U.K., U.S., Israel, UAE. Those are -- those markets are recovering fairly quickly. I think Europe will be next. China is in a pretty good place. India is a bit of a trouble spot, and Latin America is a bit of a trouble spot. So those will probably recover late this year.
Then we see a very strong pickup next -- even stronger pickup next year, particularly on the international routes. But some of those will recover in the second half of this year.

But as you highlighted and we talked about, the Q4 to Q1 decrement is the lack of Thanksgiving, Christmas, the January -- the December and January infection acceleration. So as those things start coming down, domestic travel we expect will be the main beneficiary. And you see that from all the airlines who have reported. Southwest, which is mostly a domestic leisure travel, is doing fantastic. And those who are reliant on -- more on the business travel are going to suffer.
So you're going to see that domestic and international and business travel bifurcation. Exactly how that's going to play out is -- really kind of remains to be seen. And even as was mentioned earlier, with places like Europe, domestic travel intra-Europe is -- has been depressed a little bit given the fact that they've had some additional lockdowns in some of the countries with the outbreaks there.
So it really is -- it's really a country-by-country, region-by-region impact. And so putting a precise finger on that, it's going to be a little bit elusive."

So -- but not really unexpected for what we've seen. You see what's happening with the mass coming back into service and so on. So we feel like we're sized properly for that ramp as we head into the second quarter and the back half of the year.
On BGA, certainly, that aftermarket stream, it's just going to grow at a faster pace than ATR. I mean people are shifting -- this is actually a question for the ATR business. People are shifting from commercial travel to business jet travel. That's happening. And so there may be some element of commercial first-class travel that actually, from a business perspective, doesn't fully come back.
So we do feel bullish about what we're seeing in the BGA space, particularly. But as I said earlier, there are so many variables -- as you know as well as we do. There are so many variables that go on to this between passenger behavior, airline behavior. That's a little bit as to why we're going to take this 1 quarter at a time."

And just to maybe add to that is yes, I think what we have looking forward is the OE rates slowly increasing. And I think that, that's -- we have a fairly high degree of confidence in there throughout this year, particularly second half versus first half, and then increasing even more in 2022. So that's sort of the math.
I mean I think we also forget that as recently as 3 months ago, I mean some of the infection rates in the U.S. were very, very high. And we're in a dramatically different place. So the overall January and then part of February were fairly difficult.
But we see the world slowly coming out of this. And it's -- there's going to be a direct correlation to aviation. And we think this is going to be manifested in the second half this year than '22 and '23. And we're set up for some very, very nice quarters and years ahead of us, which are going to be slowly ramping up.
So I -- we continue to be very bullish on aviation. We're investing in the business. But at the same time, 2020 was a good opportunity for us to really rationalize some cost structure. And I think we can lever up nicely as that business starts coming back.
Okay. I'm proud of everyone at Honeywell, whose consistent hard work and unwavering commitment enable us to outperform in this challenging environment. Thank you to our shareholders for your ongoing support. We are well positioned for the recovery with a strong start to the year. And I look forward to opportunities to come during the balance of 2021 and beyond.
Thank you all for listening. And please stay safe and healthy."

up 60% year-over-year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range. We delivered a strong second quarter and the first half of the year. I'm pleased with our performance and confident it will continue to execute and deliver through the ongoing recovery in our end markets. We are driving near-term growth in several areas of the portfolio, including warehouse automation, productivity solutions, building products and Advanced Materials, while the industries most affected by the pandemic will continue improving throughout the year and into 2022. 
Orders were up over 20% year-over-year organically driven by strength in Aerospace, PMT, HBT and Productivity Solutions, creating a strong setup for growth. As always, we continue to execute on our rigorous and proven operating system that drives outstanding shareholder value. 
Now let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss our recent leadership announcements. Last week, we announced changes to our senior leadership team that will take place over the coming weeks and months. Honeywell's consistent success is driven by our highly talented and committed workforce, which is guided by our world-class leadership team. 
We have a deep bench of high-quality capable leaders as demonstrated by the recent announcements. First, Vimal Kapur will succeed Rajeev Gautam as President and CEO of Performance Materials and Technologies. Rajeev will retire in August after 43 years of Honeywell and will serve as President Emeritus of Honeywell PMT until the end of January to ensure a smooth transition. 
Rajeev has led PMT for the past 5 years and guided the business through a deep industry downturn in 2020 with an unwavering focus on taking care of employees and customers. We greatly appreciate Rajeev's exemplary leadership over the past 4 decades. 
Vimal will transition to PMT from his prior role as President and CEO of Honeywell Building Technologies. He has been with Honeywell for 32 years and brings outstanding leadership capabilities and a deep knowledge of our end markets to the PMT CEO role. This will mark Vimal's return to PMT, where he was previously President of Process Solutions business. 
Doug Wright will succeed Vimal as President and CEO of HBT. Doug joined Honeywell in July 2020 as President of HBT's Fire and Security business. Bringing deep industry experience, he has quickly made a significant impact. Prior to joining Honeywell, Doug was President and CEO of Source Photonics, a global provider of optical communications products used in telecommunication systems and data communication networks. Prior to that, Doug spent 6 years at United Technologies, which served as President of Asia for the company's Fire and Security business based in Shanghai and President Of Company's $2.5 billion Automation and Control Solutions business. 
Finally, Ben Driggs has been named Chief Operating Officer of Global High Growth Regions and will succeed Shane Tedjarati as President Global High Growth Regions when Shane retires at the end of 2021 after 17 years with Honeywell. Shane has played an essential role in establishing and aggressively growing Honeywell's presence in high-growth regions, and we appreciate everything he has done to make Honeywell a truly global company. Shane will remain in an advisory capacity over the next 3 years. 
Ben has been with Honeywell for more than 16 years and brings a wealth of global experience to his new role as COO of Global High Growth Regions. Most recently, Ben was Vice President of Global Strategic Accounts, where he was responsible for all aspects of our relationships with key customers at a global level. Prior to this role, been serving a variety of positions with Honeywell, including President of Americas Aerospace, President of Honeywell Latin America and Vice President of Aerospace Asia Pacific. 
I'd like to thank Rajeev and Shane for the numerous contributions they made to Honeywell over their highly productive careers. I'd also like to congratulate Vimal, Doug and Ben under new roles. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 and talk about another exciting recent announcement. The combination of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum computing or CQC forms the largest, most advanced standalone quantum computing company in the world. Honeywell's H-Series chronic computer offers the world's highest demonstrated quanta volume of 1,024, and CQC has the first and most advanced quantum operating system. 
Together, they create a unique full stack quantum player in a league of its own. Quantum computing will absolutely remain a key breakthrough initiative for Honeywell. We will own a majority of the stake in the new company with commensurate governance rights, and we'll have a long-term agreement to help manufacture the critical ion traps needed to power the company's quantum hardware. 
Honeywell's business will also continue serving as a proving ground for the company's quantum offerings. The combination of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and CQC is essential to advancing the value that Quantum Solutions provide to customers. To advance this value, the new company will codevelop integrated quantum hardware and software solutions to enable a one-stop shop for quantum customers. 
Additionally, the focus will be on developing hardware-agnostic software solutions and a unique quantum operating system, which is optimized for the quantum hardware on which it is used. These technologies will support customer needs for improved computation diverse areas, including cybersecurity, drug discovery and delivery, material science, finance and optimization across all major industrial markets. 
We're already working with global customers to deliver solutions for markets with massive scalable commercialization opportunity, including JPMorgan, BMW, Samsung, Google, DHL and many others. The combined company holds over 150 technical patents and will have a staff of approximately 330 people, which is the largest pool of quantum talent in the world, more than 120 of whom hold doctorates and over 200 of whom are scientists, including some of the world's leading quantum computing experts. 
The long-term financial prospects of the new companies are substantial. The combination is expected to significantly accelerate the path to commercial scale, creating the potential for approximately $1 billion in sales within 2 to 5 years. We are excited about the new company's prospects, and we expect to continue to be a global quantum computing leader, shaping the future of what is projected to become a $1 trillion industry over the next 30 years. 
Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 5 to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and to provide an update on our 2021 outlook."

We overdeliv",2944,"Thank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. As Darius highlighted, we had a very strong second quarter with sales up 15% organically to $8.8 billion, segment margin expansion of 190 basis points to 20.4% and free cash flow of $1.5 billion. We overdelivered on our commitments again, building on the strong start we had in Q1. 
Let's take a minute to discuss how each of the segments contributed to that. Starting with Aerospace, second quarter sales were up 7% organically as flight hours continue to improve, resulting in double-digit commercial aerospace aftermarket growth. That was partially offset by lower commercial original equipment and software defense volumes. 
Business aviation continues to be very robust, where flight hours have already returned to 2019 levels as a portion of customers that previously traveled commercially have transitioned to business jets for health and safety reasons. We continue to expect the recovery in business travel to lag the leisure travel recovery. However, we do expect to pick up as we enter the second half of the year. 
As expected, air transport flight hours are recovering led by narrow-body flight hours, while widebodies remain soft as domestic travel recovers faster than international travel. As a result, our business aviation aftermarket sales were up 90% organically year-over-year, while our air transport aftermarket sales were up 32% year-over-year organically. 
Sequentially, overall commercial aftermarket sales were up 12% from 1Q '21, a promising sign that the recovery is gaining traction. Aerospace segment margin expanded 490 basis points to 25.7%. 
Turning to Building Technologies. Sales were up 13% organically driven by robust demand for building products and solutions. We are seeing broad-based strength across the Building Technologies portfolio and around the world as people return to schools, offices and transportation hubs. 
Building product sales and orders were both up double digits year-over-year driven by demand for fire, security and electrical products as well as building management systems. Orders for Building Solutions projects and services were up over 25% year-over-year, and the services backlog is up more than 30%, positioning the business for future growth. In addition, our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions maintained strong customer momentum with approximately $90 million of orders booked in the second quarter for a total of approximately $150 million in the first half. HBT segment margins expanded 120 basis points to 22.4%. 
On to PMT, where sales were up 10% organically driven by 30% organic growth in Advanced Materials and a return to growth in UOP. PMT had a strong quarter with total orders up 20% over year organically and backlog up mid-single digits. These are encouraging signs for the future of this business. 
The 30% year-over-year growth in Advanced Materials was broad-based, particularly in automotive refrigerants, foam products and specialty additives. In UOP, sales were up 8% organically driven by higher petrochemical catalyst shipments, licensing and equipment volumes. UOP orders were up over 25%, which should drive growth in the second half and into 2022. 
Finally, Process Solutions, down 1% organically, but up 6% sequentially from the first quarter as the recovery gains traction in the oil and gas industry. The year-over-year decline was driven by fewer global mega projects, partially offset by short-cycle strength in the products and Thermal Solutions businesses as well as demand for our life cycle solutions and services. HPS orders were up high single digits, providing confidence in the oncoming recovery. PMT segment margins expanded 190 basis points to 20.8% in the quarter. 
Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, despite battling some supply shortages, sales were up 35% organically driven by continued strength across the portfolio, including another quarter of high double-digit organic growth in the Warehouse and Workflow Solutions and Productivity Solutions and Services businesses, which grew 57% and 38%, respectively. Personal protective equipment was also up double digits organically as we delivered from our strong backlog. 
In addition, demand accelerated in the short-cycle gas protection and advanced sensing businesses, driving high single-digit sequential sales growth from the first quarter. Orders in Productivity Solutions and Services were up triple digits year-over-year, exhibiting strong ongoing demand, which we expect to fuel second half growth in this business. SPS segment margins expanded 20 basis points in the quarter to 14%. 
Growth across our portfolio was underpinned by progress in the Honeywell Connected Enterprise. Second quarter recurring revenue growth was up double digits, and orders for connected solutions were up over 20% year-over-year as we continue to drive SaaS growth. Our connected buildings and cyber solutions, which have been very strong in the past year, continued to grow double digits organically, and our connected industrial solutions business was up double digits year-over-year as the industrial markets begin to recover. 
So in total for Honeywell, our robust sales growth, coupled with strong pricing and cost management, drove 190 basis points of improvement in segment margins, 10 basis points above the high end of our 2Q guidance despite the mix headwind from much stronger sales in SPS, our lowest margin segment. 
For the quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.02, up 76% -- or excuse me, up $0.76 or 60% year-over-year, $0.06 above the high end of our guidance, $0.04 of which was due to overdelivery on sales and segment profit. The majority of our year-over-year earnings growth, $0.43, was driven by our strong segment profit improvement. 
Below the line items were a $0.25 tailwind driven by lower repositioning and higher pension income. A lower effective tax rate of 23% and lower weighted average share count of 703 million shares drove a $0.06 and $0.02 benefit, respectively. A bridge from 2Q '20 adjusted earnings per share to 2Q '21 adjusted earnings per share can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
On free cash flow, we generated $1.5 billion in the quarter or 17% of sales, resulting in 103% adjusted conversion. Free cash flow was up 17% year-over-year. Free cash flow this quarter includes the $375 million cash received from Garrett as we resolved our contractual claims under the plan of reorganization signed last quarter. As a reminder, we will continue to include cash receipts from Garrett going forward within free cash flow in order to be comparable to prior periods where the cash proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreement were recognized. 
Finally, we strategically deployed $1.9 billion to share repurchases, dividends and CapEx in the second quarter, which significantly exceeded operating cash flow. We paid $664 million in dividends, deployed $185 million in capital expenditures and repurchased more than $1 billion of Honeywell shares, reducing our share count to 703 million. 
In all, this was a very strong quarter and caps a successful first half of 2021. We're prudently managing through the multispeed recovery across the portfolio, continuing to make disciplined investments for the future while meeting or exceeding our financial commitments. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. We entered the third quarter well positioned to manage the multispeed economic recovery, which will be influenced by unique end market and regional dynamics as vaccination rates expand and the global pandemic subsides. 
At a high level, we expect ongoing strength across the portfolio in the second half. We should see acceleration in businesses that were most affected by the downturn, particularly the commercial aerospace aftermarket and the oil and gas-exposed HPS and UOP businesses. 
We do expect some deceleration in respiratory masks, Warehouse and Workflow Solutions to come down sequentially as large Intelligrated projects complete and lower year-over-year volumes in U.S. and international defense in the back half of the year, though it will grow sequentially from the second quarter. With that as a backdrop, we expect third quarter sales to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $8.8 billion, up 7% to 11% on an organic basis. And we now expect full year sales of $34.6 billion to $35.2 billion, up $400 million from the high end of our previous guidance. This represents overall organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 6%, an increase of 1 point on both ends compared to our previous guidance. 
We will talk more about our expectations by segment momentarily. An update on our 2021 end market outlook can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
One area to keep in mind is that we have been facing supply chain constraints as the sourcing environment for direct materials and components such as semiconductors and resin has been very tight. As we mentioned last quarter, we proactively partnered with distributors and alternative suppliers to mitigate these impacts and have had success, but the situation remains very fluid as global supply chains ramp up. We continue to work through this issue, but it will continue to be a constraint on our growth potential, particularly in SPS and HBT and, to a lesser degree, in Aerospace. 
Now let's take a moment to walk through the third quarter and full year expectations by segment. In Aerospace, our commercial aerospace business will continue to improve gradually throughout the year. We expect business aviation aftermarket to continue to lead in the recovery and track 2019 levels or better for the balance of the year. 
We expect air transport flight hours to continue improving in the third and the fourth quarter, driving sequential and year-over-year growth in commercial aftermarket sales. The pace of the air transport acceleration will vary regionally in the second half with domestic travel recovering faster than international and was difficult to predict country-by-country dynamics tied to vaccinations. We expect narrow-body and wide-body flight hours to fully recover to 2019 levels by 2024. 
Commercial original equipment build rates are progressing gradually as we expected. Second half defense and sales -- Defense & Space sales will be pressured by lower demand from U.S. DoD programs driven by moderating U.S. defense spend as well as by slower-than-expected international defense volumes. As a result of these Defense & Space dynamics, we now expect full year organic sales growth to be down low single digits for the year in Aerospace. 
In Building Technologies, we expect ongoing demand in the second half for products, services and projects as business conditions continue to improve as the world reopens. We anticipate broad-based order strength in the third and the fourth quarters, particularly for Building Solutions projects, which we expect will ramp up as energy projects in the government and education verticals gain traction. 
We will continue to execute on our strong projects and services backlog, driving strength in the back half. In addition, we will benefit from continued customer demand for our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions. Overall, we now expect full year organic sales growth to be up mid-single digits for the full year, trending better than expected. 
In PMT, we were encouraged by the signs of recovery in Process Solutions and UOP in the second quarter, and we expect to see this trend continue in the third quarter and beyond. While we expect the pace of recovery to be gradual, end market dynamics in energy are creating a strong setup for 2022 and beyond. 
We anticipate that HPS will return to growth in 3Q, driven by the short-cycle products and service businesses, which should deliver on strong first half orders. We also expect sequential improvement in automation projects driven by backlog execution. 
Orders for global mega projects increased in the second quarter, which is an encouraging sign for the business, though these orders will have a larger impact on 2022. Overall, HPS should grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of the year. 
For UOP, we're pleased with the 2Q outcome, which included strong catalysts and project orders that should drive growth in the second half. Last, we expect continued strength in Advanced Materials in the third quarter driven by demand for a wide range of the business' products. 
In April, we said that we were trending towards the low end of our plus or minus low single-digit full year growth expectations for PMT. Since then, our outlook has improved, and we now expect full year organic sales to be up low single digits for the year. 
Finally, we anticipate continued strength in SPS driven by another quarter of robust double-digit organic growth in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions and Productivity Solutions and Services. Though we expect year-over-year growth rates to remain strong in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, 2Q represented the high watermark for sales in that business this year as we had previously said. We will see sequential declines in 3Q and 4Q due to normal project timing as customers enter the busy holiday season. 
Our Productivity Solutions and Services backlog is up triple digits, which will drive growth in the third quarter for this business. Distributor demand continues to be strong, and we expect this to continue throughout the second half. So as I mentioned, we will be managing some supply constraints. 
We will continue to execute our backlog of personal protective equipment in the third quarter. However, respiratory demand is decelerating as various regions of the world recover from the pandemic. This deceleration will be partially offset by stronger demand in other areas of our PPE portfolio, including gloves and head and hearing protection, which we expect to ramp-up in the second half. 
Finally, we expect continued short-cycle acceleration in our gas analysis and advanced sensing business. Overall, we expect strong double-digit sales growth in SPS for the full year. 
Now let me turn to our expectations for the other core guided metrics. For third quarter segment margins, we expect to be in the range of 20.3% to 20.6%, resulting in 40 to 70 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. Margins will continue to show strong expansion despite the headwinds of the temporary cost access from 2020 and our investments in growth of the businesses. 
Third quarter net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $5 million to positive $55 million with a range of repositioning between $50 million and $100 million as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring projects. 
We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% and the average share count to be approximately 703 million shares. As a result, we expect adjusted third quarter earnings per share between $1.97 and $2.02, up 26% to 29% year-over-year. 
Given these third quarter expectations, our strong outperformance in the first half and our continued confidence in our businesses, in addition to raising our full year sales expectations, we are also raising our other full year guided metrics, including segment margins, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. We are raising the low end of our segment margin guidance by 10 basis points for a new range of 20.8% to 21.1%, representing an expansion of 40 to 70 basis points. 
We expect margin expansion in all our segments as we carefully invest back into the business, while managing the multispeed recovery across the portfolio. Our fixed cost management remains a focus, and we are on track to a net increase of $500 million for the year, cementing the permanent reduction of $1 billion of fixed costs from our 2020 cost actions. 
We expect our net below-the-line impact to be in the range of negative $110 million to positive $40 million, including capacity for $400 million to $525 million of repositioning. We continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22%, and we now expect a weighted average share count of approximately 703 million for the year, achieving our minimum 1% reduction in shares. 
As a result, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance. We now expect a range of $7.95 to $8.10, up 12% to 14% year-over-year. This represents an increase of $0.10 on the high end and $0.15 at the midpoint, reflecting our confidence in the recovery across the portfolio. 
Finally, we are raising our free cash flow guidance by $100 million on both ends for a range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. So in total, we delivered a great second quarter and anticipate a strong second half and have significantly upgraded our full year view for sales, segment margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow as we manage through this recovery. 
Let's turn to Page 7 for a quick look at our guidance progression through the year. At the beginning of '21, there was a lot of uncertainty about the virus case rates, the pace of vaccinations and the recovery around the world. We're committed to providing guidance that is commensurate with our level of visibility and the environment we are in at the time. 
In January, with the unknown pace of recovery in mind, we took a pragmatic approach to our outlook. After the first quarter, with a little more visibility into the full year and confidence in our first quarter results, we raised several key guidance metrics. 
Now halfway through the year, we have raised them again. Our full year sales guidance is now $800 million higher than our original guidance on the high end. We've also raised the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance by approximately 23% -- $0.23, and our free cash flow guidance has been raised by $100 million in the high end. As always, you can count on us to provide an outlook that is consistent with our level of visibility. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Darius to talk about the end market tailwinds that we are creating -- excuse me, that are creating a strong setup for 2022 and beyond."

Current end market macro dynamics are creating the best set of circumstances that I have seen in the last 10-plus years that I've been with Honeywell. The commercial aerospace recovery in view, upcoming capital reinvestment in the energy",1156,"Thank you, Greg. Current end market macro dynamics are creating the best set of circumstances that I have seen in the last 10-plus years that I've been with Honeywell. The commercial aerospace recovery in view, upcoming capital reinvestment in the energy sector, nonresidential construction spending returning to 2019 levels and the exponential growth we continue to see in e-commerce, we are setting up for an incredibly strong runway for medium-term growth. 
This macro setup, coupled with the strategies we have in place that are focused on driving uniquely innovative and differentiated technologies to address the world's increasing demand for digital transformation, process technology and sustainable solutions gives me great confidence in our outlook for 2022 and beyond. Let me start by talking about the medium-term dynamics of some of our key end markets. 
In commercial aerospace, pent-up demand for leisure and business travel is expected to drive approximately 20% growth in flight hours over the next 2 to 3 years. Business and general aviation flight hours have already recovered to 2019 levels, and we expect air transport narrow-body and wide-body flight hours to recover by 2024. 
We're seeing a slower defense business. We are absorbing that in our strong 2021 outlook, and our growth trajectory for the next 2 years should remain robust. 
The energy markets are gaining traction, and stabilizing oil prices support an oncoming wave of capital reinvestment in this sector, with downstream customer CapEx expected to grow at a 6.5% compound annual growth rate over the next 3 years. As I said before, the investment cycle post downturn is a consistent theme, and we'll be well positioned to capture our unfair share of it. Acceleration in refining and petrochemical volumes will drive demand for our high-margin catalysts. And new greenfield and brownfield projects over the medium term will drive demand for licensing, engineering and equipment as well as our software and automation solutions. 
Our Building Technologies portfolio will continue to benefit from the ongoing global macro trends of sustainability, digitization and public safety. Building orders are looking for healthy Building Solutions to create safe public spaces while optimizing energy consumption and productivity. 
Nonresidential construction is expected to grow by $230 billion to $2.5 trillion by 2024 with refurbishments for healthy building is growing at a high single-digit compound annual growth rate over the next 3 years. We also expect tailwinds from sizable U.S. stimulus programs targeting airports, education and health care as well as potential government infrastructure plans, which will provide a favorable setup for our Building Technologies business. 
We remain very well positioned to address the rapid evolution that we see in the click-and-collect consumer buying behavior, which is creating complex fulfillment and delivery needs. In fact, e-commerce is expected to make up approximately 30% of total retail sales by 2024. 
To meet this growing demand as well as to prepare for intensifying labor shortages, retail retailers are meaningfully stepping up investments and workflow technologies and automation, amplifying our already strong trajectory in this market with a growing installed base and ample runway for high-margin aftermarket opportunities. So you see our macro setup is a strong as it has been in a very long time. 
Now let's turn to the next page. I want to highlight a few of our strategic vectors and how they'll play into our growth algorithm. Let's start with Urban Air Mobility or UAM, one space where we see significant growth opportunity. The total available market will be around $120 billion annually in 2030, of which we are positioned to address $30 billion. 
We have leading flyby wire systems for urban air mobility, avionics and vehicle management systems in addition to highly differentiated, high assurance detect and avoid systems. We have already won $3.4 billion of content and another $1.8 billion of wins spending, and we have $7 billion in projected cumulative pipeline over the next 5 years growing to $55 billion in cumulative pipeline out to 2030. So this is a really exciting business where we are already generating substantial wins with significant future potential. 
We're also generating growth of the Honeywell Connected Enterprise, which is underpinned by Honeywell Forge, our suite of SaaS applications, to drive operational excellence and are essential to day-to-day management of company's complex operations. Honeywell Connected Enterprise delivered double-digit recurring revenue growth, and orders were up over 20% in the second quarter, which serves as an excellent proof point as we continue to focus on driving software growth. 
We are also recently launched a cloud-based connected Building Solutions jointly developed through our SAP partnership. Our portfolio of connected solutions is demonstrating great momentum with 1 million instances of Tritium's Niagara deployed worldwide and over 5,000 Honeywell Forge OT cybersecurity projects delivered, to name a few examples. 
One of the newest additions to our portfolio, Sparta Systems, is also contributing to Honeywell's software growth with orders up over 30% in the first half of 2021. Sparta's SaaS customer base has grown double digits since year-end 2020, and Sparta ended the second quarter with a backlog of over $100 million. 
Sparta Systems recently announced that a leading European specialty pharmaceutical company implemented trackwise digital solution suite that includes car QS processes in addition to complaints handling, supplier quality management, document management and training management to seamlessly integrate quality processes and data across its manufacturing operations and suppliers. So the Sparta integration is progressing smoothly, and I'm pleased with the results thus far. 
Finally, we continue to see strong demand for our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions, which I mentioned earlier. We booked around $150 million of healthy building orders in the first half and have a global pipeline of over $2 billion. A few examples of our customer wins across major verticals include the Pittsburgh and San Diego International airports, Syracuse University and Wuhan Chingpu Hospital. We anticipate the demand for healthy buildings will remain strong for the foreseeable future as building managers seek to support occupant safety and comfort for returning workers, students, travelers and visitors. 
All 4 of the technologies on this page are proof point for our strategy of focusing R&D and breakthrough initiatives around disruptive trends that will shape the global economy for years to come. We have many other equally exciting breakthroughs, including quantum, sustainable technology solutions and smart cities for as an example. These provide numerous growth vectors, which will be accretive to the recovery in our major end markets, which underpins my confidence in what is to come. 
Now let's wrap up on Slide 10. So overall, we are encouraged by the performance of the first half of 2021. Our second quarter results exceeded our expectations. And given our confidence in our businesses, we have meaningfully raised our full year sales segment margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance. The Honeywell value creation framework continues to set us apart and will continue to deliver for all of our shareholders. 
With that Reena, let's move to Q&A."

One thing that interested me in your comments there, Darius, obviously, the technology stuff is interesting. But the commercialization revenues of $1 billion as soon as 2 years. I wonder if you could kind of talk a little bit about the difference between the 2-year and the 5-year framework there? Is there something in terms of a technical breakthrough, further technical breakthrough that's required or it's more an issue of just developing the business model and kind of getting a customer set on board with what you're doing here?"

Well, I think, Jeff, more importantly, it's a toggle between focus on progressing that technology versus focusing on commercialization.

Well, I think, Jeff, more importantly, it's a toggle between focus on progressing that technology versus focusing on commercialization. This business is generating revenue today for CQC, and it's generating revenue today for Honeywell Quantum Systems. 
And we could focus on energy, our energy on continuing to drive commercialization, but we're trying to be balanced between yes, driving some commercialization, securing some blue-chip customers but also continue to advance the technology. I mean, this isn't necessarily an instant gratification kind of a business. Because if we just over function to commercialization, although we have a year or 2 lead than just about everybody else in the industry, that could get shortchanged if we don't continue to advance it. 
But I think that's more than anything. So the 2- to 4-year kind of a number is based on both how we see the technology evolving or 2 to 5 and also how we see really us focusing on technology progress versus commercialization. And I think we want to maintain both and not necessarily just full toggle to commercialization because I think that, that could sacrifice progress on the technology."

I mean, I think our results for Q3 would have easily been $100 million to $200 million harder -- higher than what we're saying because of supply chain constraints. So it is -- we're dealing with the 2. It's a daily battle. 
Some of the areas that we're particularly challenged are semiconductors, resins. Those are probably our top 2, but we're kind of seeing some supply chain pressure across the board. And our orders are super strong, particularly in SPS, and we could easily do $100 million to $200 million more in revenue this quarter in Q3 if we didn't have those challenges. 
So what we projected is kind of a reasonable best estimate of the supply we're going to get based on what our suppliers are committing. But it's a daily battle, and we're -- we've stood up a team on the supply side. We stood up a team on the pricing side to really kind of manage both those things because we're continuing to see inflation. And we're actively managing price, which actually has been a good story as we are able to pass most of that through."

Aero is going to continue to improve. Wide-body and narrow-body traffic is going to continue to improve. We absorbed some of the Defense & Space challenges this year, so that's already embedded. And we expect it to normalize. 
So as we look into next year and the year after and the year after, I mean, we are going to be relooking at our growth and margin expansion algorithm as well as don't forget, we still have plenty of firepower on the balance sheet, which we plan to deploy.

So as you may have heard within the quarter, I mean, some of our production we basically shut down because when we set it up in a hurry, literally been 30 days when the pandemic struck in April 2020, we didn't optimize for cost. We optimized for speed. And frankly, that wasn't a very high-margin gain for us. We did that because the country needed us to do it. We didn't do it to maximize profit. 
So now when we reduced production, we reduced production in the highly inefficient, highly manual cells that we were -- that we could bring up quickly. But what we replaced that production with is with highly automated cells, which will drop our cost per mask on the range of 50%. So positioning the business for the future is still going to be very, very strong. 
And our IRRs -- and that's assuming there's not a pickup in the future of masks. And as we read more and more about Delta variants that we don't know what's going to happen, but even that IRR is greater than 20%. So better than any other investment. And like I said, this wasn't done to sort of optimize profitability so that we got some revenue. We didn't necessarily get a ton of margin with it. And now we're in a better position because we got production that's done through automation, which will drop our cost profile by about 50% per mask."

Business aviation has been strong, both on the aftermarket as well as the OE side. That's going to continue to progress. So overall, there's -- we have a great deal of optimism for what we're going to see in Aerospace. And the margin performance will be very commensurate with that because some of the wide-body, narrow-body aftermarket revenue is still not kicking in, which, as you know, is going to be some of our highest margin profile.

For overall total, every business was up just about double digits in terms of orders in PMT. Our backlog was up in PMT. So all good signs. The other part that we're starting to see strong level of presence, both for our Honeywell Process Solutions business as well as UOP in some of the renewable projects. 
You probably saw the Wabash Valley announcement around carbon capture, that UOP one. Process Solutions is winning in a lot of the wind farm projects, solar farm projects. So we're shifting focus to where the future is while maintaining our presence in some of our traditional markets. 
And as we know, and we saw this movie before in the '15 and '16 time frame, you can only depress that downstream investment for so long. And we saw that come back strong in '17 and '18. We anticipate the very same thing will happen in '22 and '23.

And I agree with you. I think capital deployment is a big lever. So this kind of goes back to my prior point that I made in the presentation, which is our markets are at a tailwind, and we've got tremendous capacity on our balance sheet.

So maybe first on the pricing side, as Darius mentioned in some of his comments, that's something that we have always and continue to have a very strong eye on. And so everywhere in our books of business that we can, we continue to pass-through the inflation that's being seen and the materials and also in the labor because in the products businesses, labor is also important as well. 
So I would say as we're looking at our margin and backlog, we're not seeing any material challenges to them. It doesn't mean that because we are being able to price these things in, so I wouldn't call that as any like a big change in our profile. But it's something we keep a very strong eye on. 
We talked about in Intelligrated, the projects business. There is lower than the line average for the business overall, and that's part of the hypothesis for the business in general, capture the volume and then follow that through with services and software just as we had on -- in Process Solutions. 
So I think what we're doing is we're finding success in being able to price with the inflationary environment that we're seeing, and we're going to continue to manage through that, I think, quite well in all of our projects businesses. But it is something to keep an eye on."

And if you think about the return to things like travel and the cost that comes along with T&E, I mean, we're just now in the second quarter starting to get the organization back out on the street to see customers and to go visit our businesses. 
So I would say you're still going to see another step-up here in the third quarter in terms of the return of those temporary costs. And then the majority of those will be gone. There'll still be a little bit of trickle in, in 4Q, but third quarter is still yet to come. 
We are investing in the businesses, though. And that's, again, part of the reason when we talk about the $1 billion net cost reduction and that $0.5 billion of increase, that is also absorbing some increase in R&D, which is happening in places like quantum. It's happening in places like Aerospace. It's happening in our Honeywell Connected Enterprise, just to name a few. 
And we continue -- as the environment strengthens commercially, we're going to invest back in the business in terms of sales resources and feet on the street and so on. So we have a lot of confidence in being able to deliver the year with the net $0.5 billion increase that we talked about, and that is going to encompass both the temporary cost return and some additional investments."

We're seeing traffic pick up. The consumer traffic is strong actually. There's a lot of pent-up traffic demand for international travel. And that's what I said is that as we look at the next 2 to 3 years, it's going to get gradually better and better. And probably if there was a drawback, we absorbed it this year in terms of Defense & Space. And we expect that to normalize next year.

So I expect to see, again, sequential improvement in margins in the back half of the year in SPS. And again, the same thing being true as we think about PMT ramping up and starting to see what we did here this quarter in terms of the catalyst shipments coming through. 
As Darius highlighted, our UOP backlog is very strong. And so as that begins delivering, particularly around the catalyst side, that brings with it some nice margin accretion. And we've always talked about the fact that you can't look at PMT margins in any 1 quarter as indicative. That moves around a bit with the mix around catalyst. But I do expect that to also improve in the back half of the year as we continue to see that strengthening growth rate. 
So again, that's why we feel very good about where we are right now as we exit the first half, and we look forward to a very good second half of the year and a nice finish. That's why we upgraded our margin range on the low end by the 10 basis points that we did. So I think things are trending nicely across all of the segments."

Let's begin on Slide 2. We delivered another outstanding quarter that exceeded the high end of our second quarter organic sales growth, segment margin and adjusted earnings per share guidance range, with top line growth and margin expansion in all 4 segments. 
We delivered organic sales growth of 15%, led by double-digit growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions, Honeywell Building Technologies and Advanced Materials and Performance Materials and Technologies. We also returned to growth in the Commercial Aerospace Aftermarket and UOP amid promising signs of recovery in the oil and gas and aerospace markets. 
Segment margin expanded 190 basis points to 20.4%, driven by the impact of higher sales volumes. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.02, up 60% year-over-year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range. 
We delivered a strong second quarter in the first half of the year. I'm pleased with our performance and confident it will continue to execute and deliver through the ongoing recovery in our end markets. We are driving near-term growth in several areas of the portfolio, including Warehouse Automation, Productivity Solutions, Building Products and Advanced Materials, while the industries most affected by the pandemic will continue improving throughout the year and into 2022. 
Orders were up over 20% year-over-year organically driven by strength in Aerospace, PMT, HBT and Productivity Solutions, creating a strong setup for growth. As always, we continue to execute on our rigorous and proven operating system that drives outstanding shareholder value. 
Now let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss our recent leadership announcements. Last week, we announced changes to our senior leadership team that will take place over the coming weeks and months. Honeywell's consistent success is driven by our highly talented and committed workforce, which is guided by our world-class leadership team. 
We have a deep bench of high-quality capable leaders as demonstrated by the recent announcements. First, Vimal Kapur will succeed Rajeev Gautam as President and CEO of Performance Materials and Technologies. Rajeev will retire in August after 43 years of Honeywell and will serve as President Emeritus of Honeywell PMT until the end of January to ensure a smooth transition. Rajeev has led PMT for the past 5 years and guided the business through a deep industry downturn in 2020 with an unwavering focus on taking care of employees and customers. We greatly appreciate Rajeev's exemplary leadership over the past 4 decades. 
Vimal will transition to PMT from his prior role as President and CEO of Honeywell Building Technologies. He has been with Honeywell for 32 years and brings outstanding leadership capabilities and a deep knowledge of our end markets to the PMT CEO role. This will mark Vimal's return to PMT, where he was previously President of Process Solutions business. 
Doug Wright will succeed Vimal as President and CEO of HBT. Doug joined Honeywell in July 2020 as President of HBT's Fire and Security business. Bringing deep industry experience, he has quickly made a significant impact. Prior to joining Honeywell, Doug was President and CEO of Source Photonics, a global provider of optical communications products used in telecommunication systems and data communication networks. Prior to that, Doug spent 6 years at United Technologies, which served as President of Asia for the company's Fire and Security business based in Shanghai and President of the company's $2.5 billion Automation and Control Solutions business. 
Finally, Ben Driggs has been named Chief Operating Officer of Global High Growth Regions and will succeed Shane Tedjarati as President, Global High Growth Regions when Shane retires at the end of 2021 after 17 years with Honeywell. Shane has played an essential role in establishing and aggressively growing Honeywell's presence in high-growth regions, and we appreciate everything he has done to make Honeywell a truly global company. Shane will remain in an advisory capacity over the next 3 years. 
Ben has been with Honeywell for more than 16 years and brings a wealth of global experience to his new role as COO of Global High Growth Regions. Most recently, Ben was Vice President of Global Strategic Accounts, where he was responsible for all aspects of our relationships with key customers at a global level. Prior to this role, Ben served in a variety of positions with Honeywell, including President of Americas Aerospace, President of Honeywell Latin America and Vice President of Aerospace Asia Pacific. 
I'd like to thank Rajeev and Shane for the numerous contributions they made to Honeywell over their highly productive careers. I'd also like to congratulate Vimal, Doug and Ben under new roles. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 and talk about another exciting recent announcement. The combination of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum Computing or CQC forms the largest, most advanced standalone quantum computing company in the world. Honeywell's H-Series quantum computer offers the world's highest demonstrated quanta volume of 1,024, and CQC has the first and most advanced quantum operating system. 
Together, they create a unique full stack quantum player in a league of its own. Quantum computing will absolutely remain a key breakthrough initiative for Honeywell. We will own a majority of the stake in the new company with commensurate governance rights, and we'll have a long-term agreement to help manufacture the critical ion traps needed to power the company's quantum hardware. 
Honeywell's business will also continue serving as a proving ground for the company's quantum offerings. The combination of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and CQC is essential to advancing the value that Quantum Solutions provide to customers. To advance this value, the new company will codevelop integrated quantum hardware and software solutions to enable a one-stop shop for quantum customers. 
Additionally, the focus will be on developing hardware-agnostic software solutions and a unique quantum operating system, which is optimized for the quantum hardware on which it is used. These technologies will support customer needs for improved computation in diverse areas, including cybersecurity, drug discovery and delivery, material science, finance and optimization across all major industrial markets. 
We're already working with global customers to deliver solutions for markets with massive scalable commercialization opportunity, including JPMorgan, BMW, Samsung, Google, DHL and many others. The combined company holds over 150 technical patents and will have a staff of approximately 330 people, which is the largest pool of quantum talent in the world, more than 120 of whom hold doctorates and over 200 of whom are scientists, including some of the world's leading quantum computing experts. 
The long-term financial prospects of the new companies are substantial. The combination is expected to significantly accelerate the path to commercial scale, creating the potential for approximately $1 billion in sales within 2 to 5 years. We are excited about the new company's prospects, and we expect to continue to be a global quantum computing leader, shaping the future of what is projected to become a $1 trillion industry over the next 30 years. 
Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 5 to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and to provide an update on our 2021 outlook."

As Darius highlighted, we had a very strong second quarter with sales up 15% organically to $8.8 billion, segment margin expansion of 190 basis points to 20.4% and free cash flow of $1.5 billion. We overdelivered on our commitments again, building on the strong start we had in Q1. 
Let's take a minute to discuss how each of the segments contributed to that. Starting with Aerospace, second quarter sales were up 7% organically as flight hours continued to improve, resulting in double-digit commercial aerospace aftermarket growth. That was partially offset by lower commercial original equipment and software defense volumes. 
Business aviation continues to be very robust, where flight hours have already returned to 2019 levels as a portion of customers that previously traveled commercially have transitioned to business jets for health and safety reasons. We continue to expect the recovery in business travel to lag the leisure travel recovery, however, we do expect to pick up as we enter the second half of the year. 
As expected, air transport flight hours are recovering led by narrow-body flight hours, while wide-bodies remain soft as domestic travel recovers faster than international travel. As a result, our business aviation aftermarket sales were up 90% organically year-over-year, while our air transport aftermarket sales were up 32% year-over-year organically. 
Sequentially, overall commercial aftermarket sales were up 12% from 1Q '21, a promising sign that the recovery is gaining traction. Aerospace segment margin expanded 490 basis points to 25.7%. 
Turning to Building Technologies. Sales were up 13% organically driven by robust demand for building products and solutions. We are seeing broad-based strength across the Building Technologies portfolio and around the world as people return to schools, offices and transportation hubs. 
Building product sales and orders were both up double digits year-over-year driven by demand for fire, security and electrical products as well as building management systems. Orders for Building Solutions projects and services were up over 25% year-over-year, and the services backlog is up more than 30%, positioning the business for future growth. 
In addition, our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions maintained strong customer momentum with approximately $90 million of orders booked in the second quarter for a total of approximately $150 million in the first half. HBT segment margins expanded 120 basis points to 22.4%. 
On to PMT, where sales were up 10% organically, driven by 30% organic growth in Advanced Materials and a return to growth in UOP. PMT had a strong quarter with total orders up 20% year-over-year organically and backlog up mid-single digits. These are encouraging signs for the future of this business. 
The 30% year-over-year growth in Advanced Materials was broad-based, particularly in automotive refrigerants, foam products and specialty additives. In UOP, sales were up 8% organically driven by higher petrochemical catalyst shipments, licensing and equipment volumes. UOP orders were up over 25%, which should drive growth in the second half and into 2022. 
Finally, Process Solutions, down 1% organically, but up 6% sequentially from the first quarter as the recovery gains traction in the oil and gas industry. The year-over-year decline was driven by fewer global mega projects, partially offset by short-cycle strength in the Products and Thermal Solutions businesses as well as demand for our life cycle solutions and services. HPS orders were up high single digits, providing confidence in the oncoming recovery. PMT segment margins expanded 190 basis points to 20.8% in the quarter. 
Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, despite battling some supply shortages, sales were up 35% organically, driven by continued strength across the portfolio, including another quarter of high double-digit organic growth in the Warehouse and Workflow Solutions and Productivity Solutions and Services businesses, which grew 57% and 38%, respectively. Personal Protective Equipment was also up double digits organically as we delivered from our strong backlog. 
In addition, demand accelerated in the short-cycle gas detection and advanced sensing businesses, driving high single-digit sequential sales growth from the first quarter. Orders in Productivity Solutions and Services were up triple digits year-over-year, exhibiting strong ongoing demand, which we expect to fuel second half growth in this business. SPS segment margins expanded 20 basis points in the quarter to 14%. 
Growth across our portfolio was underpinned by progress in the Honeywell Connected Enterprise. Second quarter recurring revenue growth was up double digits, and orders for connected solutions were up over 20% year-over-year as we continue to drive SaaS growth. Our connected buildings and cyber solutions, which have been very strong in the past year, continued to grow double digits organically, and our connected industrial solutions business was up double digits year-over-year as the industrial markets begin to recover. 
So in total for Honeywell, our robust sales growth, coupled with strong pricing and cost management, drove 190 basis points of improvement in segment margins, 10 basis points above the high end of our 2Q guidance despite the mix headwind from much stronger sales in SPS, our lowest margin segment. 
For the quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.02, up 76% -- or excuse me, up $0.76 or 60% year-over-year, $0.06 above the high end of our guidance, $0.04 of which was due to overdelivery on sales and segment profit. The majority of our year-over-year earnings growth, $0.43, was driven by our strong segment profit improvement. 
Below the line items were a $0.25 tailwind driven by lower repositioning and higher pension income, a lower effective tax rate of 23% and lower weighted average share count of 703 million shares drove a $0.06 and $0.02 benefit, respectively. A bridge from 2Q '20 adjusted earnings per share to 2Q '21 adjusted earnings per share can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
On free cash flow, we generated $1.5 billion in the quarter or 17% of sales, resulting in 103% adjusted conversion. Free cash flow was up 17% year-over-year. Free cash flow this quarter includes the $375 million cash received from Garrett as we resolved our contractual claims under the plan of reorganization signed last quarter. As a reminder, we will continue to include cash receipts from Garrett going forward within free cash flow in order to be comparable to prior periods where the cash proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreement were recognized. 
Finally, we strategically deployed $1.9 billion to share repurchases, dividends and CapEx in the second quarter, which significantly exceeded operating cash flow. We paid $664 million in dividends, deployed $185 million in capital expenditures and repurchased more than $1 billion of Honeywell shares, reducing our share count to 703 million.
In all, this was a very strong quarter and caps a successful first half of 2021. We're prudently managing through the multispeed recovery across the portfolio, continuing to make disciplined investments for the future, while meeting or exceeding our financial commitments. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. We entered the third quarter well positioned to manage the multispeed economic recovery, which will be influenced by unique end market and regional dynamics as vaccination rates expand and the global pandemic subsides. 
At a high level, we expect ongoing strength across the portfolio in the second half. We should see acceleration in businesses that were most affected by the downturn, particularly the commercial aerospace aftermarket and the oil and gas-exposed HPS and UOP businesses. We do expect some deceleration in respiratory masks, Warehouse and Workflow Solutions to come down sequentially as large Intelligrated projects complete and lower year-over-year volumes in U.S. and international defense in the back half of the year, though it will grow sequentially from the second quarter. 
With that as a backdrop, we expect third quarter sales to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $8.8 billion, up 7% to 11% on an organic basis. And we now expect full year sales of $34.6 billion to $35.2 billion, up $400 million from the high end of our previous guidance. This represents overall organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 6%, an increase of 1 point on both ends compared to our previous guidance. 
We will talk more about our expectations by segment momentarily. An update on our 2021 end market outlook can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
One area to keep in mind is that we have been facing supply chain constraints as the sourcing environment for direct materials and components such as semiconductors and resin has been very tight. As we mentioned last quarter, we proactively partnered with distributors and alternative suppliers to mitigate these impacts and have had success, but the situation remains very fluid as global supply chains ramp up. We continue to work through this issue, but it will continue to be a constraint on our growth potential, particularly in SPS and HBT and, to a lesser degree, in Aerospace. 
Now let's take a moment to walk through the third quarter and full year expectations by segment. In Aerospace, our commercial aerospace business will continue to improve gradually throughout the year. We expect business aviation aftermarket to continue to lead in the recovery and track 2019 levels or better for the balance of the year. 
We expect air transport flight hours to continue improving in the third and the fourth quarter, driving sequential and year-over-year growth in commercial aftermarket sales. The pace of the air transport acceleration will vary regionally in the second half, with domestic travel recovering faster than international and was difficult to predict country-by-country dynamics tied to vaccinations. We expect narrow-body and wide-body flight hours to fully recover to 2019 levels by 2024. 
Commercial original equipment build rates are progressing gradually as we expected. Second half defense and sales -- Defense & Space sales will be pressured by lower demand from U.S. DoD programs driven by moderating U.S. defense spend as well as by slower-than-expected international defense volumes. As a result of these Defense & Space dynamics, we now expect full year organic sales growth to be down low single digits for the year in Aerospace.
In Building Technologies, we expect ongoing demand in the second half for products, services and projects as business conditions continue to improve as the world reopens. We anticipate broad-based order strength in the third and the fourth quarters, particularly for Building Solutions projects, which we expect will ramp up as energy projects in the government and education verticals gain traction. 
We will continue to execute on our strong projects and services backlog, driving strength in the back half. In addition, we will benefit from continued customer demand for our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions. Overall, we now expect full year organic sales growth to be up mid-single digits for the full year, trending better than expected. 
In PMT, we were encouraged by the signs of recovery in Process Solutions and UOP in the second quarter, and we expect to see this trend continue in the third quarter and beyond. While we expect the pace of recovery to be gradual, end market dynamics in energy are creating a strong setup for 2022 and beyond. 
We anticipate that HPS will return to growth in 3Q, driven by the short-cycle products and service businesses, which should deliver on strong first half orders. We also expect sequential improvement in automation projects driven by backlog execution. 
Orders for global mega projects increased in the second quarter, which is an encouraging sign for the business, though these orders will have a larger impact on 2022. Overall, HPS should grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of the year. 
For UOP, we're pleased with the 2Q outcome, which included strong catalysts and project orders that should drive growth in the second half. Last, we expect continued strength in Advanced Materials in the third quarter, driven by demand for a wide range of the business' products. 
In April, we said that we were trending towards the low end of our plus or minus low single-digit full year growth expectations for PMT. Since then, our outlook has improved, and we now expect full year organic sales to be up low single digits for the year. 
Finally, we anticipate continued strength in SPS driven by another quarter of robust double-digit organic growth in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions and Productivity Solutions and Services. Though we expect year-over-year growth rates to remain strong in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, 2Q represented the high watermark for sales in that business this year as we had previously said. We will see sequential declines in 3Q and 4Q due to normal project timing as customers enter the busy holiday season.  
Our Productivity Solutions and Services backlog is up triple digits, which will drive growth in the third quarter for this business. Distributor demand continues to be strong, and we expect this to continue throughout the second half. So as I mentioned, we will be managing some supply constraints. 
We will continue to execute our backlog of personal protective equipment in the third quarter. However, respiratory demand is decelerating as various regions of the world recover from the pandemic. This deceleration will be partially offset by stronger demand in other areas of our PPE portfolio, including gloves and head and hearing protection, which we expect to ramp-up in the second half. 
Finally, we expect continued short-cycle acceleration in our gas analysis and advanced sensing business. Overall, we expect strong double-digit sales growth in SPS for the full year. 
Now let me turn to our expectations for the other core guided metrics. For third quarter segment margins, we expect to be in the range of 20.3% to 20.6%, resulting in 40 to 70 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. Margins will continue to show strong expansion despite the headwinds of the temporary cost actions from 2020 and our investments in growth of the businesses. 
Third quarter net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $5 million to positive $55 million with a range of repositioning between $50 million and $100 million as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring projects. 
We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% and the average share count to be approximately 703 million shares. As a result, we expect adjusted third quarter earnings per share between $1.97 and $2.02, up 26% to 29% year-over-year. 
Given these third quarter expectations, our strong outperformance in the first half and our continued confidence in our businesses, in addition to raising our full year sales expectations, we are also raising our other full year guided metrics, including segment margins, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. We are raising the low end of our segment margin guidance by 10 basis points for a new range of 20.8% to 21.1%, representing an expansion of 40 to 70 basis points. 
We expect margin expansion in all our segments as we carefully invest back into the business, while managing the multispeed recovery across the portfolio. Our fixed cost management remains a focus, and we are on track to a net increase of $500 million for the year, cementing the permanent reduction of $1 billion of fixed costs from our 2020 cost actions. 
We expect our net below-the-line impact to be in the range of negative $110 million to positive $40 million, including capacity for $400 million to $525 million of repositioning. We continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22%, and we now expect a weighted average share count of approximately 703 million for the year, achieving our minimum 1% reduction in shares. 
As a result, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance. We now expect a range of $7.95 to $8.10, up 12% to 14% year-over-year. This represents an increase of $0.10 on the high end and $0.15 at the midpoint, reflecting our confidence in the recovery across the portfolio. 
Finally, we are raising our free cash flow guidance by $100 million on both ends for a range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. So in total, we delivered a great second quarter and anticipate a strong second half and have significantly upgraded our full year view for sales, segment margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow as we manage through this recovery. 
Let's turn to Page 7 for a quick look at our guidance progression through the year. At the beginning of '21, there was a lot of uncertainty about the virus case rates, the pace of vaccinations and the recovery around the world. We're committed to providing guidance that is commensurate with our level of visibility and the environment we are in at the time. 
In January, with the unknown pace of recovery in mind, we took a pragmatic approach to our outlook. After the first quarter, with a little more visibility into the full year and confidence in our first quarter results, we raised several key guidance metrics. Now halfway through the year, we have raised them again. 
Our full year sales guidance is now $800 million higher than our original guidance on the high end. We've also raised the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance by approximately 23% -- $0.23, and our free cash flow guidance has been raised by $100 million in the high end. As always, you can count on us to provide an outlook that is consistent with our level of visibility. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Darius to talk about the end market tailwinds that we are creating -- excuse me, that are creating a strong setup for 2022 and beyond."
1340740,1673518850,2350464,"Honeywell International Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2021",2021-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Honeywell International Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg.

Current end market macro dynamics are creating the best set of circumstances that I have seen in the last 10-plus years that I've been with Honeywell. With the commercial aerospace recovery in view, upcoming capital reinvestment in the energy sector, nonresidential construction spending returning to 2019 levels and the exponential growth we continue to see in e-commerce, we are setting up for an incredibly strong runway for medium-term growth. This macro setup, coupled with the strategies we have in place that are focused on driving uniquely innovative and differentiated technologies to address the world's increasing demand for digital transformation, process technology and sustainable solutions, gives me great confidence in our outlook for 2022 and beyond. 
Let me start by talking about the medium-term dynamics of some of our key end markets. In commercial aerospace, pent-up demand for leisure and business travel is expected to drive approximately 20% growth in flight hours over the next 2 to 3 years. Business and general aviation flight hours have already recovered to 2019 levels, and we expect air transport narrow-body and wide-body flight hours to recover by 2024. 
We're seeing a slower defense business. We are absorbing that in our strong 2021 outlook, and our growth trajectory for the next 2 years should remain robust. 
The energy markets are gaining traction, and stabilizing oil prices, support an oncoming wave of capital reinvestment in this sector, with downstream customer CapEx expected to grow at a 6.5% compound annual growth rate over the next 3 years. As I said before, the investment cycle post downturn is a consistent theme, and we'll be well positioned to capture our unfair share of it. Acceleration in refining and petrochemical volumes will drive demand for our high-margin catalysts in new greenfield, and brownfield projects over the medium term will drive demand for licensing, engineering and equipment as well as our software and automation solutions. 
Our Building Technologies portfolio will continue to benefit from the ongoing global macro trends of sustainability, digitization and public safety. Building owners are looking for healthy building Solutions to create safe public spaces while optimizing energy consumption and productivity. 
Nonresidential construction is expected to grow by $230 billion to $2.5 trillion by 2024, with refurbishments for healthy building is growing at a high single-digit compound annual growth rate over the next 3 years. We also expect tailwinds from sizable U.S. stimulus programs targeting airports, education and health care as well as potential government infrastructure plans, which will provide a favorable setup for our Building Technologies business. 
We remain very well positioned to address the rapid evolution that we see in the click-and-collect consumer buying behavior, which is creating complex fulfillment and delivery needs. In fact, e-commerce is expected to make up approximately 30% of total retail sales by 2024. 
To meet this growing demand as well as to prepare for intensifying labor shortages, retail -- retailers are meaningfully stepping up investments and workflow technologies and automation, amplifying our already strong trajectory in this market, with a growing installed base and ample runway for high-margin aftermarket opportunities. So you see our macro setup is a strong as it has been in a very long time. 
Now let's turn to the next page. I want to highlight a few of our strategic vectors and how they'll play into our growth algorithm. Let's start with urban air mobility or UAM, one space where we see significant growth opportunity. The total available market will be around $120 billion annually in 2030, of which we are positioned to address $30 billion. 
We have leading flyby wire systems for urban air mobility, avionics and vehicle management systems in addition to highly differentiated, high assurance detect and avoid systems. We have already won $3.4 billion of content and another $1.8 billion of wins pending, and we have $7 billion in projected cumulative pipeline over the next 5 years growing to $55 billion in cumulative pipeline out to 2030. So this is a really exciting business where we are already generating substantial wins with significant future potential. 
We're also generating growth of the Honeywell Connected Enterprise, which is underpinned by Honeywell Forge, our suite of SaaS applications, to drive operational excellence and are essential to day-to-day management of the company's complex operations. Honeywell Connected Enterprise delivered double-digit recurring revenue growth, and orders were up over 20% in the second quarter, which serves as an excellent proof point as we continue to focus on driving software growth. 
We are -- also recently launched a cloud-based connected building solutions jointly developed through our SAP partnership. Our portfolio of connected solutions is demonstrating great momentum with 1 million instances of Tridium's Niagara deployed worldwide and over 5,000 Honeywell Forge OT cybersecurity projects delivered, to name a few examples. 
One of the newest additions to our portfolio, Sparta Systems, is also contributing to Honeywell's software growth with orders up over 30% in the first half of 2021. Sparta's SaaS customer base has grown double digits since year-end 2020, and Sparta ended the second quarter with a backlog of over $100 million. 
Sparta Systems recently announced that a leading European specialty pharmaceutical company implemented TrackWise Digital's solution suite that includes car QMS processes in addition to complaints handling, supplier quality management, document management and training management to seamlessly integrate quality processes and data across its manufacturing operations and suppliers. So the Sparta integration is progressing smoothly, and I'm pleased with the results thus far. 
Finally, we continue to see strong demand for our portfolio of healthy Building Solutions, which I mentioned earlier. We booked around $150 million of healthy building orders in the first half and have a global pipeline of over $2 billion. A few examples of our customer wins across major verticals include the Pittsburgh and San Diego International airports, Syracuse University and Wuhan Changfu Hospital. We anticipate the demand for healthy buildings will remain strong for the foreseeable future as building managers seek to support occupant safety and comfort for returning workers, students, travelers and visitors. 
All 4 of the technologies on this page are proof points for our strategy of focusing R&D and breakthrough initiatives around disruptive trends that will shape the global economy for years to come. We have many other equally exciting breakthroughs, including quantum, sustainable technology solutions and smart cities for as an example. These provide numerous growth vectors, which will be accretive to the recovery in our major end markets, which underpins my confidence in what is to come. 
Now let's wrap up on Slide 10. So overall, we are encouraged by the performance of the first half of 2021. Our second quarter results exceeded our expectations. And given our confidence in our businesses, we have meaningfully raised our full year sales segment margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance. The Honeywell value creation framework continues to set us apart and will continue to deliver for all of our shareholders. 
With that Reena, let's move to Q&A."

One thing that interested me in your comments there, Darius, obviously, the technology stuff is interesting. But the commercialization revenues of $1 billion as soon as 2 years, I wonder if you could kind of talk a little bit about the difference between the 2-year and the 5-year framework there. Is there something in terms of a technical breakthrough, further technical breakthrough that's required? Or it's more an issue of just developing the business model and kind of getting a customer set on board with what you're doing here?"

Well, I think, Jeff, more importantly, it's a toggle between focus on progressing that technology versus focusing on commercialization. This business is generating revenue today for CQC, and it's generating revenue today for Honeywell Quantum Systems. 
And we could focus on energy, our energy on continuing to drive commercialization, but we're trying to be balanced between, yes, driving some commercialization, securing some blue-chip customers but also continue to advance the technology. I mean, this isn't necessarily an instant gratification kind of a business. Because if we just over function to commercialization, although we have a year or 2 lead on just about everybody else in the industry, that could get shortchanged if we don't continue to advance it. 
But I think that's more than anything. So the 2- to 4-year kind of a number is based on both how we see the technology evolving or -- 2 to 5 and also how we see really us focusing on technology progress versus commercialization. And I think we want to maintain both and not necessarily just full toggle to commercialization because I think that, that could sacrifice progress on the technology."

I mean I think our results for Q3 would have easily been $100 million to $200 million harder -- higher than what we're saying because of supply chain constraints. So it is -- we're dealing with the 2. It's a daily battle. 
Some of the areas that we're particularly challenged are semiconductors, resins. Those are probably our top 2, but we're kind of seeing some supply chain pressure across the board. And our orders are super strong, particularly in SPS, and we could easily do $100 million to $200 million more in revenue this quarter in Q3 if we didn't have those challenges. 
So what we projected is kind of a reasonable best estimate of the supply we're going to get based on what our suppliers are committing. But it's a daily battle, and we're -- we've stood up a team on the supply side. We stood up a team on the pricing side to really kind of manage both those things because we're continuing to see inflation. And we're actively managing price, which actually has been a good story as we are able to pass most of that through."

Aero is going to continue to improve. wide-body and narrow-body traffic is going to continue to improve. We absorbed some of the Defense & Space challenges this year, so that's already embedded. And we expect it to normalize. 
So as we look into next year and the year after and the year after, I mean, we are going to be relooking at our growth and margin expansion algorithm as well as -- don't forget, we still have plenty of firepower on the balance sheet, which we plan to deploy.

So as you may have heard within the quarter, I mean, some of our production we basically shut down because when we set it up in a hurry, literally been 30 days when the pandemic struck in April 2020, we didn't optimized for cost, we optimized for speed. And frankly, that wasn't a very high-margin gain for us. We did that because the country needed us to do it. We didn't do it to maximize profit. 
So now when we reduce production, we reduce production in the highly inefficient, highly manual cells that we were -- that we could bring up quickly. But what we replaced that production with is with highly automated cells, which will drop our cost per mask on the range of 50%. So positioning the business for the future is still going to be very, very strong. 
And our IRRs -- and that's assuming there's not a pickup in the future of masks. And as we read more and more about Delta variants that we don't know what's going to happen, but even that IRR is greater than 20%. So better than any other investment. And like I said, this wasn't done to sort of optimize profitability so that we got some revenue. We didn't necessarily get a ton of margin with it. And now we're in a better position because we got production that's done through automation, which will drop our cost profile by about 50% per mask."

Business aviation has been strong, both on the aftermarket as well as the OE side. That's going to continue to progress. So overall, there's -- we have a great deal of optimism for what we're going to see in Aerospace. And the margin performance will be very commensurate with that because some of the wide-body, narrow-body aftermarket revenue is still not kicking in, which, as you know, is going to be some of our highest margin profile.

UOP is a leading indicator of that business. HPS trails UOP orders by anywhere from 12 to 18 months. And UOP orders for the quarter were nearly 30% up, just to give you a perspective. So that's probably the single best data point. 
For overall total, every business was up just about double digits in terms of orders in PMT. Our backlog was up in PMT. So all good signs. The other part that we're starting to see strong level of presence, both for our Honeywell Process Solutions business as well as UOP in some of the renewable projects. 
You probably saw the Wabash Valley announcement around carbon capture, that UOP one. Process Solutions is winning in a lot of the wind farm projects, solar farm projects. So we're shifting focus to where the future is while maintaining our presence in some of our traditional markets. 
And as we know, and we saw this movie before in the '15 and '16 time frame, you can only depress that downstream investment for so long. And we saw that come back strong in '17 and '18. We anticipate the very same thing will happen in '22 and '23. 
And oh, by the way, a lot of these petrochemical refining facilities are going to have to get reconfigured for the future of energy, which is going to be incremental growth which is yet to see.

If you look at our liabilities, which are either dropping or they're secured through other instruments, so we have a very, very different balance sheet that we did even 5 years ago. And we're going to be a bit more comfortable in terms of having a greater level of leverage given the safety of the balance sheet, which actually provides even more potential for capital deployment. 
And I agree with you. I think capital deployment is a big lever. So this kind of goes back to my prior point that I made in the presentation, which is our markets are at a tailwind, and we've got tremendous capacity on our balance sheet. 
This is kind of a rare point in the Honeywell history, where you've got good tailwinds from the markets.

So I would say as we're looking at our margin and backlog, we're not seeing any material challenges to them. It doesn't mean that because we are being able to price these things in, so I wouldn't call that as any like a big change in our profile. But it's something we keep a very strong eye on. 
We talked about in Intelligrated, the projects business. There is lower than the line average for the business overall, and that's part of the hypothesis for the business in general, capture the volume and then follow that through with services and software just as we had done in Process Solutions. 
So I think what we're doing is we're finding success in being able to price with the inflationary environment that we're seeing, and we're going to continue to manage through that, I think, quite well in all of our projects businesses. But it is something to keep an eye on."

We are investing in the businesses, though. And that's, again, part of the reason when we talk about the $1 billion net cost reduction and that $0.5 billion of increase, that is also absorbing some increase in R&D, which is happening in places like Quantum. It's happening in places like Aerospace. It's happening in our Honeywell Connected Enterprise, just to name a few. 
And we continue -- as the environment strengthens commercially, we're going to invest back in the business in terms of sales resources and feet on the street and so on.

We came in 2Q just about where we had expected and that, call it, high 25 type of range. I think we printed something like 25.7%. And I expect you're going to see that just kind of creep up through the third and the fourth quarter as we go forward prospectively and again, more of the aftermarket business starts making its way through the P&L."

I mean the segment that we actually are looking forward to enjoying the benefits from a margin perspective more is just return of flight hours, particularly for wide-bodies and somewhat to narrow-bodies. And we project that will slowly improve. And it's going to be correlated to vaccination rates throughout the world. 
We're seeing traffic pick up. The consumer traffic is strong actually. There's a lot of pent-up traffic demand for international travel. And that's what I said is that as we look at the next 2 to 3 years, it's going to get gradually better and better. And probably if there was a drawback, we absorbed it this year in terms of Defense & Space. And we expect that to normalize next year. 
So that's probably the only segment that we had some concerns about, but that's already reflected in our 2021 guide. And as I said, 2022 and beyond looks better."

Again, as we think about the mix for SPS in particular, that's actually going to improve. I talked about the fact that we hit the peak for this year in terms of the project rollouts and Intelligrated. So that's going to come down a little bit, which will provide a little bit of a mix benefit on the overall profile. 
So I expect to see, again, sequential improvement in margins in the back half of the year in SPS. And again, the same thing being true as we think about PMT ramping up and starting to see what we did here this quarter in terms of the catalyst shipments coming through. 
As Darius highlighted, our UOP backlog is very strong. And so as that begins delivering, particularly around the catalyst side, that brings with it some nice margin accretion. And we've always talked about the fact that you can't look at PMT margins in any 1 quarter as indicative. That moves around a bit with the mix around catalyst. But I do expect that to also improve in the back half of the year as we continue to see that strengthening growth rate. 
So again, that's why we feel very good about where we are right now as we exit the first half, and we look forward to a very good second half of the year and a nice finish. That's why we upgraded our margin range on the low end by the 10 basis points that we did. So I think things are trending nicely across all of the segments."

Let's begin on Slide 2. We delivered another outstanding quarter that exceeded the high end of our second quarter organic sales growth, segment margin and adjusted earnings per share guidance range with top line growth and margin expansion in all 4 segments. 
We delivered organic sales growth of 15% led by double-digit growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions, Honeywell Building Technologies and Advanced Materials and Performance Materials and Technologies. We also returned to growth in the commercial aerospace aftermarket and UOP amid promising signs of recovery in the oil and gas and aerospace markets. 
Segment margin expanded 190 basis points to 20.4% driven by the impact of higher sales volumes. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.02, up 60% year-over-year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range. 
We delivered a strong second quarter in the first half of the year. I'm pleased with our performance and confident it will continue to execute and deliver through the ongoing recovery in our end markets. We are driving near-term growth in several areas of the portfolio, including Warehouse Automation, Productivity Solutions, Building Products and Advanced Materials, while the industries most affected by the pandemic will continue improving throughout the year and into 2022. 
Orders were up over 20% year-over-year organically driven by strength in Aerospace, PMT, HBT and Productivity Solutions, creating a strong setup for growth. As always, we continue to execute on our rigorous and proven operating system that drives outstanding shareholder value. 
Now let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss our recent leadership announcements. Last week, we announced changes to our senior leadership team that will take place over the coming weeks and months. Honeywell's consistent success is driven by our highly talented and committed workforce, which is guided by our world-class leadership team. 
We have a deep bench of high-quality capable leaders as demonstrated by the recent announcements. First, Vimal Kapur will succeed Rajeev Gautam as President and CEO of Performance Materials and Technologies. Rajeev will retire in August after 43 years of Honeywell and will serve as President Emeritus of Honeywell PMT until the end of January to ensure a smooth transition. Rajeev has led PMT for the past 5 years and guided the business through a deep industry downturn in 2020 with an unwavering focus on taking care of employees and customers. We greatly appreciate Rajeev's exemplary leadership over the past 4 decades. 
Vimal will transition to PMT from his prior role as President and CEO of Honeywell Building Technologies. He has been with Honeywell for 32 years and brings outstanding leadership capabilities and a deep knowledge of our end markets to the PMT CEO role. This will mark Vimal's return to PMT, where he was previously President of Process Solutions business. 
Doug Wright will succeed Vimal as President and CEO of HBT. Doug joined Honeywell in July 2020 as President of HBT's Fire and Security business. Bringing deep industry experience, he has quickly made a significant impact. Prior to joining Honeywell, Doug was President and CEO of Source Photonics, a global provider of optical communications products used in telecommunication systems and data communication networks. Prior to that, Doug spent 6 years at United Technologies, where he served as President of Asia for the company's Fire and Security business based in Shanghai and President of the company's $2.5 billion Automation and Control Solutions business. 
Finally, Ben Driggs has been named Chief Operating Officer of Global High Growth Regions and will succeed Shane Tedjarati as President, Global High Growth Regions when Shane retires at the end of 2021 after 17 years with Honeywell. Shane has played an essential role in establishing and aggressively growing Honeywell's presence in high-growth regions, and we appreciate everything he has done to make Honeywell a truly global company. Shane will remain in an advisory capacity over the next 3 years. 
Ben has been with Honeywell for more than 16 years and brings a wealth of global experience to his new role as COO of Global High Growth Regions. Most recently, Ben was Vice President of Global Strategic Accounts, where he was responsible for all aspects of our relationships with key customers at a global level. Prior to this role, Ben served in a variety of positions with Honeywell, including President of Americas Aerospace, President of Honeywell Latin America and Vice President of Aerospace Asia Pacific. 
I'd like to thank Rajeev and Shane for the numerous contributions they made to Honeywell over their highly productive careers. I'd also like to congratulate Vimal, Doug and Ben under new roles. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 and talk about another exciting recent announcement. The combination of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum Computing or CQC forms the largest, most advanced standalone quantum computing company in the world. Honeywell's H-series quantum computer offers the world's highest demonstrated quantum volume of 1,024, and CQC has the first and most advanced quantum operating system. Together, they create a unique, full-stack quantum player in a league of its own. 
Quantum computing will absolutely remain a key breakthrough initiative for Honeywell. We will own a majority of the stake in the new company of commensurate governance rights and will have a long-term agreement to help manufacture the critical ion traps needed to power the company's quantum hardware. 
Honeywell's business will also continue serving as a proving ground for the company's quantum offerings. The combination of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and CQC is essential to advancing the value that Quantum Solutions provide to customers. To advance this value, the new company will codevelop integrated quantum hardware and software solutions to enable a one-stop shop for quantum customers. 
Additionally, the focus will be on developing hardware-agnostic software solutions and a unique quantum operating system, which is optimized for the quantum hardware on which it is used. These technologies will support customer needs for improved computation in diverse areas, including cybersecurity, drug discovery and delivery, material science, finance and optimization across all major industrial markets. 
We're already working with global customers to deliver solutions for markets with massive scalable commercialization opportunity, including JPMorgan, BMW, Samsung, Google, DHL and many others. 
The combined company holds over 150 technical patents and will have a staff of approximately 330 people, which is the largest pool of quantum talent in the world, more than 120 of whom hold doctorates and over 200 of whom are scientists, including some of the world's leading quantum computing experts. 
The long-term financial prospects of the new companies are substantial. The combination is expected to significantly accelerate the path to commercial scale, creating the potential for approximately $1 billion in sales within 2 to 5 years. We are excited about the new company's prospects, and we expect to continue to be a global quantum computing leader, shaping the future of what is projected to become a $1 trillion industry over the next 30 years. 
Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 5 to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and to provide an update on our 2021 outlook."

As Darius highlighted, we had a very strong second quarter with sales up 15% organically to $8.8 billion, segment margin expansion of 190 basis points to 20.4% and free cash flow of $1.5 billion. We overdelivered on our commitments again, building on the strong start we had in Q1. 
Let's take a minute to discuss how each of the segments contributed to that. Starting with Aerospace, second quarter sales were up 7% organically as flight hours continued to improve, resulting in double-digit commercial aerospace aftermarket growth. That was partially offset by lower commercial original equipment and software defense volumes. 
Business aviation continues to be very robust, where flight hours have already returned to 2019 levels as a portion of customers that previously traveled commercially have transitioned to business jets for health and safety reasons. We continue to expect the recovery in business travel to lag the leisure travel recovery. However, we do expect to pick up as we enter the second half of the year. 
As expected, air transport flight hours are recovering led by narrow-body flight hours, while wide-bodies remain soft as domestic travel recovers faster than international travel. As a result, our business aviation aftermarket sales were up 90% organically year-over-year, while our air transport aftermarket sales were up 32% year-over-year organically. 
Sequentially, overall commercial aftermarket sales were up 12% from 1Q '21, a promising sign that the recovery is gaining traction. Aerospace segment margin expanded 490 basis points to 25.7%. 
Turning to Building Technologies. Sales were up 13% organically driven by robust demand for building products and solutions. We are seeing broad-based strength across the Building Technologies portfolio and around the world as people return to schools, offices and transportation hubs. 
Building product sales and orders were both up double digits year-over-year driven by demand for fire, security and electrical products as well as building management systems. Orders for Building Solutions projects and services were up over 25% year-over-year, and the services backlog is up more than 30%, positioning the business for future growth. 
In addition, our portfolio of healthy building solutions maintained strong customer momentum with approximately $90 million of orders booked in the second quarter for a total of approximately $150 million in the first half. HBT segment margins expanded 120 basis points to 22.4%. 
On to PMT, where sales were up 10% organically, driven by 30% organic growth in Advanced Materials and a return to growth in UOP. PMT had a strong quarter with total orders up 20% year-over-year organically and backlog up mid-single digits. These are encouraging signs for the future of this business. 
The 30% year-over-year growth in Advanced Materials was broad-based, particularly in automotive refrigerants, foam products and specialty additives. 
In UOP, sales were up 8% organically driven by higher petrochemical catalyst shipments, licensing and equipment volumes. UOP orders were up over 25%, which should drive growth in the second half and into 2022. 
Finally, Process Solutions, down 1% organically but up 6% sequentially from the first quarter as the recovery gains traction in the oil and gas industry. The year-over-year decline was driven by fewer global mega projects, partially offset by short-cycle strength in the Products and Thermal Solutions businesses as well as demand for our life cycle solutions and services. HPS orders were up high single digits, providing confidence in the oncoming recovery. PMT segment margins expanded 190 basis points to 20.8% in the quarter. 
Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, despite battling some supply shortages, sales were up 35% organically driven by continued strength across the portfolio, including another quarter of high double-digit organic growth in the Warehouse and Workflow Solutions and Productivity Solutions and Services businesses, which grew 57% and 38%, respectively. Personal Protective Equipment was also up double digits organically as we delivered from our strong backlog. 
In addition, demand accelerated in the short-cycle gas detection and advanced sensing businesses, driving high single-digit sequential sales growth from the first quarter. Orders in Productivity Solutions and Services were up triple digits year-over-year, exhibiting strong ongoing demand, which we expect to fuel second half growth in this business. SPS segment margins expanded 20 basis points in the quarter to 14%. 
Growth across our portfolio was underpinned by progress in the Honeywell Connected Enterprise. Second quarter recurring revenue growth was up double digits, and orders for connected solutions were up over 20% year-over-year as we continue to drive SaaS growth. Our connected buildings and cyber solutions, which have been very strong in the past year, continued to grow double digits organically, and our connected industrial solutions business was up double digits year-over-year as the industrial markets begin to recover. 
So in total for Honeywell, our robust sales growth, coupled with strong pricing and cost management, drove 190 basis points of improvement in segment margins, 10 basis points above the high end of our 2Q guidance despite the mix headwind from much stronger sales in SPS, our lowest margin segment. 
For the quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.02, up 76% -- or excuse me, up $0.76 or 60% year-over-year, $0.06 above the high end of our guidance, $0.04 of which was due to overdelivery on sales and segment profit. The majority of our year-over-year earnings growth, $0.43, was driven by our strong segment profit improvement. 
Below the line items were a $0.25 tailwind driven by lower repositioning and higher pension income, a lower effective tax rate of 23% and lower weighted average share count of 703 million shares drove a $0.06 and $0.02 benefit, respectively. A bridge from 2Q '20 adjusted earnings per share to 2Q '21 adjusted earnings per share can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
On free cash flow, we generated $1.5 billion in the quarter or 17% of sales, resulting in 103% adjusted conversion. Free cash flow was up 17% year-over-year. Free cash flow this quarter includes the $375 million cash received from Garrett as we resolved our contractual claims under the plan of reorganization signed last quarter. As a reminder, we will continue to include cash receipts from Garrett going forward within free cash flow in order to be comparable to prior periods where the cash proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreement were recognized. 
Finally, we strategically deployed $1.9 billion to share repurchases, dividends and CapEx in the second quarter, which significantly exceeded operating cash flow. We paid $664 million in dividends, deployed $185 million in capital expenditures and repurchased more than $1 billion of Honeywell shares, reducing our share count to 703 million. 
In all, this was a very strong quarter and caps a successful first half of 2021. We're prudently managing through the multispeed recovery across the portfolio, continuing to make disciplined investments for the future, while meeting or exceeding our financial commitments. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. We entered the third quarter well positioned to manage the multispeed economic recovery, which will be influenced by unique end market and regional dynamics as vaccination rates expand and the global pandemic subsides. 
At a high level, we expect ongoing strength across the portfolio in the second half. We should see acceleration in businesses that were most affected by the downturn, particularly the commercial aerospace aftermarket and the oil and gas-exposed HPS and UOP businesses. We do expect some deceleration in respiratory masks, Warehouse and Workflow Solutions to come down sequentially as large Intelligrated projects complete and lower year-over-year volumes in U.S. and international defense in the back half of the year, though it will grow sequentially from the second quarter. 
With that as a backdrop, we expect third quarter sales to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $8.8 billion, up 7% to 11% on an organic basis. And we now expect full year sales of $34.6 billion to $35.2 billion, up $400 million from the high end of our previous guidance. This represents overall organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 6%, an increase of 1 point on both ends compared to our previous guidance. 
We will talk more about our expectations by segment momentarily. An update on our 2021 end market outlook can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
One area to keep in mind is that we have been facing supply chain constraints as the sourcing environment for direct materials and components such as semiconductors and resin has been very tight. As we mentioned last quarter, we proactively partnered with distributors and alternative suppliers to mitigate these impacts and have had success, but the situation remains very fluid as global supply chains ramp up. We continue to work through this issue, but it will continue to be a constraint on our growth potential, particularly in SPS and HBT and, to a lesser degree, in Aerospace. 
Now let's take a moment to walk through the third quarter and full year expectations by segment. In Aerospace, our commercial aerospace business will continue to improve gradually throughout the year. We expect business aviation aftermarket to continue to lead in the recovery and track 2019 levels or better for the balance of the year. 
We expect air transport flight hours to continue improving in the third and the fourth quarter, driving sequential and year-over-year growth in commercial aftermarket sales. The pace of the air transport acceleration will vary regionally in the second half, with domestic travel recovering faster than international and was difficult to predict country-by-country dynamics tied to vaccinations. We expect narrow-body and wide-body flight hours to fully recover to 2019 levels by 2024. 
Commercial original equipment build rates are progressing gradually as we expected. Second half defense and sales -- Defense & Space sales will be pressured by lower demand from U.S. DoD programs driven by moderating U.S. defense spend as well as by slower-than-expected international defense volumes. As a result of these Defense & Space dynamics, we now expect full year organic sales growth to be down low single digits for the year in Aerospace. 
In Building Technologies, we expect ongoing demand in the second half for products, services and projects as business conditions continue to improve as the world reopens. We anticipate broad-based order strength in the third and the fourth quarters, particularly for Building Solutions projects, which we expect will ramp up as energy projects in the government and education verticals gain traction. 
We will continue to execute on our strong projects and services backlog, driving strength in the back half. In addition, we will benefit from continued customer demand for our portfolio of healthy building solutions. Overall, we now expect full year organic sales growth to be up mid-single digits for the full year, trending better than expected. 
In PMT, we were encouraged by the signs of recovery in Process Solutions and UOP in the second quarter, and we expect to see this trend continue in the third quarter and beyond. While we expect the pace of recovery to be gradual, end market dynamics in energy are creating a strong setup for 2022 and beyond. 
We anticipate that HPS will return to growth in 3Q driven by the short-cycle products and service businesses, which should deliver on strong first half orders. We also expect sequential improvement in automation projects driven by backlog execution. 
Orders for global mega projects increased in the second quarter, which is an encouraging sign for the business, though these orders will have a larger impact on 2022. Overall, HPS should grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of the year. 
For UOP, we're pleased with the 2Q outcome, which included strong catalysts and project orders that should drive growth in the second half. Last, we expect continued strength in Advanced Materials in the third quarter driven by demand for a wide range of the business' products. 
In April, we said that we were trending towards the low end of our plus or minus low single-digit full year growth expectations for PMT. Since then, our outlook has improved, and we now expect full year organic sales to be up low single digits for the year. 
Finally, we anticipate continued strength in SPS driven by another quarter of robust double-digit organic growth in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions and Productivity Solutions and Services. Though we expect year-over-year growth rates to remain strong in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, 2Q represented the high watermark for sales in that business this year as we had previously said. We will see sequential declines in 3Q and 4Q due to normal project timing as customers enter the busy holiday season. 
Our Productivity Solutions and Services backlog is up triple digits, which will drive growth in the third quarter for this business. Distributor demand continues to be strong, and we expect this to continue throughout the second half. So as I mentioned, we will be managing some supply constraints. 
We will continue to execute our backlog of personal protective equipment in the third quarter. However, respiratory demand is decelerating as various regions of the world recover from the pandemic. This deceleration will be partially offset by stronger demand in other areas of our PPE portfolio, including gloves and head and hearing protection, which we expect to ramp up in the second half. 
Finally, we expect continued short-cycle acceleration in our gas analysis and advanced sensing business. Overall, we expect strong double-digit sales growth in SPS for the full year. 
Now let me turn to our expectations for the other core guided metrics. For third quarter segment margins, we expect to be in the range of 20.3% to 20.6%, resulting in 40 to 70 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. Margins will continue to show strong expansion despite the headwinds of the temporary cost actions from 2020 and our investments in growth of the businesses. 
Third quarter net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $5 million to positive $55 million with a range of repositioning between $50 million and $100 million as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring projects. 
We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% and the average share count to be approximately 703 million shares. As a result, we expect adjusted third quarter earnings per share between $1.97 and $2.02, up 26% to 29% year-over-year. 
Given these third quarter expectations, our strong outperformance in the first half and our continued confidence in our businesses, in addition to raising our full year sales expectations, we are also raising our other full year guided metrics, including segment margins, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. We are raising the low end of our segment margin guidance by 10 basis points for a new range of 20.8% to 21.1%, representing an expansion of 40 to 70 basis points. 
We expect margin expansion in all our segments as we carefully invest back into the business while managing the multispeed recovery across the portfolio. Our fixed cost management remains a focus, and we are on track to a net increase of $500 million for the year, cementing the permanent reduction of $1 billion of fixed costs from our 2020 cost actions. 
We expect our net below-the-line impact to be in the range of negative $110 million to positive $40 million, including capacity for $400 million to $525 million of repositioning. We continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22%, and we now expect a weighted average share count of approximately 703 million for the year, achieving our minimum 1% reduction in shares. 
As a result, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance. We now expect a range of $7.95 to $8.10, up 12% to 14% year-over-year. This represents an increase of $0.10 on the high end and $0.15 at the midpoint, reflecting our confidence in the recovery across the portfolio. 
Finally, we are raising our free cash flow guidance by $100 million on both ends for a range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. 
So in total, we delivered a great second quarter and anticipate a strong second half and have significantly upgraded our full year view for sales, segment margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow as we manage through this recovery. 
Let's turn to Page 7 for a quick look at our guidance progression through the year. At the beginning of '21, there was a lot of uncertainty about the virus case rates, the pace of vaccinations and the recovery around the world. We're committed to providing guidance that is commensurate with our level of visibility and the environment we are in at the time. 
In January, with the unknown pace of recovery in mind, we took a pragmatic approach to our outlook. After the first quarter, with a little more visibility into the full year and confidence in our first quarter results, we raised several key guidance metrics. Now halfway through the year, we have raised them again. 
Our full year sales guidance is now $800 million higher than our original guidance on the high end. We've also raised the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance by approximately 23% -- $0.23, and our free cash flow guidance has been raised by $100 million in the high end. As always, you can count on us to provide an outlook that is consistent with our level of visibility. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Darius to talk about the end market tailwinds that we are creating -- excuse me, that are creating a strong setup for 2022 and beyond."

Current end market macro dynamics are creating the best set of circumstances that I have seen in the last 10-plus years that I've been with Honeywell. With the commercial aerospace recovery in view, upcoming capital reinvestment in the energy sector, nonresidential construction spending returning to 2019 levels and the exponential growth we continue to see in e-commerce, we are setting up for an incredibly strong runway for medium-term growth. This macro setup, coupled with the strategies we have in place that are focused on driving uniquely innovative and differentiated technologies to address the world's increasing demand for digital transformation, process technology and sustainable solutions, gives me great confidence in our outlook for 2022 and beyond. 
Let me start by talking about the medium-term dynamics of some of our key end markets. In commercial aerospace, pent-up demand for leisure and business travel is expected to drive approximately 20% growth in flight hours over the next 2 to 3 years. Business and general aviation flight hours have already recovered to 2019 levels, and we expect air transport narrow-body and wide-body flight hours to recover by 2024. 
We're seeing a slower defense business. We are absorbing that in our strong 2021 outlook, and our growth trajectory for the next 2 years should remain robust. 
The energy markets are gaining traction, and stabilizing oil prices support an oncoming wave of capital reinvestment in this sector, with downstream customer CapEx expected to grow at a 6.5% compound annual growth rate over the next 3 years. As I said before, the investment cycle post downturn is a consistent theme, and we'll be well positioned to capture our unfair share of it. 
Acceleration in refining and petrochemical volumes will drive demand for our high-margin catalysts in new greenfield, and brownfield projects over the medium term will drive demand for licensing, engineering and equipment as well as our software and automation solutions. 
Our Building Technologies portfolio will continue to benefit from the ongoing global macro trends of sustainability, digitization and public safety. Building owners are looking for healthy building solutions to create safe public spaces while optimizing energy consumption and productivity.
Nonresidential construction is expected to grow by $230 billion to $2.5 trillion by 2024, with refurbishments for healthy building is growing at a high single-digit compound annual growth rate over the next 3 years. We also expect tailwinds from sizable U.S. stimulus programs targeting airports, education and health care as well as potential government infrastructure plans, which will provide a favorable setup for our Building Technologies business. 
We remain very well positioned to address the rapid evolution that we see in the click-and-collect consumer buying behavior, which is creating complex fulfillment and delivery needs. In fact, e-commerce is expected to make up approximately 30% of total retail sales by 2024. 
To meet this growing demand as well as to prepare for intensifying labor shortages, retail -- retailers are meaningfully stepping up investments in workflow technologies and automation, amplifying our already strong trajectory in this market with a growing installed base and ample runway for high-margin aftermarket opportunities. So you see our macro setup is as strong as it has been in a very long time. 
Now let's turn to the next page. I want to highlight a few of our strategic vectors and how they'll play into our growth algorithm. Let's start with urban air mobility or UAM, one space where we see significant growth opportunity. The total available market will be around $120 billion annually in 2030, of which we are positioned to address $30 billion. 
We have leading fly-by-wire systems for urban air mobility, avionics and vehicle management systems in addition to highly differentiated, high-assurance detect and avoid systems. We have already won $3.4 billion of content and another $1.8 billion of wins pending. And we have $7 billion in projected cumulative pipeline over the next 5 years growing to $55 billion in cumulative pipeline out to 2030. So this is a really exciting business, where we are already generating substantial wins with significant future potential. 
We're also generating growth through the Honeywell Connected Enterprise, which is underpinned by Honeywell Forge, our suite of SaaS applications that drive operational excellence and are essential to day-to-day management of the company's complex operations. Honeywell Connected Enterprise delivered double-digit recurring revenue growth, and orders were up over 20% in the second quarter, which serves as an excellent proof point as we continue to focus on driving software growth. 
We are -- also recently launched a cloud-based connected building solutions jointly developed through our SAP partnership. Our portfolio of connected solutions is demonstrating great momentum with 1 million instances of Tridium's Niagara deployed worldwide and over 5,000 Honeywell Forge OT cybersecurity projects delivered, to name a few examples. 
One of the newest additions to our portfolio, Sparta Systems, is also contributing to Honeywell's software growth with orders up over 30% in the first half of 2021. Sparta's SaaS customer base has grown double digits since year-end 2020, and Sparta ended the second quarter with a backlog of over $100 million. 
Sparta Systems recently announced that a leading European specialty pharmaceutical company implemented TrackWise Digital's solution suite that includes car QMS processes in addition to complaints handling, supplier quality management, document management and training management to seamlessly integrate quality processes and data across its manufacturing operations and suppliers. So the Sparta integration is progressing smoothly, and I'm pleased with the results thus far. 
Finally, we continue to see strong demand for our portfolio of healthy building solutions, which I mentioned earlier. We booked around $150 million of healthy building orders in the first half and have a global pipeline of over $2 billion. 
A few examples of our customer wins across major verticals include the Pittsburgh and San Diego International airports, Syracuse University and Wuhan Changfu Hospital. We anticipate the demand for healthy buildings will remain strong for the foreseeable future as building managers seek to support occupant safety and comfort for returning workers, students, travelers and visitors. 
All 4 of the technologies on this page are proof points for our strategy of focusing R&D and breakthrough initiatives around disruptive trends that will shape the global economy for years to come. We have many other equally exciting breakthroughs, including quantum, sustainable technology solutions and smart cities for -- as an example. These provide numerous growth vectors, which will be accretive to the recovery in our major end markets, which underpins my confidence in what is to come. 
Now let's wrap up on Slide 10. So overall, we are encouraged by the performance of the first half of 2021. Our second quarter results exceeded our expectations. And given our confidence in our businesses, we have meaningfully raised our full year sales, segment margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance. The Honeywell value creation framework continues to set us apart and will continue to deliver for all of our shareholders. 
With that Reena, let's move to Q&A."

One thing that interested me in your comments there, Darius, obviously, the technology stuff is interesting. But the commercialization revenues of $1 billion as soon as 2 years, I wonder if you could kind of talk a little bit about the difference between the 2-year and the 5-year framework there. Is there something in terms of a technical breakthrough, further technical breakthrough that's required? Or it's more an issue of just developing the business model and kind of getting a customer set on board with what you're doing here?"

Well, I think, Jeff, more importantly, it's a toggle between focus on progressing that technology versus focusing on commercialization. This business is generating revenue today for CQC, and it's generating revenue today for Honeywell Quantum Systems. And we could focus on energy -- our energy on continuing to drive commercialization. 
But we're trying to be balanced between, yes, driving some commercialization, securing some blue-chip customers but also continue to advance the technology. I mean this isn't necessarily an instant gratification kind of a business because if we just over function to commercialization, although we have a year or 2 lead on just about everybody else in the industry, that could get shortchanged if we don't continue to advance it. 
But I think that's more than anything. So the 2- to 4-year kind of a number is based on both how we see the technology evolving -- or 2 to 5 and also how we see really us focusing on technology progress versus commercialization. And I think we want to maintain both and not necessarily just full toggle to commercialization because I think that, that could sacrifice progress on the technology."

I mean I think our results for Q3 would have easily been $100 million to $200 million harder -- higher than what we're saying because of supply chain constraints. 
So it is -- we're dealing with the 2. It's a daily battle. Some of the areas that were particularly challenged are semiconductors, resins. Those are probably our top 2, but we're kind of seeing some supply chain pressure across the board. And our orders are super strong, particularly in SPS. And we could easily do $100 million to $200 million more in revenue this quarter in Q3 if we didn't have those challenges. 
So what we projected is kind of a reasonable best estimate of the supply we're going to get based on what our suppliers are committing. But it's a daily battle, and we're -- we stood up a team on the supply side. We stood up a team on the pricing side to really kind of manage both those things because we're continuing to see inflation. And we're actively managing price, which actually has been a good story as we are able to pass most of that through."

Aero is going to continue to improve. Wide-body and narrow-body traffic is going to continue to improve. We absorbed some of the Defense & Space challenges this year, so that's already embedded. And we expect it to normalize. 
So as we look into next year and the year after and the year after, I mean, we are going to be relooking at our growth and margin expansion algorithm as well as -- don't forget, we still have plenty of firepower on the balance sheet, which we plan to deploy.

So as you may have heard within the quarter, I mean, some of our production we basically shut down because when we set it up in a hurry, literally within 30 days when the pandemic struck in April 2020, we didn't optimize for cost, we optimized for speed. And frankly, that wasn't a very high-margin gain for us. We did that because the country needed us to do it. We didn't do it to maximize profit. 
So now when we reduce production, we reduce production in the highly inefficient, highly manual cells that we were -- that we could bring up quickly. But what we replaced that production with is with highly automated cells, which will drop our cost per mask on the range of 50%. So positioning the business for the future is still going to be very, very strong. 
And our IRRs -- and that's assuming there's not a pickup in the future of masks. And as we read more and more about Delta variants that we don't know what's going to happen, but even that IRR is greater than 20%. So better than any other investment. 
And like I said, this wasn't done to sort of optimize profitability so that we got some revenue. We didn't necessarily get a ton of margin with it. And now we're in a better position because we got production that's done through automation, which will drop our cost profile by about 50% per mask."

So overall, there's -- we have a great deal of optimism for what we're going to see in Aerospace. And the margin performance will be very commensurate with that because some of the wide-body, narrow-body aftermarket revenue is still not kicking in, which, as you know, is going to be some of our highest margin profile.

UOP is a leading indicator of that business. HPS trails UOP orders by anywhere from 12 to 18 months. And UOP orders for the quarter were nearly 30% up, just to give you a perspective. So that's probably the single best data point. For overall total, every business was up just about double digits in terms of orders in PMT. Our backlog was up in PMT. So all good signs. 
The other part that we're starting to see strong level of presence, both for our Honeywell Process Solutions business as well as UOP, in some of the renewable projects. You probably saw the Wabash Valley announcement around carbon capture that UOP one. Process Solutions is winning in a lot of the wind farm projects, solar farm projects. 
So we're shifting focus to where the future is while maintaining our presence in some of our traditional markets. And as we know, and we saw this movie before in the '15 and '16 time frame, you can only depress that downstream investment for so long. And we saw that come back strong in '17 and '18. We anticipate the very same thing will happen in '22 and '23. 
And oh, by the way, a lot of these petrochemical refining facilities are going to have to get reconfigured for the future of energy, which is going to be incremental growth, which is yet to see. So we're actually very, very bullish on that market, and it's being reflected today in some of our order rates."

You saw that in the first half of the year with some of what we've done with Sparta and Fiplex. And you can imagine, quantum is essentially an M&A deal, if you will, in terms of the $200 million, $300 million that we're going to be plowing into that here, and that will happen as we close out on that combination. So we're very excited about using our balance sheet to drive M&A and add accretive business to our portfolio."

If you look at our liabilities, which are either dropping or they're secured through other instruments, so we have a very, very different balance sheet that we did even 5 years ago. And we're going to be a bit more comfortable in terms of having a greater level of leverage given the safety of the balance sheet, which actually provides even more potential for capital deployment. 
And I agree with you. I think capital deployment is a big lever. So this kind of goes back to my prior point that I made in the presentation, which is our markets are at a tailwind, and we've got tremendous capacity on our balance sheet. 
This is kind of a rare point in the Honeywell history, where you've got good tailwinds from the markets. I talked about our strategies are working, and we've got a lot of deployment capacity on the balance sheet. I don't think there's been a better time to really -- for our position then than now."

So maybe first on the pricing side, as Darius mentioned in some of his comments, that's something that we have always and continue to have a very strong eye on. And so everywhere in our books of business that we can, we continue to pass-through the inflation that's being seen and the materials and also in the labor because in the projects businesses, labor is also important as well. 
So I would say as we're looking at our margin and backlog, we're not seeing any material challenges to them. It doesn't mean that because we are being able to price these things in, so I wouldn't call that as any like a big change in our profile. But it's something we keep a very strong eye on. 
We talked about in Intelligrated, the projects business. There is lower than the line average for the business overall, and that's part of the hypothesis for the business in general. Capture the volume and then follow that through with services and software just as we had done in Process Solutions. 
So I think what we're doing is we're finding success in being able to price with the inflationary environment that we're seeing, and we're going to continue to manage through that, I think, quite well in all of our projects businesses. But it is something to keep an eye on."

And if you think about the return to things like travel and the cost that comes along with T&E, I mean, we're just now in the second quarter starting to get the organization back out on the street to see customers and to go visit our businesses. 
So I would say you're still going to see another step-up here in the third quarter in terms of the return of those temporary costs. And then the majority of those will be gone. There'll still be a little bit to trickle in, in 4Q, but third quarter is still yet to come. 
We are investing in the businesses, though. And that's, again, part of the reason when we talk about the $1 billion net cost reduction and that $0.5 billion of increase. That is also absorbing some increase in R&D, which is happening in places like quantum. It's happening in places like aerospace. It's happening in our Honeywell Connected Enterprise, just to name a few. 
And we continue -- as the environment strengthens commercially, we're going to invest back in the business in terms of sales resources and feet on the street and so on. So we have a lot of confidence in being able to deliver the year with the net $0.5 billion increase that we talked about, and that is going to encompass both the temporary cost return and some additional investments."

We're seeing traffic pick up. The consumer traffic is strong actually. There's a lot of pent-up traffic demand for international travel. And that's what I said is that as we look at the next 2 to 3 years, it's going to get gradually better and better. And probably if there was a drawback, we absorbed it this year in terms of Defense & Space. And we expect that to normalize next year.

So I expect to see, again, sequential improvement in margins in the back half of the year in SPS. And again, the same thing being true as we think about PMT ramping up and starting to see what we did here this quarter in terms of the catalyst shipments coming through. 
As Darius highlighted, our UOP backlog is very strong. And so as that begins delivering, particularly around the catalyst side, that brings with it some nice margin accretion. We've always talked about the fact that you can't look at PMT margins in any 1 quarter as indicative. That moves around a bit with the mix around catalyst. But I do expect that to also improve in the back half of the year as we continue to see that strengthening growth rate. 
So again, that's why we feel very good about where we are right now as we exit the first half, and we look forward to a very good second half of the year and a nice finish. That's why we upgraded our margin range on the low end by the 10 basis points that we did. So I think things are trending nicely across all of the segments."

Let's begin on Slide 2. Our outstanding discipline and execution enabled us to deliver third quarter results that met or exceeded our financial guidance in an increasingly challenging environment. We achieved",814,"Thank you, Reena, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. Our outstanding discipline and execution enabled us to deliver third quarter results that met or exceeded our financial guidance in an increasingly challenging environment. We achieved the high end of our third quarter adjusted earnings per share guidance range and exceeded the high end of our segment margin guidance by 60 basis points despite significant headwinds from inflation, and supply chain constraints, which tampered down our top line growth potential. 
Despite that, organic sales were up 8% year-over-year driven by double-digit organic growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions, the commercial aerospace aftermarket from Advanced Materials and UOP. Segment margin expanded 130 basis points to 21.2% driven by strong actions that we took across the portfolio to address the headwinds we faced from inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. 
Specifically, we've continued to operate our strong productivity playbook. We took swift pricing action that allowed us to stay ahead of the inflation curve. We drove a 4% increase year-over-year in -- on the top line and yielded approximately 40 basis points of margin expansion net of inflation. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $2.02, up 29% year-over-year, achieving the high end of our guidance range. We delivered a strong third quarter despite a volatile backdrop that included a hurricane in our PMT factory corridor, power blackouts in China and the persistent and ongoing impacts on the supply chain more broadly. 
I am pleased of our disciplined execution, which enabled us to navigate the challenges in the macroeconomic environment and capitalize on the ongoing recovery in our end markets. I continue to be encouraged by the strength we are seeing in many areas of our portfolio. 
Orders across Honeywell are up high single digits year-over-year organic excluding the impact of COVID-related mask business, which has seen significant demand decline since the pandemic has been subsiding. Orders across Honeywell were up double digits year-over-year. Backlog was up 7% to $27.5 billion and up 9%, excluding the impact of COVID mask orders, driven by strength in many of our segments and positioning us to deliver next phase of the recovery as we head into 2022. As always, we continue to execute on our rigorous and proven value creation framework that drives outstanding shareholder value. 
Now let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss some of our exciting recent announcements. Last month, United Airlines and Honeywell announced a joint multimillion dollar investment in Alder Fuels, powering the biggest sustainable fuel agreement in aviation history. Alder Fuels is a clean tech company that is pioneering first-of-its-kind technologies from producing sustainable aviation fuel or SAF at scale. 
When used together across the fuel life cycle, the Alder technologies, coupled with Honeywell's Ecofining process, have the ability to produce a carbon-negative alternative to today's jet fuels. As part of the agreement, United is committing to purchase 1.5 billion gallons of SAF when produced to United's requirement, which is 1.5x the size of the known purchase commitments of all global airlines combined, making this easily the largest publicly announced SAF agreement in aviation history and demonstrating the power of Honeywell technologies continue to bring to the oncoming global energy transition. 
We also recently announced the acquisition of Performix, a provider of manufacturing execution system or MES software for the pharmaceutical manufacturing and biotech industries. This acquisition builds on our strategy to create the world's leading integrated software platform for customers within the life sciences industry who are striving to achieve faster compliance, improved reliability and better production throughput at the highest levels of quality. 
The Performix MES software joins Honeywell's large and growing portfolio of automation solutions for the life sciences industry, including Sparta System's quality management software and Honeywell's Experion Process Knowledge System. The combined offerings will address life sciences customer needs across the product life cycles, from automation project execution to optimal production to sustainable quality. 
Lastly, we unveiled an all-new aircraft cockpit system earlier this month called Honeywell Anthem, the first industry build with an always-on cloud connected experience that improves flight efficiency, operations, safety and comfort. Honeywell Anthem offers unprecedented levels of connectivity and exciting and intuitive interface model after everyday smart devices in a highly scalable and customizable design. 
This next-generation flight deck is powered by a flexible software platform that can be customized for virtually every type of aircraft and flying vehicle, including a large passenger and cargo planes, business jets, helicopters, general aviation aircraft and the rapidly emerging class of advanced air mobility vehicles. In fact, Honeywell Anthem has already been selected by Vertical Aerospace and Lilium with their vertical takeoff and landing all-electric aircraft. As these announcements highlight, we're continuously innovating and enhancing our portfolio of exciting new technologies align to our long-term strategic objectives. 
Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 4 to discuss our third quarter results in more detail."
1340740,1684731815,2409817,"Honeywell International Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Honeywell International Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Darius highlighted, we executed with the typical level of rigor that you have come to expect from Honeywell and delivered on our commitments despite a challenging backdrop. Our third quarter was strong with sale",3125,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Darius highlighted, we executed with the typical level of rigor that you have come to expect from Honeywell and delivered on our commitments despite a challenging backdrop. 
Our third quarter was strong with sales up 8% organically to $8.5 billion; segment margins expanding 130 basis points to 21.2%, resulting in 36% incremental margins; and free cash flow of more than $900 million, up 20% year-on-year. Our third quarter performance demonstrates our ability to deliver for our shareholders in all environments. 
Now let's take a minute to discuss how each of the segments contributed to that. Starting with Aerospace, third quarter sales were up 2% organically as the ongoing recovery in flight hours drove another quarter of strong double-digit commercial aerospace aftermarket growth. 
As expected, air transport aftermarket sales continued to gain momentum, growing more than 10% sequentially from the second quarter and growing 40% year-over-year. Commercial original equipment returned to growth in the quarter driven by strong demand for business jets. The growth in commercial aerospace was partially offset by Defense & Space, which was down 17% in the quarter primarily due to supply chain constraints, which limited our deliveries. Excluding those impacts, Defense & Space would have been down mid-single digits in the quarter, an improvement versus the first half run rate. 
Aerospace segment margins expanded 390 basis points to 27.1% driven by growth in our high-margin aftermarket business, strong productivity from our lower cost base and pricing. 
Building Technologies sales were up 3% organically driven by broad-based demand across the building products portfolio as well as continued growth in Building Solutions services. Orders were up double digits year-over-year for the fourth straight quarter driven by demand for fire products, building management systems and projects. 
Backlog for Building Solutions services was up over 35% year-over-year, positioning the business for growth into 2022. In addition, our healthy buildings portfolio maintained strong customer momentum with approximately $100 million of orders in the quarter, bringing year-to-date orders to $250 million. HBT segment margins expanded 190 basis points to 23.5% driven by pricing and productivity, partially offset by inflation. 
In PMT, sales were up 9% organically, led by 29% growth in UOP and 14% growth in Advanced Materials. UOP sales growth was driven by higher petrochemical catalyst shipments, and their backlog grew double digits year-over-year, which should drive growth well into 2022. 
Process Solutions sales were down 2% organically as the recovery in projects has lagged, partially offset by high single-digit growth in Thermal Solutions and lifecycle solutions and services. HPS orders were up 20% year-over-year driven by broad-based demand across the portfolio, providing confidence in the longer-term outlook for the business. PMT segment margins expanded 260 basis points to 22.2% in the quarter driven by pricing, strong operating leverage and a healthy mix of UOP. 
In Safety and Productivity Solutions, despite battling supply chain and inflation challenges, sales were up 21% organically driven by another quarter of double-digit Warehouse and Workflow Solutions growth, Productivity Solutions and Services growth and gas analysis growth. Orders in these 3 businesses were also up double digits year-over-year, resulting in a robust SPS backlog of more than $4 billion. 
Personal Protective Equipment sales declined year-over-year as mask demand declined meaningfully. This was partially offset by growth in the hearing, gloves and fall protection categories. SPS segment margins contracted 70 basis points to 13.2% driven by unfavorable business mix, which, combined with targeted investments and supply chain challenges in Intelligrated, drove inefficiencies in manufacturing installation as the business has been scaling to outsized growth, which was 60% organically this quarter. 
Finally, growth across our portfolio was underpinned by continued progress in Honeywell Connected Enterprise. Our connected buildings and cyber solutions delivered another quarter of double-digit organic growth, and third quarter recurring revenue growth was once again up double digits year-over-year. 
So overall, we delivered strong organic sales growth, drove 130 basis points of improvement in segment margins, 60 basis points above the high end of our guidance despite the challenging environment. For the quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.02, up 29% year-over-year, achieving the high end of our guidance. 
A bridge from 3Q '20 adjusted EPS to 3Q '21 adjusted EPS can be found in the appendix of this presentation, which includes reference to a $160 million noncash charge related to ongoing UOP matters that are described in our Form 10-Q. The majority of our year-over-year adjusted earnings growth of $0.26 was driven by our strong segment profit improvement. Below-the-line items were a $0.13 tailwind driven by lower repositioning and higher pension income. A lower effective tax rate of 22.9% and lower weighted average share count of 699 million shares drove a $0.04 and $0.03 benefit, respectively. 
We generated $900 million of free cash flow in the quarter and -- as increased earnings -- increase in working capital due to growth of the business and related supply chain challenges tamped that down a bit. 
Finally, we strategically deployed $1.5 billion primarily to share repurchases, dividends and CapEx in the third quarter, which significantly exceeded operating cash flow. We paid $646 million in dividends, deployed $208 million to capital expenditures and reduced $650 million of Honeywell shares, reducing our weighted average share count to 699 million. Total capital deployment was up 44% year-over-year. 
In all, this was another strong quarter under difficult circumstances. We continue to manage through the multi-speed recovery across our portfolio, making disciplined investments for the future and meeting or exceeding our commitments while proactively addressing macroeconomic challenges. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss the impact of the supply chain constraints we're facing and how Honeywell is adapting to address those challenges. As we saw last quarter, the world continues to face persistent supply chain challenges as the sourcing environment for direct materials and electrical components continues to be tight, logistics capacity remains strained and labor availability becomes more challenging, all driving constraints in operating and inflationary pressures on our cost base. 
Semiconductors remain an acute problem due to a structural disconnect between supply and demand driven by canceled industrial and automotive orders during COVID-19 as well as unplanned growth of 5G, personal computing and consumer electronics. We've also started feeling pressure in Aerospace as the supply chain broadly ramps up more slowly than needed, leading to parts challenges due to deteriorating supplier delivery. 
While we have been mitigating the overall risk by proactively partnering with distributors and alternative suppliers, the challenges accelerated in the last quarter, constraining growth in some of our businesses. The most affected businesses in our portfolio are SPS, Aerospace and HPT. 
We provide guidance ranges for our quarterly and annual outlook in order to incorporate an adequate level of risk for things just such as this as we see these dynamics in the last few quarters. We are managing the situation aggressively on a daily basis and have deployed the full strength of our reengineering efforts to qualify alternative parts, which has mitigated some risk on our Productivity Solutions and Services, advanced sensing and fire businesses. 
We created tiger teams using advanced digital tools to track shortages and deploy a number of actions to liberate supply in the market. We also continue to mitigate inflation in materials, freight and labor in our operations through targeted regular pricing actions. 
For the longer term, we're developing dual-sourced platforming strategies and executing long-term supply agreements with some of our key suppliers. This, coupled with strengthening direct engagement with the semiconductor OEMs and foundries, will improve our ability to secure increased volumes in the future. We do expect this environment to persist into the fourth quarter and the first half of '22. We'll continue to adapt as we manage through this period. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 6 to talk about our expectations for the fourth quarter. As we enter the fourth quarter and given the ongoing challenges I mentioned, we expect sales to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion, down 4% to flat on an organic basis, which includes the impact of the COVID-19-driven mask sales decline. Excluding this impact, organic sales would be down 2 to up 2 organically. 
We would also normally see a seasonal step up from the third to the fourth quarter, which this year will be somewhat dampened by the unique calendar impact of having more days in the third quarter than we do in 4Q. 
In Aerospace, we expect our commercial business to continue to improve as business aviation and air transport flight hours continue to accelerate, driving continued sequential and year-over-year growth in the commercial aftermarket sales. The pace of the air transport acceleration will continue to vary regionally with domestic travel recovering faster than international. Commercial original equipment build rates will also continue to progress gradually. 
Defense & Space sales will be down due to lower demand from U.S. DoD programs driven by moderating U.S. defense spend and soft international defense volumes. We will continue to manage through the constraints as the Aerospace supply base ramps up, but we are expecting to miss out on potentially hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of shipments due to these continued challenges in Q4. We now expect organic sales growth to be down mid-single digits for the year in Aerospace. 
In Building Technologies, we expect continued strong demand across the portfolio as the world continues to reopen and sustainability solutions take hold, driving sales and orders growth in the fourth quarter. We will face ongoing pressures from the supply chain constraints, but continue to work our mitigation actions as we anticipate mid-single-digit sales growth for the year. 
In PMT, we see continued strength in the short-cycle HPS businesses, though this will be tempered by the slower recovery in projects. Our strong orders growth in the third quarter will support a growth acceleration into '22. For UOP, we're pleased with our robust 3Q performance and expect continued growth into the fourth quarter and into '22, supported by the strong backlog, which is up double digits year-over-year. 
Last, we expect continued healthy demand for products across the Advanced Materials portfolio. We expect PMT organic sales to be up low single digits for the year. 
In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we expect another quarter of robust growth in our Warehouse and Workflow Solutions and Productivity Solutions and Services businesses. In our Productivity Solutions and Services business, we just have an outstanding year. Backlog remains up triple digits year-over-year, which, combined with our Intelligrated backlog that is over $2.4 billion, gives us confidence in these businesses for the remainder of '21 and into '22. 
Mask demand has accelerated as expected as the world recovers from the pandemic, though we will partially offset the softness with strengths in other areas of the PPE portfolio. Finally, we expect to see strength in our short-cycle gas analysis and advanced sensing businesses driven by double-digit orders growth in the third quarter. We'll continue to manage through this challenging supply environment, which will impact our growth potential, but we'll record strong double-digit growth for the year. 
Now let me turn to our expectations for our other core guided metrics. For our fourth quarter segment margins, we expect to be in the range of 21.2% to 21.7%, up 10 to 60 basis points year-over-year. We expect margins to continue to benefit from pricing actions ahead of inflation, volume leverage and ongoing productivity from our streamlined cost base despite the headwinds from unfavorable business mix in Intelligrated and efficiency challenges due to the supply chain environment. 
Fourth quarter net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income tax -- and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $10 million to negative $95 million with a range of repositioning between approximately $140 million and $215 million as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring projects. 
We expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and average share count to be approximately 698 million shares. As a result, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share between $2.03 and $2.13, down 2% to up 3% year-over-year. 
Given these fourth quarter expectations, full year organic sales growth will be in the range of 4% to 5%, narrowing the range we provided last quarter to $34.2 billion to $34.6 billion. We are once again raising the low end of our segment margin guidance by 10 basis points for the year to a new range of 20.9% to 21.1%, representing expansion of 50 to 70 basis points for the year. 
We expect margin expansion in Aero, HPT and PMT as we carefully invest back into the business while managing the multi-speed recovery across the portfolio. Our fixed cost management remains a focus, and we are tracking favorably to the permanent reduction of $1 billion of fixed costs from our 2020 cost actions. 
We expect our net below-the-line impact to be in the range of $40 million to $125 million, including capacity to $475 million of repositioning. Our full year effective tax rate will be approximately 22%, and weighted average share count will be approximately 701 million for the year, over-delivering on our minimum 1% reduction in shares. 
This will take adjusted earnings per share to a range of $8 to $8.10, up 13% to 14% year-over-year. This maintains the high end of our previous guidance and raised the low end by $0.05. Despite these challenges, we are maintaining the same cash flow outlook for the year in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. 
Now let's turn to Page 7 and review our guidance progression throughout the year. Since we provided our initial 2021 guidance in January, we have navigated through several uncertainties, the ongoing global pandemic, supply chain challenges, unprecedented raw material inflation and labor market challenges. And in each turn, our rigorous operating principles have enabled us to continue to demonstrate our resiliency. 
And our latest update, we have adjusted our sales outlook purely due to the constraints we are battling in the supply chain, which dampened 3Q and our fourth quarter sales potential. We continue to have a robust backlog of demand. Despite these changes to top line expectations, we have not only maintained the high end of our segment margin and adjusted EPS guidance, but we have further increased the low end of both ranges and maintained our previous free cash flow guidance. These are excellent proof points of our ability to execute in all economic cycles. 
In total, I'm encouraged by the strength we are seeing in key areas of the portfolio as we head into '22 particularly driven by strong orders growth and backlog position as well as aggressive supply chain tactics that are mitigating risks, enabling us to deliver on our long-term commitments. 
Now let's move to Slide 8, where we can talk about some of the preliminary thoughts we have on 2022. With the commercial aerospace recovery in view, upcoming capital reinvestment in the energy sector, nonresidential construction spending returning to 2019 levels and the exponential growth we continue to see in e-commerce, we have a strong setup for 2022. 
We expect organic growth in all 4 segments driven by strong portfolio-wide demand in backlog, underpinned by year-to-date orders growth of 17% in HBT, 14% in Aero, 10% in PMT and 6% in SPS or 8% in SPS if we exclude the COVID mask business. This, coupled with the strategies we have in place that are focused on driving uniquely innovative and differentiated technologies to address the world's increasing demand for digital transformation, process technology and sustainable solutions, gives me confidence in our future. 
However, we do expect growth in the first half of '22 to be constrained due to continued challenges from labor force uncertainty, supply availability and logistics challenges. Inflation will continue to be a factor under these circumstances though our pricing rigor as reflected in our margin rates will help us. We do expect changes to corporate tax legislation, though the exact impact of that is as of yet unknown. 
With these dynamics in mind, let's look at our key markets. In Aerospace, we expect strong growth in our commercial aerospace business. Ongoing improvement in global flight hours will drive growth in our commercial aerospace aftermarket. We also expect original equipment build rates, which have lagged the flight hour recovery, to ramp up in '22. 
In Defense & Space, we expect flat to low single-digit growth year-over-year as U.S. and international defense budget spending stabilizes and our supply challenges abate. 
In HBT, we expect nonresidential construction growth and an ongoing return to public spaces to drive demand for building products, services and projects. We also expect continued demand for our portfolio of healthy building solutions as well as tailwinds from U.S. infrastructure. We expect a large backlog to draw from as well as we end [ 2021 ]. 
In PMT, we're assuming improved macroeconomic conditions and higher stable oil prices will improve growth in UOP and also help recover automation projects in HPS. We expect continued strength in Advanced Materials driven by demand in the auto, construction and health care sectors. 
For Safety and Productivity Solutions, we expect strong demand in our Productivity Solutions and Services, gas analysis and advanced sensor businesses. We also execute on our robust backlog of major projects in our Warehouse and Workflow Solutions businesses. 
However, we will face constraints to growth as supply chain challenges continue in the first half of '22. Mask demand will remain at our lower second half exit rates as the world recovers from the pandemic. 
For overall Honeywell, we expect margin expansion to be driven by aftermarket recovery in Aerospace, accelerating catalyst shipments in UOP and improving mix in SPS. Our strong productivity and pricing actions, which should carry through to next year and provide potential upside, will enable key investments to support medium-term top line growth, including a step-up in R&D and our digital initiatives. 
We look forward to completing the combination of Honeywell Quantum Solutions with Cambridge Quantum Computing, which is a very big strategic step forward for us, but will be a minor drag on our margin. We have significant balance sheet capacity for M&A and share repurchases, and we expect to reduce our share count by a minimum of 1% again in 2022. 
So overall, we have some insight into our end markets and a lot of confidence in our continued operational execution, which will give us the ability to deliver another strong financial performance and continue to execute our strategy to be the premier software industry. We'll provide more specific inputs once we close out the year. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius."

Before we wrap up, I'd like to take a minute on Slide 9 to discuss an important topic: Honeywell's culture of inclusion and diversity. Our commitment to inclusion and diversity enables better decision-making, helps build competitive advantages and further long-term success. 
Inclusion and diversity is one of our foundational principles, and Honeywell expects all employees to exemplify these principles. We continue to build out our initiatives to promote racial equality and inclusion and diversity, including employing mandatory unconscious bias training to our global workforce, establishing a global I&D student committee co-sponsored by me, and fortifying Honeywell's I&D governance structure by embedding I&D councils into each business group. We also established 2021 goals for each of my direct reports that include an annual objective of driving diversity in his or her organization. 
These initiatives have yielded results. Women and people of color represent a higher percentage of the workforce at Honeywell compared to our peers. In addition, representation of women and people of color in Honeywell has increased each year since 2018, which is a testament to our ongoing commitment to hiring, developing and retaining diverse talent. 
Now let's wrap up on Slide 10. We delivered on our third quarter commitments despite a challenging backdrop. As always, we remain laser-focused on executing our strategic objectives and investing in growth opportunities that position our business well for the next phase of recovery.

So the short answer to your question, Steve, is that, yes, we do expect the first half to grow. I think how much is going to be a little bit dependent upon some of the supply chain challenges that we pointed out that we're seeing in Q4. 
Frankly, we see it this way, which is on semiconductors, we actually see some positive tailwinds as we head into the first half next year. So that's good. I don't think that it's going to be completely alleviated, but it's going to get better. 
When it comes to some of the other components, particularly for Aerospace and some of the Tier 2, Tier 3 suppliers, particularly castings, forgings, things of that nature, we're not sure where we are in that improvement cycle because it really just kind of popped up in Q3 in a more acute phase. So we're a little more cautious there. But the short answer is we do expect growth in the first half of 2022. 
What I will say is that we have -- we'll have some headwinds in SPS due to sort of what I call COVID-related masks. But I think those are going to be particularly acute in Q1 of next year. They're evident here in Q4 of '21 and to a lesser extent, Q2 of 2022. And then it's kind of going to -- we're going to get back to that normal run rate. 
So we -- as you can see, I mean, it's -- the year '22 is setting up terrific. I mean, we're up double-digit orders growth in each of our SPGs. One exception, SPS is sort of, call it, mid-single digit. But if you exclude the impact of the COVID masks, we would be up double digit as well. 
So the only constraint that we see is, to some extent, the supply chain. And at least in semiconductors, we think that Q4 is the peak of those challenges. That's the way we see it today. 
Now I will say this lastly, which is it's a dynamic environment. There were some puts and takes here in Q3 that were probably more takes than positive. So we're going to monitor it as closely as Q4."

But we certainly expect growth, the backlog supports that. And our story hasn't changed from really the end of Q2 earnings report. I think the setup for Honeywell for '22, '23 is terrific. There's nothing here that makes me want to change my mind. 
Yes, we're going to have to deal with some of the supply chain challenges. They're here. They're real. They're probably understated in the market. I think that, frankly, it's only recently that it's been realized how severe they are. But we've incorporated that in our guide for Q4. And I think we're working diligently to try to resolve them. 
I mean, we've been at this for 12 weeks now. And it's not just one way. It's not just pushing suppliers harder. It's also doing redesign, alternative products, finding different ways to generate revenue. So I think we've got a pretty good playbook. But I won't understate this. The challenges are real and substantial."

On Defense & Space, as you saw, we kind of had a, frankly, a bit of a disappointing double-digit negative for Q3. But remember that had we not sort of had some of these supply chain challenge, which really became very evident in Q3 because think about these as Q3, Q4 suppliers which are smaller, which reduced capacity during the pandemic. And now we're getting a lot of demand, not just from us but probably some of the other aerospace players. 
It's going to take some time to work through that, but we would have been down mid-single digits in Q3 had that not happened. We have, unfortunately, more past due than we want Defense & Space. That went up substantially in Q3, and we've got to work our way through that. 
What I will tell you about Defense & Space is if you look at our bookings or where we are at this cycle, early Q4 versus where we were at the same period of last year, that gives us some -- well, quite a bit of confidence that we're looking at flat to low single digits. Now that could get even better. I don't know that it's going to get a lot worse. 
What we're seeing here is, if you recall, if you go back to 2020, we had very strong orders and revenue in 2020 in Defense & Space. And you see the effect of some level of usage and destocking by some of those Defense & Space customers and distributors. 
So we're optimistic about normalization of that in '22. And based on what we see today, and this is important to say today and this could change, we see flattish to low single-digit growth. 
And let's now switch gears and talk about commercial aftermarket. We see that continue to improve it. You saw that strong growth in Q3. We think it's going to continue to get better. We're still nowhere near the 2019 levels, but it continues to get better. 
As you know, November 8, we're going to open up the borders, and more international traffic is going to step up. So as more international comes back as COVID abates, which we think were going to happen here in Q4 and Q1 next year, we see continued growth in our aftermarket, coupled with stronger growth in OE, both in air transport as well as PGA. So the setup for Aerospace, I think, for '22 is quite good. Greg, I don't know if you..."

But the biggest lever here, and I think one of the best operational stories for Honeywell that you see here in Q3 is our pricing discipline. I mean, we think we gain in terms of price/cost 40 to 50 basis points of margin expansion, and that's what you're seeing come through in our margins. I mean, I think that was a terrific commercial execution by the team, and they did a great job.

I mean, if you think about it, Nicole, last year, obviously, we were in a substantial cost-cutting mode and are repositioning pipeline. And the projects around that reflected it. This year, we always say that we continue the productivity playbook, fixed cost power one, create operating leverage by growing sales and holding fixed costs flat as just the mantra of the way we work. 
And so to Darius' point, we're not doing massive cost cutting. We are being smart about where we're putting it back, though, and we are using the things that we spoke about last year in terms of automation and our digital capabilities to help us deliver. 
I mean, I'll be honest. The supply chain work that we're doing, that Torsten and the team are doing are very much enabled by our Honeywell digital tools and capabilities and some of the visibility that he's put into his own capabilities in the supply chain to manage. So this isn't about cutting costs. It's about managing them properly, and we are investing back in the business, as Darius mentioned. But we're going to be doing it diligently. 
So I feel pretty good about the margin rate expansion. You would see the implied margin rate expansion is a little bit lower than what our guide was previously simply because the sales numbers are down. So we'll have a little bit less operating leverage from an opportunity standpoint, but still very healthy margin expansion in Q4."

We've been talking about that. And look, that business grew 60% this quarter. Any business growing at that kind of pace is going to have some challenges. 
But you couple that kind of level of growth, which pulls on things like electronics, steel, metal, with the supply chain challenges we have, it's going to have some efficiency challenges, particularly since it's -- there's a strong correlation between third-party buy, our own manufacturing and installation. And when those things don't work together well, there are some challenges. 
I can tell you we're investing heavily in that business to really prepare it to be a $4 billion, $5 billion, $6 billion business, which is the path that it's on. So there's an investment play. There's an efficiency play and so on. 
Having said that, a lot of our other businesses, such as AST, such as PSS had an absolutely terrific quarter. PSS has been a great success story for us. It's winning in the marketplace. So we think that this sort of margin challenge is going to abate over time, particularly as we made some of the process improvements and investments in Intelligrated."

Look, I think this is becoming fairly obvious, and we all read the same articles and see what's going on, which is there's going to have to be a reinvestment cycle. As much as we all want sustainable and renewable technologies to take over sort of the energy needs tomorrow, it's probably going to be a little bit of a longer term. 
And it's very clear to me that there's going to be a reinvestment cycle. We're seeing a good reinvestment cycle when I call some of the shorter project refurbishment focused at the installed base. But we're a strong believer that there's going to be a fairly strong reinvestment cycle in '22 and '23. I think that's necessary. 
So we're bullish on that segment. And certainly, the price of oil, price of gas support that kind of investment. I mean, if you look at gas and oil, I mean, they're very, very attractive levels. What we need now is some level of stability. So that's good. 
But let me give you a couple of other specific data points, Deane. Our renewable fuel orders this past quarter were up 86%. I mean, I think we forget sometimes that we just characterize UOP as oil and gas. It is not just oil and gas. It has an incredibly strong green fuels portfolio, which is winning in the marketplace. We've seen 86% growth. 
Also some of the energy storage controls orders were up 64% this past quarter in our HPS business. So those are just a couple of data points for you that we are very excited about the energy future. We have a portfolio that's going to play in it. Having said that, there's going to have to be a reinvestment cycle in sort of what I call the whole energy infrastructure."

They've also been doing -- we talked a little bit about the reengineering work. They've done a lot of reengineering to try to include different chipsets into some of their platforms. So this one is really pretty acutely tied to the whole capacity expansion that's going on in the fab industry. So I think we're going to feel this.

I mean, that was the -- we talked about our cost reduction programs last year, and Aero was at the top of that list, PMT second in terms of the level of fixed cost takeout. So part of what you're seeing from Aerospace in terms of almost 400 basis point improvement is a big operating leverage that they're getting, even though it's on only 2% revenue growth. 
In terms of the split between U.S. DoD and international, I think what we're seeing is similar to what we spoke about before. I mean, the U.S. DoD and international bolt down from a demand perspective as we're going through that recalibration, if you will, on some of the prebuying that had been done last year. 
And we do see the supply chain issues that we're having are really in a lot of the mechanical spaces.

We achieved",816,"Thank you, Reena, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. Our outstanding discipline and execution enabled us to deliver third quarter results that met or exceeded our financial guidance in an increasingly challenging environment. We achieved the high end of our third quarter adjusted earnings per share guidance range and exceeded the high end of our segment margin guidance by 60 basis points despite significant headwinds from inflation, and supply chain constraints, which tampered down our top line growth potential. 
Despite that, organic sales were up 8% year-over-year driven by double-digit organic growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions, the commercial aerospace aftermarket from Advanced Materials and UOP. Segment margin expanded 130 basis points to 21.2% driven by strong actions that we took across the portfolio to address the headwinds we faced from inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. Specifically, we've continued to operate our strong productivity playbook. We took swift pricing action that allowed us to stay ahead of the inflation curve. We drove a 4% increase year-over-year in -- on the top line and yielded approximately 40 basis points of margin expansion net of inflation. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $2.02, up 29% year-over-year, achieving the high end of our guidance range. We delivered a strong third quarter despite a volatile backdrop that included a hurricane in our PMT factory corridor, power blackouts in China and the persistent and ongoing impacts on the supply chain more broadly. I am pleased of our disciplined execution, which enabled us to navigate the challenges in the macroeconomic environment and capitalize on the ongoing recovery in our end markets. I continue to be encouraged by the strength we are seeing in many areas of our portfolio. 
Orders across Honeywell are up high single digits year-over-year organic, excluding the impact of COVID-related mask business, which has seen significant demand decline since the pandemic has been subsiding. Orders across Honeywell were up double digits year-over-year. Backlog was up 7% to $27.5 billion and up 9%, excluding the impact of COVID mask orders, driven by strength in many of our segments and positioning us to deliver next phase of the recovery as we head into 2022. As always, we continue to execute on our rigorous and proven value creation framework that drives outstanding shareholder value. 
Now let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss some of our exciting recent announcements. Last month, United Airlines and Honeywell announced a joint multimillion dollar investment in Alder Fuels, powering the biggest sustainable fuel agreement in aviation history. Alder Fuels is a clean tech company that is pioneering first-of-its-kind technologies from producing sustainable aviation fuel or SAF at scale. 
When used together across the fuel life cycle, the Alder technologies, coupled with Honeywell's Ecofining process, have the ability to produce a carbon-negative alternative to today's jet fuels. As part of the agreement, United is committing to purchase 1.5 billion gallons of SAF when produced to United's requirement, which is 1.5x the size of the known purchase commitments of all global airlines combined, making this easily the largest publicly announced SAF agreement in aviation history and demonstrating the power of Honeywell technologies continue to bring to the oncoming global energy transition. 
We also recently announced the acquisition of Performix, a provider of manufacturing execution system or MES software for the pharmaceutical manufacturing and biotech industries. This acquisition builds on our strategy to create the world's leading integrated software platform for customers within the life sciences industry who are striving to achieve faster compliance, improved reliability and better production throughput at the highest levels of quality. The Performix MES software joins Honeywell's large and growing portfolio of automation solutions for the life sciences industry, including Sparta System's quality management software and Honeywell's Experion Process Knowledge System. The combined offerings will address life sciences' customer needs across the product life cycles, from automation project execution to optimal production to sustainable quality. 
Lastly, we unveiled an all-new aircraft cockpit system earlier this month called Honeywell Anthem, the first in the industry build with an always-on cloud connected experience that improves flight efficiency, operations, safety and comfort. Honeywell Anthem offers unprecedented levels of connectivity and exciting and intuitive interface model after everyday smart devices in a highly scalable and customizable design. 
This next-generation flight deck is powered by a flexible software platform that can be customized for virtually every type of aircraft and flying vehicle, including a large passenger and cargo planes, business jets, helicopters, general aviation aircraft and the rapidly emerging class of advanced air mobility vehicles. In fact, Honeywell Anthem has already been selected by Vertical Aerospace and Lilium with their vertical takeoff and landing all-electric aircraft. As these announcements highlight, we're continuously innovating and enhancing our portfolio of exciting new technologies align to our long-term strategic objectives. 
Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 4 to discuss our third quarter results in more detail."

As Darius highlighted, we executed with the typical level of rigor that you have come to expect from Honeywell and delivered on our commitments despite a challenging backdrop. Our third quarter was strong with sale",3131,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Darius highlighted, we executed with the typical level of rigor that you have come to expect from Honeywell and delivered on our commitments despite a challenging backdrop. 
Our third quarter was strong with sales up 8% organically to $8.5 billion; segment margins expanding 130 basis points to 21.2%, resulting in 36% incremental margins; and free cash flow of more than $900 million, up 20% year-on-year. Our third quarter performance demonstrates our ability to deliver for our shareholders in all environments. 
Now let's take a minute to discuss how each of the segments contributed to that. Starting with Aerospace, third quarter sales were up 2% organically as the ongoing recovery in flight hours drove another quarter of strong double-digit commercial aerospace aftermarket growth. As expected, air transport aftermarket sales continued to gain momentum, growing more than 10% sequentially from the second quarter and growing 40% year-over-year. Commercial original equipment returned to growth in the quarter driven by strong demand for business jets. The growth in commercial aerospace was partially offset by Defense & Space, which was down 17% in the quarter primarily due to supply chain constraints, which limited our deliveries. Excluding those impacts, Defense & Space would have been down mid-single digits in the quarter, an improvement versus the first half run rate. 
Aerospace segment margins expanded 390 basis points to 27.1%, driven by growth in our high-margin aftermarket business, strong productivity from our lower cost base and pricing. Building Technologies sales were up 3% organically driven by broad-based demand across the building products portfolio as well as continued growth in Building Solutions services. Orders were up double digits year-over-year for the fourth straight quarter driven by demand for fire products, building management systems and projects. Backlog for Building Solutions services was up over 35% year-over-year, positioning the business for growth into 2022. In addition, our healthy buildings portfolio maintained strong customer momentum with approximately $100 million of orders in the quarter, bringing year-to-date orders to $250 million. HBT segment margins expanded 190 basis points to 23.5%, driven by pricing and productivity, partially offset by inflation. 
In PMT, sales were up 9% organically, led by 29% growth in UOP and 14% growth in Advanced Materials. UOP sales growth was driven by higher petrochemical catalyst shipments, and their backlog grew double digits year-over-year, which should drive growth well into 2022. 
Process Solutions sales were down 2% organically as the recovery in projects has lagged, partially offset by high single-digit growth in Thermal Solutions and Lifecycle Solutions & Services. HPS orders were up 20% year-over-year, driven by broad-based demand across the portfolio, providing confidence in the longer-term outlook for the business. PMT segment margins expanded 260 basis points to 22.2% in the quarter driven by pricing, strong operating leverage and a healthy mix of UOP. 
In Safety and Productivity Solutions, despite battling supply chain and inflation challenges, sales were up 21% organically, driven by another quarter of double-digit Warehouse and Workflow Solutions growth, Productivity Solutions and Services growth and gas analysis growth. Orders in these 3 businesses were also up double digits year-over-year, resulting in a robust SPS backlog of more than $4 billion. Personal Protective Equipment sales declined year-over-year as mask demand declined meaningfully. This was partially offset by growth in the hearing, gloves and fall protection categories. SPS segment margins contracted 70 basis points to 13.2% driven by unfavorable business mix, which, combined with targeted investments and supply chain challenges in Intelligrated, drove inefficiencies in manufacturing installation as the business has been scaling to outsized growth, which was 60% organically this quarter. 
Finally, growth across our portfolio was underpinned by continued progress in Honeywell Connected Enterprise. Our connected buildings and cyber solutions delivered another quarter of double-digit organic growth, and third quarter recurring revenue growth was once again up double digits year-over-year. So overall, we delivered strong organic sales growth, drove 130 basis points of improvement in segment margins, 60 basis points above the high end of our guidance despite the challenging environment. For the quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.02, up 29% year-over-year, achieving the high end of our guidance. 
A bridge from 3Q '20 adjusted EPS to 3Q '21 adjusted EPS can be found in the appendix of this presentation, which includes reference to a $160 million noncash charge related to ongoing UOP matters that are described in our Form 10-Q. The majority of our year-over-year adjusted earnings growth of $0.26 was driven by our strong segment profit improvement. Below-the-line items were a $0.13 tailwind driven by lower repositioning and higher pension income. A lower effective tax rate of 22.9% and lower weighted average share count of 699 million shares drove a $0.04 and $0.03 benefit, respectively. 
We generated $900 million of free cash flow in the quarter and -- as increased earnings -- excuse me, increase in working capital due to growth of the business and related supply chain challenges tamped that down a bit. Finally, we strategically deployed $1.5 billion primarily to share repurchases, dividends and CapEx in the third quarter, which significantly exceeded operating cash flow. We paid $646 million in dividends, deployed $208 million to capital expenditures and reduced $650 million of Honeywell shares, reducing our weighted average share count to 699 million. Total capital deployment was up 44% year-over-year. In all, this was another strong quarter under difficult circumstances. We continue to manage through the multi-speed recovery across our portfolio, making disciplined investments for the future and meeting or exceeding our commitments while proactively addressing macroeconomic challenges. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss the impact of the supply chain constraints we're facing and how Honeywell is adapting to address those challenges. As we saw last quarter, the world continues to face persistent supply chain challenges as the sourcing environment for direct materials and electrical components continues to be tight, logistics capacity remains strained and labor availability becomes more challenging, all driving constraints in operating and inflationary pressures on our cost base. Semiconductors remain an acute problem due to a structural disconnect between supply and demand driven by canceled industrial and automotive orders during COVID-19 as well as unplanned growth of 5G, personal computing and consumer electronics. We've also started feeling pressure in Aerospace as the supply chain broadly ramps up more slowly than needed, leading to parts challenges due to deteriorating supplier delivery. 
While we have been mitigating the overall risk by proactively partnering with distributors and alternative suppliers, the challenges accelerated in the last quarter, constraining growth in some of our businesses. The most affected businesses in our portfolio are SPS, Aerospace and HPT. We provide guidance ranges for our quarterly and annual outlook in order to incorporate an adequate level of risk for things just such as this as we see these dynamics in the last few quarters. We are managing the situation aggressively on a daily basis and have deployed the full strength of our reengineering efforts to qualify alternative parts, which has mitigated some risk on our Productivity Solutions and Services, Advanced Sensing and Fire businesses. 
We created tiger teams using advanced digital tools to track shortages and deploy a number of actions to liberate supply in the market. We also continue to mitigate inflation in materials, freight and labor in our operations through targeted regular pricing actions. For the longer term, we're developing dual-sourced platforming strategies and executing long-term supply agreements with some of our key suppliers. This, coupled with strengthening direct engagement with the semiconductor OEMs and foundries, will improve our ability to secure increased volumes in the future. We do expect this environment to persist into the fourth quarter and the first half of '22. We'll continue to adapt as we manage through this period. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 6 to talk about our expectations for the fourth quarter. As we enter the fourth quarter and given the ongoing challenges I mentioned, we expect sales to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion, down 4% to flat on an organic basis, which includes the impact of the COVID-19-driven mask sales decline. Excluding this impact, organic sales would be down 2% to up 2% organically. We would also normally see a seasonal step up from the third to the fourth quarter, which this year will be somewhat dampened by the unique calendar impact of having more days in the third quarter than we do in 4Q. 
In Aerospace, we expect our commercial business to continue to improve as business aviation and air transport flight hours continue to accelerate, driving continued sequential and year-over-year growth in the commercial aftermarket sales. The pace of the air transport acceleration will continue to vary regionally with domestic travel recovering faster than international. Commercial original equipment build rates will also continue to progress gradually. Defense & Space sales will be down due to lower demand from U.S. DoD programs driven by moderating U.S. defense spend and soft international defense volumes. We will continue to manage through the constraints as the Aerospace supply base ramps up, but we are expecting to miss out on potentially hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shipments due to these continued challenges in Q4. We now expect organic sales growth to be down mid-single digits for the year in Aerospace. 
In Building Technologies, we expect continued strong demand across the portfolio as the world continues to reopen and sustainability solutions take hold, driving sales and orders growth in the fourth quarter. We will face ongoing pressures from the supply chain constraints, but continue to work our mitigation actions as we anticipate mid-single-digit sales growth for the year. In PMT, we see continued strength in the short-cycle HPS businesses, though this will be tempered by the slower recovery in projects. Our strong orders growth in the third quarter will support a growth acceleration into '22. For UOP, we're pleased with our robust 3Q performance and expect continued growth into the fourth quarter and into '22, supported by the strong backlog, which is up double digits year-over-year. 
Last, we expect continued healthy demand for products across the Advanced Materials portfolio. We expect PMT organic sales to be up low single digits for the year. 
In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we expect another quarter of robust growth in our Warehouse and Workflow Solutions and Productivity Solutions and Services businesses. In our Productivity Solutions and Services business, we just have an outstanding year. Backlog remains up triple digits year-over-year, which, combined with our Intelligrated backlog that is over $2.4 billion, gives us confidence in these businesses for the remainder of '21 and into '22. Mask demand has accelerated as expected as the world recovers from the pandemic, though we will partially offset the softness with strengths in other areas of the PPE portfolio. Finally, we expect to see strength in our short-cycle gas analysis and advanced sensing businesses driven by double-digit orders growth in the third quarter. We'll continue to manage through this challenging supply environment, which will impact our growth potential, but we'll record strong double-digit growth for the year. 
Now let me turn to our expectations for our other core guided metrics. For our fourth quarter segment margins, we expect to be in the range of 21.2% to 21.7%, up 10 to 60 basis points year-over-year. We expect margins to continue to benefit from pricing actions ahead of inflation, volume leverage and ongoing productivity from our streamlined cost base despite the headwinds from unfavorable business mix in Intelligrated and efficiency challenges due to the supply chain environment. Fourth quarter net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income tax -- and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $10 million to negative $95 million with a range of repositioning between approximately $140 million and [ $215 ] million as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring projects. We expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and average share count to be approximately 698 million shares. As a result, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share between $2.03 and $2.13, down 2% to up 3% year-over-year. 
Given these fourth quarter expectations, full year organic sales growth will be in the range of 4% to 5%, narrowing the range we provided last quarter to $34.2 billion to $34.6 billion. We are once again raising the low end of our segment margin guidance by 10 basis points for the year to a new range of 20.9% to 21.1%, representing expansion of 50 to 70 basis points for the year. We expect margin expansion in Aero, HPT and PMT as we carefully invest back into the business while managing the multi-speed recovery across the portfolio. Our fixed cost management remains a focus, and we are tracking favorably to the permanent reduction of $1 billion of fixed costs from our 2020 cost actions. 
We expect our net below-the-line impact to be in the range of $40 million to $125 million, including capacity for $400 to $475 million of repositioning. Our full year effective tax rate will be approximately 22%, and weighted average share count will be approximately 701 million for the year, over-delivering on our minimum 1% reduction in shares. This will take adjusted earnings per share to a range of $8 to $8.10, up 13% to 14% year-over-year. This maintains the high end of our previous guidance and raised the low end by $0.05. Despite these challenges, we are maintaining the same cash flow outlook for the year in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. 
Now let's turn to Page 7 and review our guidance progression throughout the year. Since we provided our initial 2021 guidance in January, we have navigated through several uncertainties, the ongoing global pandemic, supply chain challenges, unprecedented raw material inflation and labor market challenges. And in each turn, our rigorous operating principles have enabled us to continue to demonstrate our resiliency. And our latest update, we have adjusted our sales outlook purely due to the constraints we are battling in the supply chain, which dampened 3Q and our fourth quarter sales potential. We continue to have a robust backlog of demand. Despite these changes to top line expectations, we have not only maintained the high end of our segment margin and adjusted EPS guidance, but we have further increased the low end of both ranges and maintained our previous free cash flow guidance. These are excellent proof points of our ability to execute in all economic cycles. In total, I'm encouraged by the strength we are seeing in key areas of the portfolio as we head into '22, particularly driven by strong orders growth and backlog position as well as aggressive supply chain tactics that are mitigating risks, enabling us to deliver on our long-term commitments. 
Now let's move to Slide 8, where we can talk about some of the preliminary thoughts we have on 2022. With the commercial aerospace recovery in view, upcoming capital reinvestment in the energy sector, nonresidential construction spending returning to 2019 levels and the exponential growth we continue to see in e-commerce, we have a strong setup for 2022. We expect organic growth in all 4 segments driven by strong portfolio-wide demand in backlog, underpinned by year-to-date orders growth of 17% in HBT, 14% in Aero, 10% in PMT and 6% in SPS or 8% in SPS,, if we exclude the COVID mask business. This, coupled with the strategies we have in place that are focused on driving uniquely innovative and differentiated technologies to address the world's increasing demand for digital transformation, process technology and sustainable solutions, gives me confidence in our future. 
However, we do expect growth in the first half of '22 to be constrained due to continued challenges from labor force uncertainty, supply availability and logistics challenges. Inflation will continue to be a factor under these circumstances though our pricing rigor as reflected in our margin rates will help us. We do expect changes to corporate tax legislation, though the exact impact of that is as of yet unknown. With these dynamics in mind, let's look at our key markets. In Aerospace, we expect strong growth in our commercial aerospace business. Ongoing improvement in global flight hours will drive growth in our commercial aerospace aftermarket. We also expect original equipment build rates, which have lagged the flight hour recovery, to ramp up in '22. 
In Defense & Space, we expect flat to low single-digit growth year-over-year as U.S. and international defense budget spending stabilizes and our supply challenges abate. In HBT, we expect nonresidential construction growth and an ongoing return to public spaces to drive demand for building products, services and projects. We also expect continued demand for our portfolio of healthy building solutions as well as tailwinds from U.S. infrastructure [indiscernible]. We expect a large backlog to draw from as well as we end with 2021. In PMT, we're assuming improved macroeconomic conditions and higher stable oil prices will improve growth in UOP and also help recover automation projects in HPS. We expect continued strength in Advanced Materials driven by demand in the auto, construction and health care sectors. 
For Safety and Productivity Solutions, we expect strong demand in our Productivity Solutions and Services, gas analysis and advanced sensor businesses. We also execute on our robust backlog of major projects in our Warehouse and Workflow Solutions businesses. However, we will face constraints to growth as supply chain challenges continue in the first half of '22. Mask demand will remain at our lower second half exit rates as the world recovers from the pandemic. For overall Honeywell, we expect margin expansion to be driven by aftermarket recovery in Aerospace, accelerating catalyst shipments in UOP and improving mix in SPS. Our strong productivity and pricing actions, which should carry through to next year and provide potential upside, will enable key investments to support medium-term top line growth, including a step-up in R&D and our digital initiatives. 
We look forward to completing the combination of Honeywell Quantum Solutions with Cambridge Quantum Computing, which is a very big strategic step forward for us, but will be a minor drag on our margin. We have significant balance sheet capacity for M&A and share repurchases, and we expect to reduce our share count by a minimum of 1% again in 2022. So overall, we have some insight into our end markets and a lot of confidence in our continued operational execution, which will give us the ability to deliver another strong financial performance and continue to execute our strategy to be the premier software [indiscernible]. We'll provide more specific inputs once we close out the year. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius."

Before we wrap up, I'd like to take a minute on Slide 9 to discuss an important topic: Honeywell's culture of inclusion and diversity. Our commitment to inclusion and diversity enables better decision-making, helps build competitive advantages and further long-term success. Inclusion and diversity is one of our foundational principles, and Honeywell expects all employees to exemplify these principles. We continue to build out our initiatives to promote racial equality and inclusion and diversity, including employing mandatory unconscious bias training to our global workforce; establishing a global I&D student committee, co-sponsored by me; and fortifying Honeywell's I&D governance structure by embedding I&D councils into each business group. We also established 2021 goals for each of my direct reports that include an annual objective of driving diversity in his or her organization. 
These initiatives have yielded results. Women and people of color represent a higher percentage of the workforce at Honeywell compared to our peers. In addition, representation of women and people of color in Honeywell has increased each year since 2018, which is a testament to our ongoing commitment to hiring, developing and retaining diverse talent. Now let's wrap up on Slide 10. We delivered on our third quarter commitments despite a challenging backdrop. As always, we remain laser-focused on executing our strategic objectives and investing in growth opportunities that position our business well for the next phase of recovery. We're executing on our proven value creation framework with the rigor you can expect from Honeywell, which will continue to consistently drive shareholder value.

So the short answer to your question, Steve, is that, yes, we do expect the first half to grow. I think how much is going to be a little bit dependent upon some of the supply chain challenges that we pointed out that we're seeing in Q4. Frankly, we see it this way, which is on semiconductors, we actually see some positive tailwinds as we head into the first half next year. So that's good. I don't think that it's going to be completely alleviated, but it's going to get better. When it comes to some of the other components, particularly for Aerospace and some of the Tier 2, Tier 3 suppliers, particularly castings, forgings, things of that nature, we're not sure where we are in that improvement cycle because it really just kind of popped up in Q3 in a more acute phase. So we're a little more cautious there. But the short answer is we do expect growth in the first half of 2022. 
What I will say is that we have -- we'll have some headwinds in SPS due to sort of what I call COVID-related masks. But I think those are going to be particularly acute in Q1 of next year. They're evident here in Q4 of '21 and to a lesser extent, Q2 of 2022. And then it's kind of going to -- we're going to get back to that normal run rate. 
So we -- as you can see, I mean, it's -- the year '22 is setting up terrific. I mean, we're up double-digit orders growth in each of our SPGs. One exception, SPS is sort of, call it, mid-single digit. But if you exclude the impact of the COVID masks, we would be up double digit as well. So the only constraint that we see is, to some extent, the supply chain. And at least in semiconductors, we think that Q4 is the peak of those challenges. That's the way we see it today. Now I will say this lastly, which is it's a dynamic environment. There were some puts and takes here in Q3 that were probably more takes than positive. So we're going to monitor it as closely as Q4."

I think that, frankly, it's only recently that it's been realized how severe they are. But we've incorporated that in our guide for Q4. And I think we're working diligently to try to resolve them. I mean, we've been at this for 12 weeks now. And it's not just one way. It's not just pushing suppliers harder. It's also doing redesign, alternative products, finding different ways to generate revenue. So I think we've got a pretty good playbook. But I won't understate this. The challenges are real and very substantial."

On Defense & Space, as you saw, we kind of had a -- frankly, a bit of a disappointing double-digit negative for Q3. But remember that had we not sort of had some of these supply chain challenge, which really became very evident in Q3 because think about these as Q3, Q4 suppliers which are smaller, which reduced capacity during the pandemic. And now we're getting a lot of demand, not just from us but probably some of the other aerospace players. It's going to take some time to work through that, but we would have been down mid-single digits in Q3 had that not happened. We have, unfortunately, more past due than we want Defense & Space. That's went up substantially in Q3, and we've got to work our way through that. What I will tell you about Defense & Space is if you look at our bookings or where we are at this cycle, early Q4 versus where we were at the same period of last year, that gives us some -- well, quite a bit of confidence that we're looking at flat to low single digits. Now that could get even better. I don't know that it's going to get a lot worse. 
What we're seeing here is, if you recall, if you go back to 2020, we had very strong orders and revenue in 2020 in Defense & Space. And you see the effect of some level of usage and destocking by some of those Defense & Space customers and distributors. So we're optimistic about normalization of that in '22. And based on what we see today, and this is important to say today and this could change, we see flattish to low single-digit growth. And let's now switch gears and talk about commercial aftermarket. We see that continue to improve it. You saw that strong growth in Q3. We think it's going to continue to get better. We're still nowhere near the 2019 levels, but it continues to get better. As you know, November 8, we're going to open up the borders, and more international traffic is going to step up. So as more international comes back as COVID abates, which we think were going to happen here in Q4 and Q1 next year, we see continued growth in our aftermarket, coupled with stronger growth in OE, both in air transport as well as PGA. So the setup for Aerospace, I think, for '22 is quite good. Greg, I don't know if you..."

I mean, if you think about it, Nicole, last year, obviously, we were in a substantial cost-cutting mode and are repositioning pipeline. And the projects around that reflected it. This year, we always say that we continue the productivity playbook, fixed cost power one, create operating leverage by growing sales and holding fixed costs flat as just the mantra of the way we work. And so to Darius' point, we're not doing massive cost cutting. We are being smart about where we're putting it back, though, and we are using the things that we spoke about last year in terms of automation and our digital capabilities to help us deliver. 
I mean, I'll be honest. The supply chain work that we're doing, that Torsten and the team are doing are very much enabled by our Honeywell digital tools and capabilities and some of the visibility that he's put into his own capabilities in the supply chain to manage. So this isn't about cutting costs. It's about managing them properly, and we are investing back in the business, as Darius mentioned. But we're going to be doing it diligently. So I feel pretty good about the margin rate expansion. You would see the implied margin rate expansion is a little bit lower than what our guide was previously simply because the sales numbers are down. So we'll have a little bit less operating leverage from an opportunity standpoint, but still very healthy margin expansion in Q4."

I mean, steel is up 198% year-over-year; nickel, 25%; copper, 46%; aluminum, 66%. I mean, these are fairly substantial increases. So what we've been doing in more or less all of our businesses and particularly long cycle ones is trying to go back and reprice some of our backlog.

And the other business opportunity for us, which we're very excited about, is a focus in China on sustainability. And when we think about some of the UOP, HPS solutions and our Sustainability Technology Solutions business, that's going to create a giant opportunity for us in China and frankly, one we're very excited about.

I -- if interest rates go up, I do think it will probably cool off a little bit, so which may allow us to keep it more active. But we are active. We're looking at numerous deals. And nothing is 100% in the world of M&As, but we're hopeful we're going to be able to get something done. And certainly want to deploy our capital in that way, but it has to be the right business. It has to fit our technology orientation, has to get the right value for us, although nothing is cheap these days. And we're thrilled with what we're doing with Sparta.

Look, I think this is becoming fairly obvious, and we all read the same articles and see what's going on, which is there's going to have to be a reinvestment cycle. As much as we all want sustainable and renewable technologies to take over sort of the energy needs tomorrow, it's probably going to be a little bit of a longer term.  And it's very clear to me that there's going to be a reinvestment cycle. We're seeing a good reinvestment cycle when I call some of the shorter project, refurbishment focused at the installed base. But we're a strong believer that there's going to be a fairly strong reinvestment cycle in '22 and '23. I think that's necessary. So we're bullish on that segment. And certainly, the price of oil, price of gas support that kind of investment. I mean, if you look at gas and oil, I mean, they're very, very attractive levels. What we need now is some level of stability. So that's good. 
But let me give you a couple of other specific data points, Deane. Our renewable fuel orders this past quarter were up 86%. I mean, I think we forget sometimes that we just characterize UOP as oil and gas. It is not just oil and gas. It has an incredibly strong Green Fuels portfolio, which is winning in the marketplace. We've seen 86% growth.  Also some of the energy storage controls orders were up 64% this past quarter in our HPS business. So those are just a couple of data points for you that we are very excited about the energy future. We have a portfolio that's going to play in it.
