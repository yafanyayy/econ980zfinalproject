Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $18.75 for 2020, consistent with our commentary throughout the year as expected, reflecting a loss in the fourth quarter, largely driven by our investments in programs to support members, patients employers, providers and the communities we serve. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by the continued waiver of Medicare Advantage cost-sharing, including for primary care and COVID-19 treatment, delivery of meals, mask and prevented tests to our members, in-home assessments investments and programs to assist underserved communities and efforts to ease the financial burden for our provider partners. For the full year, these initiatives, among others, exceeded $2 billion. Defined by the worldwide pandemic, 2020 was an unprecedented and challenging year. I'm proud of the resilience and response of our associates, putting our members, patients and providers holistic health at the forefront, while continuing to advance our strategy. Despite the pandemic, Humana continued to accelerate on all fronts in 2020, including our short-term operating and financial performance, our ability to drive and invest in our long-term strategic objectives and in our customer-centric efforts. The strength of our underlying core business is compelling. In our Healthcare Services business, we delivered double-digit percentage growth and adjusted EBITDA year-over-year in 2020 with our pharmacy, provider and home business all performing well. In our Pharmacy business, we processed 478 million scripts and drove mail order penetration of over 37% in MAPD. Today, our Pharmacy business has organically grown to the fourth largest pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM. In our Provider business, we ended the year with 156 wholly owned primary care centers after opening 15 new centers in 2020, including expanding to Louisiana and Nevada. In addition, our Conviva primary care clinics delivered significant clinical and financial improvement as the turnaround in the business continued, including a 5% reduction in admissions per 1,000. In the Home, we've made important investments in our strategy to offer primary care and post-acute services in the home through minority investments in Heel, a pioneer of in-home primary care and dispatch health, a provider of emergent in-home medical care. In addition, Kindred at Home successfully managed the transition to the new CMS payment model, while also implementing a new operating system in 2020, setting it up to drive further operating model advancement in 2021. 
We demonstrated an over 50,000 home episodes integrated new proactive clinical models within the Nurse's workflow significantly reduces downstream emergency room visits and hospital admissions. The success of these clinical test and learns provides the confidence, scaling these programs will provide meaningful quality and cost improvements in 2021 and beyond. We also delivered strong fundamental results in our core insurance business while investing for the long term. We remain very focused on the consumer experience broadly across all platforms and are proud to have driven an overall 670 basis point increase in our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, in 2020, with a meaningfully higher increase in our NPS for our commercial group business. We also announced that 92% of our MA members are in plans rated 4 star or higher, leading the public traded MA companies. We ended the year with approximately 4.6 million total Medicare Advantage members, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11%, fueling consolidated revenue growth of 19% in 2020. The positive momentum continued in 2021 Medicare Advantage Annual Election Period, or AEP. For the full year, we are expecting individual MA growth of approximately 425,000 to 475,000 members or 11% to 12%. Importantly, as in prior years, our robust growth is balanced across multiple MA plan types as a result of the strength of our clinical programs, provider partnerships and distribution channels as well as our broad offerings that allow for deeper personalization to meet the member's needs. In the AEP, we led the industry in each of HMO, special needs plans, or D-SNP and MA-only membership growth and continue to grow our LPPO membership. We also launched Author by Humana in South Carolina in January, managing 5 Medicare Advantage plans with approximately 13,500 members. Author is designed to meet the emerging expectations of digital savvy seniors aging into Medicare, leveraging health coaches, digital and artificial intelligence, to create a simplify and integrated experience for consumers. We plan to scale Author by delegating more MA lives overtime and look forward to sharing our learnings. 
We continue to focus on how we can expand our presence with underserved populations, an effort to drive improved clinical outcomes and reduce health disparities. In Medicare Advantage, we experienced industry-leading growth in D-SNPs in 2020, increasing D-SNP's membership approximately 41% year-over-year. We expect another year of robust D-SNP membership growth in 2021. Our Medicaid strategy is predicated on the core strengths of our Medicare chassis, including our clinical programs, provider relationships, focus on value-based care and commitment to investments in the communities we serve. We are able to offer state individualized approach to care that considers the physical and mental well-being of beneficiaries as well as the critical social determinants that impact the population. We began serving Medicare members in Kentucky in 2020 and recently announced our entry into the South Carolina Medicaid program as well as the acquisition of Eye Care in Wisconsin. We firmly believe organic growth is the most efficient use of capital for our shareholders and remain committed to further organic Medicaid growth supplemented by smaller tuck-in acquisitions. We have a long history of success growing our Medicare Advantage and pharmacy businesses organically, and in just the last week, we were awarded the Managed Medicare Contract in Oklahoma, a state that previously did not offer Managed Medicaid. I would like to thank the Medicaid team for their tireless efforts and congratulate them on these key wins. 
As I reflect on what we've learned from the pandemic, I am energized by the way the collective health care system responded to the crisis and how actions taken to combat pandemic strengthened and accelerated critical tenets of the system. As an industry, in partnership with policymakers, we took deliberate and sustain actions to remove financial barriers and enhance access to care in response to the pandemic, easing some of the burden on our nation's most vulnerable population at a time when they need it most. Supported by CMS, health plans and providers proactively address social determinants of health that were exacerbated by the pandemic and quickly pivoted to the telephonic and in-home care, advancing in a matter of months what may have taken years absent the pandemic. Our combined actions underscore the strength of the Medicare Advantage program as an enduring public-private partnership that puts seniors and their holistic health at the forefront. Humana's pandemic response continues to evolve, and we are actively engaged with the Biden administration, including HHS and CMS as well as state and local governments regarding our role in the vaccination process as both a primary care provider and as a health plan, representing a significant portion of the nation's most vulnerable population. As such, our role is multifaceted, and we stand ready to assist further as the nationwide distribution progresses to later phases and more and more individuals become eligible for the vaccine. Driven by our strong care coordination capabilities, our role includes identification of eligible members utilizing our analytics, vaccination education and concierge services, second dose reminders and ensuring we follow-up on any complications. We are also engaged in industry-wide efforts to conduct vaccine surveillance, identify regions where vaccinations are lagging and intervene to help our members access vaccine. By collaborating with other health insurances, we can align regionally communication efforts to educate and engage members and reduce disparities in vaccine use across the U.S.  Equity and health care is an area that we are particularly focused on, recognizing that we must play a critical role, working closely with our industry and governmental partners to address the imbalance that exists today. Data shows that Medicare Advantage is continuing to grow as the preferred option for those who are low income and for racial and ethnic minorities. Of the nearly 26 million Advantage -- Medicare Advantage members, there is a growing diversity and enrollment with more than 28% of the beneficiaries being racial and ethnic minor orders as compared to 21% at traditional Medicare. This day demonstrates that as we think about disparities in health care for underserved populations, Medicare Advantage plans are uniquely positioned to address the needs of these members. Humana is committed to leverage our business platforms to support local communities and their efforts to lower social and health disparities. This includes enhancing access to care by continuing to expand and build primary care centers in underserved markets, offering supplemental benefits, including over-the-counter medication coverage, transportation, dental and vision as well as taking the leadership role in enhancing innovative solutions aimed at addressing social determinants for both Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, we recently named Dr. Land Aloha to the newly created position of Senior Vice President and Chief Equity Officer effective in April of this year. Dr. Aloha will set direction and establish strategy to promote health equity across all Humana lines of business, including our care delivery assets while working collaboratively with the broader health care community to advance health equity so health care can work better for everyone, regardless of background, age or economic status. 
In closing, we remain committed to public-private partnerships that are solution orient and drive results that will meaningfully benefit the health care system in the coming years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Today, we reported full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share of $18.75, consistent with our guidance commentary throughout the year. As Bruce described in detail, despite the unique challenges we faced in 2020 due to the pandemic, our fundamentals remain very strong. With the underlying core business delivering compelling results for the full year, including a 19% increase in consolidated revenue and an 11% increase in our total Medicare Advantage membership. We were also pleased to be able to maintain stable benefits and premiums for our members, despite the return of the $1.2 billion health insurance fee, or HIF, which was not deductible for tax purposes and disproportionately impacted our business relative to the competition. In addition, I would like to echo Bruce's congratulations to our Medicaid team for our recent contract awards in Oklahoma and our announced expansion in South Carolina. These awards further demonstrate our ability to drive organic Medicaid growth, and together with our Eye Care acquisition in Wisconsin, expand our Medicaid presence from 3 states to 6. 
I will turn now to our fourth quarter results and underlying trends, which provide important context for our initial 2021 guide. As expected, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $2.30 for the first -- for the fourth quarter of 2020 on account of the significant investments made in all of our constituents because of the pandemic. Further, as disclosed in our 8-K, filed January 8, we experienced a significant increase in COVID treatment and testing costs across the nation in November and December. For full year 2020, we incurred $1.5 billion in gross COVID treatment costs, $1.3 billion of which were related to Medicare or $825 million net of capitation to providers in risk arrangements. As a result of the dramatic increase in COVID during these months, we also experienced a decline in non-COVID utilization in the fourth quarter, particularly for Medicare, as fewer people sought nonemergent care. As a result, non-COVID Medicare utilization was approximately 15% below baseline in November and December after having yearly returned to baseline levels in October. Overall utilization in the quarter, including COVID costs, was a bit below baseline for Medicare and above for commercial. While the magnitude of these changes was unexpected, the decline in non-COVID utilization in the quarter relative to our prior expectations more than offset the increase in COVID treatment and testing costs. We were, therefore, able to increase our spending for ongoing pandemic relief efforts and investments to advance the company's strategy. It is important to note that investments in the group and specialty segment in the quarter, particularly those intended to ease financial stress for providers while positioning the business for long-term success, were disproportionate relative to the reduction in non-COVID utilization levels for the company's commercial group medical and specialty members, significantly increasing the segment's benefit ratio. In addition, as it's customary, marketing costs associated with the Medicare Advantage Annual Election Period, along with COVID-related investments, were heavily weighted to the fourth quarter in our retail segment as reflected in our operating cost ratio. 
I will now speak to our expectations and related assumptions for 2021. Today, we are providing adjusted EPS guidance for 2021 of $21.25 to $21.75, reflecting approximately 16% growth off of our $18.50 2020 baseline at the midpoint. While this guidance is consistent with our previous high level 2021 commentary from our third quarter earnings call, the embedded COVID assumptions in today's guidance have changed materially since that time, with largely offsetting headwinds and tailwinds in revenue and benefits expense. This is consistent with our previous commentary that there are natural countervailing forces between trends in COVID treatment costs and trends in non-COVID utilization. Importantly, in an effort to simplify any explanations we are going to provide, we have included a slide on our Investor Relations website, which summarizes the expected full year impact of the various material headwinds and tailwinds to our guidance today, rather than discussing any incremental changes since the third quarter conference call. At the time of that call, we reflected both revenue and expense puts and takes into our high-level commentary about expected 2021 financial performance. Since that time, the magnitude of the COVID-related impacts have increased significantly. Therefore, as I said, we will provide full year estimates, inclusive of where we stood at the time of the third quarter call  so as to provide our investors with a comprehensive assessment of our latest estimates. I would note that this heightened level of transparency, whereby we provide granular assumptions on a number of variables, is necessitated by the unique the unique uncertainties that the pandemic creates for our 2021 financial outlook. I would also note that the numbers we are providing today are for individual and group Medicare Advantage only as the net impact of a pandemic on our other lines of business is currently expected to be relatively immaterial. Additionally, it is important to note that we are providing reasonably wide ranges, given the inherent uncertainty of our estimates for each line item. And finally, so as to make it easier for investors to understand the full financial picture, all the COVID-related figures we are discussing today are net numbers. After taking into account, our capitation agreements in which provider groups take risk in whole or in part on the member. 
With that context, I will now discuss the material COVID-related headwinds and tailwinds and facing our Medicare business in 2021. I will begin with Medicare Risk Adjustment, or MRA. We now expect an MRA revenue headwind of approximately $700 million to $1 billion, representing 1% to 1.5% of Medicare premium for the full year. As a reminder, Humana's 2021 Medicare Advantage revenue is primarily driven by the risk assumed care for our membership, established through conditions documented by providers within the 2020 calendar year. While we know the 2021 prospective payment amounts from CMS based on diagnosis codes incurred through June of 2020 and submitted by the first Friday in September, over the coming months, these payments will be adjusted to reflect additional conditions documented for claims incurred within the 2020 calendar year. While we estimate and accrue for the incremental revenue from anticipated submissions as the year progresses, there is a higher degree of uncertainty in our revenue projections compared to a normal year. 
Let me spend a few minutes addressing the drivers of this increased uncertainty. First, while we worked tirelessly throughout 2020 to ensure members had access to and we're receiving the appropriate level of care, including by significantly increasing outreach and availability of in-home care and providing access to video telehealth clinician visits, the meaningful drop in non-COVID medical utilization in November and December was not expected. Those are important months as they round out our ability to drive meaningful clinical interactions with our members, and therefore, the unexpected decline in utilization affected our ability to appropriately document their conditions. Second, the mix of utilization was very different in 2020 relative to prior years. For example, the dramatic increase in the number of telehealth visits from 2019 to 2020, although critical in allowing our members to access care, while affording us the opportunity to document their conditions, nonetheless, creates greater uncertainty around the type and volume of diagnoses codes collected. Separately, utilization for in-patient and non-in-patient continued to increase for COVID diagnosis throughout the year. Accordingly, within the mix of submissions from 2020 that drive our 2021 revenue, we also expect organic diagnosis code submissions tied to COVID claims for which we have limited visibility at this time. These are just 2 examples of how emerging experience in 2020 creates more uncertainty in our MRA revenue projections for 2021 because we are not able to place the same level of reliance on historical trends as compared to a normal year. 
I will now discuss COVID-related utilization. As a general rule, we have seen an inverse relationship between COVID treatment costs and levels of non-COVID utilization as surges in the pandemic led to less nonessential care being sought by our members. While the ratio of COVID treatment to non-COVID depressed utilization has varied, to date, we have seen in our Medicare book that the level of depressed utilization has more than offset the treatment cost. The shape of the COVID case curve is one of the largest drivers of these 2 related factors, and as such, they remain the 2 largest sources of uncertainty for 2021, given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic. To set a bit more context around what we are seeing currently, the COVID and non-COVID utilization trends we saw in the fourth quarter persisted throughout January. Medicare in-patient non-COVID utilization is running approximately 20% below baseline. With non -- in-patient reduction percentages in the low teens, with a significant caveat that we have a much better view of inpatient emissions for which we receive weekly authorization data than we do for non in-patient utilization. Importantly, the increased COVID treatment costs incurred in November and December 2020 ramped up quickly with the reduction in non-COVID utilization initially lagging that ramp as would be expected. We expect the inverse to occur in 2021, such that when COVID treatment costs begin to decline, the rate of decline will likely be steeper than the bounce back in non-COVID utilization, potentially creating a favorable impact for a more prolonged period of time. This is consistent with what we saw throughout 2020 as COVID cases ramped up and then declined in various markets. As a result, we now expect Medicare COVID treatment and testing costs of $525 million to $925 million, which when combined with the Medicare physician fee schedule increase that I will discuss in a minute, represents approximately 1.9% to 3.1% of normalized Medicare claim costs. This is similar to what we experienced in 2020 and is consistent with the expectation that the pandemic will begin to subside as more people get vaccinated through the first and second quarters. 
In addition, subsequent to the third quarter call, a net claims headwind of $175 million to $200 million resulted from the increase to the physician fee schedule rates for 2021 as part of the December stimulus bill, partially offset by a net $80 million to $90 million impact from the Medicare sequester relief extension through March 31. Our guidance to date does not assume that the sequester relief will be extended for the rest of the year. Finally, for full year 2021, we currently expect a reduction of $1.3 billion to $2 billion in Medicare non-COVID utilization off a normalized claims pattern, including lower flu costs, which are significantly reduced compared to normal seasonal patterns. This reflects overall non-COVID annual reductions of approximately 3.6% to 5.5% of a normalized claim pattern, and inclusive of COVID treatment costs, a reduction of approximately 1.7% to 2.4%. For full year 2020, the all-in reduction with and without COVID was approximately 5.9% and 8.6%, respectively. We, of course, acknowledge that the ranges we are providing are wide and are a consequence of the continued heightened uncertainty surrounding the ongoing pandemic. We recognize that it will take at least several months to both ascertain from CMS, the negative impact to our 2021 revenue growth expectations, resulting from decreased utilization experience in 2020, including, in particular, the unanticipated depression in non-COVID utilization in the final 2 months of 2020 and to the extent to which this reduction in utilization and associated medical cost impact net of COVID-related expenses persists into 2021. With respect to quarterly utilization patterns, our guidance ranges assume that we will experience non-COVID utilization levels that reflect double-digit percentage reductions to baseline levels throughout the first few months of 2021, before ramping back up and running slightly above baseline levels towards the end of the year. Similarly, we assume COVID testing and treatment costs will continue to run at the higher levels experienced in November and December in the first quarter of 2021 and trend down as the vaccine becomes more widely available in the second quarter. 
With that said, there are a range of potential scenarios, and we would expect any variance in our assumptions around COVID treatment costs to be more than offset by a change in non-COVID utilization. As I said before, we expect that COVID and non-COVID utilization are driven by naturally countervailing forces. Also as a reminder, we believe capacity constraints in the health care system will prevent non-COVID utilization from running materially above baseline and also limit the amount of time a modest increase above a normal baseline could continue. Therefore, given the deviation from historical patterns we will experience in 2021, forecasting quarterly EPS split is much more difficult than usual, but we do expect a meaningfully higher portion of our earnings coming in the first quarter that we typically see. As such, we expect the first quarter to contribute just below 1/3 of the annual total versus a more typical first quarter, which will contribute 800 to 1,000 basis points less. As an important aside, while utilization patterns will be most significantly affected in the first quarter of the year, we expect the negative impact on revenue to be more equally split throughout the year. 
Now that I've walked you through the material Medicare headwinds and tailwinds, I'm going to turn to our expected operating performance by segment. I encourage you to reference the waterfall slide provided on our Investor Relations website with the webcast materials. As outlined in the waterfall, given the pandemic, we must first reset the baseline off of which to grow 2021 adjusted EPS. As discussed previously, our starting point is $18.50, which represents the midpoint of our initial adjusted EPS guide for 2020 and effectively neutralizes for any COVID impacts throughout 2020. Importantly, we believe we struck the appropriate balance in our pricing between top and bottom line growth while investing for long-term sustainability, contemplating both the permanent repeal of the health insurance industry fee and the significant impact of the pandemic, which creates more uncertainty than we would experience in a typical year. Our 2021 consolidated revenue guidance of $80.3 billion to $81.9 billion at the book midpoint reflects year-over-year growth of approximately 8% from adjusted 2020 consolidated revenue. This growth is primarily driven by our expected 11% to 12% individual MA membership growth, partially offset by anticipated declines in group MA and standalone PDP membership. The revenue is also adversely impacted by the MRA headwind previously discussed as well as fewer months of sequester relief in 2021 versus 2020. Additionally, and as previously discussed, the after-tax benefit of the hit was worth approximately $2 in EPS, and we took a balanced approach in increasing our benefits to our members while providing enhanced earnings to our shareholders. We have incorporated the hints impact in the segment waterfall bars. 
In our Retail segment, we are excited about the balanced Medicare growth we have seen, in particularly our industry-leading D-SNP growth. Our Medicaid business also continues to perform very well, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead for this growing business. Taken together, the Retail segment is expected to show strong operating improvement as demonstrated in the waterfall, contributing an incremental $1.21 to adjusted EPS. With respect to our Group and Specialty segment, while we are facing some pressures on account of the pandemic, specifically as it relates to actions by our competitors to retain membership, the business continues to execute on its growth strategy, and we are excited about the prospects for our major medical, specialty and military businesses. We expect the segment to contribute approximately $0.05 of incremental adjusted EPS to the enterprise for 2021. For Healthcare Services, we experienced double-digit adjusted EBITDA percentage growth from 2019 to 2020 and expect high-teens growth year-over-year in 2021. Accordingly, we expect the increase in Healthcare Services adjusted EBITDA to contribute an incremental $1.72 to adjusted EPS. In our Pharmacy business, we anticipate continued momentum, primarily driven by our strong Medicare Advantage membership growth and continued increased mail order penetration. Likewise, our Home business is anticipated to perform well, led by Kindred at Home, and our wholly owned provider businesses continue to improve core operating performance while meaningfully expanding our primary care center footprint, as Bruce described. In summary, our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of $21.25 to $21.75 reflects growth of 16% from the 18.50 baseline at the midpoint, modestly above our long-term target of 11% to 15%. Since 2017, following the termination of the Aetna merger, the company has achieved an adjusted EPS compounded annual growth rate of 16.4%, which is above the top end of our 11% to 15% long-term growth commitment we have made to our investors. 
While it's very early, I want to close with some preliminary thoughts on our current view of 2022. Our expectation is that 2022 will be a more normal year, and as we get into the spring and summer, we expect the vaccine to take hold and COVID utilization to decline, allowing non-COVID utilization to trend back to more normal levels, enabling providers to see our members in the ordinary course and appropriately document their clinical conditions, resulting in more normalized medical costs and revenue expectations for 2022. Therefore, barring any major unforeseen circumstances or significant changes in the course of the pandemic, the midpoint of the 2021 adjusted EPS guidance that we provided today were 21.50 is the baseline off of which investors should think about growing earnings for 2022. As we do every year, we will consider a variety of factors as we approach our bids in the spring, including any lingering impacts of a pandemic either on revenue or utilization relative to baseline as well as other external dynamics.

Rolling forward to the third quarter when we gave guidance, obviously, a lot of things by definition changed since pricing and the sort of the high-level guidance we gave at the time reflected our current view of those headwinds and tailwinds that we would face. I would also remind you that as we've said multiple times throughout the year that our operators are spending a significant amount of time working to try to mitigate any of those revenue headwinds by really trying to see our members, which was really important to get into their homes, visit them either in-person or via telehealth, where we would also have the benefit of being able to document their conditions. And so we took a really significant effort, invested a lot of dollars to be able to do that. And so as we approach the third quarter, we understood where we were relative to those expectations and obviously, updated our utilization expectations for 2021. And in that context, we provided 2021 guidance or high level guidance. November, December happened, a lot changed, significant decrease in utilization, which was unexpected as the COVID pandemic really took off and hit levels that really exceeded any expectations, and we're much higher levels that were even hit in the spring and was nationwide. And so that clearly impacted our perspective. And so as we approach the JPMorgan Conference in January, we felt it was important to get out to our investors to provide some high-level commentary on what we are seeing of potential countervailing headwinds and tailwinds.  So we've done that. Here, we provided, obviously, a lot of granular detail on that, but there is a lot of variation in these numbers. I mean, you can see there are wide ranges, and we've deliberately provide those wide ranges. We think what's on this page is obviously reasonable. There is nothing that we're seeing that suggest that these numbers aren't reasonable, but where we fall in these ranges on all these variables matters a lot. And that's something, obviously, that we're going to continue to watch closely, and as appropriate, we would update investors on that. But I would just say, as we said in our remarks that 2021 has heightened uncertainty relative to what we thought coming into the year into your question on the HIF. We actually feel we achieved an appropriate balance between giving dollars back to our members through higher benefits, which we did, and giving higher EPS growth to our shareholders where we're exceeding our typical 11% to 15% growth. And at our midpoint, notwithstanding all the COVID headwinds and tailwinds, we're still able to guide to a midpoint that's above that range. So we think we've achieved the right balance. There is no doubt that 2021 has a heightened level of uncertainty, and we're going to be monitoring it very closely and keep you updated, which is why we've also, I think, anchored investors on 2022 with the hope and expectation that, that will be a much more normal year."

So we're not going to provide a lot of details on 2022, obviously. With respect to the utilization patterns, as we mentioned in our remarks, we expect the first quarter to see the most depressed utilization and certainly, the highest COVID treatment cost. And so those, as I mentioned, offset one another, but again, we expect that most sort of utilization depression will occur in the first quarter. We expect the utilization to remain depressed in the second quarter, although not as much, and then we expect it to ramp up more towards normal than a bit above normal as we approach the back half of the year and the end of the year. So that's how we're broadly thinking about it, which we think is consistent with what we're seeing with the vaccinations and the progress there. As that impacts 2022, it's really hard to give specifics at this point. Again, we'll have to decide when we get to the spring, what's appropriate to reflect in our bids. We'll be very mindful of what we're seeing in terms of headwinds and tailwinds with respect to COVID and revenue and utilization like we were this year. But beyond that, I wouldn't want to comment other than to say, we do think 21.50 is a reasonable baseline off of which to think about 2022 without providing any more specifics beyond that today."

I think it's fair to say that new members tend to be breakeven. If these steps may run a little bit better out of the gate, but not a lot of profitability in the first year. Certainly, as we get to the second and third year, we start getting to more of our normalized margins as we're able to document our members' conditions and also get them in our clinical programs and that really hasn't changed. I think that's consistent with what we've seen, and certainly, that's what we typically plan for in our bids. We think without providing too much detail on 2022, I think it's fair to say that you might see effectively a catch-up in 2022. So any MRA revenue headwind we've seen in 2022, which is a function of sort of our existing membership base. And remember, it's not just the members that we have, but it's also the new members that we got, particularly if they were in other Medicare plans. So if they're a switcher, they would also have sort of -- we'd have less of their documentation than normal for the same reasons because our competitors weren't able to get those conditions documented either. And so you will see sort of the -- for us, the 2021 cohort as well as, frankly, some of our other cohorts where we weren't able to redocument their conditions, you will see more of a sort of an increase in 2022. And that will be something that we planned for in our bids as we figure out what percent of normal do we expect to be for 2022 based on 2021 utilization. Hopefully, that was clear."

But I would just say, as it relates to utilization, we've been thoughtful about sort of normalized trends and then think about what the impact might be when we did our pricing for 2021 and all these various variables that we've talked about. Really, what we mean by normalized baseline is actually, really straightforward, which is to say if you were -- if you just stripped out COVID entirely, what would the claims assumption be, based on sort of the normal inflators we would use from 2021 over 2020. And so whatever sort of secular trends and other things that we build in, trend vendors and other things, we get to sort of a net trend ex-COVID and that's really the baseline. Just to give you a -- make it easier for you to compare relative to, say, on 2020 ex-COVID and what the baseline reduction is. And that's why I tried to say sort of ex-COVID for Medicare, it was, call it, 8.5%, 8.6% down for 2020 relative to the 3.6% to 5.5% that we guided today. So again, we think that number is reasonable. Again, we could be wrong. That's -- there's just a wide range here. And I guess, I just emphasize that there is more uncertainty around this 2021 number than we would typically have because when we formulate those trend assumptions that you were asking about, we have a lot of historical experience. We have hundreds of actuaries, very smart people working on our trend assumptions. It's something that we think we're very good at and ensuring we baked in the appropriate levels of potential tread variances. We're dealing here in a whole new world with a pandemic where we have no historical experience. And so that creates some of the challenges in our forecasting."

They're not able to schedule the surgeries, for example, it just takes time for the system to ramp back up. So there is just sort of a natural trail off that -- just given the volumes we're talking about, they're not insignificant. And it's one of the reasons why we had the tailwinds we had in 2020 was that delay. It just takes time to get the gears cranking again, and they will crank again. And we certainly forecast that, but there is that delay. To the extent the vaccine rolls out more slowly or there is a variance in the virus that we've heard and that they're not as effective. That, for sure, can affect our ranges here. We try to capture what we think are reasonable ranges based on today's sets of facts and circumstances. To the extent those facts and circumstances change, it's conceivable that some of these sort of COVID treatment versus non-COVID cost, that could be impacted. Again, it's likely that because there is a -- there is that inverse correlation. They will offset one another. Though in the Medicare business, it tends to lead to a tailwind, as we mentioned. The commercial business is not as clear. As you mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we are running a little bit above par all-in, but for the Medicare business, we were below. 
The investments, to your question there, we really, I would say, pull all those out for 2021. So there is really not any additional flexibility there. We were very clear to confine those investments in 2020, and as we've described, we benefit all of our constituents and really gave back a lot of those dollars, which is important to do, but that was not baked in in any way into our 2021 pricing or to our guide."

And so this is the sort of the full headwind that we currently face, and again, we want to be very transparent, but this is net of our mitigation efforts. As it relates to yields, we typically don't, as you know, guide to PMPMs, but just to help you out, I would say, it sort of flat, maybe modestly up is the way I would describe our  individual MA PMPM expectations, and we'll see where that ultimately goes. But there are a lot of things that impact that, Justin, as you know. Obviously, MRA is one of them. The rate notice is another. Sequester is another. Remember, there is fewer months of sequester relief this year. Business mix is a very significant driver because there are pretty disparate rates around the country. So depending on where you grow, that can impact it. So there are a host of things that impact yields, but it's a fair question and understand where you're going. 
Now I would be disappointed if you didn't ask us about the margin question. So I'm glad you took the opportunity, and I know it's a fair question. I think it's important when you look at the overall retail margin is to -- remember that there are multiple businesses inside the Retail segment. First off, the margin has been impacted by the HIF and the fact that it was nondeductible. So there is a lot of geography going on there, and certainly, we thought about after tax. I mean we sort of managed to pretax, but think about the after-tax impact as we thought about our pricing, et cetera. As we just discussed, we balance giving back some of the tax benefit, both to our members in the form of higher benefits as well as to our shareholders. So there is some geography issues that will impact and depress the margin. There are also, as we've discussed on the PDP side, a lot of the margin has come out of that product. And in fact, most of the margin today, if not all, the margin today is in the pharmacy for us. We've talked about how that product has become much more of a commodity product at these levels of premium. It's hard to make money on the insurance side, and so we're doing nicely on the Pharmacy side. And so we want to -- we'll continue to be aggressive in this business. And as Bruce commented in his remarks, our mail order penetration continues to -- we can reach very, very high levels both on the MA side, but also on the PDP side. So -- but again, that's a geography issue. So as you think about individual MA margins, you need to take that into account. Also, just to be transparent here, group MA has seen some margin impacts from some of the larger accounts that have been shifting back and forth between major competitors. When there is margin to those accounts when they get rebid, sometimes takes a few years to recover that margin. And so that's also driving some of the impact there, too. So it is, for sure, in the case that we are below our 4.5% to 5% target. I would say you're reasonably below that target. We are committed to that over the longer term to get back to that 4.5% to 5%, but I would just say there are a lot of things impacting that number, and there is a lot of sort of variables embedded in that retail overall guide that you're looking at."

All that combined, that's why you see us aggressively pursuing on both our affiliated relationships and in addition, building our primary care clinics to place our members in those clinics. The challenge with the clinic side is just the organic. There is not enough capacity in the marketplace to fill the demand. So you see a lot of start-up clinics -- from a start-up point of view being invested into to build the capacity there, and so for us, for more capacity constraint as opposed to -- for our growth. Our growth traditionally has been at equal to and greater than what you see in the traditional 10% to 12% growth that you've seen over the last few years in these clinics and getting more and more members in those clinics. And I think you'll see that growth accelerate as the capacity becomes more and more available for us. On the value-based provider side of the business, outside of the ones that are clinic oriented, we continue to see really, really great -- good results from that.

What we expect is, as we've said for a number of quarters here, we think it's going to take several years to get up to the Medicare Advantage penetration. We think that continues to be the case, and so again, I'd say right in line with our expectations. These are not profitable members. I think overtime, as we continue to manage them and work with partners and really try to get them before they get the ESRD and slow their disease progression. We think there is real opportunities to drive profitability, but I would say, we're getting to a point where it's more or less breakeven as opposed to having any meaningful losses on these members.

Effectively, the assumption is the public health emergency ends in April will -- if that happens, then we expect to lose some lives because we saw a nice increase this past year, but as the redeterminations happen, that will cause that membership to decline. And so I would say that's sort of our base case expectation as we think about our overall guidance and revenue, et cetera. To the extent that the public up emergency is extended, the redeterminations don't happen, that will cause the increase in membership to continue, which -- again, I think would be relatively immaterial to the overall enterprise, but would cause us to have a higher membership at the end of the year, and that, of course, excludes anything from South Carolina or Oklahoma, which will kick in later this year, and our guide excludes that."

I think to broaden your question a little bit, what we do see is that when we do have value-based relationships and the proactiveness really helping the member in this time is so important for us, especially as you think about downstream cost and other conditions that could occur, if not properly maintained and traded. So to answer your question, we don't see much in COVID bundling the type of payment, but we do see very different proactive care models in our value-based payment relationships in this time, especially with the more vulnerable populations."

We did see an increase in mail penetration as we looked for the -- in the early part of the COVID pandemic. We saw it in the March and April timeframe as people were really concerned about the lockdown that was happening, and therefore, we're taking 90-day prescriptions and really utilizing the mail order along with the fact that they couldn't get to the drug stores if they were normal users and became more active users of the mail order. What we have seen is as a result of the convenience of mail order and really, I would say, as a result of our service improvement we've seen, more and more people really converting to mail order as a result of that. And so the pandemic we have seen has helped educate individuals of the benefit of may order and the ability to continue to utilize it on an ongoing basis as opposed to just through the pandemic and some of the shutdown periods. So we look at it first as really an accelerator for us in that. The second thing is that we have a very active investment going in into making it much more consumer friendly on the mail order side, all the way from the digital platforms that are being used to the turnaround time of delivery to be able to ensure that we can meet the the expectations and the changing expectations of customers today on when they expect deliveries to happen. And I would say that our goal is to really grow the penetration of mail order in our existing book of business. 
You asked why sort of high the penetration, I would say it's been a very concentrated effort by our management team and really all the way from our service centers on the insurance side to our providers that we have relationships with to our specialty pharmacy area continuing to remind our members of the benefits of the mail order. And that continued use of throughout the organization of being -- bringing the mail order conversation then at the appropriate period of time has really assisted us being able to increase that rate from a much different rate that is the average in the industry to really a superior rate that you see having."

And both of those have been, I think, reducing the barriers and really creating, as you said, on incentives to use use telehealth. We really have a few different strategies of using telehealth. I mean one is around really helping our providers if they don't have telehealth and providing them some some technology that would offer them to utilize it. That's in a small need for external providers as they have all sort of become very acquainted with telehealth and being able to use it. Our internal -- our own providers, we offer them a very sophisticated telehealth platform that they can outreach on the telehealth side. And then the third area that we look at is continuing to work with hospital systems, especially in the specialty area, where we can have an outreach where specialists might be in and short supply in certain markets and being able to offer that at a convenience in the local marketplace.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $18.75 for 2020, consistent with our commentary throughout the year as expected, reflecting a loss in the fourth quarter, largely driven by our investments in programs to support members, patients, employers, providers and the communities we serve. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by the continued waiver of Medicare Advantage cost-sharing, including for primary care and COVID-19 treatment, delivery of meals, mask and prevented tests to our members, in-home assessments, investments in programs to assist underserved communities and efforts to ease the financial burden for our provider partners. 
For the full year, these initiatives, among others, exceeded $2 billion. Defined by the worldwide pandemic, 2020 was an unprecedented and challenging year. I'm proud of the resilience and response of our associates, putting our members, patients and providers' holistic health at the forefront, while continuing to advance our strategy. Despite the pandemic, Humana continued to accelerate on all fronts in 2020, including our short-term operating and financial performance, our ability to drive and invest in our long-term strategic objectives and in our customer-centricity efforts. 
The strength of our underlying core business is compelling. In our Healthcare Services business, we delivered double-digit percentage growth in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year in 2020 with our pharmacy, provider and home business all performing well. In our Pharmacy business, we processed 478 million scripts and drove mail order penetration of over 37% in MAPD. Today, our Pharmacy business has organically grown to the fourth largest pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM. In our provider business, we ended the year with 156 wholly owned primary care centers after opening 15 new centers in 2020, including expanding to Louisiana and Nevada. 
In addition, our Conviva primary care clinics delivered significant clinical and financial improvement as the turnaround in the business continued, including a 5% reduction in admissions per 1,000. In the Home, we've made important investments in our strategy to offer primary care and post-acute services in the home through minority investments in Heal, a pioneer of in-home primary care; and DispatchHealth, a provider of emergent in-home medical care. In addition, Kindred at Home successfully managed the transition to the new CMS payment model, while also implementing a new operating system in 2020, setting it up to drive further operating model advancement in 2021.  
We demonstrated an over 50,000 Home episodes, integrated new proactive clinical models within the nurses' workflow significantly reduces downstream emergency room visits and hospital admissions. The success of these clinical test and learns provides the confidence scaling these programs will provide meaningful quality and cost improvements in 2021 and beyond. We also delivered strong fundamental results in our core insurance business while investing for the long term. We remain very focused on the consumer experience broadly across all platforms and are proud to have driven an overall 670 basis point increase in our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, in 2020, with a meaningfully higher increase in our NPS for our commercial group business. 
We also announced that 92% of our MA members are in plans rated 4 star or higher, leading the public-traded MA companies. We ended the year with approximately 4.6 million total Medicare Advantage members, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11%, fueling consolidated revenue growth of 19% in 2020. The positive momentum continued in 2021 Medicare Advantage Annual Election Period, or AEP. For the full year, we are expecting individual MA growth of approximately 425,000 to 475,000 members or 11% to 12%. Importantly, as in prior years, our robust growth is balanced across multiple MA plan types as a result of the strength of our clinical programs, provider partnerships and distribution channels as well as our broad offerings that allow for deeper personalization to meet the member's needs. 
In the AEP, we led the industry in each of HMO, special needs plans or D-SNP, and MA-only membership growth and continue to grow our LPPO membership. We also launched Author by Humana in South Carolina in January, managing 5 Medicare Advantage plans with approximately 13,500 members. Author is designed to meet the emerging expectations of digital savvy seniors aging into Medicare, leveraging health coaches, digital and artificial intelligence, to create a simplify and integrated experience for consumers. We plan to scale Author by delegating more MA lives over time and look forward to sharing our learnings.  
We continue to focus on how we can expand our presence with underserved populations, an effort to drive improved clinical outcomes and reduce health disparities. In Medicare Advantage, we experienced industry-leading growth in D-SNPs in 2020, increasing D-SNP membership approximately 41% year-over-year. We expect another year of robust D-SNP membership growth in 2021. Our Medicaid strategy is predicated on the core strengths of our Medicare chassis, including our clinical programs, provider relationships focused on value-based care and commitment to investments in the communities we serve. We are able to offer states individualized approach to care that considers the physical and mental well-being of beneficiaries as well as the critical social determinants that impact the population. 
We began serving Medicare members in Kentucky in 2020 and recently announced our entry into the South Carolina Medicaid program as well as the acquisition of iCare in Wisconsin. We firmly believe organic growth is the most efficient use of capital for our shareholders and remain committed to further organic Medicaid growth supplemented by smaller tuck-in acquisitions. We have a long history of success growing our Medicare Advantage and pharmacy businesses organically, and in just the last week, we were awarded the Managed Medicare contract in Oklahoma, a state that previously did not offer Managed Medicaid. I would like to thank the Medicaid team for their tireless efforts and congratulate them on these key wins. 
As I reflect on what we've learned from the pandemic, I am energized by the way the collective health care system responded to the crisis and how actions taken to combat the pandemic strengthened and accelerated critical tenets of the system. As an industry, in partnership with policymakers, we took deliberate and sustained actions to remove financial barriers and enhance access to care in response to the pandemic, easing some of the burden on our nation's most vulnerable population at a time when they need it most. Supported by CMS, health plans and providers proactively addressed social determinants of health that were exacerbated by the pandemic and quickly pivoted to the telephonic and in-home care, advancing in a matter of months what may have taken years absent the pandemic. 
Our combined actions underscore the strength of the Medicare Advantage program as an enduring public-private partnership that puts seniors and their holistic health at the forefront. Humana's pandemic response continues to evolve, and we are actively engaged with the Biden administration, including HHS and CMS as well as state and local governments regarding our role in the vaccination process as both a primary care provider and as a health plan, representing a significant portion of the nation's most vulnerable population. 
As such, our role is multifaceted, and we stand ready to assist further as the nationwide distribution progresses to later phases and more and more individuals become eligible for the vaccine. Driven by our strong care coordination capabilities, our role includes identification of eligible members utilizing our analytics, vaccination education and concierge services, second dose reminders and ensuring we follow-up on any complications. We are also engaged in industry-wide efforts to conduct vaccine surveillance, identify regions where vaccinations are lagging and intervene to help our members access vaccine. By collaborating with other health insurances, we can align regionally communication efforts to educate and engage members and reduce disparities in vaccine use across the U.S.  
Inequity in health care is an area that we are particularly focused on, recognizing that we must play a critical role, working closely with our industry and governmental partners to address the imbalance that exists today. Data shows that Medicare Advantage is continuing to grow as the preferred option for those who are low income and for racial and ethnic minorities. Of the nearly 26 million Advantage -- Medicare Advantage members, there is a growing diversity in enrollment with more than 28% of the beneficiaries being racial and ethnic minorities as compared to 21% in traditional Medicare. This data demonstrates that as we think about disparities in health care for underserved populations, Medicare Advantage plans are uniquely positioned to address the needs of these members. 
Humana is committed to leverage our business platforms to support local communities in their efforts to lower social and health disparities. This includes enhancing access to care by continuing to expand and build primary care centers in underserved markets, offering supplemental benefits, including over-the-counter medication coverage, transportation, dental and vision as well as taking a leadership role in enhancing innovative solutions aimed at addressing social determinants for both Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, we recently named Dr. Nwando Olayiwola to the newly created position of Senior Vice President and Chief Equity Officer effective in April of this year. Dr. Olayiwola will set direction and establish strategy to promote health equity across all Humana lines of business, including our care delivery assets, while working collaboratively with the broader health care community to advance health equity so health care can work better for everyone, regardless of background, age or economic status.  
In closing, we remain committed to public-private partnerships that are solution oriented and drive results that will meaningfully benefit the health care system in the coming years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Today, we reported full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share of $18.75, consistent with our guidance commentary throughout the year. As Bruce described in detail, despite the unique challenges we faced in 2020 due to the pandemic, our fundamentals remain very strong with the underlying core business delivering compelling results for the full year, including a 19% increase in consolidated revenue and an 11% increase in our total Medicare Advantage membership. We were also pleased to be able to maintain stable benefits and premiums for our members, despite the return of the $1.2 billion health insurance fee, or HIF, which was not deductible for tax purposes and disproportionately impacted our business relative to the competition. In addition, I would like to echo Bruce's congratulations to our Medicaid team for our recent contract awards in Oklahoma and our announced expansion in South Carolina. These awards further demonstrate our ability to drive organic Medicaid growth, and together with our iCare acquisition in Wisconsin, expand our Medicaid presence from 3 states to 6.  
I will turn now to our fourth quarter results and underlying trends, which provide important context for our initial 2021 guide. As expected, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $2.30 for the first -- for the fourth quarter of 2020 on account of the significant investments made in all of our constituents because of the pandemic. Further, as disclosed in our 8-K filed January 8, we experienced a significant increase in COVID treatment and testing costs across the nation in November and December. For full year 2020, we incurred $1.5 billion in gross COVID treatment costs, $1.3 billion of which were related to Medicare or $825 million net of capitation to providers in risk arrangements. As a result of the dramatic increase in COVID during these months, we also experienced a decline in non-COVID utilization in the fourth quarter, particularly for Medicare, as fewer people sought nonemergent care. As a result, non-COVID Medicare utilization was approximately 15% below baseline in November and December after having nearly returned to baseline levels in October. 
Overall utilization in the quarter, including COVID costs, was a bit below baseline for Medicare and above for commercial. While the magnitude of these changes was unexpected, the decline in non-COVID utilization in the quarter relative to our prior expectations more than offset the increase in COVID treatment and testing costs. We were, therefore, able to increase our spending for ongoing pandemic relief efforts and investments to advance the company's strategy. It is important to note that investments in the Group and Specialty segment in the quarter, particularly those intended to ease financial stress for providers while positioning the business for long-term success, were disproportionate relative to the reduction in non-COVID utilization levels for the company's commercial group medical and specialty members, significantly increasing the segment's benefit ratio. In addition, as is customary, marketing costs associated with the Medicare Advantage Annual Election Period, along with COVID-related investments, were heavily weighted to the fourth quarter in our retail segment as reflected in our operating cost ratio.  
I will now speak to our expectations and related assumptions for 2021. Today, we are providing adjusted EPS guidance for 2021 of $21.25 to $21.75, reflecting approximately 16% growth off of our $18.50 2020 baseline at the midpoint. While this guidance is consistent with our previous high level 2021 commentary from our third quarter earnings call, the embedded COVID assumptions in today's guidance have changed materially since that time, with largely offsetting headwinds and tailwinds in revenue and benefits expense. This is consistent with our previous commentary that there are natural countervailing forces between trends in COVID treatment costs and trends in non-COVID utilization. 
Importantly, in an effort to simplify any explanations we are going to provide, we have included a slide on our Investor Relations website, which summarizes the expected full year impact of the various material headwinds and tailwinds to our guidance today, rather than discussing any incremental changes since the third quarter conference call. At the time of that call, we reflected both revenue and expense puts and takes into our high-level commentary about expected 2021 financial performance. Since that time, the magnitude of the COVID-related impacts have increased significantly. Therefore, as I said, we will provide full year estimates, inclusive of where we stood at the time of the third quarter call so as to provide our investors with a comprehensive assessment of our latest estimates. I would note that this heightened level of transparency, whereby we provide granular assumptions on a number of variables, is necessitated by the unique uncertainties that the pandemic creates for our 2021 financial outlook. 
I would also note that the numbers we are providing today are for individual and group Medicare Advantage only as the net impact of the pandemic on our other lines of business is currently expected to be relatively immaterial. Additionally, it is important to note that we are providing reasonably wide ranges, given the inherent uncertainty of our estimates for each line item. And finally, so as to make it easier for investors to understand the full financial picture, all the COVID-related figures we are discussing today are net numbers after taking into account our capitation agreements in which provider groups take risk in whole or in part on the member.  
With that context, I will now discuss the material COVID-related headwinds and tailwinds facing our Medicare business in 2021. I will begin with Medicare Risk Adjustment, or MRA. We now expect an MRA revenue headwind of approximately $700 million to $1 billion, representing 1% to 1.5% of Medicare premium for the full year. As a reminder, Humana's 2021 Medicare Advantage revenue is primarily driven by the risk assumed to care for our membership, established through conditions documented by providers within the 2020 calendar year. While we know that 2021 prospective payment amounts from CMS based on diagnoses codes incurred through June of 2020 and submitted by the first Friday in September, over the coming months, these payments will be adjusted to reflect additional conditions documented for claims incurred within the 2020 calendar year. While we estimate and accrue for the incremental revenue from anticipated submissions as the year progresses, there is a higher degree of uncertainty in our revenue projections compared to a normal year.  
Let me spend a few minutes addressing the drivers of this increased uncertainty. First, while we worked tirelessly throughout 2020 to ensure members had access to and were receiving the appropriate level of care, including by significantly increasing outreach and availability of in-home care and providing access to video telehealth clinician visits, the meaningful drop in non-COVID medical utilization in November and December was not expected. Those are important months as they round out our ability to drive meaningful clinical interactions with our members, and therefore, the unexpected decline in utilization affected our ability to appropriately document their conditions. 
Second, the mix of utilization was very different in 2020 relative to prior years. For example, the dramatic increase in the number of telehealth visits from 2019 to 2020, although critical in allowing our members to access care while affording us the opportunity to document their conditions, nonetheless, creates greater uncertainty around the type and volume of diagnoses codes collected. Separately, utilization for in-patient and non-in-patient continued to increase for COVID diagnosis throughout the year. Accordingly, within the mix of submissions from 2020 that drive our 2021 revenue, we also expect organic diagnosis code submissions tied to COVID claims, for which we have limited visibility at this time. These are just 2 examples of how emerging experience in 2020 creates more uncertainty in our MRA revenue projections for 2021 because we are not able to place the same level of reliance on historical trends as compared to a normal year.  
I will now discuss COVID-related utilization. As a general rule, we have seen an inverse relationship between COVID treatment costs and levels of non-COVID utilization, as surges in the pandemic led to less nonessential care being sought by our members. While the ratio of COVID treatment to non-COVID depressed utilization has varied, to date, we have seen in our Medicare book that the level of depressed utilization has more than offset the treatment cost. The shape of the COVID case curve is one of the largest drivers of these 2 related factors, and as such, they remain the 2 largest sources of uncertainty for 2021, given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic. To set a bit more context around what we are seeing currently, the COVID and non-COVID utilization trends we saw in the fourth quarter persisted throughout January. Medicare in-patient non-COVID utilization is running approximately 20% below baseline, with non-in-patient reduction percentages in the low teens, with a significant caveat that we have a much better view of inpatient admissions for which we receive weekly authorization data than we do for non-in-patient utilization. 
Importantly, the increased COVID treatment costs incurred in November and December 2020 ramped up quickly with the reduction in non-COVID utilization initially lagging that ramp as would be expected. We expect the inverse to occur in 2021, such that when COVID treatment costs begin to decline, the rate of decline will likely be steeper than the bounce back in non-COVID utilization, potentially creating a favorable impact for a more prolonged period of time. This is consistent with what we saw throughout 2020 as COVID cases ramped up and then declined in various markets. As a result, we now expect Medicare COVID treatment and testing costs of $525 million to $925 million, which when combined with the Medicare physician fee schedule increase that I will discuss in a minute, represents approximately 1.9% to 3.1% of normalized Medicare claim costs. This is similar to what we experienced in 2020 and is consistent with the expectation that the pandemic will begin to subside as more people get vaccinated through the first and second quarters. 
In addition, subsequent to the third quarter call, a net claims headwind of $175 million to $200 million resulted from the increase to the physician fee schedule rates for 2021 as part of the December stimulus bill, partially offset by a net $80 million to $90 million impact from the Medicare sequester relief extension through March 31. Our guidance to date does not assume that the sequester relief will be extended for the rest of the year. Finally, for full year 2021, we currently expect a reduction of $1.3 billion to $2 billion in Medicare non-COVID utilization off a normalized claims pattern, including lower flu costs, which are significantly reduced compared to normal seasonal patterns. This reflects overall non-COVID annual reductions of approximately 3.6% to 5.5% off a normalized claim pattern, and inclusive of COVID treatment costs, a reduction of approximately 1.7% to 2.4%. For full year 2020, the all-in reduction with and without COVID was approximately 5.9% and 8.6%, respectively. 
We, of course, acknowledge that the ranges we are providing are wide and are a consequence of the continued heightened uncertainty surrounding the ongoing pandemic. We recognize that it will take at least several months to both ascertain from CMS the negative impact to our 2021 revenue growth expectations, resulting from decreased utilization experience in 2020, including, in particular, the unanticipated depression in non-COVID utilization in the final 2 months of 2020 and to the extent to which this reduction in utilization and associated medical cost impact, net of COVID-related expenses, persists into 2021. With respect to quarterly utilization patterns, our guidance ranges assume that we will experience non-COVID utilization levels that reflect double-digit percentage reductions to baseline levels throughout the first few months of 2021, before ramping back up and running slightly above baseline levels towards the end of the year. Similarly, we assume COVID testing and treatment costs will continue to run at the higher levels experienced in November and December in the first quarter of 2021 and trend down as the vaccine becomes more widely available in the second quarter.  
With that said, there are a range of potential scenarios, and we would expect any variance in our assumptions around COVID treatment costs to be more than offset by a change in non-COVID utilization. As I said before, we expect that COVID and non-COVID utilization are driven by naturally countervailing forces. Also as a reminder, we believe capacity constraints in the health care system will prevent non-COVID utilization from running materially above baseline and also limit the amount of time a modest increase above a normal baseline could continue. Therefore, given the deviation from historical patterns we will experience in 2021, forecasting quarterly EPS splits is much more difficult than usual, but we do expect a meaningfully higher portion of our earnings coming in the first quarter than we typically see. As such, we expect the first quarter to contribute just below 1/3 of the annual total versus a more typical first quarter, which will contribute 800 to 1,000 basis points less. As an important aside, while utilization patterns will be most significantly affected in the first quarter of the year, we expect the negative impact on revenue to be more equally split throughout the year.  
Now that I've walked you through the material Medicare headwinds and tailwinds, I'm going to turn to our expected operating performance by segment. I encourage you to reference the waterfall slide provided on our Investor Relations website with the webcast materials. As outlined in the waterfall, given the pandemic, we must first reset the baseline off of which to grow 2021 adjusted EPS. As discussed previously, our starting point is $18.50, which represents the midpoint of our initial adjusted EPS guide for 2020 and effectively neutralizes for any COVID impacts throughout 2020. Importantly, we believe we struck the appropriate balance in our pricing between top and bottom line growth while investing for long-term sustainability, contemplating both the permanent repeal of the health insurance industry fee and the significant impact of the pandemic, which creates more uncertainty than we would experience in a typical year. 
Our 2021 consolidated revenue guidance of $80.3 billion to $81.9 billion at the book midpoint reflects year-over-year growth of approximately 8% from adjusted 2020 consolidated revenue. This growth is primarily driven by our expected 11% to 12% individual MA membership growth, partially offset by anticipated declines in group MA and standalone PDP membership. The revenue is also adversely impacted by the MRA headwind previously discussed as well as fewer months of sequester relief in 2021 versus 2020. Additionally, and as previously discussed, the after-tax benefit of the hit was worth approximately $2 in EPS, and we took a balanced approach in increasing our benefits to our members while providing enhanced earnings to our shareholders. We have incorporated the HIF's impact in the segment waterfall bars. 
In our Retail segment, we are excited about the balanced Medicare growth we have seen, and particularly our industry-leading D-SNP growth. Our Medicaid business also continues to perform very well, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead for this growing business. Taken together, the Retail segment is expected to show strong operating improvement as demonstrated in the waterfall, contributing an incremental $1.21 to adjusted EPS. With respect to our Group and Specialty segment, while we are facing some pressures on account of the pandemic, specifically as it relates to actions by our competitors to retain membership, the business continues to execute on its growth strategy, and we are excited about the prospects for our major medical, specialty and military businesses. We expect the segment to contribute approximately $0.05 of incremental adjusted EPS to the enterprise for 2021. 
For Healthcare Services, we experienced double-digit adjusted EBITDA percentage growth from 2019 to 2020 and expect high-teens growth year-over-year in 2021. Accordingly, we expect the increase in Healthcare Services adjusted EBITDA to contribute an incremental $1.72 to adjusted EPS. In our Pharmacy business, we anticipate continued momentum, primarily driven by our strong Medicare Advantage membership growth and continued increased mail order penetration. Likewise, our Home business is anticipated to perform well, led by Kindred at Home, and our wholly owned provider businesses continue to improve core operating performance while meaningfully expanding our primary care center footprint, as Bruce described. 
In summary, our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of $21.25 to $21.75 reflects growth of 16% from the $18.50 baseline at the midpoint, modestly above our long-term target of 11% to 15%. Since 2017, following the termination of the Aetna merger, the company has achieved an adjusted EPS compounded annual growth rate of 16.4%, which is above the top end of our 11% to 15% long-term growth commitment we have made to our investors. 
While it's very early, I want to close with some preliminary thoughts on our current view of 2022. Our expectation is that 2022 will be a more normal year, and as we get into the spring and summer, we expect the vaccine to take hold and COVID utilization to decline, allowing non-COVID utilization to trend back to more normal levels, enabling providers to see our members in the ordinary course and appropriately document their clinical conditions, resulting in more normalized medical costs and revenue expectations for 2022. Therefore, barring any major unforeseen circumstances or significant changes in the course of the pandemic, the midpoint of the 2021 adjusted EPS guidance that we provided today of $21.50 is the baseline off of which investors should think about growing earnings for 2022. As we do every year, we will consider a variety of factors as we approach our bids in the spring, including any lingering impacts of the pandemic either on revenue or utilization relative to baseline as well as other external dynamics.

We anticipated that there could be a revenue headwind. We ran various utilization scenarios to see whether there would be any offsets, and we put our assumption into our pricing. 
Rolling forward to the third quarter when we gave guidance, obviously, a lot of things by definition changed since pricing and the sort of the high-level guidance we gave at the time reflected our current view of those headwinds and tailwinds that we would face. I would also remind you that, as we've said multiple times throughout the year that, our operators are spending a significant amount of time working to try to mitigate any of those revenue headwinds by really trying to see our members, which was really important to get into their homes, visit them either in-person or via telehealth, where we would also have the benefit of being able to document their conditions. And so we took a really significant effort, invested a lot of dollars to be able to do that. 
And so as we approached the third quarter, we understood where we were relative to those expectations and, obviously, updated our utilization expectations for 2021. And in that context, we provided 2021 guidance -- or high level guidance. November and December happened, a lot changed, significant decrease in utilization, which was unexpected, as the COVID pandemic really took off and hit levels that really exceeded any expectations and were much higher levels than were even hit in the spring and was nationwide. And so that clearly impacted our perspective. 
And so as we approached the JPMorgan Conference in January, we felt it was important to get out to our investors and provide some high-level commentary on what we are seeing of potential countervailing headwinds and tailwinds. And so we've done that. Here, we provided, obviously, a lot of granular detail on that, but there is a lot of variation in these numbers. I mean you can see there are wide ranges, and we've deliberately provided those wide ranges. We think what's on this page is obviously reasonable. There is nothing that we're seeing that suggests that these numbers aren't reasonable, but where we fall in these ranges on all these variables matters a lot. And that's something, obviously, that we're going to continue to watch closely, and as appropriate, we would update investors on that. 
But I would just say, as we said in our remarks, that 2021 has heightened uncertainty relative to what we thought coming into the year. And to your question on HIF, we actually feel we achieved an appropriate balance between giving dollars back to our members through higher benefits, which we did, and giving higher EPS growth to our shareholders where we're exceeding our typical 11% to 15% growth. And at our midpoint, notwithstanding all of the COVID headwinds and tailwinds, we were still able to guide to a midpoint that's above that range. So we think we've achieved the right balance. There is no doubt that 2021 has a heightened level of uncertainty, and we're going to be monitoring it very closely and keep you updated, which is why we've also, I think, anchored investors on 2022 with the hope and expectation that, that will be a much more normal year."

And then secondly, when we think about 2022, to your point, we want to anchor in 2022 of that starting point of $21.50, but when you think about the 2021 COVID-related headwinds, can you maybe help us quantify what is reasonable for us to back out of the 2021 number as we think of a more normalized 2022?

So we're not going to provide a lot of details on 2022, obviously. With respect to the utilization patterns, as we mentioned in our remarks, we expect the first quarter to see the most depressed utilization and certainly, the highest COVID treatment cost. And so those, as I mentioned, offset one another. But again, we expect that the most sort of utilization depression will occur in the first quarter. We expect the utilization to remain depressed in the second quarter, although not as much, and then we expect it to ramp up more towards normal and then a bit above normal as we approach the back half of the year and the end of the year. 
So that's how we're broadly thinking about it, which we think is consistent with what we're seeing with the vaccinations and the progress there. As that impacts 2022, it's really hard to give specifics at this point. Again, we'll have to decide when we get to the spring, what's appropriate to reflect in our bids. We'll be very mindful of what we're seeing in terms of headwinds and tailwinds with respect to COVID and revenue and utilization like we were this year. But beyond that, I wouldn't want to comment other than to say, we do think $21.50 is a reasonable baseline off of which to think about 2022 without providing any more specifics beyond that today."

I think it's fair to say that new members tend to be breakeven. These steps may run a little bit better out of the gate, but not a lot of profitability in the first year. Certainly, as we get to the second and third year, we start getting to more of our normalized margins as we're able to document our members' conditions and also get them in our clinical programs, and that really hasn't changed. I think that's consistent with what we've seen. And certainly, that's what we typically plan for in our bids. 
We think without providing too much detail on 2022, I think it's fair to say that you might see effectively a catch-up in 2022. So any MRA revenue headwind we've seen in 2022, which is a function of sort of our existing membership base, and remember, it's not just the members that we've had, but it's also the new members that we got, particularly if they were in other Medicare plans. So if they're a switcher, they would also have sort of -- we'd have less of their documentation than normal for the same reasons because our competitors weren't able to get those conditions documented either. And so you will see sort of the -- for us, the 2021 cohort as well as, frankly, some of our other cohorts where we weren't able to redocument their conditions, you will see more of a sort of an increase in 2022. And that will be something that we plan for in our bids as we figure out what percent of normal do we expect to be for 2022 based on 2021 utilization. Hopefully, that was clear."

But I would just say, as it relates to utilization, we've been thoughtful about sort of normalized trends and then think about what the impact might be when we did our pricing for 2021 on all these various variables that we've talked about. Really, what we mean by a normalized baseline is actually, really straightforward, which is to say if you are -- if you just stripped out COVID entirely, what would the claims assumption be, based on sort of the normal inflators we would use from 2021 over 2020. And so whatever sort of secular trends and other things that we build in, trend vendors and other things, we get to sort of a net trend ex COVID and that's really the baseline. Just to give you a -- make it easier for you to compare relative to, say, our 2020 ex COVID what the baseline reduction is. And that's why I tried to say sort of ex COVID for Medicare, it was, call it, 8.5%, 8.6% down for 2020 relative to the 3.6% to 5.5% that we guided today. 
So again, we think that number is reasonable. Again, we could be wrong. That's -- there's just a wide range here. And I -- again, as I just emphasized, that there is more uncertainty around this 2021 number than we would typically have because when we formulate those trend assumptions that you were asking about, we have a lot of historical experience. We have hundreds of actuaries, very smart people working on our trend assumptions. It's something that we think we're very good at in ensuring we bake in the appropriate levels of potential trend variances. We're dealing here in a whole new world with a pandemic where we have no historical experience. And so that creates some of the challenges in our forecasting."

They're not able to schedule the surgeries, for example. It just takes time for the system to ramp back up. So there is just sort of a natural trail off that, just given the volumes we're talking about, they're not insignificant. And it's one of the reasons why we had the tailwinds we had in 2020, was that delay. It just takes time to get the gears cranking again, and they will crank again. And we certainly forecast that, but there is that delay. 
To the extent the vaccine rolls out more slowly or there is a variant in the virus that we've heard and that they're not as effective, that, for sure, can affect our ranges here. We've tried to capture what we think are reasonable ranges based on today's sets of facts and circumstances. To the extent those facts and circumstances change, it's conceivable that some of these sort of COVID treatment versus non-COVID cost, that could be impacted. Again, it's likely that because there is a -- there is that inverse correlation, they will offset one another, though in the Medicare business, it tends to lead to a tailwind, as we mentioned. The commercial business is not as clear. As you mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we are running a little bit above par all-in, but for the Medicare business, we were below. 
The investments, to your question there, we really, I would say, pulled all those out for 2021. So there is really not any additional flexibility there. We were very clear to confine those investments to 2020. And as we've described, we benefit all of our constituents and really gave back a lot of those dollars, which was important to do, but that was not baked in, in any way into our 2021 pricing or to our guidance."

Because I would -- we did readdress where we're at and began to really become aggressive and use all availability. I do believe the biggest area that we -- our challenge with this is just the normal course of people not using the health care system. 
We are very active both with our value-based providers and, in addition, with our outbound engagement with our members to ensure that they are going to the physician office or utilizing the health care system.

Justin, so on the MRA side, what we're showing here effectively is the total headwind net of mitigation. And so as Bruce just described, we did a lot to really try to get our members into the health care system and make sure we can see them. And so this is the sort of the full headwind that we currently face. And again, we want to be very transparent, but this is net of our mitigation efforts. As it relates to yields, we typically don't, as you know, guide to PMPMs, but just to help you out, I would say, is sort of flat, maybe modestly up is the way I would describe our individual MA PMPM expectations, and we'll see where that ultimately goes. 
But there are a lot of things that impact that, Justin, as you know. Obviously, MRA is one of them. The rate notice is another. Sequester is another. Remember, there is fewer months of sequester relief this year. Business mix is a very significant driver because there are pretty disparate rates around the country. So depending on where you grow, that can impact it. So there are a host of things that impact yields, but it's a fair question and understand where you're going. 
Now I would be disappointed if you didn't ask us about the margin question. So I'm glad you took the opportunity, and I know it's a fair question. I think it's important when you look at the overall retail margin, is to -- remember that there are multiple businesses inside the Retail segment. First off, the margin has been impacted by the HIF and the fact that it was nondeductible. So there is a lot of geography going on there, and certainly, we thought about after tax. I mean we sort of managed the pretax, but think about the after-tax impact as we thought about our pricing, et cetera. 
As we just discussed, we balance giving back some of the tax benefit, both to our members in the form of higher benefits as well as to our shareholders. So there is some geography issues that will impact and depress the margin. There are also -- as we've discussed on the PDP side, a lot of the margin has come out of that product. And in fact, most of the margin today, if not all the margin today, is in the pharmacy for us. We've talked about how that product has become much more of a commodity product at these levels of premium. It's hard to make money on the insurance side, and so we're doing nicely on the pharmacy side. And so we want to -- we'll continue to be aggressive in this business. 
And as Bruce commented in his remarks, our mail order penetration continues to, we think, reach very, very high levels both on the MA side, but also on the PDP side. So -- but again, that's a geography issue. So as you think about individual MA margins, you need to take that into account. Also, just to be transparent here, group MA has seen some margin impacts from some of the larger accounts that have been shifting back and forth between major competitors. When there is margin to those accounts when they get rebid, sometimes takes a few years to recover that margin. And so that's also driving some of the impact there, too. So it is, for sure, the case that we are below our 4.5% to 5% target, I would say, reasonably below that target. We are committed to that over the longer term to get back to that 4.5% to 5%, but I would just say there are a lot of things impacting that number, and there is a lot of sort of variables embedded in that retail overall guide that you're looking at."

We see great MLR, significantly below what the average is in the industry, and we also see great Net Promoter Score. All that combined, that's why you see us aggressively pursuing on both our affiliated relationships and in addition, building our primary care clinics to place our members in those clinics. 
The challenge with the clinic side is just they're organic. There is not enough capacity in the marketplace to fill the demand. So you see a lot of start-up -- clinics from a start-up point of view being invested in to build the capacity there. And so for us, for more capacity constraint as opposed to for our growth. Our growth traditionally has been at equal to and greater than what you see in the traditional 10% to 12% growth that you've seen over the last few years in these clinics and getting more and more members in those clinics. And I think you'll see that growth accelerate as the capacity becomes more and more available for us. On the value-based provider side of the business, outside of the ones that are clinic oriented, we continue to see really, really great -- good results from that. Those results are a little less than the clinic results. We see good star scores. We see 4 and above, and we see good Net Promoter Scores, but it does not compare to the outcomes that we see in the clinic side."

What we expect is, as we've said for a number of quarters here, we think it's going to take several years to get up to the Medicare Advantage penetration. We think that continues to be the case. And so again, I'd say right in line with our expectations. These are not profitable members. I think over time, as we continue to manage them and work with partners and really try to get them before they get the ESRD and slow their disease progression, we think there is real opportunities to drive profitability.

And that has helped us in being able to effectively manage the clinical side of this and the cost side, but the clinical side of ESRD. 
And then the second thing is we continue to invest in innovative models, both around the coordination of care and then also where the care is provided in the home. And those 2 strategies really have given us more confidence in the ability to manage these patients. As Brian said, the patients will continue to be costly and continue to be at no margin or very, very low margin business for us going forward.

Effectively, the assumption is the public health emergency ends in April. We'll -- if that happens, then we expect to lose some lives because we saw a nice increase this past year, but as the redeterminations happen, that will cause that membership to decline. 
And so I would say that's sort of our base case expectation as we think about our overall guidance and revenue, et cetera. To the extent that the public health emergency is extended, redeterminations don't happen, that will cause the increase in membership to continue, which -- again, I think, would be relatively immaterial to the overall enterprise, but would cause us to have a higher membership at the end of the year. And that, of course, excludes anything from South Carolina or Oklahoma, which will kick in later this year, and our guide excludes that."

I think to broaden your question a little bit, what we do see is that when we do have value-based relationships, the proactiveness of really helping the member in this time is so important for us, especially as you think about downstream cost and other conditions that could occur, if not properly maintained and traded. So to answer your question, we don't see much in COVID bundling in the type of payment, but we do see very different proactive care models in our value-based payment relationships in this time, especially with the more vulnerable populations."

We did see an increase in mail penetration as we looked for the -- in the early part of the COVID pandemic. We saw it in the March and April time frame as people were really concerned about the lockdown that was happening, and therefore, were taking 90-day prescriptions and really utilizing the mail order along with the fact that they couldn't get to the drug stores if they were normal users and became more active users of the mail order. 
What we have seen is as a result of the convenience of mail order and really, I would say, as a result of our service improvement, we've seen more and more people really converting to mail order as a result of that. And so the pandemic, we have seen, has helped educate individuals of the benefit of mail order and the ability to continue to utilize it on an ongoing basis as opposed to just through the pandemic and some of the shutdown periods. So we look at it first as really an accelerator for us in that. 
The second thing is that we have a very active investment going in into making it much more consumer friendly on the mail order side, all the way from the digital platforms that are being used to the turnaround time of delivery, to be able to ensure that we can meet the expectations and the changing expectations of customers today on when they expect deliveries to happen. And I would say that our goal is to really grow the penetration of mail order in our existing book of business. 
You asked why sort of high the penetration. I would say it's been a very concentrated effort by our management team and really all the way from our service centers on the insurance side to our providers that we have relationships with to our specialty pharmacy area of continuing to remind our members of the benefits of the mail order. And that continued use throughout the organization of being -- bringing the mail order conversation in at the appropriate period of time has really assisted in us being able to increase that rate from a much different rate that is the average in the industry to really a superior rate that you see Humana having."

To answer your question about how do we incentivize them, we're really doing it on 2 sides: First on, we did carry over the copay, the 0 copay this year to telehealth and carried that on going forward; and then the second thing that we've also done is, we continued to pay equal to our member -- I mean, our providers visit versus a telehealth visit. And both of those have been, I think, reducing the barriers and really creating, as you said, some incentives to use telehealth. 
We really have a few different strategies of using telehealth. I mean one is around really helping our providers if they don't have telehealth and providing them some technology that would offer them to utilize it. That's in a small need for external providers as they have all sort of become very acquainted with telehealth and being able to use it. Our internal -- our own providers, we offer them a very sophisticated telehealth platform that they can outreach on the telehealth side. And then the third area that we look at is continuing to work with hospital systems, especially in the specialty area, where we can have an outreach where specialists might be in short supply in certain markets and being able to offer that at a convenience in the local marketplace.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.67 for the first quarter of 2021, and  reaffirmed our full year 2021 and adjusted EPS guidance of $21.25 to $21.75. Our first quarter results reflect solid performance across each of the company's segments, fueled by strong individual Medicare Advantage and state-based membership growth, and improved profitability in the group and specialty and Healthcare Services segments. 
As we continue to navigate the pandemic, we also meaningfully advanced our strategy during the quarter. I want to congratulate our Medicaid organization on the significant contract award in Ohio, which when combined with recent additions of Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin, brings our Medicaid footprint to 7 states. These additions affirm our capital efficient, organic growth strategy and further demonstrates the strength of our Medicaid capabilities built on our Medicare Advantage chassis. 
We also continue to deliver compelling dual special needs plan membership growth. These net membership increased approximately 23% in the quarter, and we now serve more than 0.5 million D-SNP members. We remain committed to proactively addressing disparities in health care for underserved populations and recognize that Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans are uniquely positioned to address the needs of these members. 
Data shows that Medicare Advantage is continuing to grow as the preferred option for those who are low income and for racial and ethnic minorities with more than 28% of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries being racial and ethnic minorities as compared to 21% in traditional Medicare. Currently, 55% of Latino and 39% of African-American beneficiaries have actively chosen to enroll in MA, and there is growing diversity in enrollment because of the value provided to beneficiaries. The ability of MA plans to adapt to change and drive innovation and better clinical outcomes is why today nearly 27 million seniors have chosen MA over original Medicare. 
Our ability to drive innovation and improve clinical outcomes is enabled by our strong integrated care delivery platform. And in recent years, we have significantly expanded our health care services capabilities, from primary care to pharmacy to home care and more, in order to better serve our medical members and to significantly strengthen our payer-agnostic care offerings. These services help deliver on the promise of better quality and health outcomes, lower cost and a simpler, more personalized experience for the people they touch. 
These advancements also provide a solid foundation to ultimately serve individuals beyond our MA membership base, including original Medicare fee-for-service members as we continue to evolve and expand beyond managed care to a broader clinical services orientation with the ability to manage risk and coordinate care outside of MA. 
During the quarter, we took the next step in this evolution, introducing CenterWell as the new brand to unite our broad range of payer-agnostic health care service offerings. The CenterWell brand speaks to how we put our members and patients at the center of everything we do. The first Humana-owned services to adopt the brand, our partners in primary care and family physician group, named CenterWell senior primary care. We are also accelerating our strategy around the home. And as I will discuss in a moment, the home will be the next service to adopt the CenterWell brand. 
We see the home, coupled with our primary care strategy, has the mix meaningful opportunity to improve access to quality, proactive care for a broader senior population. As such, we continue to invest in assets that allow us to better manage the holistic needs of our members and patients by expanding care in the home, including primary care, telehealth and emergency room care while also addressing social determinants of health. 
The home health industry is among the fastest-growing health care industry in the U.S. as a result of an aging population, the prevalence of chronic disease and growing physician acceptance of care in the home. This need has only been accelerated by COVID-19. However, we recognized for some time that the current volume-based fee-for-service model has limited the innovation in home health. 
Accordingly, in 2018, we acquired a 40% interest in Kindred at Home, embarking on a journey to test and learn innovative clinical models in the home with the goal of evolving home health to value-based payment models. Today, Kindred at Home employs approximately 43,000 caregivers providing home health, hospice and community care services to over 550,000 patients annually. They have locations in 40 states, providing extensive geographic coverage, with approximately 65% overlap with Humana's individual Medicare Advantage membership. 
Yesterday, we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home. As detailed in the press release we issued last night, the Kindred at Home transaction represents an enterprise value of $8.1 billion, including the value of Humana's existing 40% equity interest. This acquisition, which is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, is the largest in Humana's history and comes at a pivotal time in health care, when a worldwide epidemic has exasperated the existing disparities in health care for underserved populations and highlighted the power of telehealth and in-home care and addressing those disparities. 
Further, the pandemic has reinforced patients' increasing desire for convenient and personalized delivery channels, requiring innovative home care offerings. The acquisition of Kindred at Home will provide us with an extensive network of nurses, a critical distribution channel for delivering care in the home. However, we recognize the need for innovative home care offering at scale. 
Through our successful partnership with Kindred's management team and our private equity partners, over the last few years, we have proved that altering the nurses' clinical interaction in the home improves care. We've demonstrated that we can reduce the cost of care and provide value to shareholders through additional referrals to Kindred, advancing effective clinical interventions in the home, and supporting higher acuity patients by leveraging other home-based assets we've assembled. 
When at home health episodes served by Kindred at Home has increased from 8% to 19% overall in markets with geographic overlap, reaching penetration as high as 49% in certain key markets. In addition, Kindred at Home continues to demonstrate superior patient outcomes, including reduced hospitalizations, admissions and ER utilization. 
Management's successful transition of Kindred at Home to an independent home health and hospice company, the strong and growing core business is reflected in Kindred's solid historical EBITDA compounded annual growth rate of approximately 20% since 2017, our demonstrated ability to deliver savings to health plans through reduced hospitalizations and the ability to drive increased referrals to Kindred at Home provides us the confidence to accelerate our 100% ownership of Kindred. Full ownership allows us to move from market testing to full-scale implementation over time. 
We recognize the significant value we can deliver to members and patients by integrating this asset into our holistic approach to care. Fully integrating at home -- Kindred at Home will enable us to more closely align incentives to focus on improving patient outcomes and on reducing the total cost of care. This is critical to deploying at scale, a value-based advanced home health model that makes it easier for patients and providers to benefit from our full continuum of home-based capabilities. By leveraging the best channel to deliver the right care needed at the right time, we believe we can deliver outcomes and value beyond what is possible and traditional fee-for-service models. 
As shown on the slide deck that we posted to our Investor Relations website this morning, home health utilizers are 5x more likely to have an inpatient admission within 120 days of the start of their home health episode as compared to an individual MA member that does not utilize home health. This speaks to the significant opportunity we have to continue to improve outcomes and lower costs for this population. 
We look forward to sharing additional details about the value creation we plan to drive with our home health strategy at our Investor Day in June. While the acquisition includes the operations of Kindred's hospice and community care operations, our intent is to ultimately only maintain a minority interest in this portion of the asset. Our experience with hospice demonstrates the integration of pallative and traditional hospice care, improves the quality of life for patients transitioning from restorative care to hospice. 
However, we have been successful delivering the desired patient experience and outcomes through partnership models, demonstrating we do not need to own a majority interest in the hospice asset long term. Kindred at Home will be integrated into Humana's Home Solutions business under the leadership of Susan Diamond. When combined, our Home Solutions geographic scale and clinical breadth will provide the opportunity to offer care beyond Humana members. And as a result, we will transition to our CenterWell brand as CenterWell home health. 
Luckily, Kindred Care services will be integrated and coordinated with other care offerings, including CenterWell's senior primary care and convenience VBID as well as our primary care and emerging care offerings in the home via our investment in heal and dispatch health. 
Before turning the call over to Brian, I want to acknowledge that this will be his last earnings call at Humana and thank him for his invaluable contribution to Humana over the last several years. Among his many contributions, Brian brought rigor to his role in the creation of a strong financial capability, not only through sophisticated physical and ongoing operational discipline, but also by developing a deep bench of talent within our finance organization to drive this discipline forward. 
We wish Brian the very best in his next chapter. As previously announced, Brian will remain in his current role through June 1 and then serve in an advisory role through the end of the year. On June 1, Susan Diamond will assume the role of interim CFO while we complete our search for a permanent replacement. Given Susan's strong knowledge of our business and financial expertise, I have great confidence in her ability to lead the finance team as we recruit a new CFO. Susan will also continue to lead the Home Solutions business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $7.67, reflecting a positive start to the year across our segments, particularly in light of the impacts that the pandemic has had on our results, which we outlined on our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call in February. While the first quarter came in modestly ahead of our previous expectations, it is early and we are continuing to work through uncertainty related both to our revenue and claims due to pandemic. 
Specifically as it relates to revenue, given our significant exposure to Medicare Advantage, we are disproportionately affected by COVID's impact on Medicare risk adjustment, or MRA. Our risk-adjusted revenue is determined by 2020 dates of service, medical utilization and resulting documentation, which as previously discussed, was materially depressed last year. In particular, we are focused on monitoring the impacts on utilization from the late surge of COVID cases in 4Q, which occurred following the communication of high-level 2021 guidance on our third quarter earnings call. 
While the extension of sequestration helps mitigate any potential pressure against our estimates, I would remind investors that a critical indicator of 2021 revenue relative to our initial expectations will be the midyear MRA payment, which we expect from CMS anytime in the next 1 to 3 months. The mid-year payment, which effectively rolls forward the dates of service used for 2021 payment to year-end 2020 from mid-year 2020 and incorporates the impact on risk-adjusted revenue of our new members is meaningfully more uncertain this year given the 4Q dynamics I mentioned, as this payment requires significant estimation even in normal times. 
As it relates to benefits expense, non-COVID utilization is running largely in line with our previous expectations and, as anticipated, is still depressed relative to baseline. The first 3 months of in-patient admissions were down approximately 20%, 15% and 10% in January, February and March, respectively, relative to baseline, with the first few weeks of April, seeing non-COVID inpatient trends moderate to around 5% depressed. 
Separately, non inpatient spend is also depressed, although it appears to be rebounding a bit faster than previously expected, with the caveat that the completion on non inpatient claims is much slower, and therefore, there is significantly more uncertainty around these service categories in terms of exactly where we stand. Finally, COVID admissions, which tend to have higher unit costs than those of non-COVID, came down more quickly than expected in the quarter. The COVID case deceleration moderated in late March and seems to be holding flat in early April, as certain geographic locations have become hotspots. We expect utilization to continue to rebound at par as we move through the second quarter and to slightly exceed baseline towards the end of the year. 
Given that we remain in a period of heightened uncertainty, we are reaffirming our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guide of $21.25 to $21.75 as well as the benefit expense and operating cost ratios notwithstanding the favorable first quarter results. This represents adjusted EPS growth of 16% above the 2020 baseline of $18.50 at the midpoint of our guide, nicely above the high end of our long-term EPS growth target of 11% to 15%. 
I would note that we have been consistent in our expectation of adjusted EPS growth above our long-term target since we provided our initial 2021 commentary on our third quarter 2020 earnings call in November. Additionally, we expect our second quarter adjusted EPS to reflect a low 30s percentage of our full year adjusted EPS. 
As we look ahead to 2022, we are pleased that our members appear to be engaging in more routine interactions with their providers, which we anticipate will result in more normalized Medicare Advantage revenue next year as providers are able to ensure that our members are receiving an appropriate level of care and that their conditions are being documented. While it is, of course, too early to provide 2022 guidance, I would note that as we think about our Medicare Advantage bids for 2022, our intention is to reflect the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 in our premium and claims assumptions. 
In addition, I would like to reiterate that the appropriate baseline for calculating 2022 adjusted EPS growth is $21.50, the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range. I will now briefly discuss each of our segment's performance in the quarter. 
In the retail segment, in addition to the revenue and claims dynamics I discussed, our Medicare Advantage growth remains comfortably on track and consistent with our previous expectations, with individual MA growing solidly above the market at an expected 11% to 12% increase. As Bruce indicated in his remarks, we experienced robust growth in D-SNP membership, adding 95,000 members in the first quarter with an additional 12,400 added effective April 1. I also want to echo Bruce's congratulations to our Medicaid team on their state contract awards in Ohio and Oklahoma, along with our application approval in South Carolina during the quarter. An incredible achievement, demonstrating the strength of our Medicaid capabilities. 
In our group and specialty segment, consistent with our commentary on our last earnings call in February, medical membership declines on account of COVID were less severe than initially expected coming into the year. The segment performance continues to improve, and we continue to execute on the first phase of a multiyear plan to grow our group commercial and specialty products, bringing in strong new talent, increasing our local presence in certain key markets, and deepening our partnerships with innovative companies. 
Our dental network expansion is proceeding ahead of plan. Our small group commercial medical pipeline volume is back in line with pre-COVID levels. And our Net Promoter Scores for our large group medical accounts were at a record high for first quarter performance. 
Finally, our healthcare services operations remain on track with our previous expectations. In our pharmacy operations, we continue to pursue pharmacy initiatives that we expect to further increase mail order penetration as the year progresses. I would note that this anticipated spend to accelerate growth, coupled with labor-related overtime and shipping costs due to weather-related disruptions in February, did modestly impact the pharmacy business results in the quarter. CenterWell's senior primary care in Conviva are performing well and we continue to execute on our clinic expansion with [indiscernible]. 
Kindred at Home is also delivering solid results. And as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we are accelerating our full acquisition of Kindred at Home. With respect to Kindred, last night, we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home for a total enterprise value of $8.1 billion, including $2.4 billion associated with our current 40% equity interest. We do not anticipate a material impact to non-GAAP or adjusted earnings in 2021. 
We expect the transaction to provide modest additional financial flexibility as we set targets for 2022 earnings, although I would note that buying in Kindred has long been a part of our financial planning process, which has included providing capability to build out our clinical capabilities and value-based care model. 
In addition, we intend to exclude onetime transaction and integrated costs related to the acquisition from non-GAAP earnings. Key financial terms are outlined in the slides available on our website accompanying today's earnings call. 
The innovative partnership we created with Welsh, Carson and TPG will deliver significant strategic and financial value to Humana. Executing on the Kindred at Home transaction now versus waiting for the contracted sponsor put option that would likely not be exercised until mid-2022, given the asset's strong EBITDA growth not only accelerates the strategic benefits, as Bruce described, but importantly, allows us to acquire the nation's largest home health and hospice company for a multiple meaningfully lower than where comparable public companies are trading today. 
Additionally, we expect that we will be able to capitalize on a robust market for hospice assets by divesting a majority stake in that portion of the business and what we anticipate will be an attractive valuation. 
As to the EBITDA multiple we are paying for Kindred at Home, investors should consider the $5.7 billion purchase price for the remaining 60% interest, plus our initial investment of $1.1 billion for our 40% stake in 2018, which when grown at a reasonable 8% weighted average cost of capital for a present value of $1.4 billion, equates to a total cash purchase price of approximately $7.1 billion all in. When using a normalized full year 2021 estimated EBITDA for Kindred at Home, inclusive of Hospice and Community Care, the transaction EBITDA multiple is approximately 11x. 
It is important to note that the normalized EBITDA excludes expected home care and hospice investments in clinical capabilities and value-based care models, onetime costs, including transaction and integration expenses and any potential synergies. The expected synergies will primarily result from the meaningfully enhanced clinical capabilities Bruce has described, which will materialize over time, in addition to the EBITDA benefit of in-sourcing further home health episodes from other home health providers. 
One other important note regarding the financial value created that I would mention. After adjusting for our intended divestiture of a majority interest in the hospice and community care assets at a reasonable market valuation, the implied transaction EBITDA multiple for acquiring the nation's largest home health business would be in the mid- to high-single digits, based on the roughly 50-50 split of the EBITDA between the Home and Hospice Community Care segments. 
As far as the transaction financing is concerned, we expect to fund the $5.7 billion purchase price, which again is net of our existing equity interest with a mix of parent company cash and debt financing. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, subject to customary state and federal regulatory approvals. Immediately following the closing of the transaction, we expect our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio to be in the low 40s, with significant deleveraging expected post divestiture of the majority stake in Hospice and Community Care. 
We expect the debt-to-capital ratio, including assuming a customary level of share repurchase to return to a more normalized target leverage level during 2022, freeing up the balance sheet for further capital deployment. We anticipate maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as a result of this transaction. 
Before we open the line up for questions, I want to take a moment to thank our associates, shareholders and sell-side analysts for their support over the last 7 years, as this will be my final Humana earnings call. I'm very proud of what the company has accomplished in a period of rapid transformation. And I know that under Bruce's leadership and with the support of the outstanding team across the organization, the company is well positioned to execute on its strategic plan and deliver significant shareholder value in the years ahead. It's been a true honor to serve the millions of Humana members, and I'm grateful to have worked with so many talented colleagues. I remain fully committed to a seamless transition in the coming weeks and months. And I'm very excited that Susan Diamond will serve as interim CFO. Susan is someone I've worked with extensively over the last 7 years and is one of the most talented people I know.

And there are positive knock-on effects as well to winning these accounts in the local markets in which we operate with respect to providers, et cetera, and visibility. 
And so there's a lot of competition for these accounts. We remain very well positioned there. Our group MA team has really been very smart about how they've underwritten these accounts. We're not going to chase accounts down to profitability levels that we don't think are sustainable. And so we're being prudent and thoughtful as we pursue these opportunities. But again, feel very good about how we're positioned in group MA, notwithstanding the competition there. 
I would note one thing, though, that at the sort of smaller group account size, sort of mid- level accounts and small level accounts, the profit margins are better and more -- more attractive from a pure for profitability perspective."

And so I would say as we think about the potential headwinds and tailwinds, that is one that we're very mindful of and it's something that, as I said to the last question, the sequestration is helpful, but it's still early. 
And so I would say that we're sort of in a similar posture as we were last quarter at this time. There are headwinds and tailwinds that we look at. And we want to be, I think, pretty cautious as we head into the last 9 months of the year because there's still a lot of uncertainty. And clearly, MRA is an important element of that, but there's also the claims side, which we have to see unfold over the next 9 months. 
And we obviously have assumptions about how claims are reverting to baseline levels, which they seem to be doing, sort of, in line with what largely as we expected. I would say not inpatient, maybe a little bit faster, but sort of in the range and patient in line, with COVID coming down faster. So that's obviously a positive. So there are a few puts and takes in those numbers. But I think there's a bit of a ways to go before, obviously, we're fully comfortable there. 
As it relates to the documentation for 2022, we as I mentioned, we are feeling reasonably good about what we're seeing so far, it still is early. But the documentation codes do seem to be coming in a way that makes us feel good about 2022. We've been effective in getting into the home through our in-home assessments program. We ramped those up pretty meaningfully. And so that I think is a positive side for 2022. 
But we also will be cautious as we price 2022 and run a range of scenarios to understand what the various eventualities may be on both revenue and claims as a result of the pandemic."

And so I think it is going to be an asset that is going to have a lot of interest from multiple different buyers, so to speak. 
We haven't worked out the contractual terms of can they reenter into the home business, I think, even if they were to do that. It is a fragmented industry. But it is also an industry that, as you all know, because of legalities of licensure issues and being able to get home health license isn't the easiest thing in the world, especially both in CON states and to get a Medicare reimbursement side. So we do believe that there's barriers to entry in just getting into the business. So we're less worried about that."

The -- we were coming up with the sequestration benefit being maybe as much as $1.50 or so. And so I guess this lower visibility, I guess, today than when you had last year or we provided guidance for Q4, is a little bit surprising me. 
It's not necessarily something that I'm hearing from the other managed care companies. I just want to hear a little bit more about why you think there is still so much lack of visibility in that number at this point, even though Q1 came in better. Like there was good PPD, and now you've got a big sequestration tailwind. It seems like that uncertainty would have to be significant. 
And then if it is significant, you're still reaffirming this number as your base for thinking about 2022. How can you feel comfortable that you would be able to fully reprice that into next year?"

I would say, first off, in terms of our confidence for pricing next year, I mean we as I said in my remarks, we're going to reflect any uncertainty that we see in our bids to ensure that there are any issues that we can contemplate here with respect to various scenarios that may play out, we would have considered in our bid. So I think that's the first thing. So $21.50, from a pricing perspective, we feel very good about. 
We also feel good about the reiterated guidance that we provided today. I would say relative to perhaps some of our peers, we have a much higher concentration of Medicare revenue and Medicare claims, which I think in many respects, particularly on the revenue side, have more volatility. But on the claims side as well, you're making assumptions about how seniors who have not used the health care system for a long time, how they're going to respond in the next, call it, back half of the year. And in that regard, we just want to -- and we think it's appropriate to be cautious about how they might use the system in the back half of the year. 
Especially as we saw again, the depressed utilization in the fourth quarter, how does that all play through. And so that's, I think, appropriate caution. As we said, the sequester benefit is beneficial for obvious reasons. So that is clearly a tailwind. But I think understanding how impactful on our revenue numbers, the last -- the fourth quarter was, is still out there. 
In particular, because the way the midyear payment works as it rolls forward to the last 6 months of the year in terms of how we get paid and understanding the documentation codes that were collected is something that we really need to understand, both on existing members as well as frankly, new members. 
We get a lot of new members every year. Remember, it's not just the net growth, but it's just the number of new sales that we have. And so from that perspective, there's uncertainty there. Again, I feel pretty good about where we are today. But we don't think it would be appropriate to change our guide. 
The last point I'd make is we came into the year committed to our 16% growth rate, which was above our target. And that's where we continue to be. We -- versus perhaps some of our other peers. Those numbers have not modified. And we actually obviously put out a number of ranges on a number of variables here, which are -- there was a reasonable amount of uncertainty starting from the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned, that continues.  But again, I think the first quarter is a good quarter, but there's still a ways to go."

The difference in PYD was about 110. Coincidentally, also 110 basis points. So call that 220. 
The HIF, and remember, you have to tax effect it, because we did give some of that back to members, encompasses a good portion of that 220. And I would say the group phenomena that we called out and the PDP mix, is not insignificant in terms of impacting the MER. 
So I would -- if you want to do on an apples-to-apples incurred basis, I would actually say the MER got better year-over-year if you exclude prior periods and you just do it on an incurred basis. Other than, like I said, the group MER, as we expected, and as we as we price for it, I think that does have an impact on the overall margin in the retail segment, as I think we discussed on the last call. 
With respect to utilization bouncing back, we do assume, as we mentioned, that there will be -- we expect a bounce back in utilization. We are starting to see that again in line with what we what we've expected, particularly on the inpatient side, as more people are using the hospital facilities, in particular, but they're still below par. 
We do expect the utilization of the systems run at or perhaps a little bit above par as the year continues. We are not seeing increased acuity as yet, although as I mentioned with respect to both 2021 but also 2022, we just want to be mindful of how acuity or ""long haulers"" might play into our cost base, particularly for later this year and next year. And so we are definitely mindful of that as well as any just general bounce back in utilization in the system. 
And then on the side of service side, we'll see where it goes. We have seen a decline in D-SNP usage, and that's moved into the home, which I think also, frankly, helps validate the thesis behind the Kindred transaction just as more and more care is taking place into the home. And as Bruce outlined in his remarks, doing everything we can to make the home a much more comprehensive setting where care can be delivered. And so I think our belief is that, that will continue. 
Whether members are more shy -- shy away from the institutional setting. We're [indiscernible]. I would say that

So -- and obviously, that's a segment that's not really exposed to this uncertainty around the risk-adjusted dynamic in Medicare. So just maybe a little insight into that in terms of if you still just wanted to see how utilization will ultimately develops? Or are you planning on sort of leading into that tailwind to increase your investments within that segment?"

But it is early. 
The prior year development was a positive note. The incurred results that we've seen, we feel good about. The specialty results are also doing well, specialty meaning dental. And I think the military business is having a good start to the year. So really, all elements of our strategy are on course. And the financial performance, I think, is showing. But as you rightly point out, it's still very, very early. And so we want to see a few more quarters develop."

And so I wouldn't call it a problem. I would just say, you look at the overall retail -- overall retail segment, MER, I think it's important to normalize for some of the impacts there. And so if you sort of strip that out and you look at sort of year-over-year, I think we're -- from an MER perspective, in a pretty good position. 
And so I wouldn't want to quantify it specifically. Or am I then to say, I think anything not made up by the sort of hits, including the tax benefit, some of which we pass-through with the group MER impact because of the lower -- bidding on the lower margin levels for these large accounts. 
As well as frankly, the continued decline of PDP, which also as we've talked about, has the way the MER dynamics works would, I think, impact the first quarter in a way that would also effectively more, quote rate the 2 year-over-year. So we feel good about the year-over-year MER comparison.

In our clinics, we today have telehealth, and we are utilizing a few different technology platforms. And so we are offering that. And that's -- so we're in that business, but it's through our provider-based businesses.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.67 for the first quarter of 2021, and reaffirmed our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of $21.25 to $21.75.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.67 for the first quarter of 2021, and reaffirmed our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of $21.25 to $21.75. Our first quarter results reflect solid performance across each of the company's segments, fueled by strong individual Medicare Advantage and state-based membership growth, and improved profitability in the Group and Specialty and Healthcare Services segments. 
As we continue to navigate the pandemic, we also meaningfully advanced our strategy during the quarter. I want to congratulate our Medicaid organization on the significant contract award in Ohio, which when combined with recent additions of Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin, brings our Medicaid footprint to 7 states. These additions affirm our capital-efficient organic growth strategy and further demonstrates the strength of our Medicaid capabilities built on our Medicare Advantage chassis. 
We also continue to deliver compelling dual Special Needs Plan membership growth. These net membership increased approximately 23% in the quarter, and we now serve more than 0.5 million D-SNP members. We remain committed to proactively addressing disparities in health care for underserved populations and recognize that Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans are uniquely positioned to address the needs of these members. 
Data shows that Medicare Advantage is continuing to grow as the preferred option for those who are low income and for racial and ethnic minorities, with more than 28% of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries being racial and ethnic minorities as compared to 21% in traditional Medicare. Currently, 55% of Latino and 39% of African-American beneficiaries have actively chosen to enroll in MA, and there is growing diversity in enrollment because of the value provided to beneficiaries. The ability of MA plans to adapt to change and drive innovation and better clinical outcomes is why today nearly 27 million seniors have chosen MA over original Medicare. 
Our ability to drive innovation and improve clinical outcomes is enabled by our strong integrated care delivery platform. And in recent years, we have significantly expanded our Healthcare Services capabilities, from primary care to pharmacy to home care and more, in order to better serve our medical members and to significantly strengthen our payer-agnostic care offerings. 
These services help deliver on the promise of better quality and health outcomes, lower cost and a simpler, more personalized experience for the people they touch. These advancements also provide a solid foundation to ultimately serve individuals beyond our MA membership base, including original Medicare fee-for-service members, as we continue to evolve and expand beyond managed care to a broader clinical services orientation with the ability to manage risk and coordinate care outside of MA. 
During the quarter, we took the next step in this evolution, introducing CenterWell as the new brand to unite our broad range of payer-agnostic Healthcare Service offerings. The CenterWell brand speaks to how we put our members and patients at the center of everything we do. The first Humana-owned services to adopt the brand are Partners in Primary Care and Family Physician Group, named CenterWell Senior Primary Care. We are also accelerating our strategy around the home. And as I will discuss in a moment, the home will be the next service to adopt the CenterWell brand. 
We see the home coupled with our primary care strategy as the mix meaningful opportunity to improve access to quality, proactive care for a broader senior population. As such, we continue to invest in assets that allow us to better manage the holistic needs of our members and patients by expanding care in the home, including primary care, telehealth and emergency room care while also addressing social determinants of health. 
The home health industry is among the fastest-growing health care industry in the U.S. as a result of an aging population, the prevalence of chronic disease and growing physician acceptance of care in the home. This need has only been accelerated by COVID-19. However, we recognized for some time that the current volume-based fee-for-service model has limited the innovation in home health. 
Accordingly, in 2018, we acquired a 40% interest in Kindred at Home, embarking on a journey to test and learn innovative clinical models in the home with the goal of evolving home health to value-based payment models. Today, Kindred at Home employs approximately 43,000 caregivers providing home health, hospice and community care services to over 550,000 patients annually. They have locations in 40 states, providing extensive geographic coverage, with approximately 65% overlap with Humana's individual Medicare Advantage membership. 
Yesterday, we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home. As detailed in the press release we issued last night, the Kindred at Home transaction represents an enterprise value of $8.1 billion, including the value of Humana's existing 40% equity interest. This acquisition, which is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, is the largest in Humana's history and comes at a pivotal time in health care, when a worldwide epidemic has exasperated the existing disparities in health care for underserved populations and highlighted the power of telehealth and in-home care and addressing those disparities. 
Further, the pandemic has reinforced patients' increasing desire for convenient and personalized delivery channels, requiring innovative home care offerings. The acquisition of Kindred at Home will provide us with an extensive network of nurses, a critical distribution channel for delivering care in the home. 
However, we recognize the need for innovative home care offering at scale. Through our successful partnership with Kindred's management team and our private equity partners over the last few years, we have proved that altering the nurses' clinical interaction in the home improves care. We've demonstrated that we can reduce the cost of care and provide value to shareholders through additional referrals to Kindred, advancing effective clinical interventions in the home and supporting higher acuity patients by leveraging other home-based assets we've assembled. 
[ Created ] at home health episodes served by Kindred at Home has increased from 8% to 19% overall in markets with geographic overlap, reaching penetration as high as 49% in certain key markets. In addition, Kindred at Home continues to demonstrate superior patient outcomes, including reduced hospitalizations, admissions and ER utilization. 
Management's successful transition of Kindred at Home to an independent home health and hospice company, the strong and growing core business as reflected in Kindred's solid historical EBITDA compounded annual growth rate of approximately 20% since 2017, our demonstrated ability to deliver savings to health plans through reduced hospitalizations and the ability to drive increased referrals to Kindred at Home provides us the confidence to accelerate our 100% ownership of Kindred. Full ownership allows us to move from market testing to full-scale implementation over time. 
We recognize the significant value we can deliver to members and patients by integrating this asset into our holistic approach to care. Fully integrating at home -- Kindred at Home will enable us to more closely align incentives to focus on improving patient outcomes and on reducing the total cost of care. This is critical to deploying at scale a value-based advanced home health model that makes it easier for patients and providers to benefit from our full continuum of home-based capabilities. By leveraging the best channel to deliver the right care needed at the right time, we believe we can deliver outcomes and value beyond what isn't possible in traditional fee-for-service models. 
As shown on the slide deck that we posted to our Investor Relations website this morning, home health utilizers are 5x more likely to have an inpatient admission within 120 days of the start of their home health episode as compared to an individual MA member that does not utilize home health. This speaks to the significant opportunity we have to continue to improve outcomes and lower costs for this population. We look forward to sharing additional details about the value creation we plan to drive with our home health strategy at our Investor Day in June. 
While the acquisition includes the operations of Kindred's hospice and community care operations, our intent is to ultimately only maintain a minority interest in this portion of the asset. Our experience with hospice demonstrates the integration of palliative and traditional hospice care improves the quality of life for patients transitioning from restorative care to hospice. However, we have been successful delivering the desired patient experience and outcomes through partnership models, demonstrating we do not need to own a majority interest in a hospice asset long term. 
Kindred at Home will be integrated into Humana's Home Solutions business under the leadership of Susan Diamond. When combined, our Home Solutions' geographic scale and clinical breadth will provide the opportunity to offer care beyond Humana members. And as a result, we will transition to our CenterWell brand as CenterWell Home Health. 
Luckily, Kindred Care services will be integrated and coordinated with other care offerings, including CenterWell's Senior Primary Care and convenience VBID as well as our primary care and emerging care offerings in the home via our investment in Heal and DispatchHealth. 
Before turning the call over to Brian, I want to acknowledge that this will be his last earnings call at Humana and thank him for his invaluable contribution to Humana over the last several years. Among his many contributions, Brian brought rigor to his role in the creation of a strong financial capability, not only through sophisticated physical and ongoing operational discipline, but also by developing a deep bench of talent within our financial organization to drive this discipline forward. 
We wish Brian the very best in his next chapter. As previously announced, Brian will remain in his current role through June 1 and then serve in an advisory role through the end of the year. On June 1, Susan Diamond will assume the role of interim CFO while we complete our search for a permanent replacement. Given Susan's strong knowledge of our business and financial expertise, I have great confidence in her ability to lead the finance team as we recruit a new CFO. Susan will also continue to lead the Home Solutions business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
29618,709205934,2261098,"Humana Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $7.67, reflecting a positive start to the year across our segments, particularly in light of the impacts that the pandemic has had on our results, which we outlined on our fo",1898,"Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $7.67, reflecting a positive start to the year across our segments, particularly in light of the impacts that the pandemic has had on our results, which we outlined on our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call in February. While the first quarter came in modestly ahead of our previous expectations, it is early and we are continuing to work through uncertainty related both to our revenue and claims due to pandemic. 
Specifically as it relates to revenue, given our significant exposure to Medicare Advantage, we are disproportionately affected by COVID's impact on Medicare Risk Adjustment, or MRA. Our risk-adjusted revenue is determined by 2020 dates of service, medical utilization and resulting documentation, which as previously discussed, was materially depressed last year. In particular, we are focused on monitoring the impacts on utilization from the late surge of COVID cases in 4Q, which occurred following the communication of high-level 2021 guidance on our third quarter earnings call. 
While the extension of sequestration helps mitigate any potential pressure against our estimates, I would remind investors that a critical indicator of 2021 revenue relative to our initial expectations will be the midyear MRA payment, which we expect from CMS anytime in the next 1 to 3 months. The mid-year payment, which effectively rolls forward the dates of service used for 2021 payment to year-end 2020 from mid-year 2020 and incorporates the impact on risk-adjusted revenue of our new members is meaningfully more uncertain this year given the 4Q dynamics I mentioned, as this payment requires significant estimation even in normal times. 
As it relates to benefits expense, non-COVID utilization is running largely in line with our previous expectations and, as anticipated, is still depressed relative to baseline. The first 3 months of in-patient admissions were down approximately 20%, 15% and 10% in January, February and March, respectively, relative to baseline, with the first few weeks of April, seeing non-COVID inpatient trends moderate to around 5% depressed. 
Separately, non-inpatient spend is also depressed, although it appears to be rebounding a bit faster than previously expected, with the caveat that the completion on non-inpatient claims is much slower, and therefore, there is significantly more uncertainty around these service categories in terms of exactly where we stand. 
Finally, COVID admissions, which tend to have higher unit costs than those of non-COVID, came down more quickly than expected in the quarter. The COVID case deceleration moderated in late March and seems to be holding flat in early April, as certain geographic locations have become hotspots. We expect utilization to continue to rebound at par as we move through the second quarter and to slightly exceed baseline towards the end of the year. 
Given that we remain in a period of heightened uncertainty, we are reaffirming our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guide of $21.25 to $21.75 as well as the benefit expense and operating cost ratios notwithstanding the favorable first quarter results. This represents adjusted EPS growth of 16% above the 2020 baseline of $18.50 at the midpoint of our guide, nicely above the high end of our long-term EPS growth target of 11% to 15%. 
I would note that we have been consistent in our expectation of adjusted EPS growth above our long-term target since we provided our initial 2021 commentary on our third quarter 2020 earnings call in November. Additionally, we expect our second quarter adjusted EPS to reflect a low 30s percentage of our full year adjusted EPS. 
As we look ahead to 2022, we are pleased that our members appear to be engaging in more routine interactions with their providers, which we anticipate will result in more normalized Medicare Advantage revenue next year as providers are able to ensure that our members are receiving an appropriate level of care and that their conditions are being documented. 
While it is, of course, too early to provide 2022 guidance, I would note that as we think about our Medicare Advantage bids for 2022, our intention is to reflect the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 in our premium and claims assumptions. In addition, I would like to reiterate that the appropriate baseline for calculating 2022 adjusted EPS growth is $21.50, the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range. 
I will now briefly discuss each of our segment's performance in the quarter. In the Retail segment, in addition to the revenue and claims dynamics I discussed, our Medicare Advantage growth remains comfortably on track and consistent with our previous expectations, with individual MA growing solidly above the market at an expected 11% to 12% increase. 
As Bruce indicated in his remarks, we experienced robust growth in D-SNP membership, adding 95,000 members in the first quarter, with an additional 12,400 added effective April 1. I also want to echo Bruce's congratulations to our Medicaid team on their state contract awards in Ohio and Oklahoma, along with our application approval in South Carolina during the quarter. An incredible achievement, demonstrating the strength of our Medicaid capabilities. 
In our Group and Specialty segment, consistent with our commentary on our last earnings call in February, medical membership declines on account of COVID were less severe than initially expected coming into the year. The segment performance continues to improve, and we continue to execute on the first phase of a multiyear plan to grow our group commercial and specialty products, bringing in strong new talent, increasing our local presence in certain key markets and deepening our partnerships with innovative companies. 
Our dental network expansion is proceeding ahead of plan. Our small group commercial medical pipeline volume is back in line with pre-COVID levels. And our Net Promoter Scores for our large group medical accounts were at a record high for first quarter performance. 
Finally, our Healthcare Services operations remain on track with our previous expectations. In our pharmacy operations, we continue to pursue pharmacy initiatives that we expect to further increase mail order penetration as the year progresses. I would note that this anticipated spend to accelerate growth, coupled with labor-related overtime and shipping costs due to weather-related disruptions in February, did modestly impact the pharmacy business results in the quarter. CenterWell's Senior Primary Care and Conviva are performing well and we continue to execute on our clinic expansion with Welsh, Carson. 
Kindred at Home is also delivering solid results. And as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we are accelerating our full acquisition of Kindred at Home. With respect to Kindred, last night we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home for a total enterprise value of $8.1 billion, including $2.4 billion associated with our current 40% equity interest. We do not anticipate a material impact to non-GAAP or adjusted earnings in 2021. 
We expect the transaction to provide modest additional financial flexibility as we set targets for 2022 earnings, although I would note that buying in Kindred has long been a part of our financial planning process, which has included providing capability to build out our clinical capabilities and value-based care model. In addition, we intend to exclude onetime transaction and integrated costs related to the acquisition from non-GAAP earnings. Key financial terms are outlined in the slides available on our website accompanying today's earnings call. 
The innovative partnership we created with Welsh, Carson and TPG will deliver significant strategic and financial value to Humana. Executing on the Kindred at Home transaction now versus waiting for the contracted sponsor put option that would likely not be exercised until mid-2022, given the asset's strong EBITDA growth, not only accelerates the strategic benefits as Bruce described, but importantly, allows us to acquire the nation's largest home health and hospice company for a multiple meaningfully lower than where comparable public companies are trading today. 
Additionally, we expect that we will be able to capitalize on a robust market for hospice assets by divesting a majority stake in that portion of the business at what we anticipate will be an attractive valuation. 
As to the EBITDA multiple we are paying for Kindred at Home, investors should consider the $5.7 billion purchase price for the remaining 60% interest, plus our initial investment of $1.1 billion for our 40% stake in 2018, which when grown at a reasonable 8% weighted average cost of capital for a present value of $1.4 billion, equates to a total cash purchase price of approximately $7.1 billion all in. When using a normalized full year 2021 estimated EBITDA for Kindred at Home, inclusive of hospice and community care, the transaction EBITDA multiple is approximately 11x. 
It is important to note that the normalized EBITDA excludes expected home care and hospice investments in clinical capabilities and value-based care models, onetime costs including transaction and integration expenses and any potential synergies. The expected synergies will primarily result from the meaningfully enhanced clinical capabilities Bruce has described, which will materialize over time, in addition to the EBITDA benefit of in-sourcing further home health episodes from other home health providers. 
One other important note regarding the financial value created that I would mention, after adjusting for our intended divestiture of a majority interest in the hospice and community care assets at a reasonable market valuation, the implied transaction EBITDA multiple for acquiring the nation's largest home health business would be in the mid- to high-single digits, based on the roughly 50-50 split of the EBITDA between the home and hospice community care segments. 
As far as the transaction financing is concerned, we expect to fund the $5.7 billion purchase price, which again is net of our existing equity interest, with a mix of parent company cash and debt financing. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021 subject to customary state and federal regulatory approvals. 
Immediately following the closing of the transaction, we expect our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio to be in the low 40s, with significant deleveraging expected post divestiture of the majority stake in hospice and community care. We expect the debt-to-capital ratio, including assuming a customary level of share repurchase, to return to a more normalized target leverage level during 2022, freeing up the balance sheet for further capital deployment. We anticipate maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as a result of this transaction. 
Before we open the line up for questions, I want to take a moment to thank our associates, shareholders and sell-side analysts for their support over the last 7 years, as this will be my final Humana earnings call. I'm very proud of what the company has accomplished in a period of rapid transformation. And I know that under Bruce's leadership and with the support of the outstanding team across the organization, the company is well positioned to continue to execute on its strategic plan and deliver significant shareholder value in the years ahead. 
It's been a true honor to serve the millions of Humana members, and I'm grateful to have worked with so many talented colleagues. I remain fully committed to a seamless transition in the coming weeks and months. And I'm very excited that Susan Diamond will serve as interim CFO. Susan is someone I've worked with extensively over the last 7 years and is one of the most talented people I know. 
With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, please introduce the first caller."

Well, just as we mentioned really on several calls, the group M&A market, particularly on the large-scale accounts, has continually become more competitive. There are several players who you know well, who are pursuing these accounts. And they're obviously attractive pieces of business. They're large membership, significant revenue. And there are positive knock-on effects as well to winning these accounts in the local markets in which we operate with respect to providers, et cetera, and visibility. 
And so there's a lot of competition for these accounts. We remain very well positioned there. Our group MA team has really been very smart about how they've underwritten these accounts. We're not going to chase accounts down to profitability levels that we don't think are sustainable. And so we're being prudent and thoughtful as we pursue these opportunities. But again, feel very good about how we're positioned in group MA, notwithstanding the competition there. 
I would note one thing, though, that at the sort of smaller group account size, sort of mid- level accounts and small-level accounts, the profit margins are better and more attractive from a pure profitability perspective."

And so I would say as we think about the potential headwinds and tailwinds, that is one that we're very mindful of and it's something that, as I said to the last question, the sequestration is helpful, but it's still early. 
And so I would say that we're sort of in a similar posture as we were last quarter at this time. There are headwinds and tailwinds that we look at. And we want to be, I think, pretty cautious as we head into the last 9 months of the year because there's still a lot of uncertainty. And clearly, MRA is an important element of that, but there's also the claims side which we have to see unfold over the next 9 months. 
And we obviously have assumptions about how claims are reverting to baseline levels, which they seem to be doing sort of in line with -- largely as we expected. I would say non-inpatient maybe a little bit faster but sort of in the range, and inpatient in line, with COVID coming down faster. So that's obviously a positive. So there are a few puts and takes in those numbers. But I think there's a bit of a ways to go before, obviously, we're fully comfortable there. 
As it relates to the documentation for 2022, as I mentioned, we are feeling reasonably good about what we're seeing so far. It still is early, but the documentation codes do seem to be coming in, in a way that makes us feel good about 2022. We've been effective in getting into the home through our in-home assessments program. We ramped those up pretty meaningfully. And so that I think is a positive side for 2022. But we also will be cautious as we price 2022 and run a range of scenarios to understand what the various eventualities may be on both revenue and claims as a result of the pandemic."

We haven't worked out the contractual terms of can they reenter into the home business, I think, even if they were to do that. It is a fragmented industry. But it is also an industry that, as you all know, because of legalities of licensure issues and being able to get home health license isn't the easiest thing in the world, especially both in CON states and to get a Medicare reimbursement side. So we do believe that there's barriers to entry in just getting into the business. So we're less worried about that."

The -- we were coming up with the sequestration benefit being maybe as much as $1.50 or so. And so I guess this lower visibility, I guess, today than when you had last year or when you provided guidance for Q4, is a little bit surprising me. 
It's not necessarily something that I'm hearing from the other managed care companies. I just want to hear a little bit more about why you think there is still so much lack of visibility in that number at this point, even though Q1 came in better. Like there was good PPD, and now you've got a big sequestration tailwind. It seems like that uncertainty would have to be significant. And then if it is significant, you're still reaffirming this number as your base for thinking about 2022. How can you feel comfortable that you would be able to fully reprice that into next year?"

I would say, first off, in terms of our confidence for pricing next year, I mean we -- as I said in my remarks, we're going to reflect any uncertainty that we see in our bids to ensure that there are any issues that we can contemplate here with respect to various scenarios that may play out, we would have considered in our bid. So I think that's the first thing. So $21.50, from a pricing perspective, we feel very good about. 
We also feel good about the reiterated guidance that we provided today. I would say relative to perhaps some of our peers, we have a much higher concentration of Medicare revenue and Medicare claims, which I think in many respects, particularly on the revenue side, have more volatility. But on the claims side as well, you're making assumptions about how seniors who have not used the health care system for a long time, how they're going to respond in the next, call it, back half of the year. 
And in that regard, we just want to -- and we think it's appropriate to be cautious about how they might use the system in the back half of the year. Especially as we saw, again, the depressed utilization in the fourth quarter, how does that all play through. And so that's, I think, appropriate caution. As we said, the sequester benefit is beneficial for obvious reasons. So that is clearly a tailwind. 
But I think understanding how impactful on our revenue numbers the last -- the fourth quarter was, is still out there, in particular, because the way the midyear payment works as it rolls forward to the last 6 months of the year in terms of how we get paid and understanding the documentation codes that were collected is something that we really need to understand both on existing members as well as, frankly, new members. We get a lot of new members every year. 
Remember, it's not just the net growth, but it's just the number of new sales that we have. And so from that perspective, there's uncertainty there. Again, I feel pretty good about where we are today. But we don't think it would be appropriate to change our guide. 
The last point I'd make is we came into the year committed to our 16% growth rate, which was above our target. And that's where we continue to be. We -- versus perhaps some of our other peers, those numbers have not modified. And we actually obviously put out a number of ranges on a number of variables here, which are -- there was a reasonable amount of uncertainty starting from the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned, that continues. But again, I think the first quarter is a good quarter, but there's still a ways to go."

They will also serve when -- in the appropriate area, Medicare fee-for-service areas such as direct contracting would be an example of that. And they will serve other providers -- I mean, other payers as we do today in value-based payment models and will take full risk. 
And so the opportunity we have is to take advantage of the organic growth of each of those markets to be able to then integrate those together and take advantage of offering a value-based offering to different payment mechanisms, whether it's within MA to other payers or within a direct contracting area.

The difference in PYD was about 110 -- coincidentally, also 110 basis points, so call that 220. The HIF -- and remember, you have to tax effect it, because we did give some of that back to members, encompasses a good portion of that 220. And I would say the group phenomena that we called out and the PDP mix, is not insignificant in terms of impacting the MER. 
So I would -- if you want to do on an apples-to-apples incurred basis, I would actually say the MER got better year-over-year if you exclude prior periods and you just do it on an incurred basis. Other than, like I said, the group MER, as we expected and as we as we priced for it, I think that does have an impact on the overall margin in the Retail  segment, as I think we discussed on the last call. 
With respect to utilization bouncing back, we do assume, as we mentioned, that there will be -- we expect a bounce back in utilization. We are starting to see that again in line with what we what we've expected, particularly on the inpatient side as more people are using the hospital facilities in particular, but they're still below par. 
We do expect the utilization of the systems run at or perhaps a little bit above par as the year continues. We are not seeing increased acuity as yet, although as I mentioned with respect to both 2021 but also 2022, we just want to be mindful of how acuity or ""long haulers"" might play into our cost base, particularly for later this year and next year. And so we are definitely mindful of that as well as any just general bounce back in utilization in the system. 
And then on the site of service side, we'll see where it goes. We have seen a decline in SNF usage, and that's moved into the home, which I think also, frankly, helps validate the thesis behind the Kindred transaction just as more and more care is taking place into the home. And as Bruce outlined in his remarks, doing everything we can to make the home a much more comprehensive setting where care can be delivered. And so I think our belief is that, that will continue.

As well as frankly, the continued decline of PDP, which also as we've talked about has -- the way the MER dynamics works would, I think, impact the first quarter in a way that would also effectively more [ corroborate ] the 2 year-over-year. 
So we feel good about the year-over-year MER comparison. But again, I wouldn't get too caught up in the group MA MER specifically, but rather just an overall commentary on the competitiveness in that one segment of the market. And so it's just something that we're mindful of, and we continue to be very thoughtful about how we price there."

I think the technology side, we would be leasing it or be it someone would vend it to us. We feel that, that technology is, frankly, will be a commodity over time. So I just want to sort of break down the different parts of telehealth. 
The second aspect is from who the providers are in that. And we really see there's different channels there, one, the partners and our provider value-based relationships that we have. Most of them already have telehealth, and so we don't need to provide that to them. In our clinics, we today have telehealth, and we are utilizing a few different technology platforms. And so we are offering that. And that's -- so we're in that business, but it's through our provider-based businesses. 
And then providers that are needing telehealth we will partner on a vended basis with some technology company to offer that. That's probably less than a minority part of our telehealth business. The first 2 will be the majority. And so I would answer the question that we don't need to partner, it would be more of a vended solution to offer the technology where we will offer or our partners will offer through our contractual relationships, the provider side."

Where they reside in the organization today, Heal and Dispatch relationship, relies within our Home Solution group.

What we find is the palliative -- the integration of palliative in hospice is very powerful. And being able to offer both of those in an integrated fashion, really creates the opportunity for us to partner across the hospice business as opposed to having one vendor, so to speak, in that.

29618,1671861870,2352665,"Humana Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Amy, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.89 for the second quarter of 2021, in line with our previous expectations. We continue to focus on delivering strong operating res",1015,"Amy, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.89 for the second quarter of 2021, in line with our previous expectations. We continue to focus on delivering strong operating results while navigating a dynamic environment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all while staying true to our commitment to delivering the highest quality health care experience for members and patients. Well, we are maintaining our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $21.5 to $21.75 at the midpoint, representing full year adjusted EPS growth of 16% above the 2020 baseline of $18.50 in excess of our long-term growth target while acknowledging the continued uncertainty driven by COVID-19 hospitalization trends and the rate at which non-COVID costs normalized. 
As Susan will describe in more detail, our full year adjusted EPS guidance now assumes a $600 million COVID-19-related headwind that is expected to be largely offset by favorable operating items. In addition, this guidance assumes no COVID costs will run -- non-COVID costs will run approximately 2.5% below baseline in the back half of the year, including an assumption of minimum COVID testing and treatment costs for the remaining of the year. 
I'd like to reiterate that our core fundamentals are performing well, and 2021 is a year of COVID-19 transition with various pandemic-related financial impacts, including reduced Medicare Advantage revenue resulting from the significant temporary deferral of utilization in 2020 as well as the lingering near-term uncertainties regarding the pace and level of the return of utilization for the balance of the year. We also acknowledge that we are seeing increase in COVID utilization in recent weeks, which we will continue to watch closely. 
While we continue to navigate this pandemic-related uncertainties in 2021, as Susan will lay out in detail, we expect 2022 to be a more normal year. The health care system has been open for several months, and we have seen vaccination rates in the seniors reach approximately 80% nationally. Accordingly, our members continue to engage in more routine interactions with their providers, which we anticipate will result in more normalized Medicare Advantage revenue next year as providers are able to ensure that our members are receiving appropriate care and that their conditions are being fully documented. 
I would reiterate our remarks from the last quarter regarding our Medicare Advantage bids for 2022, which reflected the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 in our premium and claims assumption, with a focus on maintaining benefit stability in 2023. While it is still too early to provide 2022 guidance, we believe our operating discipline in 2021, combined with the depth of our planning for 2022 Medicare Advantage AEP, puts us in a strong position for financial growth in 2022. 
I will now turn to an operational and strategic update. Importantly, our underlying core businesses continue to deliver strong results on solid fundamentals, with individual Medicare Advantage membership growth outpacing the industry. As we highlighted at our recent Investor Day, this growth is balanced across various product lines, including HMO and PPO and dual special need plans, or D-SNPs. Our Medicaid business continues to perform well in 2021, and our South Carolina plant is now operational. We are diligently preparing for the Ohio contract go-live date in early 2022 and are continuing to improve our operating model, building off of our core Medicare Advantage capabilities. We've also experienced slightly better-than-expected results in our home and provider businesses and increased mail order rates in our pharmacy business. 
Finally, as announced last quarter, we've entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home, and we expect the transaction to close mid-August, which we've included in our revised estimates for the year. Our strong operating performance this year is in part a tribute to our strong partnerships with providers who are delivering high-quality care to our members. We are currently seeing 87% of our provider partners and value-based arrangements in surplus. 
Further, our relentless focus on consumer centricity has led to an all-time high Net Promoter Scores for our retail organization, contributing to Medicare Advantage membership growth and resulted in an external recognition of Humana as an industry leader in customer satisfaction, including the announcement this morning that we received the highest ranking in mail order pharmacy customer satisfaction for the fourth year in a row in the J.D. Power 2021 U.S. Pharmacy study. 
On the public policy front, as policymakers explore changes to Medicare, including adding dental, vision and hearing as part of the Medicare benefit, we stand ready to both innovate for the more than 12 million of our members who already have these benefits, including 7 million dental and vision policies in our MA group as well as offer ideas, a public-private collaboration to leverage our deep capabilities in Medicare and specialty markets so that beneficiaries could quickly see benefits go from a proposed law to a tangible benefit. 
Before turning the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Susan Diamond, I'd like to take a moment to speak about Susan's experience at Humana over the last 15 years. She has served in various leadership roles across the company during our tenure, spending 8 years as part of the Medicare leadership team with various financial and operational and line of business responsibilities. She also spent 2 years on the finance team, leading enterprise planning and forecasting and overseeing the company's line of business, CFOs and controllers. 
Most recently, she led our home business, growing it to the largest offering of its kind. Her strong financial background and extensive knowledge of our business made her uniquely positioned to step into the CFO role. The board and I have great confidence in our abilities and the contribution she will make in the next chapter for Humana as we execute on our strategic plan and deliver shareholder value. In addition, given the strategic nature of the CFO role, Susan will continue to contribute in a meaningful way to our home health business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan."
29618,1671861870,2352665,"Humana Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $6.89 for the second quarter, in line with our previous expectations.

Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $6.89 for the second quarter, in line with our previous expectations. Our underlying core business fundamentals remain strong, and we experienced a positive start to the year across our segments with the first quarter coming in modestly ahead of our previous expectations. Our results moderated back to expected levels in the second quarter albeit with variation in the way specific underlying assumptions emerged, with COVID treatment costs coming in lower than expected, offset by non-inpatient utilization continuing to bounce back faster than originally anticipated. 
As I will describe in further detail in a moment, uncertainty remains for the balance of the year due to the pandemic, specifically as it respects COVID hospitalizations and the rate at which non-COVID costs normalize, inclusive of both volume and unit costs. 
Recognizing the majority of today's call will focus on our emerging experience and our 2021 guidance, I want to quickly touch on operating performance across our segments before diving into that detail. Our Medicare Advantage growth remains on track and consistent with our previous expectations, with individual MA growing solidly above the market and an expected 11.4% at the midpoint. Our Medicaid business results are exceeding our initial expectations, given membership increases largely attributable to the extension of the public health emergency as well as higher-than-expected favorable prior period development. 
In our Group and Specialty segment, consistent with our commentary on our last earnings call, medical membership declines are lower than we expected coming into the year. Our specialty business results are exceeding expectations as utilization, particularly for dental services, has been slower to bounce back than initially expected. 
Finally, within our Healthcare Services operations, pharmacy continues to see increased mail order penetration as a result of customer experience improvements and additional marketing initiatives. The Home business, CenterWell Senior Primary Care and Conviva are performing slightly ahead of expectations, and we remain on track to open 20 new clinics this year with Wells Carson. In addition, as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we now expect the Kindred at Home acquisition to close in mid-August, subject to customary state and federal regulatory approvals. 
Before I go into more detail on our 2021 guide, I want to reiterate that the uncertainty we are seeing in 2021 relates solely to the difficulty estimating the impact of the pandemic and is not expected to carry forward into 2022. We remain comfortable with how we approach 2022 pricing, which I will expand on later in my remarks. 
Turning to full year 2021 guidance. I would remind you our adjusted EPS guidance represents growth at or above the top end of our long-term target of 11% to 15%. Our philosophy regarding 2021 guidance has been to provide transparency into the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and the ability to deliver our targeted earnings growth with solid underlying core business performance and largely offsetting COVID-19-related headwinds and tailwinds. We have been consistent in and remain committed to this philosophy. 
There is a reasonable path to achieving adjusted EPS within our initial guidance range. And accordingly, today, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $21.25 to $21.75, while acknowledging the continued uncertainty as it respects COVID hospitalization trends as well as the pace at which non-COVID costs bounce back and at what level they ultimately normalize. Additionally, we expect our third quarter adjusted EPS to reflect a low 20s percentage of our full year adjusted EPS. 
As Bruce indicated, given our experience to date, together with our current estimates for the back half of 2021, we have effectively recognized a $600 million COVID-related headwind for Medicare Advantage in our full year guidance, offset by favorable operating items. These favorable items include, among others, higher than initially expected prior year development, the previously discussed better-than-expected specialty and Medicaid results and the expected contribution from Kindred at Home given the transaction is expected to close in the coming weeks. 
Now let me provide an update on the underlying changes since our initial detailed guide in February, articulate key assumptions regarding utilization in the back half of 2021 and expand on the continued pandemic-related uncertainties I described. 
I will begin with Medicare Advantage revenue. As discussed last quarter, given our significant exposure to Medicare Advantage, we are disproportionately affected by COVID's impact on Medicare risk adjustment, or MRA. Recall, our risk-adjusted revenue for 2021 is determined by 2020 dates of service, medical utilization and resulting documentation, which, as previously discussed, was materially depressed in 2020. As we have indicated since the beginning of the year, the MRA headwind that we are facing in 2021 is significant, and we have closely monitored it over the course of the year. Our April guide recognized we had $300 million of additional pressure from MRA relative to our initial expectations for the full year, which was offset by the net benefit of the extension of sequester relief. 
In July, we received the mid-year MRA payment, and it came in modestly lower than expected. We are, however, taking operational steps now to be able to recover some of the MRA revenue and the final payment for 2021. Accordingly, our MA premium estimates, net of capitation, remain largely in line with our initial expectations when factoring in the net sequestration benefit. 
Now turning to benefit expense. At the beginning of the year, we indicated that we expected non-COVID costs for our Medicare business to run 3.6% to 5.5% below baseline. We defined baseline as 2019 experience trended forward based on a normalized trending factor excluding the effects of COVID. In the first quarter, we acknowledge that non-inpatient costs were bouncing back faster than initially expected. However, that was offset by COVID utilization, decelerating faster than expected. We also recognize, however, visibility into non-inpatient claims was significantly less than inpatient and therefore, we acknowledge that there was more uncertainty around non-inpatient service categories in terms of exactly where we stood. However, at that time, we could still tolerate overall utilization returning to baseline late in the year if the non-inpatient acceleration we were seeing was due to pent-up demand and leveled off in the second and third quarters. 
In the first and second quarters, non-COVID costs ran approximately 7% and 3% below baseline, respectively, with the bounce back outpacing expectations in the second quarter. Non-inpatient utilization did not lever loss and instead continue to increase in the second quarter and was offset by lower-than-expected COVID costs and other business outperformance. 
As the health care system has been opened for several months and a high rate of the senior population has been vaccinated, our current guidance now assumes that non-COVID costs level off and run approximately 2.5% below baseline levels in the back half of the year. Consistent with our original forecast, our current guidance assumes minimal COVID testing and treatment costs in the back half of the year. That said, we do acknowledge that we are seeing increases in COVID admissions in recent weeks, although it's too early to determine if there will be offsetting declines in non-COVID utilization, and we will continue to monitor this recent development. Finally, as it respects our 2021 guide for our commercial business, we expect all-in utilization for COVID and non-COVID to continue to run above baseline as anticipated. 
In summary, I want to emphasize that 2021 as a COVID transition year. There is a reasonable path to deliver against our guidance expectations. However, as non-COVID utilization or COVID treatment costs increased beyond our expectations in the back half of the year, it will present a headwind to our guide, absent offsetting tailwinds. 
I also want to reiterate that the $21.50 midpoint of our original guide continues to be the right jumping off point for 2022 adjusted EPS growth. Our members continue to engage in routine interactions with their providers, which we anticipate will result in more normalized Medicare Advantage revenue next year as providers are able to ensure that our members are receiving appropriate care and if their conditions are fully documented. 
During the first half of 2021, provider interactions and documentation of clinical diagnosis that will impact 2022 revenue outpaced those experienced in the first half of 2020 and are approximately 80% complete, in line with the estimated completion of the same time period in 2019. Lastly, I would remind you that our Medicare managed bid for 2022 reflected the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 as it relates to our premium and baseline non-COVID claims trend assumptions, with a focus on maintaining benefit stability into 2023. 
Before we open up the line for questions, I'm excited to announce 2 finance leadership changes that will promote the growth and versatility of our finance leadership team. First, with the expected integration of Kindred at Home, our Home business is growing significantly, and Amy has accepted the role of Vice President and CFO of Home Solutions. She will be a key member of the Home Solutions leadership team, responsible for the financial oversight and planning and forecasting for the segment. Lisa Studer will succeed Amy, accepting the role of Vice President, Investor Relations. Lisa has worked with Amy over the last 4 years and is well-known and respected by our investors. We are excited about the opportunity this affords both Amy and Lisa, and Lisa's continuity in Investor Relations will allow for a seamless transition. 
With that, we will open up the lines for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

One, it sounds like the first half or the second quarter, I should say, was worse than expected, and yet you still kind of came in line with -- from an MOR perspective. So you're telling us the back half has -- needs to be more optimistic. So what happened in the second quarter beyond that allowed you to make the MLR, but still have higher medical costs that need the back half? And then I guess the -- around that, the $600 million specifically, can you flush that out in as much detail as you can? Because is that comparable to the old COVID estimate? Or is that a new COVID headwind that you've kind of thrown in there for the back half of the year for us to think about?"

So I'll take these 1 at a time. I'll start with your last question around the $600 million. So just to clarify, the $600 million represents our full year estimate of the Medicare Advantage-only net headwinds and tailwinds and related to the COVID pandemic. And if you recall back to our initial guidance earlier this year, we provided a schedule that laid out the specific line items that were considered in that and a range of estimates at the time. So the $600 million represents our current view and what is contemplated in our guide related to those items on a net basis, so the net of all the various headwinds and tailwinds based on our current expectations. 
As it respects to the first half and second half, as we described in the call, what we continue to see throughout the first half of the year was COVID costs coming down faster than initially expected, but non-COVID outpatient, in particular, rebounding faster than expected, and that continued through the second quarter. And we anticipate that, that will extend some into the third quarter before it levels off. In the first half of the year, the benefits we saw from COVID-related costs as well as some lower inpatient -- non-COVID inpatient costs, we do not expect to continue at the same rate because our expectation has always been that those costs on the Home side would come down as a result of the rollout of vaccinations and that utilization would rebound to more normal levels such that there is less positive upside that can offset those costs in the second half of the year, which is why we are now estimating a net 2.5% decline in non-COVID utilization in the back half of the year to meet our guide. 
As it respects to MRA, I think we provided the net detail in terms of what our current estimates really are. I know we provided the line item in the initial guide in terms of the beginning of the year. And what we're saying is on a net basis net of capitation, there's about a $300 million additional headwind. And in the context of the overall guide, that is largely offset or fully offset by the net impact of the positive sequestration benefit."

And the other thing I would add as well in terms of your question about how did you offset that, there was a lower COVID and other inpatient costs.

Our third and fourth quarter now, on average, are estimated to run 2.5% below baseline. And recall that, that's inclusive of both utilization as well as unit cost. So as I mentioned, we do expect, given that the country has been largely open, our population is largely vaccinated, that we will see those non-COVID utilization start to normalize, and so we've allowed for some additional return to baseline relative to what we've experienced in the second quarter. 
I would also say that as we see that utilization come back, we also see that the average cost per hospitalization will come down because lower severity cases are reintroduced. And so the combination of leveling off of utilization and continued reductions in the unit cost contribute to that 2.5% below baseline. 
I think you've suggested that overall utilization might be above baseline. I think you might be referring to my comments about commercial where we had planned to see in total COVID -- non-COVID slightly above baseline as we were beginning to see that at the end of 2020.

On OpEx, as you said, you're exactly right. The reason for the change in the guide and the increase that is directly attributable to incorporating the Kindred performance into our guidance points, and so that is largely the reason for that increase. We do, however, I would say, in terms of our core business and even within Kindred anticipate some investment like we would in normal course. Kindred, as you can imagine, by integrating it, there are some investments we might want to make there as a respect to the value-based operating model that we've described at Investor Day. And so that is contemplated in there as well. 
On your second question on sequestration, we do expect that to reverse in 2022. That would have been contemplated in our bids and pricing.

Should we see somewhat depressed utilization in the back half of the year, given the way risk adjustment works, generally speaking, we feel good that so long as there's not sort of a full shutdown like we saw in 2020, which is not what we anticipate currently, we feel confident that we should be on pace to deliver against what we need for MRA, again, based on what we're currently seeing.

So as it respects the $300 million that we referenced that was contemplated in our April guide, so just for context, our January payment in 2021 would reflect claims that were submitted through the September submission deadline. And then that requires us to estimate the submissions that will come in organically as well as a result of our activities around chart review and prospective programs for the remainder of the year. 
At that time, we were not anticipating the significant surge that we saw across the country in the fourth quarter due to COVID and the resulting reduction in non-COVID utilization. What that led to was lower -- what we refer to as organic diagnosis submissions, so those are not related to the campaigns that we initiated, but rather organic submissions across the provider community based on the utilization that's happening. And those ultimately prove to come in lower than we had anticipated. And generally speaking, I think we've mentioned before that those organic submissions are more difficult to estimate, obviously, than the initiatives that we are executing. So that was reflected in our April guide at the time. 
In terms of the midyear adjustment, as we've said on previous calls, the adjustment there was solely related to new members or members who were only enrolled for a partial year in 2020, where we don't have full visibility to their claims. And so while we made an estimate of what we thought the impact would be based on what we were seeing within our concurrent population, ultimately, that midyear payment came in, it reflected a lower level of contribution for those new members and our estimates had originally anticipated.

I sort of think of those as related. And then would a rise in direct COVID costs, so if we did see this increase that you guys mentioned that you're seeing in the last couple of weeks, if that did continue, would that end up being a net negative now because you've got all the direct costs, but you're already assuming lower utilization?"

Our view is, again, just based on the trajectory we've seen that given the level of utilization increase we've seen that we were at a point where it will be in the plateau and level off as sort of just a new baseline for the back half of the year. 
As it respects COVID, as we mentioned, it's just very early in terms of the increase we've seen is literally just in the last couple of weeks. It is still a bit too early to determine whether or not we will see offsetting non-COVID utilization impacts like we have seen in all previous surges. I will say, just this last week, we just began to see some level of reduction in inpatient -- non-COVID inpatient as the COVID cases increase. It's simply just too early to really assess the duration that we might see in terms of an uptake and the offsetting utilization. But should we see offsetting utilization in the non-COVID space, in order for that not to present a headwind, it would be incremental to the 2.5% that we are currently forecasting. Next question, please."

The first is the respect to pricing, U.S. industry about the group MA. And I think as we've said before, the group MA space, particularly for larger group accounts, continues to be highly competitive, and we would expect that to continue. And so the margins that we would see on those accounts to continue to be competitive and pressured. I think though, as we think about group MA, there are a lot of other benefits to winning those large accounts in terms of the impact they can have in a local geography on the network and our ability to work with provider partnerships, et cetera. But we expect that to be -- continue to be competitive. 
On the individual side, this is always a process we go through every year to understand sort of the rate environment, the competitive environment, other business performance. We always strive to maintain benefit stability, knowing how important that is to our members as well as our sales and distribution channels. So that's always our goal. And there's always a number of puts and takes that we will consider, including the broader enterprise performance as it respects, first and foremost, delivering against our overall growth target of 11% to 15%. 
And after considering sort of strategic investments, other business performance and then understanding what's required of our Medicare business and what we're trying to achieve, balancing both growth and margin in the long term. All of those are taken into account. We remain committed to achieving long-term, our targeted individual margin of 4.5% to 5%, and that will vary each year based on those things that I mentioned. But we expect this to continue to progress towards that goal. 
On utilization, I would say really it's too early, I think, for us to really see anything specific at the clinic level. That information is not as real time available to us as there are hopefully information. So to date, I have not seen anything that would provide us any visibility. I will say, there are some concentrations geographically. As you've seen probably in the press, Florida is a state that is seeing higher rates given we have a concentration of some of our clinics there. I imagine that they would see some, but we actually don't have detailed information on that just yet. Next question, please."

As it respects to 2.5%, as you mentioned, I think in earlier calls during the first quarter, did mention that our original forecast did contemplate over the course of the second half of the year that we would begin to approach baseline and potentially for a short period of time see above baseline utilization related to pent-up demand. So we just projected that to occur later in the year. Our view is that given the rate at which we've seen it bounce back more quickly, that we have seen that in the first half of the year instead. And so at the time, I don't think we've given specifics on sort of the monthly trajectory. But in general, our original forecast going into the year did anticipate a slower return to baseline and could tolerate it getting to baseline by the end of the year. 
But as I described in my remarks, because we saw the faster bounce-back in non-inpatient and in the first half, that was, again, largely offset by the reductions in COVID and inpatient. Those trends will not continue at the same level and therefore, we will need to see below baseline utilization on the nonpoinside in order to achieve that full year estimate of 3.75%.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.89 for the second quarter of 2021, in line with our previous expectations. We continue to focus on delivering strong operating results while navigating a dynamic environment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all while staying true to our commitment to delivering the highest quality health care experience for members and patients. Well, we are maintaining our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $21.5 to $21.75 at the midpoint, representing full year adjusted EPS growth of 16% above the 2020 baseline of $18.50 in excess of our long-term growth target while acknowledging the continued uncertainty driven by COVID-19 hospitalization trends and the rate at which non-COVID costs normalized. 
As Susan will describe in more detail, our full year adjusted EPS guidance now assumes a $600 million COVID-19-related headwind that is expected to be largely offset by favorable operating items. In addition, this guidance assumes no COVID costs will run -- non-COVID costs will run approximately 2.5% below baseline in the back half of the year, including an assumption of minimum COVID testing and treatment costs for the remaining of the year. 
I'd like to reiterate that our core fundamentals are performing well, and 2021 is a year of COVID-19 transition with various pandemic-related financial impacts, including reduced Medicare Advantage revenue resulting from the significant temporary deferral of utilization in 2020 as well as the lingering near-term uncertainties regarding the pace and level of the return of utilization for the balance of the year. We also acknowledge that we are seeing increase in COVID utilization in recent weeks, which we will continue to watch closely. 
While we continue to navigate this pandemic-related uncertainties in 2021, as Susan will lay out in detail, we expect 2022 to be a more normal year. The health care system has been open for several months, and we have seen vaccination rates in the seniors reach approximately 80% nationally. Accordingly, our members continue to engage in more routine interactions with their providers, which we anticipate will result in more normalized Medicare Advantage revenue next year as providers are able to ensure that our members are receiving appropriate care and that their conditions are being fully documented. 
I would reiterate our remarks from the last quarter regarding our Medicare Advantage bids for 2022, which reflected the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 in our premium and claims assumption, with a focus on maintaining benefit stability in 2023. While it is still too early to provide 2022 guidance, we believe our operating discipline in 2021, combined with the depth of our planning for 2022 Medicare Advantage AEP, puts us in a strong position for financial growth in 2022. 
I will now turn to an operational and strategic update. Importantly, our underlying core businesses continue to deliver strong results on solid fundamentals, with individual Medicare Advantage membership growth outpacing the industry. As we highlighted at our recent Investor Day, this growth is balanced across various product lines, including HMO and PPO and dual special need plans, or D-SNPs. Our Medicaid business continues to perform well in 2021, and our South Carolina plant is now operational. We are diligently preparing for the Ohio contract go-live date in early 2022 and are continuing to improve our operating model, building off of our core Medicare Advantage capabilities. We've also experienced slightly better-than-expected results in our home and provider businesses and increased mail order rates in our pharmacy business. 
Finally, as announced last quarter, we've entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home, and we expect the transaction to close mid-August, which we've included in our revised estimates for the year. Our strong operating performance this year is in part a tribute to our strong partnerships with providers who are delivering high-quality care to our members. We are currently seeing 87% of our provider partners and value-based arrangements in surplus. 
Further, our relentless focus on consumer centricity has led to an all-time high Net Promoter Scores for our retail organization, contributing to Medicare Advantage membership growth and resulted in an external recognition of Humana as an industry leader in customer satisfaction, including the announcement this morning that we received the highest ranking in mail order pharmacy customer satisfaction for the fourth year in a row in the J.D. Power 2021 U.S. Pharmacy study. 
On the public policy front, as policymakers explore changes to Medicare, including adding dental, vision and hearing as part of the Medicare benefit, we stand ready to both innovate for the more than 12 million of our members who already have these benefits, including 7 million dental and vision policies in our MA group as well as offer ideas, a public-private collaboration to leverage our deep capabilities in Medicare and specialty markets so that beneficiaries could quickly see benefits go from a proposed law to a tangible benefit. 
Before turning the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Susan Diamond, I'd like to take a moment to speak about Susan's experience at Humana over the last 15 years. She has served in various leadership roles across the company during our tenure, spending 8 years as part of the Medicare leadership team with various financial and operational and line of business responsibilities. She also spent 2 years on the finance team, leading enterprise planning and forecasting and overseeing the company's line of business, CFOs and controllers. 
Most recently, she led our home business, growing it to the largest offering of its kind. Her strong financial background and extensive knowledge of our business made her uniquely positioned to step into the CFO role. The board and I have great confidence in our abilities and the contribution she will make in the next chapter for Humana as we execute on our strategic plan and deliver shareholder value. In addition, given the strategic nature of the CFO role, Susan will continue to contribute in a meaningful way to our home health business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan."

Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $6.89 for the second quarter, in line with our previous expectations. Our underlying core business fundamentals remain strong, and we experienced a positive start to the year across our segments with the first quarter coming in modestly ahead of our previous expectations. Our results moderated back to expected levels in the second quarter albeit with variation in the way specific underlying assumptions emerged, with COVID treatment costs coming in lower than expected, offset by non-inpatient utilization continuing to bounce back faster than originally anticipated. 
As I will describe in further detail in a moment, uncertainty remains for the balance of the year due to the pandemic, specifically as it respects COVID hospitalizations and the rate at which non-COVID costs normalize, inclusive of both volume and unit costs. 
Recognizing the majority of today's call will focus on our emerging experience and our 2021 guidance, I want to quickly touch on operating performance across our segments before diving into that detail. Our Medicare Advantage growth remains on track and consistent with our previous expectations, with individual MA growing solidly above the market and an expected 11.4% at the midpoint. Our Medicaid business results are exceeding our initial expectations, given membership increases largely attributable to the extension of the public health emergency as well as higher-than-expected favorable prior period development. 
In our Group and Specialty segment, consistent with our commentary on our last earnings call, medical membership declines are lower than we expected coming into the year. Our specialty business results are exceeding expectations as utilization, particularly for dental services, has been slower to bounce back than initially expected. 
Finally, within our Healthcare Services operations, pharmacy continues to see increased mail order penetration as a result of customer experience improvements and additional marketing initiatives. The Home business, CenterWell Senior Primary Care and Conviva are performing slightly ahead of expectations, and we remain on track to open 20 new clinics this year with Wells Carson. In addition, as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we now expect the Kindred at Home acquisition to close in mid-August, subject to customary state and federal regulatory approvals. 
Before I go into more detail on our 2021 guide, I want to reiterate that the uncertainty we are seeing in 2021 relates solely to the difficulty estimating the impact of the pandemic and is not expected to carry forward into 2022. We remain comfortable with how we approach 2022 pricing, which I will expand on later in my remarks. 
Turning to full year 2021 guidance. I would remind you our adjusted EPS guidance represents growth at or above the top end of our long-term target of 11% to 15%. Our philosophy regarding 2021 guidance has been to provide transparency into the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and the ability to deliver our targeted earnings growth with solid underlying core business performance and largely offsetting COVID-19-related headwinds and tailwinds. We have been consistent in and remain committed to this philosophy. 
There is a reasonable path to achieving adjusted EPS within our initial guidance range. And accordingly, today, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $21.25 to $21.75, while acknowledging the continued uncertainty as it respects COVID hospitalization trends as well as the pace at which non-COVID costs bounce back and at what level they ultimately normalize. Additionally, we expect our third quarter adjusted EPS to reflect a low 20s percentage of our full year adjusted EPS. 
As Bruce indicated, given our experience to date, together with our current estimates for the back half of 2021, we have effectively recognized a $600 million COVID-related headwind for Medicare Advantage in our full year guidance, offset by favorable operating items. These favorable items include, among others, higher than initially expected prior year development, the previously discussed better-than-expected specialty and Medicaid results and the expected contribution from Kindred at Home given the transaction is expected to close in the coming weeks. 
Now let me provide an update on the underlying changes since our initial detailed guide in February, articulate key assumptions regarding utilization in the back half of 2021 and expand on the continued pandemic-related uncertainties I described. 
I will begin with Medicare Advantage revenue. As discussed last quarter, given our significant exposure to Medicare Advantage, we are disproportionately affected by COVID's impact on Medicare risk adjustment, or MRA. Recall, our risk-adjusted revenue for 2021 is determined by 2020 dates of service, medical utilization and resulting documentation, which, as previously discussed, was materially depressed in 2020. As we have indicated since the beginning of the year, the MRA headwind that we are facing in 2021 is significant, and we have closely monitored it over the course of the year. Our April guide recognized we had $300 million of additional pressure from MRA relative to our initial expectations for the full year, which was offset by the net benefit of the extension of sequester relief. 
In July, we received the mid-year MRA payment, and it came in modestly lower than expected. We are, however, taking operational steps now to be able to recover some of the MRA revenue and the final payment for 2021. Accordingly, our MA premium estimates, net of capitation, remain largely in line with our initial expectations when factoring in the net sequestration benefit. 
Now turning to benefit expense. At the beginning of the year, we indicated that we expected non-COVID costs for our Medicare business to run 3.6% to 5.5% below baseline. We defined baseline as 2019 experience trended forward based on a normalized trending factor excluding the effects of COVID. In the first quarter, we acknowledge that non-inpatient costs were bouncing back faster than initially expected. However, that was offset by COVID utilization, decelerating faster than expected. We also recognize, however, visibility into non-inpatient claims was significantly less than inpatient and therefore, we acknowledge that there was more uncertainty around non-inpatient service categories in terms of exactly where we stood. However, at that time, we could still tolerate overall utilization returning to baseline late in the year if the non-inpatient acceleration we were seeing was due to pent-up demand and leveled off in the second and third quarters. 
In the first and second quarters, non-COVID costs ran approximately 7% and 3% below baseline, respectively, with the bounce back outpacing expectations in the second quarter. Non-inpatient utilization did not lever loss and instead continue to increase in the second quarter and was offset by lower-than-expected COVID costs and other business outperformance. 
As the health care system has been opened for several months and a high rate of the senior population has been vaccinated, our current guidance now assumes that non-COVID costs level off and run approximately 2.5% below baseline levels in the back half of the year. Consistent with our original forecast, our current guidance assumes minimal COVID testing and treatment costs in the back half of the year. That said, we do acknowledge that we are seeing increases in COVID admissions in recent weeks, although it's too early to determine if there will be offsetting declines in non-COVID utilization, and we will continue to monitor this recent development. Finally, as it respects our 2021 guide for our commercial business, we expect all-in utilization for COVID and non-COVID to continue to run above baseline as anticipated. 
In summary, I want to emphasize that 2021 as a COVID transition year. There is a reasonable path to deliver against our guidance expectations. However, as non-COVID utilization or COVID treatment costs increased beyond our expectations in the back half of the year, it will present a headwind to our guide, absent offsetting tailwinds. 
I also want to reiterate that the $21.50 midpoint of our original guide continues to be the right jumping off point for 2022 adjusted EPS growth. Our members continue to engage in routine interactions with their providers, which we anticipate will result in more normalized Medicare Advantage revenue next year as providers are able to ensure that our members are receiving appropriate care and if their conditions are fully documented. 
During the first half of 2021, provider interactions and documentation of clinical diagnosis that will impact 2022 revenue outpaced those experienced in the first half of 2020 and are approximately 80% complete, in line with the estimated completion of the same time period in 2019. Lastly, I would remind you that our Medicare managed bid for 2022 reflected the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 as it relates to our premium and baseline non-COVID claims trend assumptions, with a focus on maintaining benefit stability into 2023. 
Before we open up the line for questions, I'm excited to announce 2 finance leadership changes that will promote the growth and versatility of our finance leadership team. First, with the expected integration of Kindred at Home, our Home business is growing significantly, and Amy has accepted the role of Vice President and CFO of Home Solutions. She will be a key member of the Home Solutions leadership team, responsible for the financial oversight and planning and forecasting for the segment. Lisa Studer will succeed Amy, accepting the role of Vice President, Investor Relations. Lisa has worked with Amy over the last 4 years and is well-known and respected by our investors.

One, it sounds like the first half or the second quarter, I should say, was worse than expected, and yet you still kind of came in line with -- from an MOR perspective. So you're telling us the back half has -- needs to be more optimistic. So what happened in the second quarter beyond that allowed you to make the MLR, but still have higher medical costs that need the back half? And then I guess the -- around that, the $600 million specifically, can you flush that out in as much detail as you can? Because is that comparable to the old COVID estimate? Or is that a new COVID headwind that you've kind of thrown in there for the back half of the year for us to think about?"
29618,1671861870,2352667,"Humana Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Sure. So I'll take these 1 at a time.

So I'll take these 1 at a time. I'll start with your last question around the $600 million. So just to clarify, the $600 million represents our full year estimate of the Medicare Advantage-only net headwinds and tailwinds and related to the COVID pandemic. And if you recall back to our initial guidance earlier this year, we provided a schedule that laid out the specific line items that were considered in that and a range of estimates at the time. So the $600 million represents our current view and what is contemplated in our guide related to those items on a net basis, so the net of all the various headwinds and tailwinds based on our current expectations. 
As it respects to the first half and second half, as we described in the call, what we continue to see throughout the first half of the year was COVID costs coming down faster than initially expected, but non-COVID outpatient, in particular, rebounding faster than expected, and that continued through the second quarter. And we anticipate that, that will extend some into the third quarter before it levels off. In the first half of the year, the benefits we saw from COVID-related costs as well as some lower inpatient -- non-COVID inpatient costs, we do not expect to continue at the same rate because our expectation has always been that those costs on the Home side would come down as a result of the rollout of vaccinations and that utilization would rebound to more normal levels such that there is less positive upside that can offset those costs in the second half of the year, which is why we are now estimating a net 2.5% decline in non-COVID utilization in the back half of the year to meet our guide. 
As it respects to MRA, I think we provided the net detail in terms of what our current estimates really are. I know we provided the line item in the initial guide in terms of the beginning of the year. And what we're saying is on a net basis net of capitation, there's about a $300 million additional headwind. And in the context of the overall guide, that is largely offset or fully offset by the net impact of the positive sequestration benefit."

And the other thing I would add as well in terms of your question about how did you offset that, there was a lower COVID and other inpatient costs.

Our third and fourth quarter now, on average, are estimated to run 2.5% below baseline. And recall that, that's inclusive of both utilization as well as unit cost. So as I mentioned, we do expect, given that the country has been largely open, our population is largely vaccinated, that we will see those non-COVID utilization start to normalize, and so we've allowed for some additional return to baseline relative to what we've experienced in the second quarter. 
I would also say that as we see that utilization come back, we also see that the average cost per hospitalization will come down because lower severity cases are reintroduced. And so the combination of leveling off of utilization and continued reductions in the unit cost contribute to that 2.5% below baseline. 
I think you've suggested that overall utilization might be above baseline. I think you might be referring to my comments about commercial where we had planned to see in total COVID -- non-COVID slightly above baseline as we were beginning to see that at the end of 2020. But for our Medicare business, because we're including limited COVID costs in our forecast in the back half of the year, it's not contributing significantly, so that would not take it over baseline."

And that, again, because of the length of time the country has largely been open, that pent-up demand has worked through. And therefore, while we will -- we are expecting a little bit more return to baseline relative to our second quarter performance that, that will stabilize through the back half of the year.

Are you expecting more investments in the back half of the year in other areas? 
And then if I could squeeze in 1 more. Your comment about the offset of sequestration versus the MRA headwind this year, does that, in your mind, reverse next year? So if we lose sequestration, you -- the MRA catch-up by having fully coded all the people from last year and this year offsets that? Is that the way to think about it?"

On OpEx, as you said, you're exactly right. The reason for the change in the guide and the increase that is directly attributable to incorporating the Kindred performance into our guidance points, and so that is largely the reason for that increase. We do, however, I would say, in terms of our core business and even within Kindred anticipate some investment like we would in normal course. Kindred, as you can imagine, by integrating it, there are some investments we might want to make there as a respect to the value-based operating model that we've described at Investor Day. And so that is contemplated in there as well. 
On your second question on sequestration, we do expect that to reverse in 2022. That would have been contemplated in our bids and pricing. And our MRA assumptions as we think about 2022 would not be impacted by that explicitly. They are independently calculating what we believe the risk adjustment will be based on the diagnosis submissions that we would expect in a more normal environment. Thank you.

But really, we are seeing, with the exception of some of those specific service categories I mentioned like surgical, other categories are largely still running below baseline across the board. 
As far as MRA impact, as we said, what we are seeing in terms of the normal routine interactions with our providers, our income assessment activity and other annual wellness programs, those are all trending exactly as we would expect to see in order to deliver against our 2022 revenue estimates contemplated in pricing. And so we feel really good about our trajectory there. Should we see somewhat depressed utilization in the back half of the year, given the way risk adjustment works, generally speaking, we feel good that so long as there's not sort of a full shutdown like we saw in 2020, which is not what we anticipate currently, we feel confident that we should be on pace to deliver against what we need for MRA, again, based on what we're currently seeing.

So as it respects the $300 million that we referenced that was contemplated in our April guide, so just for context, our January payment in 2021 would reflect claims that were submitted through the September submission deadline. And then that requires us to estimate the submissions that will come in organically as well as a result of our activities around chart review and prospective programs for the remainder of the year. 
At that time, we were not anticipating the significant surge that we saw across the country in the fourth quarter due to COVID and the resulting reduction in non-COVID utilization. What that led to was lower -- what we refer to as organic diagnosis submissions, so those are not related to the campaigns that we initiated, but rather organic submissions across the provider community based on the utilization that's happening. And those ultimately prove to come in lower than we had anticipated. And generally speaking, I think we've mentioned before that those organic submissions are more difficult to estimate, obviously, than the initiatives that we are executing. So that was reflected in our April guide at the time. 
In terms of the midyear adjustment, as we've said on previous calls, the adjustment there was solely related to new members or members who were only enrolled for a partial year in 2020, where we don't have full visibility to their claims. And so while we made an estimate of what we thought the impact would be based on what we were seeing within our concurrent population, ultimately, that midyear payment came in, it reflected a lower level of contribution for those new members and our estimates had originally anticipated. 
I would say that going into 2022, because those impacts were directly related to the COVID pandemic and impacts the utilization, I would not expect to see that continued uncertainty carry into 2022 based on what we're seeing so far this year. Thank you. Next question."

As it respects COVID, as we mentioned, it's just very early in terms of the increase we've seen is literally just in the last couple of weeks. It is still a bit too early to determine whether or not we will see offsetting non-COVID utilization impacts like we have seen in all previous surges. I will say, just this last week, we just began to see some level of reduction in inpatient -- non-COVID inpatient as the COVID cases increase. It's simply just too early to really assess the duration that we might see in terms of an uptake and the offsetting utilization.

But we expect that to be -- continue to be competitive. 
On the individual side, this is always a process we go through every year to understand sort of the rate environment, the competitive environment, other business performance. We always strive to maintain benefit stability, knowing how important that is to our members as well as our sales and distribution channels. So that's always our goal. And there's always a number of puts and takes that we will consider, including the broader enterprise performance as it respects, first and foremost, delivering against our overall growth target of 11% to 15%. 
And after considering sort of strategic investments, other business performance and then understanding what's required of our Medicare business and what we're trying to achieve, balancing both growth and margin in the long term. All of those are taken into account. We remain committed to achieving long-term, our targeted individual margin of 4.5% to 5%, and that will vary each year based on those things that I mentioned. But we expect this to continue to progress towards that goal. 
On utilization, I would say really it's too early, I think, for us to really see anything specific at the clinic level. That information is not as real time available to us as there are hopefully information. So to date, I have not seen anything that would provide us any visibility. I will say, there are some concentrations geographically.

As it respects to 2.5%, as you mentioned, I think in earlier calls during the first quarter, did mention that our original forecast did contemplate over the course of the second half of the year that we would begin to approach baseline and potentially for a short period of time see above baseline utilization related to pent-up demand. So we just projected that to occur later in the year. Our view is that given the rate at which we've seen it bounce back more quickly, that we have seen that in the first half of the year instead. And so at the time, I don't think we've given specifics on sort of the monthly trajectory. But in general, our original forecast going into the year did anticipate a slower return to baseline and could tolerate it getting to baseline by the end of the year. 
But as I described in my remarks, because we saw the faster bounce-back in non-inpatient and in the first half, that was, again, largely offset by the reductions in COVID and inpatient.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.89 for the second quarter of 2021, in line with our previous expectations.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.89 for the second quarter of 2021, in line with our previous expectations. We continue to focus on delivering strong operating results, while navigating a dynamic environment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all while staying true to our commitment to delivering the highest quality health care experience for members and patients. 
We are maintaining our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $21.5 to $21.75 at the midpoint, representing full year adjusted EPS growth of 16% above the 2020 baseline of $18.50, in excess of our long-term growth target, while acknowledging the continued uncertainty driven by COVID-19 hospitalization trends and the rate at which non-COVID costs normalized. 
As Susan will describe in more detail, our full year adjusted EPS guidance now assumes a $600 million COVID-19-related headwind that is expected to be largely offset by favorable operating items. In addition, this guidance assumes no COVID costs will run -- non-COVID costs will run approximately 2.5% below baseline in the back half of the year, including an assumption of minimum COVID testing and treatment costs for the remaining of the year. 
I'd like to reiterate that our core fundamentals are performing well, and 2021 is a year of COVID-19 transition, with various pandemic-related financial impacts, including reduced Medicare Advantage revenue resulting from the significant temporary deferral of utilization in 2020, as well as the lingering near-term uncertainties regarding the pace and level of the return of utilization for the balance of the year. We also acknowledge that we are seeing increase in COVID utilization in recent weeks, which we will continue to watch closely. 
While we continue to navigate this pandemic-related uncertainties in 2021, as Susan will lay out in detail, we expect 2022 to be a more normal year. The health care system has been open for several months, and we have seen vaccination rates in the seniors reach approximately 80% nationally. 
Accordingly, our members continue to engage in more routine interactions with their providers, which we anticipate will result in more normalized Medicare Advantage revenue next year, as providers are able to ensure that our members are receiving appropriate care and that their conditions are being fully documented. 
I would reiterate our remarks from the last quarter regarding our Medicare Advantage bids for 2022, which reflected the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 in our premium and claims assumption, with a focus on maintaining benefit stability in 2023. While it is still too early to provide 2022 guidance, we believe our operating discipline in 2021, combined with the depth of our planning for 2022 Medicare Advantage AEP, puts us in a strong position for financial growth in 2022. 
I will now turn to an operational and strategic update. Importantly, our underlying core businesses continue to deliver strong results on solid fundamentals, with individual Medicare Advantage membership growth outpacing the industry. As we highlighted at our recent Investor Day, this growth is balanced across various product lines, including HMO, PPO and dual special need plans, or D-SNPs. 
Our Medicaid business continues to perform well in 2021, and our South Carolina plan is now operational. We are diligently preparing for the Ohio contract go-live date in early 2022 and are continuing to improve our operating model, building off of our core Medicare Advantage capabilities. 
We've also experienced slightly better-than-expected results in our home and provider businesses and increased mail order rates in our pharmacy business. 
Finally, as announced last quarter, we've entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 60% interest in Kindred at Home, and we expect the transaction to close mid-August, which we've included in our revised estimates for the year. 
Our strong operating performance this year is in part a tribute to our strong partnerships with providers who are delivering high-quality care to our members. We are currently seeing 87% of our provider partners and value-based arrangements in surplus. 
Further, our relentless focus on consumer centricity has led to an all-time high Net Promoter Scores for our retail organization, contributing to Medicare Advantage membership growth and resulted in an external recognition of Humana as an industry leader in customer satisfaction, including the announcement this morning that we received the highest ranking in mail order pharmacy customer satisfaction for the fourth year in a row in the J.D. Power 2021 U.S. Pharmacy Study. 
On the public policy front, as policymakers explore changes to Medicare, including adding dental, vision and hearing as part of the Medicare benefit, we stand ready to both innovate for the more than 12 million of our members who already have these benefits, including 7 million dental and vision policies in our MA group, as well as offer ideas, a public-private collaboration to leverage our deep capabilities in Medicare and specialty markets, so that beneficiaries could quickly see benefits go from a proposed law to a tangible benefit. 
Before turning the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Susan Diamond, I'd like to take a moment to speak about Susan's experience at Humana over the last 15 years. She has served in various leadership roles across the company during her tenure, spending 8 years as part of the Medicare leadership team with various financial and operational and line of business responsibilities. She also spent 2 years on the finance team, leading enterprise planning and forecasting and overseeing the company's line of business, CFOs and controllers. 
Most recently, she led our home business, growing it to the largest offering of its kind. Her strong financial background and extensive knowledge of our business made her uniquely positioned to step into the CFO role. 
The Board and I have great confidence in her abilities and the contribution she will make in the next chapter for Humana as we execute on our strategic plan and deliver shareholder value. In addition, given the strategic nature of the CFO role, Susan will continue to contribute in a meaningful way to our home health business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan."

Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $6.89 for the second quarter, in line with our previous expectations. Our underlying core business fundamentals remain strong, and we experienced a positive start to the year across our segments, with the first quarter coming in modestly ahead of our previous expectations. 
Our results moderated back to expected levels in the second quarter, albeit with variation in the way specific underlying assumptions emerged, with COVID treatment cost coming in lower than expected, offset by non-inpatient utilization continuing to bounce back faster than originally anticipated. 
As I will describe in further detail in a moment, uncertainty remains for the balance of the year due to the pandemic, specifically as it respects to COVID hospitalizations and the rate at which non-COVID costs normalize, inclusive of both volume and unit costs. 
Recognizing the majority of today's call will focus on our emerging experience and our 2021 guidance, I want to quickly touch on operating performance across our segments before diving into that detail. Our Medicare Advantage growth remains on track and consistent with our previous expectations, with individual MA growing solidly above the market and an expected 11.4% at the midpoint. 
Our Medicaid business results are exceeding our initial expectations given membership increases largely attributable to the extension of the public health emergency as well as higher-than-expected favorable prior period development. 
In our Group and Specialty segment, consistent with our commentary on our last earnings call, medical membership declines are lower than we expected coming into the year. Our specialty business results are exceeding expectations as utilization, particularly for dental services, has been slower to bounce back than initially expected. 
Finally, within our Healthcare Services operations, pharmacy continues to see increased mail order penetration as a result of customer experience improvements and additional marketing initiatives. 
The home business, CenterWell Senior Primary Care and Conviva, are performing slightly ahead of expectations, and we remain on track to open 20 new clinics this year with Welsh, Carson. 
In addition, as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we now expect the Kindred at Home acquisition to close in mid-August, subject to customary state and federal regulatory approvals. 
Before I go into more detail on our 2021 guide, I want to reiterate that the uncertainty we are seeing in 2021 relates solely to the difficulty estimating the impact of the pandemic and is not expected to carry forward into 2022. We remain comfortable with how we approach 2022 pricing, which I will expand on later in my remarks. 
Turning to full year 2021 guidance. I would remind you, our adjusted EPS guidance represents growth at or above the top end of our long-term target of 11% to 15%. Our philosophy regarding 2021 guidance has been to provide transparency into the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and the ability to deliver our targeted earnings growth, with solid underlying core business performance and largely offsetting COVID-19-related headwinds and tailwinds. We have been consistent in and remain committed to this philosophy. 
There is a reasonable path to achieving adjusted EPS within our initial guidance range. And accordingly, today, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $21.25 to $21.75, while acknowledging the continued uncertainty as it respects to COVID hospitalization trends as well as the pace at which non-COVID costs bounce back and at what level they ultimately normalize. Additionally, we expect our third quarter adjusted EPS to reflect a low 20s percentage of our full year adjusted EPS. 
As Bruce indicated, given our experience to date, together with our current estimates for the back half of 2021, we have effectively recognized a $600 million COVID-related headwind for Medicare Advantage in our full year guide, offset by favorable operating items. 
These favorable items include, among others, higher than initially expected prior period development, the previously discussed better-than-expected specialty and Medicaid results and the expected contribution from Kindred at Home given the transaction is expected to close in the coming weeks. 
Now let me provide an update on the underlying changes since our initial detailed guide in February, articulate key assumptions regarding utilization in the back half of 2021 and expand on the continued pandemic-related uncertainties I described. 
I will begin with Medicare Advantage revenue. As discussed last quarter, given our significant exposure to Medicare Advantage, we are disproportionately affected by COVID's impact on Medicare Risk Adjustment, or MRA. Recall, our risk-adjusted revenue for 2021 is determined by 2020 dates of service, medical utilization and resulting documentation, which, as previously discussed, was materially depressed in 2020. 
As we have indicated since the beginning of the year, the MRA headwind that we are facing in 2021 is significant, and we have closely monitored it over the course of the year. Our April guide recognized we had $300 million of additional pressure from MRA relative to our initial expectations for the full year, which was offset by the net benefit of the extension of sequester relief. 
In July, we received the mid-year MRA payment, and it came in modestly lower than expected. We are, however, taking operational steps now to be able to recover some of the MRA revenue and the final payment for 2021. Accordingly, our MA premium estimates, net of capitation, remain largely in line with our initial expectations when factoring in the net sequestration benefit. 
Now turning to benefit expense. At the beginning of the year, we indicated that we expected non-COVID costs for our Medicare business to run 3.6% to 5.5% below baseline. We define baseline as 2019 experience trended forward based on a normalized trending factor, excluding the effects of COVID. 
In the first quarter, we acknowledged that non-inpatient costs were bouncing back faster than initially expected. However, that was offset by COVID utilization decelerating faster than expected. We also recognize, however, visibility into non-inpatient claims was significantly less than inpatient and, therefore, we acknowledge that there was more uncertainty around non-inpatient service categories in terms of exactly where we stood. 
However, at that time, we could still tolerate overall utilization returning to baseline late in the year if the non-inpatient acceleration we were seeing was due to pent-up demand and leveled off in the second and third quarters. 
In the first and second quarters, non-COVID costs ran approximately 7% and 3% below baseline, respectively, with the bounce back outpacing expectations in the second quarter. Non-inpatient utilization did not level off and instead continue to increase in the second quarter and was offset by lower-than-expected COVID costs and other business outperformance. 
As the health care system has been open for several months, and a high rate of the senior population has been vaccinated, our current guidance now assumes that non-COVID cost level off and run approximately 2.5% below baseline levels in the back half of the year. 
Consistent with our original forecast, our current guidance assumes minimal COVID testing and treatment cost in the back half of the year. That said, we do acknowledge that we are seeing increases in COVID admissions in recent weeks, although it's too early to determine if there will be offsetting declines in non-COVID utilization, and we will continue to monitor this recent development. 
Finally, as it respects to our 2021 guide for our commercial business, we expect all-in utilization for COVID and non-COVID to continue to run above baseline as anticipated. 
In summary, I want to emphasize that 2021 is a COVID transition year. There is a reasonable path to deliver against our guidance expectations. However, as non-COVID utilization or COVID treatment cost increase beyond our expectations in the back half of the year, it will present a headwind to our guide, absent offsetting tailwinds. 
I also want to reiterate that the $21.50 midpoint of our original guide continues to be the right jumping off point for 2022 adjusted EPS growth. Our members continue to engage in routine interactions with their providers, which we anticipate will result in more normalized Medicare Advantage revenue next year, as providers are able to ensure that our members are receiving appropriate care and that their conditions are fully documented. 
During the first half of 2021, provider interactions and documentation of clinical diagnosis that will impact 2022 revenue outpaced those experienced in the first half of 2020 and are approximately 80% complete, in line with the estimated completion rate for the same time period in 2019. 
Lastly, I would remind you that our Medicare Advantage bid for 2022 reflected the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 as it relates to our premium and baseline non-COVID claims trend assumptions, with a focus on maintaining benefit stability into 2023. 
Before we open up the line for questions, I'm excited to announce 2 finance leadership changes that will promote the growth and versatility of our finance leadership team. First, with the expected integration of Kindred at Home, our Home business is growing significantly, and Amy has accepted the role of Vice President and CFO of Home Solutions. She will be a key member of the Home Solutions leadership team, responsible for the financial oversight and planning and forecasting for the segment. 
Lisa Stoner will succeed Amy, accepting the role of Vice President, Investor Relations. Lisa has worked with Amy over the last 4 years and is well-known and respected by our investors.

And yet, you still kind of came in line with -- from an MOR perspective. So you're telling us the back half has -- is -- needs to be more optimistic. 
So what happened in the second quarter beyond that allowed you to make the MLR, but still have higher medical costs beneath the back half? And then I guess the -- around that, the $600 million specifically, can you flesh that out in as much detail as you can because is that comparable to the old COVID estimate? Or is that a new COVID headwind that you've kind of thrown in there for the back half of the year for us to think about?"

So just to clarify, the $600 million represents our full year estimate of the Medicare Advantage-only net headwinds and tailwinds related to the COVID pand",384,"Sure. So I'll take these one at a time. I'll start with your last question around the $600 million. So just to clarify, the $600 million represents our full year estimate of the Medicare Advantage-only net headwinds and tailwinds related to the COVID pandemic. And if you recall, back to our initial guidance earlier this year, we provided a schedule that laid out the specific line items that were considered in that and a range of estimates at the time. 
So the $600 million represents our current view and what is contemplated in our guide related to those items on a net basis, so the net of all the various headwinds and tailwinds based on our current expectations. 
As it respects to the first half and second half, as we described in the call, what we continue to see throughout the first half of the year was COVID cost coming down faster than initially expected, but non-COVID outpatient, in particular, rebounding faster than expected, and that continued through the second quarter. And we anticipate that, that will extend some into the third quarter before it levels off. 
In the first half of the year, the benefits we saw from COVID-related cost as well as some lower inpatient -- non-COVID inpatient cost, we do not expect to continue at the same rate because our expectation has -- had always been that those costs on the COVID side would come down as a result of the rollout of vaccinations and that utilization would rebound to more normal levels, such that there is less positive upside that can offset those costs in the second half of the year, which is why we are now estimating a net 2.5% decline in non-COVID utilization in the back half of the year to meet our guide. 
As it respects to MRA, I think we provided the net detail in terms of what our current estimates really are. I know we provided the line item in the initial guide in terms of the beginning of the year. And what we're saying is on a net basis, net of capitation, there's about a $300 million additional headwind. And in the context of the overall guide, that is largely offset -- or fully offset by the net impact of the positive sequestration benefit."

Is that the comparable now? 
And then have you said that, that's all eaten away in the first half of the year? So effectively, that updated $600 million is comparable to the $400 to $700, and it's completely gone effectively, so you don't have any -- none of that's assumed in the back half. Is that the way to read it?"

And the other thing I would add as well in terms of your question about how did you offset that, there was a lower COVID and other inpatient costs.

Our third and fourth quarter now, on average, are estimated to run 2.5% below baseline. And recall that, that's inclusive of both utilization as well as unit cost. 
So as I mentioned, we do expect, given that the country has been largely open, our population is largely vaccinated, that we will see those non-COVID utilization start to normalize, and so we've allowed for some additional return to baseline relative to what we've experienced in the second quarter. 
I would also say that as we see that utilization come back, we also see that the average cost per hospitalization will come down because lower severity cases are reintroduced. And so the combination of leveling off of utilization and continued reductions in the unit cost contribute to that 2.5% below baseline. 
I think you've suggested that overall utilization might be above baseline. I think you might be referring to my comments about commercial, where we had planned to see in total COVID, non-COVID to run slightly above baseline as we were beginning to see that at the end of 2020. But for our Medicare business, because we're including limited COVID cost in our forecast in the back half of the year, it's not contributing significantly, so that would not take it over baseline."

And then if I could squeeze in one more. Your comment about the offset of sequestration versus the MRA headwind this year, does that, in your mind, reverse next year? So if we lose sequestration, you -- the MRA catch-up by having fully coded all of the people from last year and this year offsets that. Is that the way to think about it?"

On OpEx, as you said, you're exactly right. The reason for the change in the guide and the increase that is directly attributable to incorporating the Kindred performance into our guidance points, and so that is largely the reason for that increase. 
We do, however, I would say, in terms of our core business, and even within Kindred, anticipate some investment like we would in normal course. Kindred, as you can imagine, by integrating it, there are some investments we might want to make there as it respect to the value-based operating model that we've described at Investor Day. And so that is contemplated in there as well. 
On your second question on sequestration, we do expect that to reverse in 2022. That would have been contemplated in our bids and pricing.

And so I wouldn't say that we're necessarily seeing shifts in the site of service or the site of care, but rather just, as utilization returns to normal, there is some level of utilization that hasn't -- just hasn't come back on an absolute basis. 
But really, we are seeing, with the exception of some of those specific service categories I mentioned like surgical, other categories are largely still running below baseline across the board. 
As far as MRA impact, as we said, what we are seeing in terms of the normal routine interactions with our providers, our in-home assessment activity and other annual wellness programs, those are all trending exactly as we would expect to see in order to deliver against our 2022 revenue estimates contemplated in pricing. And so we feel really good about our trajectory there. 
Should we see somewhat depressed utilization in the back half of the year, given the way risk adjustment works, generally speaking, we feel good that so long as there's not sort of a full shutdown like we saw in 2020, which is not what we anticipate currently, we feel confident that we should be on pace to deliver against what we need for MRA, again, based on what we're currently seeing.

So as it respects to the $300 million that we referenced that was contemplated in our April guide, so just for context, our January payment in 2021 would reflect claims that were submitted through the September submission deadline. And then that requires us to estimate the submissions that will come in organically as well as a result of our activities around chart review and prospective programs for the remainder of the year. 
At that time, we were not anticipating the significant surge that we saw across the country in the fourth quarter due to COVID and the resulting reduction in non-COVID utilization. What that led to was lower, what we refer to as, organic diagnosis submissions. So those are not related to the campaigns that we initiated, but rather organic submissions across the provider community based on the utilization that's happening, and those ultimately prove to come in lower than we had anticipated. 
And generally speaking, I think we've mentioned before that those organic submissions are more difficult to estimate, obviously, than the initiatives that we are executing. So that was reflected in our April guide at the time. 
In terms of the midyear adjustment, as we've said on previous calls, the adjustment there was solely related to new members or members who were only enrolled for a partial year in 2020, where we don't have full visibility to their claims. And so while we made an estimate of what we thought the impact would be based on what we were seeing within our concurrent population, ultimately, that midyear payment came in. It reflected a lower level of contribution for those new members than our estimates had originally anticipated. 
I would say that going into 2022, because those impacts were directly related to the COVID pandemic and impacts the utilization, I would not expect to see that continued uncertainty carry into 2022 based on what we're seeing so far this year. Thank you."

As it respects to COVID, as we mentioned, it's just very early. In terms of the increase, what we've seen is literally just in the last couple of weeks. It is still a bit too early to determine whether or not we will see offsetting non-COVID utilization impacts like we have seen in all previous surges. 
I will say, just this last week, we just began to see some level of reduction in inpatient -- non-COVID inpatient, as the COVID cases increase. It's simply just too early to really assess the duration that we might see in terms of an uptake and the offsetting utilization.

The first is with respect to pricing, you asked specifically about the group MA, and I think as we've said before, the group MA space, particularly for larger group accounts, continues to be highly competitive, and we would expect that to continue, and so the margins that we would see on those accounts to continue to be competitive and pressured. 
I think, though, as we think about group MA, there are a lot of other benefits to winning those large accounts in terms of the impact they can have in a local geography on the network and our ability to work with provider partnerships, et cetera. But we expect that to be -- continue to be competitive. 
On the individual side, this is always a process we go through every year to understand sort of the rate environment, the competitive environment, other business performance. We always strive to maintain benefit stability, knowing how important that is to our members as well as our sales and distribution channels. 
So that's always our goal, and there's always a number of puts and takes that we will consider, including the broader enterprise performance as it respects to, first and foremost, delivering against our overall growth target of 11% to 15%. 
And after considering sort of strategic investments, other business performance and then understanding what's required of our Medicare business and what we're trying to achieve, balancing both growth and margin in the long term, all of those are taken into account. 
We remain committed to achieving, long term, our targeted individual margin of 4.5% to 5%, and that will vary each year based on those things that I mentioned. But we would expect this to continue to progress towards that goal. 
On utilization, I would say, really, it's too early, I think, for us to really see anything specific at the clinic level. That information is not as real time available to us as our health plan information. And so to date, I have not seen anything that would provide us any visibility. 
I will say, there are some concentrations geographically. As you've seen probably in the press, Florida is a state that is seeing higher rates. Given we have a concentration of some of our clinics there, I imagine that they would see some, but we actually don't have detailed information on that just yet."

As it respects to 2.5%, as you mentioned, I think in earlier calls during the first quarter, we did mention that our original forecast did contemplate over the course of the second half of the year that we would begin to approach baseline and potentially for a short period of time see above baseline utilization related to pent-up demand. So we just projected that to occur later in the year. 
Our view is that, given the rate at which we've seen it bounce back more quickly, that we have seen that in the first half of the year instead. And so at the time, I don't think we've given specifics on sort of the monthly trajectory. But in general, our original forecast going into the year did anticipate a slower return to baseline and could tolerate it getting to baseline by the end of the year. 
But as I described in my remarks, because we saw the faster bounce-back in non-inpatient and in the first half, that was, again, largely offset by the reductions in COVID and inpatient, those trends will not continue at the same level. And therefore, we will need to see below baseline utilization on the non-COVID side in order to achieve that full year estimate of 3.75%.

There's obviously a range of scenarios that could emerge, some of which could be that, by the end of the year, it gets closer to baseline. So I think that, until we get to the plateau and then see that sustained, I think it will be hard to assess the long term, whether that's a long-term new normal or not. So we'll continue to watch that. 
As for acuity, I would say, so far, we are not seeing indicators that there is a higher acuity, that there's -- or there has been impact from the deferred care in 2020. We are continuing to watch it. But so far, we have not seen any sort of systemic indicators of that. And in fact, some of the things that we were able to initiate along with our provider partners to ensure members receive the needed preventative care through telemedicine were quite hopeful during the pandemic. 
And one data point as an example was that we saw higher medication adherence through the pandemic than we actually did pre-pandemic. So a nice indication that members were receiving the needed preventative care, receiving their medications and hopefully staying on top of their conditions. But so far, we are watching it.

So that's something we'll look at, so we'll need to see whether there's anything we should break out separately, specific to the Kindred business.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.83 for the third quarter of 2021, slightly above consensus estimates. Our year-to-date results reflect the strength of our core operations as we continue to see strong underlying fundamentals across all lines of business and have remained focused on ensuring our members receive the right care at the right time despite the continued disruption caused by the pandemic. 
While our underlying fundamentals are strong, 2021 financial results have been impacted by the ongoing pandemic, which has resulted in an adjustment to our full year adjusted EPS guidance. As detailed in our earnings press release, we have updated our guidance to approximately $20.50 from our previous guidance of $21.25 to $21.75. As Susan will share in more detail, this reduction of approximately $1 in adjusted EPS as a direct result of COVID and corresponds to our current expectation of the total Medicare Advantage utilization inclusive of COVID costs will run 1% below baseline in the fourth quarter, which is 150 basis points less than our previous assumption of 2.5% below baseline. 
This update reflects a more conservative posture going into the final months of the year. And notably, $21.50 remains the baseline of which to grow for 2022. 
As a reminder, prior to this guidance update, we had not recognized a COVID headwind in our '21 guidance as many of our peers did. Our adjusted EPS guidance has been above our long-term growth target at the midpoint throughout the year at 16% growth. This update results in an expected adjusted EPS growth at the lower end of our long-term range and importantly, is not reflective of any concerns with our core operations. 
I will now turn to our operational and strategic update. Our Medicare Advantage individual above-market growth in 2021 of 11% can be in part attributed to our industry-leading quality and consumer satisfaction scores. We are pleased to be recognized by CMS for having 97% of our members in 4-star or higher-rated contracts for 2022. We also increased the number of contracts that received a 5-star rating from one contract in 2021 to 4 contracts in 2022, the most in our history.

Let me just maybe just go back to our guidance update here and ensure that the investors understand the guidance and in addition, how it reflects in the -- as we look at the future here. 
First, the guidance reflects a much more conservative posture going into the final months of the year. And notably, $21.50 remains the baseline of which to grow for 2022. As a reminder, prior to the guidance update, we had not recognized a COVID headwind in our 2021 guidance as many of our peers did. Our adjusted EPS guidance has been above our long-term growth target at the midpoint throughout the year at 16% growth. This update results and expected adjusted EPS growth at the lower end of our long-term range and is importantly does not reflect any concern with our core operations. 
I will now turn to our operational and strategic update. Our Medicare Advantage individual above-market growth in 2021 of 11% can be in part attributed to our industry-leading quality and consumer satisfaction scores. We are pleased to be recognized by CMS for having 97% of our members in 4-star or higher contract for 2022. We also increased the number of contracts that received a 5-star rating from 1 contract in 2021 to 4 contracts in 2022, the most in our history. 
And while CMS did make adjustments to the 2022 star ratings due to the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, these adjustments had minimal impact on our ratings. This further demonstrates our enterprise-wide focus on quality, clinical outcomes and best-in-class customer service, which has been recognized from notable organizations such as Forrester, J.D. Power and USAA. Importantly, the stars bonus allows us to maintain a strong value proposition for our members and provided value supplemental benefits that address social determinants of health and other barriers not addressed by fee-for-service Medicare. 
Looking ahead to 2022, we are pleased to be able to provide stable or enhanced benefits for the majority of our Medicare Advantage members, offering plans that support members' whole health needs while continuing to deliver the human care our members have come to expect from us. Our strong clinical and quality programs drive improved clinical outcomes and cost savings that allow our Medicare Advantage plans to continue to expand member benefits beyond those covered by fee-for-service Medicare. 
Our plans include highly valuable extra benefits, including dental, vision, hearing and over-the-counter medication allowance, transportation support, business program memberships and home delivered meals following an inpatient hospital stay. 
Over the last few years, we've made great progress in addressing social determinants of health and health equity by expanding our Medicare Advantage benefits. Examples of those impactful areas include respite care, distributing 1.5 million meals during COVID, sending fans to seniors with COPD during a heat wave and providing support for financial need impacting a senior's health and well-being. Given the increase in demand for health equity across America, we have aggressively expanded our efforts to address it. 
We continue to advance our consumer segmentation efforts, developing plans that are tailored to the unique needs of specific member populations. This has allowed us to provide benefits that enhance and complement an individual's existing coverage through programs like Medicaid or entities such as Veterans Affairs. 
This approach leads to disproportionate growth. As you've seen in our D-SNP plans designed for dual eligible members where we have grown our membership approximately 40% in both 2022 and 2021, we've expanded our D-SNP offerings for 2022 to cover nearly 65% of the dual eligible population nationally. 
To reduce food and security, 97% of our members enrolled in our D-SNP plans and will have a healthy food card which provides a monthly allowance to purchase approved food and beverages at various national chains. New for 2022, many of our D-SNP members will have reduced Part D drug co-pays as a result of the D-SNP prescription drug savings benefit, which will help address the financial barriers some members face when assessing needed prescriptions, leading to better medication adherence, an important driver of members health -- overall health outcomes. 
As previously shared, we took a more conservative approach to our 2022 bids recognizing the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and potential impacts to premium and claims assumption, allowing us to prioritize long-term benefit stability for our members. While it is early in the selling season, we believe we've struck the right balance and are competitively positioned for our continued growth in Medicare Advantage. Our brand promise to deliver human care resonates with seniors given our comprehensive set of offerings and focus on providing a patient-centric experience based on their specific needs. Susan will provide more detailed 2022 commentary in our remarks, including high-level EPS and membership guidance. 
I now would like to highlight the continued progress of our strategy through the build-out of our health care service platform, starting with primary care business and then moving to our growing home solutions offerings. We have the largest senior-focused, value-based primary care organization in the country, which by year-end, will include approximately 200 clinics, serving 300,000 patients across 24 markets in 9 states. 
We are accelerating organic and inorganic growth nationally and plan to open a total of 30 de novo senior-focused centers in 2022, up from 24 in 2021. This will include launching in 2 new major metropolitan areas, Dallas and Phoenix, next year. This faster-paced expansion comes as we continue to gain conviction in our de novo center model with panel growth in centers launched in 2021, exceeding plan, and clinical performance in our more mature markets continuing to improve. 
In our more mature centers, hospitalizations and ER visits are down 12% year-to-date versus 2019 pre-COVID levels, with star performance tracking to 4.5 stars and NPS score of 90. We will also continue to expand through inorganic growth, completing 7 acquisitions through the third quarter of this year, bringing 21 newly wholly-owned centers to our portfolio. We plan to continue this pace of acquisitions, focused on the markets where we have established presence to provide more access and high-quality care to our patients. 
Turning to the home. We completed the acquisition of Kindred at Home in the third quarter and now the largest home health and hospice organization in the nation. As previously shared, we will be migrating Kindred at Home to Humana's payer-agnostic health care service brand, CenterWell. 
Our efforts to transform home health to a value-based model come at a pivotal time for the industry. As seniors increasingly choose Medicare Advantage, there is a meaningful opportunity for home health organizations to engage differently with patients and Medicare Advantage payers to more holistically address patient needs and improve health outcomes, reduce the total cost of care for health plans and share appropriately in this value creation. We've made substantial progress towards our goal of scaling and maturing a risk-bearing value-based model that manages the provision of home health, durable medical equipment and home infusion services. 
With the acquisition of One Home earlier in 2021, a delegated post-acute management services organization for the home, we have the capabilities to be a value-based convener, providing risk-based contracting and referral management and continue to develop technology, enabling us to coordinate other adjacent services. 
These services include gap in care, closure, primary or emergent care in the home as well as coordination of meals, transportation and other services to positively support social determinants of health. 
We currently care for approximately 270,000 Humana members under value-based home care models in South Florida and Southeast Texas, where we have seen improved outcomes, including emergency room usage being 100 basis points better than Humana's national average. We now are focused on expanding to select markets in North Carolina and Virginia, which we chose based on multiple criteria, including market density, opportunity to significantly reduce home care expense and a robust Kindred at Home footprint. We expect to begin the rollout in the second quarter of 2022 with the goal of covering nearly 50% of Humana Medicare Advantage members under this value-based home health model within the next 5 years. 
We are excited about the continued progress of our strategy in the home, but consistent with our home health peers, we recognize that the national nursing labor shortage poses a significant risk to the industry, and we are taking proactive steps to address it as part of our well-developed integration process with Kindred at Home. 
In some markets, the nursing shortages resulting inadequate capacity to meet demand negatively impacting our ability to grow the top line. We believe the Humana CenterWell brand, supported by our patient-centric culture, will bolster recruiting and retention efforts for nurses. 
We've seen increased nurse satisfaction and engagement in pilot markets where we have deployed value-based concepts with voluntary nursing turnover, improving nearly 10% among home health nurses in 2021. In addition to unlock sufficient capacity to meet our growth goals, we are implementing broader operational improvements and benefit enhancements while also making targeted investments in capacity-constrained areas to enhance nurse recruiting and retention. 
With respect to hospice, our intent remains to ultimately divest the majority interest in this portion of the asset. As our experience has demonstrated, we can deliver desired experiences and outcomes for patients transitioning from restorative care to hospice through partnership models. 
Since we closed the transaction in August, we have continued to explore alternatives for the long-term ownership structure for the business and have initiated steps to reorganize the hospice business for stand-alone operations while also ensuring business continuity and monitoring underlying trends. We do not have any further update on the specific transaction structure or expected transaction timing, but we will provide additional updates as appropriate moving forward. 
Given the continued expansion of interest in our health care service platform, we are committed to providing additional disclosure to give further transparency into the performance of these businesses, beginning with our first quarter 2022 reporting. 
Before closing, I want to touch on the current regulatory and legislative landscape. As you know, last week, the White House and Congressional leaders released their plan known as Build Back Better, which includes several proposed changes to the Medicare program, including establishing a hearing benefit starting in calendar year 2024, which will be included in the Medicare Advantage benchmark. 
Given that today, more than 40% of Medicare beneficiaries, over 27 million seniors and those with disabilities are enrolled in Medicare Advantage, we were encouraged to see that the package did not include any payment reductions to the program. As this legislation continues to advance and likely be modified and as we look ahead to the annual CMS call letter and rate notice period, we will continue to work with policymakers and the Biden administration to further improve Medicare Advantage, building on the program's innovation and significant progress in areas like value-based care, social determinants of health, affordability and financial protection for beneficiaries. as well as reducing the total cost of care. 
These attributes, along with the deep consumer popularity of Medicare Advantage are what have enabled it to have a strong bipartisan support with hundreds of members of Congress on the record supporting the program. With Medicare Advantage serving as a leading example of a successful private-public partnership, I am often missed it. We can continue to lead on important health care issues facing both individuals and society, including addressing health and equities, improving health outcomes and expanding value-based care. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan."

Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $4.83 for the third quarter and updated full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $20.50 to reflect a net unmitigated COVID headwind resulting from our current",1555,"Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. 
Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $4.83 for the third quarter and updated full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $20.50 to reflect a net unmitigated COVID headwind resulting from our current view of utilization levels for the balance of the year. Before beginning, I would point you to Page 4 of our earnings press release for detail of our previous assumptions for Medicare Advantage utilization in the second half of the year, actual third quarter utilization results as well as current projections for the fourth quarter. 
I will now walk you through the details, starting with a reminder of our previous commentary. As of our second quarter call, full year guidance assumed non-COVID Medicare Advantage utilization would run 2.5% below baseline in the second half of the year, with a further assumption of minimal COVID testing and treatment costs for the same period. In September 2021, as a result of the surge in COVID cases due to the Delta variant, we updated our commentary on full year guidance to indicate we expected non-COVID Medicare Advantage utilization to be 5.5% below baseline in the back half of the year, while being partially [indiscernible] by 3% of COVID costs. Therefore, again, assuming total utilization would be 2.5% below baseline in the back half of 2021. 
What we've seen developed for the third quarter is that total utilization is running 1% below baseline versus the previously anticipated 2.5%. COVID costs have been higher than initially anticipated as the Delta variant resulted in hospitalization levels on par with what we experienced in January of 2021 and were overwhelmingly driven by the 20% of our Medicare Advantage members believed to be unvaccinated. 
These higher-than-expected COVID costs were fully offset by depressed non-COVID utilization in the quarter. As COVID hospitalizations increase or decrease, we continue to see an approximate 1:1 offset in non-COVID hospitalization levels. We also continue to see significantly reduced non-inpatient utilization when surges occur, offsetting the higher average cost of a COVID admission. 
However, for the third quarter, in total, we saw 1% incremental reduction in utilization beyond the level needed to offset COVID costs versus a 2.5% contemplated in our previous guide. As a result, we have adjusted our full year guide to now reflect the fourth quarter running similarly with total Medicare Advantage utilization running 1% below baseline, inclusive of estimated COVID costs, consistent with what we experienced in the third quarter. 
We realized higher-than-expected positive current claims development in Medicare Advantage in the third quarter as well as other operating outperformance largely mitigating the lower-than-anticipated depressed Medicare Advantage utilization, allowing us to report results that were slightly favorable to the Street estimates. Our revised guidance does not assume that the higher levels of favorable current period development seen in the third quarter will continue. Taken together, our updated full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance takes a more conservative posture going into the final months of 2021. 
And it's important to note, as we've consistently shared throughout the year, the midpoint of our original guidance range of $21.50 remains the correct baseline for 2022, given our approach to pricing. 
I will now briefly touch on operating results across our segments before sharing early thoughts on 2022 performance. Our Medicare Advantage growth remains on track and consistent with previous expectations. We have refined our full year individual Medicare Advantage membership guidance to up approximately 450,000 members, consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance of up 425,000 to 475,000 members. This outlook represents above-market growth with an increase of 11.4% year-over-year. 
Our Medicaid results continue to exceed initial expectations due to higher-than-anticipated membership increases largely attributable to the extension of the public health emergency. We now expect to add 125,000 to 150,000 Medicaid members in 2021, up from our previous expectation of 100,000 to 125,000 members. 
Utilization trends continue to be favorable to initial expectations and the Medicaid team is working diligently toward a successful implementation in Ohio with go-live anticipated in July. 
In our Group and Specialty segment, fully insured medical results were impacted by higher-than-expected COVID costs in the quarter, while our specialty business results continue to exceed expectations as utilization particularly for dental services remained lower than previously anticipated. Recall that our guidance as of the second quarter did not contemplate significant COVID costs in the back half of the year and the commercial business is not seeing the same level of utilization offset experience in Medicare Advantage. 
From a membership perspective, we have increased our expected group medical membership losses from $100,000 to $125,000, reflecting the expectation of additional losses in the fourth quarter as the result of rating actions taken to account for the expected impact of COVID in 2022. 
Finally, within our Healthcare Services operations, the pharmacy and provider businesses continue to perform slightly better than expected, with pharmacy benefiting from increased mail order penetration as a result of customer experience improvements and marketing campaigns. And the provider business seeing continued operating improvements in our more mature centers which are now aligned under the same leadership is our de novo centers. 
As Bruce mentioned in his remarks, we are actively integrating the Kindred at Home operations and results post integration have largely been in line with expectations. Similar to home health and hospice peers, the business is being impacted by COVID and labor shortages. For the third quarter, home health admissions grew low single digits year-over-year while hospice experienced a low single-digit decline year-over-year. We will continue to closely monitor trends as we make targeted investments to sustainably improve the recruitment and retention of nurses. 
Now let me take a few moments to share an early outlook for 2022, starting with membership. As you're aware, the overall PDP market continues to decline as more and more beneficiaries, including dual eligibles, choose Medicare Advantage. In addition, as we have discussed previously, PDP plans to become a commodity with a low-price leader capturing disproportionate growth. 
Consistent with 2021, the Walmart value plan will offer competitive benefits but will not be the low premium leader in 2022. As a result, we expect a net decline in PDP membership of a few hundred thousand members in 2022. We continue to focus on creating enterprise value for our PDP plans by driving increased mail order penetration and conversions to Medicare Advantage. 
With respect to group Advanced Group Medicare Advantage, we expect membership to be generally flat for 2022 as we do not anticipate any large accounts will be gained or lost as we continue to maintain pricing discipline in a highly competitive market. 
Moving to individual Medicare Advantage. As previously shared, we took a more conservative approach to our 2022 bids, reflecting the continued uncertainty associated with the pandemic. We expect to grow our individual Medicare Advantage membership in a range of 325,000 to 375,000 members in 2022 or approximately 8% year-over-year, reflective of our prudent approach we took to pricing for 2022 and the competitive nature of the market. 
It is early in our AEP selling season and the outlook we are providing today could change depending on how sales and voluntary disenrollments ultimately come in. And consistent with prior years, we have very little member disenrollment data at this point in the AEP cycle. 
I will now turn to our expected 2022 financial performance. As previously mentioned, I want to reiterate that the $21.50 midpoint of our original 2021 guide continues to be the appropriate jumping off point for 2022 adjusted EPS growth given our approach to pricing. In addition, we feel comfortable that the risk adjustment assumptions in our 2022 pricing are appropriate, as providers have been actively engaging with our members to ensure their conditions are fully documented and that care plans are established to address gaps in care. 
Provider interactions and documentation of clinical diagnoses that we anticipate will impact 2022 revenue are approximately 92% complete to date, in line with both our expectations for 2021 as well as the estimated completion rate for the same time period in 2019. We also assumed a medical costs would return to baseline levels, reflective of pre-COVID historical trending. 
From an earnings perspective, we believe the conservative approach we took to 2022 pricing struck the appropriate balance between membership and earnings growth. Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to enter the year with an appropriately conservative view of our initial 2022 financial outlook. Accordingly, we anticipate that our initial EPS guidance will target the low end of our long-term growth range of 11% to 15%. 
We expect that COVID will be net neutral to the Medicare business in 2022 as we do not anticipate a risk adjustment headwind and expect COVID utilization to be offset by a reduction in non-COVID utilization. However, our initial guide will allow for an explicit COVID-related headwind that we can tolerate, should it emerge, similar to the approach some of our peers took in 2021. We believe entering the year with this more conservative approach is prudent in the current environment and sets the company up for success in 2022. We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in early February. 
With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

So to your point, estimating the impact of COVID has proven to be more challenging particularly given the environment that we were in, in 2020 is quite different than what we're experiencing, obviously, in 2021. In 2020, no one was vaccinated, various states have lockdown throughout the year. As we acknowledged in our Q2 call, anticipating how behavior might emerge in an environment where largely people are back to normal and a large percentage of our Medicare population were vaccinated, we just recognized that it was difficult to anticipate whether we see the same level of offset through the surge. 
The good news is, as we saw the surge emerge in the third quarter, despite it being just as high as what we experienced the last time, we did continue to see a full offset. The hospitalization offsets have been pretty consistent throughout 2020 and 2021. It's on the non-inpatient side where we tend to see more variation. And as we explained in the second quarter, that claims service category is one where we don't have the same level of near-term visibility. 
Having said that, we've studied all of the historical patterns based on what we saw in the third quarter, and our estimates of the continued decline in the COVID curve in the fourth quarter, we feel very comfortable with the assumptions that are underlying our revised guide and feel like we have sufficient visibility to feel confident we can deliver against that. 
Your question about 2022 was a good one. As we've explained in all of our calls, given this late surge in 2021, getting visibility to where baseline trend is actually running, obviously, will be more challenging. However, given how we approach the pricing for 2022, meaning that we started with pre-COVID historical levels and assumed historical trending factors not anticipating any ongoing depressed utilization into 2022, we feel confident that, that's an appropriate baseline expectation. So we'll continue to watch it. And certainly, if we see something different emerge, if any of the depression continues, that would be positive for us, but we are not contemplating it, which is what gives us confidence about our approach to 2022."

I mean, first, we do see more and more intensity in the local markets and similar to in the past, we see some players being more aggressive to try to gain market share while others are a little more aligned with the pricing that -- and a little more stability in the marketplace. So we do see a bell curve in just how people are approaching it as their strategic plan is pushing them to make those decisions. 
We are seeing more awareness in the marketplace as a result of the amount of education that's going on through marketing and through the telesales efforts that are going on. And I think that is a positive for the industry because it really brings alive all the benefits that members receive. It creates more competitive nature for that for those members, but it does create, I think, more growth industry-wide. 
For us as an organization, we were one of the early adopters of the tele market -- the telesales area, and we have benefited from that, I think, in multiple different ways, benefited from it in the way of both our market growth and in addition our ability to reach a population that we haven't been able to reach in the past. So I do think it's a benefit for us. But to answer your question, more competitive in the local market, more awareness in the industry.

Just to understand, Susan, if you think about 80% of your MA members are vaccinated based on your estimate. So just kind of trying to reconcile what you're saying versus what some of your peers are saying. What do you think happened that drove COVID hospitalization to levels experienced back in January? Was that sort of a specific geography or anything else that can explain it? And then the longer-term question is really around sort of virtual. Many of your peers launched your virtual first offering on the commercial side for 2022. Do you see room for some sort of virtual first type offering in the Medicare population, especially when you consider sort of the Kindred capabilities?"

So to take your question, so with respect to the high COVID levels and you're right, and honestly, this was something that was a bit surprising to us as well that we did see levels on par with what we experienced in the last surge despite the high vaccination rate. And what we learned is to your point, some of that was a reflection of our geographic mix. Say like Florida and Texas and Louisiana did see higher levels than even the previous surge. It represents a new all-time high, and we have disproportionate share there. So that was part of it. 
But the main driver is that as we looked at the hospitalization rate between vaccinated and unvaccinated, the unvaccinated fairly consistently saw hospitalization rate that was 10 or more times the vaccinated population. And so that, again, as I mentioned in my comments, was the overwhelming driver. And because of the spread of the Delta variant through that vaccinated population and at much higher hospitalization rate, that is what drove the level on par with what we saw historically. 
To your second question about Virtual First in Medicare, we were pleased with the COVID pandemic to see that primary care providers and specialists really did adopt telemedicine at a higher rate to ensure that they could continue to support their patients and their permitted needs. I think as a result of that, frankly, providers gained a better appreciation of the range of care and the quality of care that they can provide through virtual, which, frankly, pre pandemic, they really didn't appreciate were adopting. 
So I think we will see some continued use of virtual technology to enhance the operating model and allow for more touch points with their patients than we did pre-pandemic. Your question about home health is definitely a good one. It's something we're looking at, particularly with the challenges we have in terms of nursing labor shortages. Virtual is one strategy we're looking at to see how it can be leveraged to, again, create more touch points with the patient and improve the efficiency of the operating model to just create more overall capacity. And so we'll be testing with Kindred appropriate uses of that and where we can implement it and still see the high-quality outcomes that we would expect. So we'll be testing that and the hope would be that you'll see expansion of that in the future."

But on the Medicare side, what we do find is that there's a great opportunity to see the patient, both to understand the patient in a physical setting. And unlike more episodic of care versus a chronic care management there's a good -- there is an importance of being able to have a physical and encouraging a physical interaction. 
We see that telehealth as being an opportunity to have a complementary and more interaction. But I don't know if it would be a replacement or we would want to motivate highly chronic members to have a Virtual First interaction for a whole host of reasons, both from a care point of view and from the ability for us to establish the proper care plan."

And you might recall from our previous commentary, what you typically see is a tail of depressed utilization anytime you come off a curve, which is what allows you to sort of fully recapture the cost of that COVID peak. And so we've -- with this surge in particular, what's kind of interesting is different states, as I mentioned before, are seeing different levels of utilization relative to previous surges, Texas, Florida, were examples where we saw a very high peak and a very rapid decline. 
There are some other states like New York and Michigan, where we're actually seeing a much more moderate and sort of gradual increase without sort seeing the same start peak in decline. So as we've seen that in total that on a national basis, what we're seeing is the slope of the downturn from -- coming off of the peak isn't quite as sharp as what we've seen historically. 
We've drilled into each of those states and are consistently seeing irrespective of that difference in peak level, we are still seeing that 1:1 offset regardless. And so to some degree, we think there's just an overall capacity constraints, particularly on the inpatient side that comes into play. And the rest is just that behavior change in terms of providers and patients as they manage through it. 
So based on what we've seen emerge and particularly in the third quarter with that 1% offset, everything we've seen suggests that assuming the same level of offset as we continue to come off that third quarter peak is reasonable. To your point about early indicators, we do, as we've said before, have really good real-time information on inpatient activity. That continues to hold where as the COVID utilization comes down, we'll see a bounce back on a 1:1 offset in the non-COVID hospitalization. So that has been very consistent. And we'll continue to watch the non-inpatient, but again, based on everything we've seen, we believe that is a reasonable assumption. 
In terms of your question about value-based providers, interestingly enough, most of our -- both our own centers and some of our high-performing partners, they have indicated that they are not seeing the same sort of neutrality or even benefit from a COVID event that we do. And the theory there is that in general, they manage sort of the unnecessary hospitalization events as lower value out of the system more routinely. 
And so when you do see a surge, there's not as much utilization to manage to be depressed because they have already managed it out on a more run rate basis. And so we're still, frankly, trying to assess and use some analytics on that. I think they may take a little bit more time for their claims to fully develop and have a full view of that. But their belief is that they don't see the same level of net benefit that we do on the health plan side generally."

And by reaffirming that, that is the appropriate baseline really just reinforces that the way we approached our 2022 pricing acknowledge that despite, however, the results emerged in 2021, that our revenue assumptions would assume that Medicare risk adjustment return to more normalized levels for 2022. And that claims also returned to more normalized levels as if COVID cannot occur. And so again, for claims, we started with pre-pandemic levels in 2019 and using historical trend factors turned that forward. And so that's why we continue to reinforce given that approach, $21.50 is the appropriate jumping off point from which we would grow and expect to be in our long-term arrangement in 2022, recognizing, however, from an initial guide perspective, we do intend to take a more conservative approach to ensure we're set up for success and target the lower end of that range."

I think, first, obviously, adding the number of organic units in the earlier years creates a drag as they mature, and we're seeing some great maturation in the cohorts that have been open a year or 2, both on a membership side from a point of view of revenue and in addition, on the cost side. So we feel very confident. And that's one of the reasons why we increased the number of cohorts this year as a result of our confidence and conviction in the business outcome. 
What we see over a longer period of time is as we call it the J curve, we'll start to become into profitability of the ones that we opened in the earlier years. And that will start to give us growth. So if you were to shut off the development, you actually see a pretty quick growth rate within the existing business. We are accenting that by 2 other opportunities for growth. One is the existing operations of the businesses that have been open for a while, the mature centers. And we're seeing some really great same-store growth in that area and they have done a great turnaround over the last few years in being able to approve that. 
And although it doesn't show up in the profitability because of the J curve override it a lot, we are seeing some really great improvement there with operationally and then also from a quality and experience point of view. And then the third area of growth for us as an organization is really in the inorganic area. As many of you know, we do have a relationship with a number of providers, especially in our more mature markets that we have the right of first refusal. And that offers us an advantage in being able to continue to densify markets that we're in and add additional sites and  we did that in 2021, we anticipate doing in 2022. And those are very synergistic inorganic opportunities from the standpoint that we're able to evolve the management of it into our existing management team. We're able to, in addition, bring some of our operating capabilities to those centers. 
So 3, the continuum advancement of our J curve and what we see there, the more mature centers continuing to improve that. And then the third, the inorganic growth and being able to leverage in some of the markets we have. I think over a period of time, we're going to see a 5 to 7 period of time, I think you're going to see a fairly sizable business come out of this as a result of the investments we're making today and both in the organic and inorganic area, really today is the leading size clinic or clinics oriented to senior business.

Relative to financing, we don't have -- we haven't come to structure yet. And Justin, I think that will be an active conversation with the investors in probably the second quarter of 2022. We will come back to the investors and discuss how we will finance another cohort or number of clinics for the foreseeable future. We, today, have enough of the capital to invest from our off-balance sheet financing on Welsh, Carson to get us through to the 2022 openings. And so we -- this doesn't cause any slowdown into our openings.

What you'll typically instead see from us is product expansion within our existing geographies. That could be additional -- a couple of years ago, it was really focused on our $0 premium LTPO product, as an example. You see us continue to expand our dual eligible D-SNP footprint, and you will see county expansion there in 2022 as well as our veteran offering, both the duals and the veterans, as we said before, are great examples of where we focused on product and consumer segmentation and designing product that uniquely meets the needs of this consumers. 
And when we do that well, you see an opportunity for disproportionate growth. So we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to do that. But again, I think you'll see more product expansion from Humana versus county expansion just because to your point, we've already got pretty broad coverage with some products."

So for your first question on 2022, recall that in 2021, when we came out with our second quarter commentary, we acknowledged that we had a net COVID headwind that had emerged. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we did not contemplate that explicitly in our original guidance for 2021. So as we saw that emerge as we explained in the second quarter, we were able to mitigate a fair amount of that through other business outperformance, some favorable prior period development and other items. 
But in order to achieve our guide, it did require that utilization continued to run below baseline throughout the year. That is not what we're considering in our 2022 pricing. We assume that it will bounce back. And so it's really just a reflection -- the challenges in 2021 are just acknowledging that while we are seeing net utilization below baseline levels, it's running less than we had previously anticipated or needed in order to achieve the guide and overcome that net COVID headwind that we discussed in the second quarter. 
Again, given the way we approach '22 pricing, while our pricing didn't explicitly contemplate COVID costs beyond just sort of vaccination and testing, as we've consistently said, we did take a more overall conservative approach to pricing, recognizing there would be uncertainty that we would need to be able to navigate through and also recognizing that it was a favorable rate environment, we had the headwinds. We wanted to make sure that we could maintain long-term benefit stability for our members and contemplated there may be a less favorable rate environment in 2023. 
So again, those are all the reasons that we approach pricing the way we did and the reason we continue to have confidence because we did not anticipate any ongoing net benefit in respect to price utilization into 2022. On Kindred, and we've had this question a couple of times. I think we've addressed it both in the second quarter call and again, maybe at Morgan Stanley, is that we -- that was one of the items that helped us address the net COVID headwind in 2021, the contribution from the full integration. We knew at the time of bid that we would be integrating Kindred. So that was something we were able to consider as we aligned around our targets and our good pricing for 2022. 
We've always said the capital deployment is one of the levers we have available, and we'll use to sustainably deliver our long-term growth target of 11% to 15%, so that was something we specifically contemplated in pricing. So it wouldn't represent an incremental tailwind for 2022, but certainly expect the value that we expect to create from that value-based model and the continued growth of Kindred will certainly continue to contribute in the future to our sustainable ability to deliver against our long-term target."

And what we see is we actively work to educate our PDP members about the value proposition of Medicare Advantage. In recent years as we've expanded our dual-eligible SNP offerings that increased our ability to drive those conversions because a large percentage of our PDP members are low-income or dual-eligible members. 
And so what we consistently see is that we will be able to generate a disproportionate share of our PDP members who ultimately choose Medicare Advantage. And so we will disproportionately capture share within a Humana plan relative to what you would see our share capture in just overall Medicare Advantage. So really pleased with that. 
Having said that, some of our members do use other competitor MA plans. And so we continue to focus on identifying if there are opportunities to enhance the product to attract more PDP members who ultimately are likely to migrate to MA, are there things we can do to enhance the marketing, product segmentation, all of those things we've talked about to continue to drive increased share capture for those PDP members who ultimately determine that MA provides a better value proposition for them. 
On your second question around some of the recent tax has come out, we certainly are watching it closely. We'd say it really represents a framework at this point. We'll have to see some of the detailed tax that ultimately comes through and what the final proposals are and certainly are certainly supportive of anything that can be done to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for our members. And it's something we would certainly contemplate and take into consideration in our pricing each year. But I think at this point, it's too early, we'll need to see what comes out of the final tax."

That's what they're built for. That's how the staffing is constructed. That's how the recruiting of the physicians, that's how the business model is built. And so that sort of leads you to the conclusion the majority of them are going to be MA members. 
Now we have some Medicare fee-for-service side members in there. They are really oriented to how, over time, that can evolve to be a longer-term member for us through a Medicare Advantage relationship. They are agnostic platforms. And so there's a good composition of Humana members as well as other payers in the clinic. That's why it's really called CenterWell, it's to reinforce that agnostic nature, and we are very oriented to that being agnostic. And a number of our sites, there's probably more non-Humana members than there are Humana members on there.
So you do see us oriented to a much broader opportunity for Medicare Advantage. In addition, in a few of the sites, we do have direct contracting members as a result of that. And so we are in the opportunity to take Medicare fee-for-service relationships that then -- that are more oriented to value-based. Your last part of your question just was the relationship. Over time, they will take full risk. 
Now there might be an earlier part of the opening that they will take a path to risk orientation where they'll have some upside and downside limits, but they will, over time, convert to a full risk model. And that's really just as the panel size gets bigger and bigger, the ability to manage the risk is much easier because of the diversification of the panel size."

So I'll try to answer this as much as I can, maybe a little bit more generally. But as you said before, right now, in our '22 pricing, our approach to baseline trend was to go back to pre-COVID levels, use historical trend factors and roll that forward. Now we certainly -- our models have a lot of granularity to them. And so certainly, they would take into account any site of service shifts that we may be seeing and then our estimate of what those might do going forward. 
They also look at what we've referred to as health care pipeline technologies to anything else that we expect that may be coming to market that would impact trends differently than what we've seen historically. And that's just part of our consistent process. So all of that work was done to support our '22 pricing. 
We have not changed our view of that currently. Although as you can imagine, there is a lot of work being done across the enterprise to study as best we can what has emerged over the course of 2020 and 2021, how we can decipher COVID impacted utilization, depression versus what might be just lower baseline trend. I think our view and as you've seen us consistently be able to meet and beat earnings historically, would imply that our core sort of trend forecasting models may have a little bit of conservatism in that. We've not assumed that going forward. Trending off '19 is certainly more years of trending than we would typically like. And so that's why we're going to do a lot more analysis between now and issuing our final guidance points for 2022 to see if there's any additional information that would inform our perspective on 2022 baselines. 
But what we're considering now we think is an appropriately conservative view. To your point, is the COVID headwind that we will contemplate in that guide does emerge, then we would be seeing utilization above baseline levels -- or I'm sorry, hit that backwards -- that I heard -- yes. That we would be able to tolerate it running above baseline, even though we don't expect that to occur. If it does not occur, then that would obviously represent an additional tailwind for us that you should see unwind over the course of the year. Does that answer..."

Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.83 for the third quarter of 2021, slightly above consensus estimates. Our year-to-date results reflect the strength of our core operations as we continue to see strong underlying fundamentals across all lines of business and have remained focused on ensuring our members receive the right care at the right time despite the continued disruption caused by the pandemic. 
While our underlying fundamentals are strong, 2021 financial results have been impacted by the ongoing pandemic, which has resulted in an adjustment to our full year adjusted EPS guidance. As detailed in our earnings press release, we have updated our guidance to approximately $20.50 from our previous guidance of $21.25 to $21.75. As Susan will share in more detail, this reduction of approximately $1 in adjusted EPS, as a direct result of COVID and corresponds to our current expectation of the total Medicare Advantage utilization inclusive of COVID costs, will run 1% below baseline in the fourth quarter, which is 150 basis points less than our previous assumption of 2.5% below baseline. 
This update reflects a more conservative posture going into the final months of the year. And notably, $21.50 remains the baseline of which to grow for 2022. 
As a reminder, prior to this guidance update, we had not recognized a COVID headwind in our '21 guidance as many of our peers did. Our adjusted EPS guidance has been above our long-term growth target at the midpoint throughout the year at 16% growth. This update results in an expected adjusted EPS growth at the lower end of our long-term range and, importantly, is not reflective of any concerns with our core operations. 
I will now turn to our operational and strategic update. Our Medicare Advantage individual above-market growth in 2021 of 11% can be in part attributed to our industry-leading quality and consumer satisfaction scores. We are pleased to be recognized by CMS for having 97% of our members in 4-Star or higher-rated contracts for 2022. We also increased the number of contracts that received a 5-Star rating from one contract in 2021 to 4 contracts in 2022, the most in our history. And while CMS did make adjustments to the...

I will now turn to our operational and strategic update. Our Medicare Advantage individual above-market growth in 2021 of 11% can be in part attributed to our industry-leading quality and consumer satisfaction scores. We are pleased to be recognized by CMS for having 97% of our members in 4-Star or higher contract for 2022. We also increased the number of contracts that received a 5-Star rating from 1 contract in 2021 to 4 contracts in 2022, the most in our history. 
And while CMS did make adjustments to the 2022 Star ratings due to the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, these adjustments had minimal impact on our ratings. This further demonstrates our enterprise-wide focus on quality, clinical outcomes and best-in-class customer service, which has been recognized from notable organizations such as Forrester, J.D. Power and USAA. Importantly, the Stars bonus allows us to maintain a strong value proposition for our members and provided valuable supplemental benefits that address social determinants of health and other barriers not addressed by fee-for-service Medicare. 
Looking ahead to 2022, we are pleased to be able to provide stable or enhanced benefits for the majority of our Medicare Advantage members, offering plans that support members' whole health needs while continuing to deliver the human care our members have come to expect from us. Our strong clinical and quality programs drive improved clinical outcomes and cost savings that allow our Medicare Advantage plans to continue to expand member benefits beyond those covered by fee-for-service Medicare. 
Our plans include highly valuable extra benefits, including dental, vision, hearing and over-the-counter medication allowance, transportation support, business program memberships and home-delivered meals following an inpatient hospital stay. 
Over the last few years, we've made great progress in addressing social determinants of health and health equity by expanding our Medicare Advantage benefits. Examples of those impactful areas include respite care, distributing 1.5 million meals during COVID, sending fans to seniors with COPD during a heat wave and providing support for financial need impacting a senior's health and well-being. Given the increase in demand for health equity across America, we have aggressively expanded our efforts to address it. 
We continue to advance our consumer segmentation efforts, developing plans that are tailored to the unique needs of specific member populations. This has allowed us to provide benefits that enhance and complement an individual's existing coverage through programs like Medicaid or entities such as Veterans Affairs. 
This approach leads to disproportionate growth. As you've seen in our D-SNP plans designed for dual-eligible members, where we have grown our membership approximately 40% in both 2022 and 2021, we've expanded our D-SNP offerings for 2022 to cover nearly 65% of the dual-eligible population nationally. 
To reduce food and security, 97% of our members enrolled in our D-SNP plans and will have a healthy food card, which provides a monthly allowance to purchase approved food and beverages at various national chains. New for 2022, many of our D-SNP members will have reduced Part D drug co-pays as a result of the D-SNP prescription drug savings benefit, which will help address the financial barriers some members face when assessing needed prescriptions, leading to better medication adherence, an important driver of members health -- overall health outcomes. 
As previously shared, we took a more conservative approach to our 2022 bids, recognizing the continued uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and potential impacts to premium and claims assumption, allowing us to prioritize long-term benefit stability for our members. While it is early in the selling season, we believe we've struck the right balance and are competitively positioned for our continued growth in Medicare Advantage. Our brand promise to deliver human care resonates with seniors given our comprehensive set of offerings and focus on providing a patient-centric experience based on their specific needs. Susan will provide more detailed 2022 commentary in our remarks, including high-level EPS and membership guidance. 
I now would like to highlight the continued progress of our strategy through the build-out of our health care service platforms, starting with primary care business and then moving to our growing home solutions offerings. We have the largest senior-focused, value-based primary care organization in the country, which by year-end, will include approximately 200 clinics, serving 300,000 patients across 24 markets in 9 states. 
We are accelerating organic and inorganic growth nationally and plan to open a total of 30 de novo senior-focused centers in 2022, up from 24 in 2021. This will include launching in 2 new major metropolitan areas, Dallas and Phoenix, next year. This faster-paced expansion comes as we continue to gain conviction in our de novo center model with panel growth in centers launched in '20 and 2021 exceeding plan, and clinical performance in our more mature markets continuing to improve. 
In our more mature centers, hospitalizations and ER visits are down 12% year-to-date versus 2019 pre-COVID levels, with Stars performance tracking to 4.5 Stars and NPS score of 90. We will also continue to expand through inorganic growth, completing 7 acquisitions through the third quarter of this year, bringing 21 newly wholly-owned centers to our portfolio. We plan to continue this pace of acquisitions, focused on the markets where we have established presence to provide more access and high-quality care to our patients. 
Turning to the home. We completed the acquisition of Kindred at Home in the third quarter and now the largest home health and hospice organization in the nation. As previously shared, we will be migrating Kindred at Home to Humana's payer-agnostic health care service brand, CenterWell. 
Our efforts to transform home health to a value-based model come at a pivotal time for the industry. As seniors increasingly choose Medicare Advantage, there is a meaningful opportunity for home health organizations to engage differently with patients and Medicare Advantage payers to more holistically address patient needs and improve health outcomes, reduce the total cost of care for health plans and share appropriately in this value creation. We've made substantial progress towards our goal of scaling and maturing a risk-bearing value-based model that manages the provision of home health, durable medical equipment and home infusion services. 
With the acquisition of onehome earlier in 2021, a delegated post-acute management services organization for the home, we have the capabilities to be a value-based convener, providing risk-based contracting and referral management and continue to develop technology, enabling us to coordinate other adjacent services. 
These services include gap in care, closure, primary or emergent care in the home as well as coordination of meals, transportation and other services to positively support social determinants of health. 
We currently care for approximately 270,000 Humana members under value-based home care models in South Florida and Southeast Texas, where we have seen improved outcomes, including emergency room usage being 100 basis points better than Humana's national average. We now are focused on expanding to select markets in North Carolina and Virginia, which we chose based on multiple criteria, including market density, opportunity to significantly reduce home care expense and a robust Kindred at Home footprint. We expect to begin the rollout in the second quarter of 2022 with the goal of covering nearly 50% of Humana Medicare Advantage members under this value-based home health model within the next 5 years. 
We are excited about the continued progress of our strategy in the home. But consistent with our home health peers, we recognize that the national nursing labor shortage poses a significant risk to the industry, and we are taking proactive steps to address it as part of our well-developed integration process with Kindred at Home. 
In some markets, the nursing shortage is resulting inadequate capacity to meet demand, negatively impacting our ability to grow the top line. We believe the Humana CenterWell brand, supported by our patient-centric culture, will bolster recruiting and retention efforts for nurses. 
We've seen increased nurse satisfaction and engagement in pilot markets where we have deployed value-based concepts, with voluntary nursing turnover improving nearly 10% among home health nurses in 2021. In addition, to unlock sufficient capacity to meet our growth goals, we are implementing broader operational improvements and benefit enhancements while also making targeted investments in capacity-constrained areas to enhance nurse recruiting and retention. 
With respect to hospice, our intent remains to ultimately divest the majority interest in this portion of the asset. As our experience has demonstrated, we can deliver desired experiences and outcomes for patients transitioning from restorative care to hospice through partnership models. 
Since we closed the transaction in August, we have continued to explore alternatives for the long-term ownership structure for the business and have initiated steps to reorganize the hospice business for stand-alone operations while also ensuring business continuity and monitoring underlying trends. We do not have any further update on the specific transaction structure or expected transaction timing, but we will provide additional updates as appropriate moving forward. 
Given the continued expansion of interest in our health care service platform, we are committed to providing additional disclosure to give further transparency into the performance of these businesses, beginning with our first quarter 2022 reporting. 
Before closing, I want to touch on the current regulatory and legislative landscape. As you know, last week, the White House and Congressional leaders released their plan known as Build Back Better, which includes several proposed changes to the Medicare program, including establishing a hearing benefit starting in calendar year 2024, which will be included in the Medicare Advantage benchmark. 
Given that today, more than 40% of Medicare beneficiaries, over 27 million seniors and those with disabilities are enrolled in Medicare Advantage, we were encouraged to see that the package did not include any payment reductions to the program. As this legislation continues to advance and likely be modified and as we look ahead to the annual CMS call letter and rate notice period, we will continue to work with policymakers and the Biden administration to further improve Medicare Advantage, building on the program's innovation and significant progress in areas like value-based care, social determinants of health, affordability and financial protection for beneficiaries as well as reducing the total cost of care. 
These attributes, along with the deep consumer popularity of Medicare Advantage, are what have enabled it to have a strong bipartisan support with hundreds of members of Congress on the record supporting the program. With Medicare Advantage serving as a leading example of a successful private-public partnership, I am often missed it. We can continue to lead on important health care issues facing both individuals and society, including addressing health and equities, improving health outcomes and expanding value-based care. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan."
29618,1683170079,2423517,"Humana Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $4.83 for the third quarter and updated full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $20.50 to reflect a net unmitigated COVID headwind resulting from our current",1555,"Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. 
Today, we reported adjusted EPS of $4.83 for the third quarter and updated full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $20.50 to reflect a net unmitigated COVID headwind resulting from our current view of utilization levels for the balance of the year. Before beginning, I would point you to Page 4 of our earnings press release for detail of our previous assumptions for Medicare Advantage utilization in the second half of the year, actual third quarter utilization results as well as current projections for the fourth quarter. 
I will now walk you through this detail, starting with a reminder of our previous commentary. As of our second quarter call, full year guidance assumed non-COVID Medicare Advantage utilization would run 2.5% below baseline in the second half of the year, with a further assumption of minimal COVID testing and treatment costs for the same period. In September 2021, as a result of the surge in COVID cases due to the Delta variant, we updated our commentary on full year guidance to indicate we expected non-COVID Medicare Advantage utilization to be 5.5% below baseline in the back half of the year, while being partially [indiscernible] by 3% of COVID costs. Therefore, again, assuming total utilization would be 2.5% below baseline in the back half of 2021. 
What we've seen developed for the third quarter is that total utilization is running 1% below baseline versus the previously anticipated 2.5%. COVID costs have been higher than initially anticipated as the Delta variant resulted in hospitalization levels on par with what we experienced in January of 2021 and were overwhelmingly driven by the 20% of our Medicare Advantage members believed to be unvaccinated. 
These higher-than-expected COVID costs were fully offset by depressed non-COVID utilization in the quarter. As COVID hospitalizations increase or decrease, we continue to see an approximate 1:1 offset in non-COVID hospitalization levels. We also continue to see significantly reduced non-inpatient utilization when surges occur, offsetting the higher average cost of a COVID admission. 
However, for the third quarter, in total, we saw 1% incremental reduction in utilization beyond the level needed to offset COVID costs versus a 2.5% contemplated in our previous guide. As a result, we have adjusted our full year guide to now reflect the fourth quarter running similarly with total Medicare Advantage utilization running 1% below baseline, inclusive of estimated COVID costs, consistent with what we experienced in the third quarter. 
We realized higher-than-expected positive current period claims development in Medicare Advantage in the third quarter as well as other operating outperformance largely mitigating the lower-than-anticipated depressed Medicare Advantage utilization, allowing us to report results that were slightly favorable to the Street estimates. Our revised guidance does not assume that the higher levels of favorable current period development seen in the third quarter will continue. Taken together, our updated full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance takes a more conservative posture going into the final months of 2021. 
And it's important to note, as we've consistently shared throughout the year, the midpoint of our original guidance range of $21.50 remains the correct baseline for 2022, given our approach to pricing. 
I will now briefly touch on operating results across our segments before sharing early thoughts on 2022 performance. Our Medicare Advantage growth remains on track and consistent with previous expectations. We have refined our full year individual Medicare Advantage membership guidance to up approximately 450,000 members, consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance of up 425,000 to 475,000 members. This outlook represents above-market growth with an increase of 11.4% year-over-year. 
Our Medicaid results continue to exceed initial expectations due to higher-than-anticipated membership increases largely attributable to the extension of the public health emergency. We now expect to add 125,000 to 150,000 Medicaid members in 2021, up from our previous expectation of up 100,000 to 125,000 members. 
Utilization trends continue to be favorable to initial expectations, and the Medicaid team is working diligently toward a successful implementation in Ohio with go-live anticipated in July. 
In our Group and Specialty segment, fully insured medical results were impacted by higher-than-expected COVID costs in the quarter, while our specialty business results continued to exceed expectations as utilization, particularly for dental services remained lower than previously anticipated. Recall that our guidance as of the second quarter did not contemplate significant COVID costs in the back half of the year, and the commercial business is not seeing the same level of utilization offset experienced in Medicare Advantage. 
From a membership perspective, we have increased our expected group medical membership losses from $100,000 to $125,000, reflecting the expectation of additional losses in the fourth quarter as the result of rating actions taken to account for the expected impact of COVID in 2022. 
Finally, within our Healthcare Services operations, the pharmacy and provider businesses continue to perform slightly better than expected, with pharmacy benefiting from increased mail order penetration as a result of customer experience improvements and marketing campaigns. And the provider business seeing continued operating improvements in our more mature centers, which are now aligned under the same leadership as our de novo centers. 
As Bruce mentioned in his remarks, we are actively integrating the Kindred at Home operations, and results post integration have largely been in line with expectations. Similar to home health and hospice peers, the business is being impacted by COVID and labor shortages. For the third quarter, home health admissions grew low single digits year-over-year while hospice experienced a low single-digit decline year-over-year. We will continue to closely monitor trends as we make targeted investments to sustainably improve the recruitment and retention of nurses. 
Now let me take a few moments to share an early outlook for 2022, starting with membership. As you're aware, the overall PDP market continues to decline as more and more beneficiaries, including dual eligibles, choose Medicare Advantage. In addition, as we have discussed previously, PDP plans should become a commodity with a low-price leader capturing disproportionate growth. 
Consistent with 2021, the Walmart Value Plan will offer competitive benefits but will not be the low-premium leader in 2022. As a result, we expect a net decline in PDP membership of a few hundred thousand members in 2022. We continue to focus on creating enterprise value for our PDP plans by driving increased mail order penetration and conversions to Medicare Advantage. 
With respect to group advanced -- group Medicare Advantage, we expect membership to be generally flat for 2022 as we do not anticipate any large accounts will be gained or lost as we continue to maintain pricing discipline in a highly competitive market. 
Moving to individual Medicare Advantage. As previously shared, we took a more conservative approach to our 2022 bids, reflecting the continued uncertainty associated with the pandemic. We expect to grow our individual Medicare Advantage membership in a range of 325,000 to 375,000 members in 2022 or approximately 8% year-over-year, reflective of our prudent approach we took to pricing for 2022 and the competitive nature of the market. 
It is early in our AEP selling season and the outlook we are providing today could change depending on how sales and voluntary disenrollments ultimately come in. And consistent with prior years, we have very little member disenrollment data at this point in the AEP cycle. 
I will now turn to our expected 2022 financial performance. As previously mentioned, I want to reiterate that the $21.50 midpoint of our original 2021 guide continues to be the appropriate jumping-off point for 2022 adjusted EPS growth given our approach to pricing. In addition, we feel comfortable that the risk adjustment assumptions in our 2022 pricing are appropriate, as providers have been actively engaging with our members to ensure their conditions are fully documented and that care plans are established to address gaps in care. 
Provider interactions and documentation of clinical diagnoses that we anticipate will impact 2022 revenue are approximately 92% complete to date, in line with both our expectations for 2021 as well as the estimated completion rate for the same time period in 2019. We also assumed medical costs would return to baseline levels, reflective of pre-COVID historical trending. 
From an earnings perspective, we believe the conservative approach we took to 2022 pricing struck the appropriate balance between membership and earnings growth. Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to enter the year with an appropriately conservative view of our initial 2022 financial outlook. Accordingly, we anticipate that our initial EPS guidance will target the low end of our long-term growth range of 11% to 15%. 
We expect that COVID will be net neutral to the Medicare business in 2022 as we do not anticipate a risk adjustment headwind and expect COVID utilization to be offset by a reduction in non-COVID utilization. However, our initial guide will allow for an explicit COVID-related headwind that we can tolerate, should it emerge, similar to the approach some of our peers took in 2021. We believe entering the year with this more conservative approach is prudent in the current environment and sets the company up for success in 2022. We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in early February.

So to your point, estimating the impact of COVID has proven to be more challenging particularly given the environment that we were in, in 2020 is quite different than what we're experiencing, obviously, in 2021. In 2020, no one was vaccinated, various states have lockdown throughout the year. And as we acknowledged in our Q2 call, anticipating how behavior might emerge in an environment where largely people were back to normal and a large percentage of our Medicare population were vaccinated, we just recognized that it was difficult to anticipate whether we see the same level of offset through the surge. 
The good news is, as we saw the surge emerge in the third quarter, despite it being just as high as what we experienced the last time, we did continue to see a full offset. The hospitalization offsets have been pretty consistent throughout 2020 and 2021. It's on the non-inpatient side where we tend to see more variation. And as we explained in the second quarter, that claims service category is one where we don't have the same level of near-term visibility. 
Having said that, we've studied all of the historical patterns based on what we saw in the third quarter, and our estimates of the continued decline in the COVID curve in the fourth quarter, we feel very comfortable with the assumptions that are underlying our revised guide and feel like we have sufficient visibility to feel confident we can deliver against that. 
Your question about 2022 was a good one. As we've explained in all of our calls, given this late surge in 2021, getting visibility to where baseline trend is actually running, obviously, will be more challenging. However, given how we approach the pricing for 2022, meaning that we started with pre-COVID historical levels and assumed historical trending factors not anticipating any ongoing depressed utilization into 2022, we feel confident that, that's an appropriate baseline expectation. So we'll continue to watch it. And certainly, if we see something different emerge, if any of the depression continues, that would be positive for us, but we are not contemplating it, which is what gives us confidence about our approach to 2022."

We are seeing more awareness in the marketplace as a result of the amount of education that's going on through marketing and through the telesales efforts that are going on.

It creates more competitive nature for that, for those members, but it does create, I think, more growth industry-wide. 
For us as an organization, we were one of the early adopters of the tele market -- the telesales area, and we have benefited from that, I think, in multiple different ways, benefited from it in the way of both our market growth and in addition, our ability to reach a population that we haven't been able to reach in the past.

We're not expecting net favorability that we've seen this year, that 1% we're projecting for the fourth quarter, consistent to what we saw in the third quarter. 
So what we would say is we are expecting that if we have COVID cost, they'll be offset, but that we would still be at baseline. But as I mentioned in my comments, what we intend to do with our initial guide though is despite the belief that, that's a reasonable assumption, we will allow for an explicit net COVID headwind, should it emerge, such that and then we would run actually above baseline levels, should that emerge and our guide will contemplate and allow for some of that if it should emerge. 
And while not giving a specific amount, obviously, today, when we do give specific guidance on our fourth quarter call, we will be explicit about how much of a COVID headwind we can tolerate within the guide. So we will be explicit about that at that time."

So to take your question, so with respect to the high COVID levels and you're right, and honestly, this was something that was a bit surprising to us as well that we did see levels on par with what we experienced in the last surge despite the high vaccination rate. And what we learned is to your point, some of that was a reflection of our geographic mix. Say like Florida and Texas and Louisiana did see higher levels than even the previous surge. It represents a new all-time high, and we have disproportionate share there. So that was part of it. 
But the main driver is that as we looked at the hospitalization rate between vaccinated and unvaccinated, the unvaccinated fairly consistently saw hospitalization rate that was 10 or more times the vaccinated population. And so that, again, as I mentioned in my comments, was the overwhelming driver. And because of the spread of the Delta variant through that unvaccinated population and at much higher hospitalization rate, that is what drove the level on par with what we saw historically. 
To your second question about virtual first in Medicare, we were pleased with the COVID pandemic to see that primary care providers and specialists really did adopt telemedicine at a higher rate to ensure that they could continue to support their patients and their permitted needs. I think as a result of that, frankly, providers gained a better appreciation of the range of care and the quality of care that they can provide through virtual, which frankly, pre pandemic, they really didn't appreciate and weren't adopting. 
So I think we will see some continued use of virtual technology to enhance the operating model and allow for more touch points with their patients than we did pre pandemic. Your question about home health is definitely a good one. It's something we're looking at, particularly with the challenges we have in terms of nursing labor shortages. Virtual is one strategy we're looking at to see how it can be leveraged to, again, create more touch points with the patient and improve the efficiency of the operating model to just create more overall capacity. And so we'll be testing with Kindred appropriate uses of that and where we can implement it and still see the high-quality outcomes that we would expect. So we'll be testing that, and the hope would be that you'll see expansion of that in the future."

We did launch a few years ago, a virtual first with doctors on-demand product, and that was a success for us on the commercial side. But on the Medicare side, what we do find is that there's a great opportunity to see the patient, both to understand the patient in a physical setting. And unlike more episodic of care versus a chronic care management, there's a good -- there is an importance of being able to have a physical and encouraging a physical interaction. 
We see that telehealth as being an opportunity to have a complementary and more interaction. But I don't know if it would be a replacement or we would want to motivate highly chronic members to have a virtual-first interaction for a whole host of reasons, both from a care point of view and from the ability for us to establish the proper care plan."

So to your question, so with respect to the fourth quarter, as we said before, we have really analyzed all of the prior surges to understand the patterns coming out of a surge. And you might recall from our previous commentary, what you typically see is a tail of depressed utilization anytime you come off a curve, which is what allows you to sort of fully recapture the cost of that COVID peak. And so we've -- with this surge in particular, what's kind of interesting is different states, as I mentioned before, are seeing different levels of utilization relative to previous surges. Texas, Florida, were examples where we saw a very high peak and a very rapid decline. 
There are some other states like New York and Michigan, where we're actually seeing a much more moderate and sort of gradual increase without sort of seeing the same sharp peak in decline. So as we've seen that in total that on a national basis, what we're seeing is the slope of the downturn from -- coming off of the peak isn't quite as sharp as what we've seen historically. 
We've drilled into each of those states and are consistently seeing irrespective of that difference in peak level, we are still seeing that 1:1 offset regardless. And so to some degree, we think there's just an overall capacity constraints, particularly on the inpatient side that comes into play. And the rest is just that behavior change in terms of providers and patients as they manage through it. 
So based on what we've seen emerge and particularly in the third quarter with that 1% offset, everything we've seen suggests that assuming the same level of offset as we continue to come off that third quarter peak is reasonable. To your point about early indicators, we do, as we've said before, have really good real-time information on inpatient activity. That continues to hold, where as the COVID utilization comes down, we'll see a bounce back on a 1:1 offset in the non-COVID hospitalization. So that has been very consistent. And we'll continue to watch the non-inpatient, but again, based on everything we've seen, we believe that is a reasonable assumption. 
In terms of your question about value-based providers, interestingly enough, most of our -- both our own centers and some of our high-performing partners, they have indicated that they are not seeing the same sort of neutrality or even benefit from a COVID event that we do. And the theory there is that in general, they manage sort of the unnecessary hospitalization events as lower value out of the system more routinely. 
And so when you do see a surge, there's not as much utilization to manage to be depressed because they have already managed it out on a more run rate basis. And so we're still, frankly, trying to assess and use some analytics on that. I think they may take a little bit more time for their claims to fully develop and have a full view of that. But their belief is that they don't see the same level of net benefit that we do on the health plan side generally."

And if you remember, the way we approached our initial guide was a bit different than many of our peers in the sense that we did not contemplate a net COVID headwind. And so that initial guide at the midpoint was actually above our more typical long-term growth range, recognizing some of the tailwinds that supported our pricing in -- for 2021. 
So by reaffirming that, that is the appropriate baseline really just reinforces that the way we approached our 2022 pricing acknowledge that despite however the results emerge in 2021, that our revenue assumptions would assume that Medicare risk adjustment return to more normalized levels for 2022. And that claims also return to more normalized levels as if COVID did not occur. And so again, for claims, we started with pre-pandemic levels in 2019 and using historical trend factors trended that forward. And so that's why we continue to reinforce given that approach, $21.50 is the appropriate jumping-off point from which we would grow and expect to be in our long-term arrangement in 2022, recognizing, however, from an initial guide perspective, we do intend to take a more conservative approach to ensure we're set up for success and target the lower end of that range."

I think, first, obviously, adding the number of organic units in the earlier years creates a drag as they mature, and we're seeing some great maturation in the cohorts that have been open a year or 2, both on a membership side from a point of view of revenue and in addition, on the cost side. So we feel very confident. And that's one of the reasons why we increased the number of cohorts this year as a result of our confidence and conviction in the business outcome. 
What we see over a longer period of time is as we call it the J-curve, we'll start to become into profitability of the ones that we opened in the earlier years. And that will start to give us growth. So if you were to shut off the development, you actually see a pretty quick growth rate within the existing business. We are accenting that by 2 other opportunities for growth. One is the existing operations of the businesses that have been open for a while, the mature centers. And we're seeing some really great same-store growth in that area, and they have done a great turnaround over the last few years in being able to approve that. 
And although it doesn't show up in the profitability because of the J-curve override it a lot, we are seeing some really great improvement there both operationally and then also from a quality and experience point of view. And then the third area of growth for us as an organization is really in the inorganic area. As many of you know, we do have a relationship with a number of providers, especially in our more mature markets that we have the right of first refusal. And that offers us an advantage in being able to continue to densify markets that we're in and add additional sites and  we did that in 2021, we anticipate doing that in 2022. And those are very synergistic inorganic opportunities from the standpoint that we're able to evolve the management of it into our existing management team. We're able to, in addition, bring some of our operating capabilities to those centers. 
So [ going 3 ], the continuum advancement of our J-curve and what we see there, the more mature centers continuing to improve that. And then the third, the inorganic growth and being able to leverage in some of the markets we have. I think over a period of time, you're going to see a 5 to 7 period of time, I think you're going to see a fairly sizable business come out of this as a result of the investments we're making today and both in the organic and inorganic area, really today is the leading size clinic or clinics oriented to senior business. I think we'll continue to maintain that leadership long term. 
And relative to financing, we don't have -- we haven't come to structure yet. And Justin, I think that will be an active conversation with the investors in probably the second quarter of 2022. We will come back to the investors and discuss how we will finance another cohort or number of clinics for the foreseeable future. We, today, have enough of the capital to invest from our off-balance sheet financing on Welsh, Carson to get us through to the 2022 openings. And so we -- this doesn't cause any slowdown into our openings. But we do and are looking at all the different alternatives for financing and the most cost effective for our shareholders as we think about the future."

That could be additional -- a couple of years ago, it was really focused on our $0 premium LPPO product, as an example. You see us continue to expand our dual-eligible SNP footprint, and you will see county expansion there in 2022 as well as our veteran offering. Both the duals and the veterans, as we said before, are great examples of where we focused on product and consumer segmentation and designing product that uniquely meets the needs of those consumers. 
And when we do that well, you see an opportunity for disproportionate growth. So we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to do that. But again, I think you'll see more product expansion from Humana versus county expansion just because to your point, we've already got pretty broad coverage with some products."

So for your first question on 2022, recall that in 2021, when we came out with our second quarter commentary, we acknowledged that we had a net COVID headwind that had emerged. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we did not contemplate that explicitly in our original guidance for 2021. So as we saw that emerge as we explained in the second quarter, we were able to mitigate a fair amount of that through other business outperformance, some favorable prior period development and other items. 
But in order to achieve our guide, it did require that utilization continue to run below baseline throughout the year. That is not what we're considering in our 2022 pricing. We assume that it was bounce back. And so it's really just a reflection -- the challenges in 2021 are just acknowledging that while we are seeing net utilization below baseline levels, it's running less than we had previously anticipated or needed in order to achieve the guide and overcome that net COVID headwind that we discussed at the second quarter. 
Again, given the way we approach '22 pricing, while our pricing didn't explicitly contemplate COVID costs beyond just sort of vaccination and testing, as we've consistently said, we did take a more overall conservative approach to pricing, recognizing there would be uncertainty that we would need to be able to navigate through and also recognizing that it was a favorable rate environment, we had the MRA headwinds. We wanted to make sure that we could maintain long-term benefit stability for our members and contemplated there may be a less favorable rate environment in 2023. 
So again, those are all the reasons that we approach pricing the way we did and the reason we continue to have confidence, because we did not anticipate any ongoing net benefit in respect to price utilization into 2022. On Kindred, and we've had this question a couple of times. I think we've addressed it both in the second quarter call and again, maybe at Morgan Stanley, is that we -- that was one of the items that helped us address the net COVID headwind in 2021, the contribution from the full integration. We knew at the time of bid that we would be integrating Kindred. So that was something we were able to consider as we aligned around our targets and our good pricing for 2022. 
We've always said the capital deployment is one of the levers we have available, and we'll use to sustainably deliver our long-term growth target of 11% to 15%, so that was something we specifically contemplated in pricing. So it wouldn't represent an incremental tailwind for 2022, but certainly expect the value that we expect to create from that value-based model and the continued growth of Kindred will certainly continue to contribute in the future to our sustainable ability to deliver against our long-term target."

In recent years, as we've expanded our dual-eligible SNP offerings, that increased our ability to drive those conversions because a large percentage of our PDP members are low-income, dual-eligible members. 
And so what we consistently see is that we will be able to generate a disproportionate share of our PDP members who ultimately choose Medicare Advantage. And so we will disproportionately capture share within a Humana plan relative to what you would see our share capture in just overall Medicare Advantage. So really pleased with that. 
Having said that, some of our members do choose other competitor MA plans. And so we continue to focus on identifying if there are opportunities to enhance the product to attract more PDP members who ultimately are likely to migrate to MA, are there things we can do to enhance the marketing, product segmentation, all of those things we've talked about to continue to drive increased share capture for those PDP members who ultimately determine that MA provides a better value proposition for them.

That's what they're built for. That's how the staffing is constructed. That's how the recruiting of the physicians, that's how the business model is built. And so that sort of leads you to the conclusion the majority of them are going to be MA members. 
Now we have some Medicare fee-for-service side members in there. They are really oriented to how, over time, that can evolve to be a longer-term member for us through a Medicare Advantage relationship. They are agnostic platforms, and so there's a good composition of Humana members as well as other payers in the clinic. That's why it's really called CenterWell. It's to reinforce that agnostic nature, and we are very oriented to that being agnostic. And a number of our sites, there's probably more non-Humana members than there are Humana members on there.
So you do see us oriented to a much broader opportunity for Medicare Advantage. In addition, in a few of the sites, we do have direct contracting members as a result of that. And so we are in the opportunity to take Medicare fee-for-service relationships that then -- that are more oriented to value based. 
Your last part of your question just was the relationship. Over time, they will take full risk.  Now there might be an earlier part of the opening that they will take a path to risk orientation where they'll have some upside and downside limits, but they will, over time, convert to a full risk model. And that's really just as the panel size gets bigger and bigger, the ability to manage the risk is much easier because of the diversification of the panel size."

So I'll try to answer this as much as I can, maybe a little bit more generally. But as you said before, right now, in our '22 pricing, our approach to baseline trend was to go back to pre-COVID levels, use historical trend factors and roll that forward. Now we certainly -- our models have a lot of granularity to them. And so certainly, they would take into account any site of service shifts that we may be seeing and then our estimate of what those might be going forward. 
They'd also look at what we've referred to as health care pipeline technologies to anything else that we expect that may be coming to market that would impact trends differently than what we've seen historically. And that's just part of our consistent process. So all of that work was done to support our '22 pricing. 
We have not changed our view of that currently. Although as you can imagine, there is a lot of work being done across the enterprise to study as best we can what has emerged over the course of 2020 and 2021, how we can decipher COVID-impacted utilization, depression versus what might be just lower baseline trend. I think our view and as you've seen us consistently be able to meet and beat earnings historically, would imply that our core sort of trend forecasting models may have a little bit of conservatism in that. We've not assumed that going forward. Trending off '19 is certainly more years of trending than we would typically like. And so that's why we're going to do a lot more analysis between now and issuing our final guidance points for 2022 to see if there's any additional information that would inform our perspective on 2022 baselines. 
But what we're considering now we think is an appropriately conservative view. To your point, is the COVID headwind that we will contemplate in that guide does not emerge -- does emerge, then we would be seeing utilization above baseline levels -- or I'm sorry, hit that backwards, is that what I heard? Yes. That we would be able to tolerate it running above baseline even though we don't expect that to occur.

Some of the work that we're doing with our value-based home health model as well as the use of our broader home set of capabilities or other examples of how we continue to work to see how we can use these capabilities to focus on patients who are disproportionately likely to see potentially avoidable hospitalization events and use those capabilities to redirect to an alternative site of service like the home or an outpatient setting. So we'll continue to do all of those things in support of not only 2022 trend mitigation, but then also longer term to support our value proposition in Medicare Advantage broadly."

But we are not assuming currently that, that same excess favorability we saw emerge in third quarter will continue. 
In terms of '22 growth, we obviously haven't given detailed guidance by product. What I can tell you though is while it's still early in the AEP, Bruce mentioned we saw 40% growth in 2020 and 2021. We do continue to see strong growth in 2022. So while we're not prepared to share any specific number so far, again, while it's early, D-SNP growth is actually coming in better than we had originally expected for '22 so far."
