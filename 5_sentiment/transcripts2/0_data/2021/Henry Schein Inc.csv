Thank you all for participating in today's call. Against the backdrop of the most challenging year in our history due to the COVID pandemic, with unprecedented human toll and economic impact worldwide, we were successfu",629,"Good morning. Thank you, Carolynne. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Against the backdrop of the most challenging year in our history due to the COVID pandemic, with unprecedented human toll and economic impact worldwide, we were successful in supporting practices that were initially open for emergency services and also assisting customers preparing to restore practices to increased operating capacity as restrictions eased. Henry Schein's unwavering focus on our customers, along with our resilience and agility, enabled us to deliver fourth quarter total sales growth of 18.6%, capping off record total sales for the second half of 2020 as our end markets have rebounded.
Our teams are working tirelessly to execute against our plans. We recognize the commitment and sacrifice of Team Schein members globally and wish to sincerely thank the team for the continued commitment the team brings to Henry Schein each day. 
Dental patient traffic has remained at stable levels compared to the third quarter of 2020, even in countries experiencing more stringent lockdown rules, with the exception of the U.K. To date, the overall recovery is continuing. Specifically in the United States, the latest survey data published by the American Dental Association for the U.S. shows that dental practices are at close to 80% of pre-COVID patient volumes. That's patient traffic. These patient volumes represent a slight increase over the past couple of months of ADA survey data, which we believe is reasonably accurate. Henry Schein's U.S. dental e-claims data also show that patients continue to return for a broad set of oral care procedures.
We also believe overall patient volumes in Medical are still at relatively stable levels. In fact, we are pleased to report that for the second quarter in a row our global Medical business has achieved over $1 billion in quarterly sales.
Over time, our Dental and Medical customers, we believe will experience patient traffic that will improve to pre-COVID-19 levels.
We are pleased with our non-PPE and COVID-related sales for the fourth quarter in both Dental and Medical in the United States and abroad, but also expect PPE and COVID-19-related sales to continue to be elevated -- to continue at the elevated levels to support standard of care followed by practitioners. So although we are pleased with our non-PPE sales, and we did experience significant increase in PPE and COVID-related sales, we do expect that PPE and COVID-related sales will continue at these elevated levels beyond this year or beyond at the end of 2020 -- into '21 and beyond. 
So despite this very difficult past year, we remain optimistic about our future, and our financial position is strong. We remain confident that Henry Schein is well positioned for future continued success given the breadth of our products, services and supplier and Team Schein support across the global dental and medical markets.
Today, we will review the specifics of our financial results, discuss key achievements in 2020, provide our perspective on the state of our end markets and speak to our strategic focus while providing guidance for 2021, of course, bearing in mind that we are still in the midst of a pandemic.
However, before Steven offers his remarks, I would like to clarify a point related to the impact of noncash nonrecurring intangible asset impairment charge of $18 million -- just over $18 million that we announced today. This impairment charge was recorded within our operating expenses, impacting our operating margins by 57 basis points. It should, of course, be noted that this impairment charge reduced both GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS by $0.07.
With that, I'll ask Steven to discuss our quarterly and full year financial performance, and then I'll provide some additional comments on the current business conditions, our markets and where we're heading. Steven, please."
339447,703140156,2213653,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2021",2021-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q4 2020 and Q4 2019 non-GAAP results",2231,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q4 2020 and Q4 2019 non-GAAP results exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release and in the supplemental information section of our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have again included a corporate sales category for Q4 that represents sales to Covetrus under the transitional services agreements that has now expired just shy of 2 years since the completion of the spin-off of our Animal Health business to form Covetrus. We expect stranded costs related to the Animal Health spin-off to be in the $10 million to $12 million range for 2021.
Turning now to our financial results. Total net sales for the quarter ended December 26, 2020, were $3.2 billion, reflecting growth of 18.6% compared with the prior year, with internally generated sales up 17.1% in local currencies, which was driven by sales of PPE, or personal protective equipment, as well as COVID-related products. Details of sales performance are contained in Exhibit E of our earnings press release issued earlier today.
On a GAAP basis, our operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 5.7%, representing a decrease of 164 basis points compared with the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin of 5.9% contracted by 146 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Again, a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin can be found in the supplemental information page on the Investor Relations page of our website.
Our operating margin was unfavorably impacted by significant inventory adjustments associated with PPE and COVID-related products as well as lower supplier rebates, and that was partially offset by lower expenses as a percentage of sales. It's important to note we do not expect any material inventory adjustments to continue into 2021.
Our operating margin, as Stanley said, was also negatively impacted by 57 basis points due to a noncash nonrecurring intangible asset impairment charge recorded by Henry Schein One of approximately $18.1 million, which reduced both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by $0.07 per diluted share.
Turning to taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 17.3%. This compares with 22.3% GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019. And on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 17.5%, which compares to a prior year non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22.2%. You can see a reconciliation of GAAP effective tax rate to non-GAAP effective tax rate again on our supplemental information page on our website. This lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 was favorably impacted by income tax resolutions in both the U.S. as well as internationally, which lowered income tax expense by approximately $14.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Excluding this impact, the effective tax rate would have been in the 26% range for both GAAP and non-GAAP.
Moving on. Our GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $141.9 million or $0.99 per diluted share. This compares with the prior year GAAP net income from continuing operations of $330 million or $2.25 per diluted share, but remember that included a net gain on the sale of equity investments of $1.27.
Our non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $143.6 million or $1 per diluted share, and this compares to the non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $143 million or $0.97 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of last year. Again, both our GAAP and non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was favorably impacted by the tax resolutions I just mentioned and unfavorably impacted by the onetime impairment charge.
Our amortization of acquired intangibles for Q4 2020 was $25.3 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share. This excludes the nonrecurring $18.1 million impairment charge that we recorded in the current quarter and compares to $26.9 million pretax or $0.12 per diluted share for the same period last year. Similarly, for the full year 2020, amortization from acquired intangibles was $102.1 million pretax or $0.40 per diluted share. This excludes the combined $20.3 million in noncash asset impairment charges that we recorded in Q1 as well as in the current quarter and compares to $105.9 million pretax or $0.46 per diluted share in 2019. 
I'll also note that foreign currency had a very minor impact on our EPS. It positively impacted Q4 diluted EPS by less than $0.01 per share.
Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the fourth quarter. Global dental sales of $1.8 billion grew 7.2% compared with the same period last year, with internal sales growth of 5.1% in local currencies. Global dental consumable merchandise internal sales increased by 10% in local currencies in the fourth quarter. And excluding PPE and COVID-related products, sales increase was 5.0%. I'll note that this 5.0% quarterly growth rate is among the highest that we've recorded at Henry Schein since 2017.
North American internal sales in local currencies declined 0.7%, which included growth of 5.3% in dental consumable merchandise, 0.4% excluding PPE and COVID-related products and a 13.2% decline in sales of dental equipment.
Our international dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 14.2%, which included 16.7% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise sales or 11.4% when excluding PPE and COVID-related products and 6.8% growth in sales of international dental equipment.
Looking at dental consumable merchandise sales, we experienced very solid growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, China, Brazil and throughout most of Europe. We saw particular strength in France and Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Italy and Poland. However, the U.K. countries continue to experience lower sales as that country has moved into a stricter lockdown.
Our North American dental equipment sales performance was impacted by a difficult prior year comparison, including the Dentsply Sirona world event moving to a virtual platform and production transitions as a key supplier exited traditional equipment categories. In addition, we believe some practices potentially held off on year-end equipment purchases as U.S. tax incentives may be more favorable in 2021.
International dental equipment sales growth in Q4 was driven by strength in Germany, Austria, France as well as Australia and New Zealand. We experienced high single-digit internal sales growth in local currencies and traditional equipment and low single-digit growth in high-tech equipment internationally. We continue to be encouraged by the extent of customer engagement and interest in equipment and technology investments. Currently, both our North America and international equipment backlogs are exhibiting growth year-over-year. Please keep in mind that backlog represents sales orders at the end of the quarter that have not been shipped, but we also take a substantial amount of orders within the quarter that will drive our sales results for the current quarter.
Given our current perspective, we are optimistic about our North American as well as international dental equipment sales growth for the first quarter of 2021.
Our global dental specialty revenue in the fourth quarter totaled approximately $200 million, with internal growth of 2.2% in local currencies versus the prior year. The split was 1.7% growth in North America and 3.1% internationally. Our global dental implant growth in the fourth quarter was 4.3%. Our orthodontic sales decreased by 5%, primarily due to business interruption as we moved to a new distribution center in Q4 as well as a supplier exiting the market, which resulted in a shift of orders to alternate suppliers. We expect to see a sequential improvement in orthodontic sales in the first quarter of 2021.
Turning now to global medical sales. They were of $1.2 billion and growth of 48.5% compared to the same period last year, 48.2% of that was in local currencies and included 47.9% increase in North America and international sales growth of 63.1%. Our medical sales results were driven by continued strong demand for PPE and COVID-19-related products. If you were to exclude the sales of these products to global medical, internal growth in local currencies was approximately 3.6%. I'll also note that we sold approximately $270 million in COVID tests in Q4, including some multi-assay flu and COVID-19 combination test. This was up from approximately $100 million in the third quarter. We believe solid COVID test sales growth is likely to continue while COVID cases remain at relatively high levels. We also experienced double-digit growth in sales of med-surg products in Q4.
Turning to Technology and Value-Added Services sales. They were $138.7 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% compared with the prior year, including a decline in internally generated sales in local currencies of approximately 0.7%. In North America, tech and value-added services internal sales growth was 0.6% in local currencies. And I'll note that the sales growth was impacted by transactional revenue associated with the lower number of patient visits compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. We also faced a difficult prior year comparison that benefited hardware upgrades in the prior year as we help transition customers to address new operating system requirements.
We are very pleased with our solid sales growth from our Dentrix Ascend cloud-based software solutions as well as financial services. Internationally, Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales declined by 8.4% in local currencies when compared to the prior year. The prolonged lockdown in the U.K. significantly impacted this international business.
As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call last May, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program as a means to preserve cash in response of the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations and due to certain restrictions related to financial covenants. Prior to the suspension of this program in 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares at $61.49 average price, which represents a total of $73.8 million in cash. At the year-end, we had approximately $201 million authorized and available for future stock purchases. But remember, when we amended our credit facilities earlier this year, we also agreed to restrict stock repurchases until we report our second quarter 2020 financial results.
Currently, we have significant access to liquidity, providing flexibility and financial stability in this challenging environment. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $345 million compared to $295 million for the fourth quarter of last year. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher net income in 2020 after adjusting for the pretax gain on the sale of equity investments in the prior year. As part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we recorded a pretax charge in Q4 2020 of $4.4 million or $0.02 per diluted share. This charge primarily relates to severance pay and facility closing costs and reflects opportunities to reduce expenses, drive operating efficiencies and mitigated stranded costs. We anticipate additional restructuring costs in 2021.
I'll now provide a quick review of the full year of 2020 and then move on to 2021 guidance. During 2020, we achieved total net sales of $10.1 billion, up 1.3% from 29 -- from 2019, sorry, with internally generated sales up 0.8% in local currencies, and this is all despite the significant impact we saw earlier in the year regarding the COVID pandemic. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 40.1%, largely impacted by COVID-19 and the net gain on sale of equity investments in the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS declined 15% due to the impact of COVID-19. And again, we're pleased with solid operating cash flow for the year of almost $600 million with cash funds, which funds our balanced approach to capital allocation.
Let me conclude my remarks on financial guidance. At this time, we're not providing a '21 GAAP guidance since we are unable to provide an accurate estimate of expenses related to the ongoing restructuring initiative. However, given the wide range of analyst EPS estimates for the year, we see a benefit in providing a high-level guidance. As such, we expect that our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein will be at or above 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations, which was $3.51. We believe this comparison to 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is appropriate, given the COVID-19 impact on 2020 results.
I think it's very important to note that our guidance is not a range, and it's not a specific EPS number. In fact, what we're trying to show and what we're intending is for this guidance of $3.51 -- at or above $3.51 to be a floor off of our guidance and not a specific guidance number. So hopefully, it's taken as such.
And keep in mind that guidance for 2021 non-GAAP EPS attributable to Henry Schein is for current operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but it does not include the potential for future acquisitions, if any, as well as restructuring expenses or share repurchases. Our guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates that are generally consistent with current levels and also assumes that the end markets remain stable and consistent with current market conditions. Of course, guidance does not assume any material market changes associated with COVID-19.
So with that summary, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley."

We undertake a rolling formal planning initiative every 3 years, and we are currently in the midst of developing our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan, which",2415,"Thank you very much, Steven. I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our strategic planning process. We undertake a rolling formal planning initiative every 3 years, and we are currently in the midst of developing our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan, which we believe will help us focus on optimizing the long-term return on our investments and enable us to continue delivering value to our shareholders. We had deferred, of course, and I think the investors know this, our strategic planning process for 1 year as we focused on addressing the impact of COVID-19. Today, we'd like to offer a preview of our thinking around some key components of our strategic plan.
First, a key element in our effort to grow closer to our customers is our One Shine initiative, which is a unified go-to-market approach that enables practitioners to work synergistically with Henry Schein's supply chain, equipment sales and service and other value-added services, allowing our customers to leverage the combined value that we offer through a single program. Specifically, One Schein provides customers with streamlined access to our comprehensive offering of, of course, national brand products, Henry Schein private label and proprietary specialty products and solutions, including surgical and orthodontic products. In addition, customers have access to services, pretty wide range, probably the largest, we believe, in the marketplaces that we serve, including software and other value-added services. Ultimately, One Schein enables customers to benefit from the ability to enrich patient treatment options and outcomes and simplify business operations in addition to the opportunity to drive practice profitability.
So looking more closely at our Technology and Value-Added Services and dental specialty businesses, let me start with a discussion on our Technology and Value-Added Services business, which comprises approximately $500 million of revenue, about 5% of Henry Schein's total sales in 2020. I would like to note that COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on this Technology and Value-Added Services business, at least from a sales point of view. Within this segment, Henry Schein One, our dental software offering, represents the lion's share of sales and is also one of the Henry Schein's highest-margin businesses, one of our large -- highest-margin businesses is reflected in the Henry Schein One business. Our comprehensive suite of integrated dental software solutions reaches far beyond practice management software, which is key to simplifying clinical and office space processes in the physical office or in the cloud. So we go beyond the practice management software, which, of course, is quite effective and the leading systems in the world. We are also advancing patient demand generation with our expertise in website, search engine optimization, patient reviews and dental directories and dental savings plans.
Our patient engagement solutions help practices communicate with patients engaged in market campaigns and facilitate online booking. And our revenue cycle management products facilitate insurance processing and patient payments. We believe that no other company offers a combined portfolio of products as broad and as extensive as Henry Schein One solutions and that our expertise is fundamental to the capabilities that practitioners value as a resource to help drive practice success. 
We are delighted that Mike Baird has joined us as CEO of Henry Schein One, taking over the role that Jon Koch, CEO of our Global Dental Group, held on an interim basis. In his new role, Mike will work with leaders across Henry Schein One, including our software businesses in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region, to continue promotion of our industry-leading practice management, patient engagement and patient demand-creation solutions. His team will also continue to collaborate closely with Henry Schein Dental and our specialty businesses to help drive the One Schein offering to dental professionals around the world. Prior to joining Henry Schein One, Mike held several leadership positions in the health care information technology space and most recently served as President of Health Systems at American Well.
During the fourth quarter, we launched a number of product enhancements for Henry Schein One Solutions, including directory online booking, which is self-scheduling solution for the WebMD directory, allowing prospective patients to book appointments online through the WebMD directory.
Patient Engagement Live, which provides dental practice teams with access to real-time patient notifications, the Patient Engage mobile app, which enables practice functions on the go, Dentrix Ascend, Pay and Dentrix Enterprise Pay, which integrate point-of-service card processing solutions for faster check-in/check-out processing after the procedure is completed. And Dentrix Ascend ERX, which is an integrated electronic prescribing solution that enables seamless electronically prescribing functionality with the Ascend practice management system.
Our value-added services also includes Henry Schein financial services, which facilitates financing options, including equipment, technology, financing and leasing, working capital loans as well as patient finance and credit card options.
Our business solutions offering, which is the third component in this group, offers a complete array of value-added services and include technology as well as resources for improving key business functions that contribute to the successful business operations and clinical effectiveness of dental and medical practices. So that's our Technology and Value-Added Services offering, which is described separately or reported separately in our financial statements.
Let me now discuss our dental specialty business, which consists of dental implants and biomaterials for tooth replacement therapy, certain surgical pharmaceutical products, endodontics and rotary products as well as orthodontic products. Comprising approximately 12% of our global dental sales, this business generated sales of approximately $700 million in 2020. Of course, we are quite pleased with these results given the COVID-19 challenges we experienced, which had a significant negative impact on 2020 sales and particularly in the second quarter, although we did recover significantly and effected very well in the third and fourth quarter for the -- in other words, the second half of the year. Given the proprietary designs and unique value proposition of these specialized products, our dental specialties businesses command a higher margin than most core dental products that we distribute. Through our expertise across the entire value chain from research and development, production and distribution to marketing, education and value-added services offered to practitioners undertaking specialty products -- procedures, our customers benefit from our high pace of innovation and our comprehensive portfolio of specialty products and related value-added services.
As a percentage of global dental specialty sales, implant tooth replacement, bone regeneration and oral surgery products represent the largest portion of dental specialty sales, with contributions from our by BioHorizons, CAMLOG, Medentis Medical, ACE Surgical and Southern Anesthesia businesses. Over the past several quarters, we believe we have been among the leading companies in premium implant segment sales performance, including strong sales in biomaterials. We expect this trend to continue based on our continued innovative -- innovation and investment in portfolio expansion and value-added services.
In addition, Medentis Medical, our value implant line, posted solid fourth quarter sales in the DACH region, which represents Medentis' largest region. The next largest piece in our specialties businesses -- business, is our endodontic products, which includes Brasseler Dental, our Henry Schein branded endodontic ranges and other products as well as national brand products. We continue to invest in enhancing our selling capabilities and R&D around our endodontic platform, and we believe we have gained market share in key markets.
Last on the specialty side, our orthodontic business is comprised of sales from Ortho2, Ortho technology and our Reveal Clear Aligner businesses. Although our orthodontic sales and, specifically, our clear aligner sales represent the smallest dental specialty business -- part of our specialty business, sales continued to grow, and we expect that trend to continue as we invest in enhancing the user experience through sales, marketing and manufacturing innovation, including with our software solutions.
On this group, in Specialty Group, in general, we continue to make progress in penetrating private practices, the mid-market and DSO customers that value the precision quality and expertise that we deliver through our dental specialty solutions, in part due to our One Schein initiative.
So now let me just address PPE and COVID testing for a minute and COVID-related -- COVID-19 tests and other related products. In both the dental and medical markets, we expect we will continue to see sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products at elevated levels compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. We continue to firm up global sources of supply and have begun to utilize alternate domestic manufacturers to meet our customer supply needs. We are very pleased and proud, in fact, of the way we handled the whole PPE and testing availability of products during 2020 when we went -- had our extensive activities in seeking product, flu product in from around the world, ensure that our customers had adequate PPE products and test products as well, costing us a lot of money to do this, but well worth it from a customer service and satisfaction point of view. At this time, we believe that most dental and medical practices are able to access adequate supply of PPE, including face shields, mass, gowns and thermometers. The exceptions continue to be where the market is experiencing supplier constraints for particular products such as nitrile gloves, medical wipes and, more recently, syringes and needle inventory to support vaccine rollout. We believe we have adequate availability for our current customer base and should be able to satisfy our customers' needs as we have during most of 2020. 
Now let me turn to M&A for a moment. On the acquisition side, although we suspended M&A activities from March through the summer, we closed 9 acquisitions with [indiscernible] sales of almost $300 million and deployed nearly $200 million in capital. These transactions are expected to be slightly dilutive in their first year and quite accretive thereafter.
In the new year, we announced the acquisition of Prism Medical Products. This transaction expands our U.S. medical business beyond our core base of office space physicians and into the home health market. Specifically, home medical suppliers is a natural extension of our focus on the continuum of care delivery model. With revenues of $52 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, Prism serves a broad network of nationally affiliated and independently operated wound care clinics as well as specialist practices. We believe this acquisition will allow us to move closer to the patient. It also strengthens our relationship with physicians who prescribe home medical supplies.
I would like to take a moment to address our investments in technology and business intelligence to enhance current e-commerce, digital marketing and customer engagement tools, then in turn, help our teams succeed in the market, providing, of course, greater customer satisfaction. Marketing automation, customer insights and analytics, personalization technologies and customer experience management tools are just a few of the many areas in which we have made considerable advancement in recent years. Consistent with our broad digital strategy, these investments leverage best-of-breed technologies to ensure we provide a rich customer experience adaptable as customers' need evolve. As part of supporting our customers through every step of their buying journey, we are focused on using our global e-commerce platform for dental and medical, which we internally refer to as GEP, G-E-P. Successful implementation of current and future GEP investments will enable Henry Schein to remain a destination of choice over the long term for health care providers and suppliers. Keep in mind that we are early in the process of planning, implementing long-term phases -- the long-term phases of GEP market by market. The long-term phase of GEP will be rolled out beginning of 2022 and continue through 2024. We have a great team in place. And consistent with our history of rolling out advancements in the IT space on a consistent and reliable basis, we are extremely enthusiastic about the GEP investments. Again, we look forward to keeping you appraised of our evolving strategic plans as we enhance the breadth of our solutions and services offerings and look to deliver continued long-term value to our stakeholders, which takes me to a short discussion on ESG.
I'd like to comment on the significant work that Henry Schein has undertaken over the years in this area and particularly this past year to enhance our long-standing commitment to environmental, social and governance, or as known ESG, initiatives. In 2019, we embarked on a journey to evolve our ESG disclosure with a goal of reporting on appropriate Global Reporting Initiatives, also known as GRI, standards. We've had a broad cross-functional team working with our business of corporate teams on goals and targets for carbon dioxide, energy, waste supply chain, diversity and inclusion safety, employee training, volunteering and community impact. Our diversity inclusion work has always been a part of our core values, and we have helped drive this conversation for more than 2 decades.
Building on our women's leadership network, employee resource group, we have added 3 additional employee resource groups this year -- last year, including our Black Legacy Professionals, Pride and Allies and Latin ERGs. We were pleased to earn 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Annual Assessment of LGBTQ Workplace Equality and be named to Fortune's World Most Admired Companies list for the 20th consecutive year, ranking actually first in our category for the last couple of years. With the support of Henry Schein's senior management and oversight by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, our ESG program reflects our long history as a purpose-driven, higher-ambition company that integrates our sense of purpose in the way we operate our business.
Last, let me just report on our Board of Directors. We recently announced changes as Paul Brons and Shira Goodman will not stand for reelection at our 2021 stockholder meeting. We thank, of course, Paul and Shira for their many years of service and valued contributions to the Henry Schein Board. At the same time, we welcome our newest board members, Mohamad Ali and Deborah Derby. Mohamad has extensive experience with successful technology transformation. And Deb brings broad operational, strategic and senior leadership experience with public companies. The addition of these directors complements the skill and experience of our current Board, and we are confident that the collective set of leaders will provide valuable perspectives as we continue to execute our strategy.
So I realize that was a lot, but there's a lot going on at Henry Schein. So now we're happy to open the floor to any Q&A or any questions that investors may have, and we will answer them. Thank you."

First, just, Steve, on 2021 guidance, I understand that you're not and you really never do, I guess, provide revenue guidance. I'd still be interested in hearing maybe how you're thinking about your core ex PPE and COVID product revenues in dental and medical. Do they get back to 2019 levels this year? Or how to think about that?
And given the additional PPE and COVID revenues in '21 versus '19, it seems like your '21 EPS guidance, if I were to get down to that $3.51 level, your margins have to be down something like 60, 70 basis points versus '19. Is that a fair ballpark to think to get down to that $3.51 level?"

So again, I just want to make sure people understand that the guidance that we gave is the floor. We've debated, quite honestly, whether to give guidance or not this quarter. But leading up to the quarter with investor",374,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. So again, I just want to make sure people understand that the guidance that we gave is the floor. We've debated, quite honestly, whether to give guidance or not this quarter. But leading up to the quarter with investor meetings, we were getting lots of questions on guidance, and we felt giving a floor was beneficial rather than giving nothing and having that total uncertainty out there. So please take it as the floor.
The other point I want to make before I directly answer your questions, Jeff, is that people seem to look at, as you are, the non-PPE core sales growth. And I think it's important to note that, if you look at North American dental consumables as an example, that growth was -- I think it was 0.4%, excluding PPE products, but that's given patient traffic is down 80% -- down 20% to 80%. And so that's, I think, a good number considering that.
And the other thing that's important to note is that we believe that PPE and COVID-related products will continue to be strong going forward. It will represent really the new standard of care for practitioners. So I wouldn't look at those revenues as nonrecurring. I would look at them as recurring. 
But given that, the growth in our sales, excluding PPE, to specifically answer your question, really is directly related to the continued improvement in the underlying market, having that patient traffic grow from 80% to a higher number. Given that we're not making predictions on that, it's hard really to specifically answer, but that's the correlation that we're looking for.
Also, I would say that while we're not giving specific margin items, we did note at least a couple of things in the call that negatively impact margin. One is stranded costs that we did say will be $10 million to $12 million for the current year for 2021. And we -- Stanley did describe our investments in G-E-P, or GEP, that's also included in that guidance. So I think as the year goes on, Jeff, we'll try to give even greater guidance, but we really felt that doing at least a floor for guidance was better than doing nothing."

There might be a change going on in the implant side of that relationship a bit.

I mean, just thinking about volumes being down 20% and your consumable numbers sort of being up, how do you sort of reconcile those two?
And then I'll ask my follow-up upfront. As we think about the $3.51 floor, does that just kind of assume no change in visit behavior? So if we continue to monitor these ADA surveys as kind of like a baseline, we're assuming no meaningful improvement from those levels in that $3.51? I guess that also assumes that the elevated sort of medical sales continue, as you just suggested, Steve, to kind of -- is also embedded in that $3.51? Sorry.

And the bottom line is the analyst estimates are all over the place. So what we decided to do was to provide a floor. That's by no means guidance in the traditional sense. We're not providing ranges, as Steven noted. It's a floor, number one. Number two is we do expect the visits to physicians and to dentists to continue to grow. We do expect, therefore, that our consumable business will grow. We'll go back to '19 levels and grow a little bit above that, too. The same with our specialties and, of course, our software and other value-added services. We do expect Henry Schein programs, in general, One Schein, the way in which our sales organization relates to our customers, all of that, to continue to perform well. 
Having said that, we are in the midst of a pandemic. And so it's hard to provide solid guidance in the sense that we offered in 2019 before -- and before. So we decided to give a floor, which we're pretty comfortable with. Actually, we're quite optimistic about the business. And if we just had a look at 2000 -- in the first quarter, and we had to stop things now, I would say we're very optimistic. 
Having said that, we can't tell where this pandemic is going to hit. No one can tell. And just like a year ago, we cautioned investors about the pandemic. We're doing the same now, although we're a little bit more confident today than we were in February and March of 2020. What we're saying is we're comfortable with the bottom, with the floor of the guidance we've given. We just can't give ranges. And yes, we believe our consumable business, our equipment business, our software business, our specialty businesses, are all poised to do well. And if the music stopped today, we think we'd have a very good 2021. But again, we can't tell where this is heading. I must say, though, that as one goes to the East and then comes West, things are getting better. Our Asia businesses are pretty much back to normal, doing quite well, Asia Pacific. Europe is okay, except for the U.K., where, hopefully, the reimbursement of dentists will encourage reimbursement for dentists to see more patients again. And in the U.S., it's pretty stable, both in dental and medical. And we're hopeful that the 80% will start going back to normal to the pre -- the 2019 levels as the year goes by. But exactly in which quarter, it's very hard to tell. All I can say is we are and we continue to be very optimistic about our business and are very pleased with the performance so far this year."

You asked, well, patient traffic is 80% and you're up 0.4% ex PPE, what's the reconciliation. And remember, it's patient traffic that the ADA measures. It's not procedures. And we do believe that part of the reason why is that there's a higher acuity of procedures being done today than typically. So there's more tooth restorations. There's more implants. There's more, again, of the higher procedures that generally cause a higher level of consumable products. Things like -- and general examinations as a percentage of the total procedures is not as high. So the type of procedure being done is helping us with that.
And just to quickly add on one of your questions, we're really not assuming much market improvement in that floor guidance. Because, again, we would not know when to assume it, and there's still a lot of uncertainty on when it improves. So there is potential upside if the market improves quicker because we really don't have that in our guidance at this point."

These are not our normal customers. I'm not talking about a lot of money in terms of sales, but we had to replenish this product at higher prices, including significant freight costs. We made a decision as a company to provide PPE products to our customers at a lower price as we could possibly do that. And so at the end of the day, we provided, I believe, great customer satisfaction while following through on the government's call, and I'm referring to the United States, for a request to empty our warehouses on PPE and send it to those areas, those hotspots that were the most challenged. This did have an impact on our 2020 margins for PPE and in general. But as Steven said, I think that is largely behind us, but I do believe that the history books will tell we made the right decisions from a morality point of view, and we are a higher-ambitions company, and we've made the right decision from our customers' point of view, number one.
Number two, on equipment. We had almost a perfect storm at the end of a 2020 in North America. This particular situation did not occur outside of North America, where we did experience good consumable, by the way, and, of course, equipment growth. In the United States, and I'm not referring to Canada now, but specifically relating to the United States, we do report our North America numbers, but in the United States, for equipment, Dentsply Sirona World went virtual, which has been historically a terrific opportunity for us to generate business. We believe that we will generate that business largely in the first quarter and, to some extent, in the third quarter. We had a key supplier of traditional equipment exit the market, and that product that was ordered by that -- from that supplier through us, of course, could not be satisfied fully by the existing manufacturers who have brought their production up to speed. And we expect, again, for that to be satisfied in the second and third quarter.
And then there's the whole issue of whether dentists should have purchased equipment in the fourth quarter or not, given that the incomes were largely down, being that 80% of dentists in the United States were out of practice in the -- out of their practices in the second quarter, the earnings were not great. And with the expectation that tax rates will go up in 2021, there was quite a bit of deferment of purchases of equipment from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Taking that all into account, I think we are quite optimistic about our North American equipment business, U.S. business. Canada was a little bit different. It was good in general because these variations, these perfect storm variations, they're not applied in Canada.
As to the areas of sales that we expect, I think the traditional business chairs units lights, as reported in prior quarters, is still an area where dentists are investing. I would say that the imaging area is an area, although pricing, as we've said in the past, has come down somewhat. And yes, the whole area of DI and chair side full milling of crowns and bridges will all be areas where we expect decent growth in '21 and beyond.
So Carolynne, do we have any -- do we have more time for questions? I think we're running out of time. But we can go over a little bit since there's a lot going on."

So we will expand our footprint. We will drive efficiency in that business and expect to increase our margins in general on the distribution side both in Dental, as I noted now, internal, but also, we are expanding our medical business abroad. We did not focus on our international medical business until about a year ago, 18 months ago, because we had so much going on in the U.S., but we have taken our small medical business in Europe, added resources to it, and we'll be adding more resources to it in the future and expect, of course, the medical distribution business to go beyond the U.S. and Europe, expanding in Canada, where it's very small today, and in other markets.
At the same time, specialty products will be important for us in dental. We expect to continue to grow. We've done very well in implants. We've done very well in endodontics. And we have a very good foundation in orthodontics. We had a peculiar fourth quarter again, a perfect storm. We had a manufacturer exiting that market, and so we had to replace that -- those products from elsewhere. And we had a move in our distribution center around the end of the year. That will all catch up. And so those are the areas we want to invest in, expanding our specialty platforms around the world. Of course, Henry Schein One is a huge opportunity for Henry Schein. We're investing in that area. We're very, very pleased to see the pickup in SaaS products, in cloud-based products. Of course, it does impact sales. But in the long run, it's a very profitable business, and we've done very well with our SaaS product. We're investing in that, too.
And then when it comes to medical devices, we expect to expand in that area in specialty devices. We already are a player in orthodontic saws -- sorry, orthopedic saws and expect to increase that platform as well. So I think it's about global expansion in our core business, in our specialty businesses, adding to those platforms that we have and also in the technology areas. So we have our dental distribution, our medical distribution, our practice management technology and other value-added services platforms and, of course, our specialty products. All of these are areas where there's great opportunity. And strategic planning, John, as you know, is not necessarily about what you can do, but what you want to prioritize on. So we have a lot of options, very excited. We have the best management team, I would say, in the company's history from a capabilities point of view of expanding these various platforms we've developed and are very excited about the future."

I think one has to look at a trend for several quarters.

So I think it's fair to say we expect to grow our global consumables and equipment business and, in particular, are very enthused about our international business.
On the testing. So we had a shortage of, believe it or not, even with these good numbers, of test in the point-of-care quick test arena. We believe the testing is now -- there's more testing available to us. The DPAs, I wouldn't say, are being completely satisfied, but there's more product available for us than in the past. And I'm referring to COVID testing, but also other tests, flu tests, et cetera. So I think it's fair to say that the price of these tests will come down because the larger machines that were used in the earlier stage will be replaced those tests. A large number of those tests will be replaced by snap test with a lower cost per test. Having said that, the demand for test is likely to grow, in our view. And in particular, they'll be more available for our channel, which is the office space practitioner environment and the workplace health environment. So in general, we think with the opening up availability, the price coming down, but at the same time, the demand growing, we expect to have a good 2021 in test. Of course, there's no way we can talk about any specific numbers because we don't know exactly, but we've built in our plans a fair amount of PPE sales and of testing sales. So these are 2 growth areas for us. It will grow as compared to 2019. Thank you for that question. And thank you for all the questions."

Of course, no one can predict exactly wher",461,"Yes. Thank you, operator. Thank you all. I'm sorry we went over today, but there was a lot in this call that we wanted to cover a lot of unusual situations. Bottom line is we're quite optimistic about the future. Of course, no one can predict exactly where the virus is heading, although I think it's fair to say we will not go into a situation again where dental practices will be closed down and physician practices and ambulatory surgical centers will be closed down. If it gets worse, the virus, I think there'll be more precautions, but I can't see a total lockdown as occurred in the second quarter. Of course, as our investors know, we powered down significantly in the second quarter and powered up very quickly in the third quarter. This did cost us a lot. It certainly probably cost us a little bit of market share, but I think we've gained that back and some more. So overall, I would say we did the right things in 2021 from a cash preservation point of view, taking care of our team as the #1 priority. And of course, in parallel with that, ensuring that our customers' service needs were taken care of, while at the same time, in particular, ensuring that PPE was made available to our customers at reasonable prices. Of course, the prices went up significantly, but we kept prices, to a large extent, within the range of what it cost us, rather than passing on unusual profits that we could have gained. And I think this will pay off in the long run with trust from our customers. And in the end, I think, well, Henry Schein has come out of this COVID period as a much stronger company in terms of brand recognition and appreciation of what full service does in the dental and medical market for our customers.
So with that in mind, I have to say, we're pretty optimistic about the future, although we are in this pandemic environment. Our plans will be finalized. There's a wide array of opportunities. We are operating right now under interim refresh plan for on 2021. But by the end of this year, we will firm up the key areas of focus. And I think we will, in turn, do well for our investors. We feel very comfortable.
I will end with this comment. This year is our 25th year as a public company. We've had EPS compounded annual growth at a rate of 12% and stock appreciation at a rate of 12% during this period. We are a company that provides stability, and we believe that we're in good markets with a great team. Thank you very much, everyone, for participating in this call today."

Thank you, Carolynne. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Against the backdrop of the most challenging year in our history due to the COVID pandemic, with unprecedented human toll and economic impact worldwide, we were successful in supporting practices that were initially open for emergency services and also assisting customers preparing to restore practices to increased operating capacity as restrictions eased. Henry Schein's unwavering focus on our customers, along with our resilience and agility, enabled us to deliver fourth quarter total sales growth of 18.6%, capping off record total sales for the second half of 2020 as our end markets have rebounded. 
Our teams are working tirelessly to execute against our plans. We recognize the commitment and sacrifice of Team Schein members globally and wish to sincerely thank the team for the continued commitment the team brings to Henry Schein each day.  
Dental patient traffic has remained at stable levels compared to the third quarter of 2020, even in countries experiencing more stringent lockdown rules, with the exception of the U.K. To date, the overall recovery is continuing. Specifically in the United States, the latest survey data published by the American Dental Association for the U.S. shows that dental practices are at close to 80% of pre-COVID patient volumes. That's patient traffic. These patient volumes represent a slight increase over the past couple of months of ADA survey data, which we believe is reasonably accurate. Henry Schein's U.S. dental eClaims data also show that patients continue to return for a broad set of oral care procedures. 
We also believe overall patient volumes in Medical are still at relatively stable levels. In fact, we are pleased to report that for the second quarter in a row, our Global Medical business has achieved over $1 billion in quarterly sales.  Over time, our Dental and Medical customers, we believe, will experience patient traffic that will improve to pre-COVID-19 levels. 
We are pleased with our non-PPE and COVID-related sales for the fourth quarter in both Dental and Medical in the United States and abroad, but also expect PPE and COVID-19-related sales to continue to be elevated -- to continue at the elevated levels to support standard of care followed by practitioners. So although we are pleased with our non-PPE sales, and we did experience significant increase in PPE and COVID-related sales, we do expect that PPE and COVID-related sales will continue at these elevated levels beyond this year or beyond at the end of 2020 -- into '21 and beyond.  
So despite this very difficult past year, we remain optimistic about our future and our financial position is strong. We remain confident that Henry Schein is well positioned for future continued success given the breadth of our products, services and supplier and Team Schein support across the global Dental and Medical markets. 
Today, we will review the specifics of our financial results, discuss key achievements in 2020, provide our perspective on the state of our end markets and speak to our strategic focus while providing guidance for 2021, of course, bearing in mind that we are still in the midst of a pandemic. 
However, before Steven offers his remarks, I would like to clarify a point related to the impact of noncash nonrecurring intangible asset impairment charge of $18 million -- just over $18 million that we announced today. This impairment charge was recorded within our operating expenses, impacting our operating margins by 57 basis points. It should, of course, be noted that this impairment charge reduced both GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS by $0.07. 
With that, I'll ask Steven to discuss our quarterly and full year financial performance, and then I'll provide some additional comments on the current business conditions, our markets and where we're heading. Steven, please."
339447,703140156,2213764,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2021",2021-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q4 2020 and Q4 2019 non-GAAP results",2229,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q4 2020 and Q4 2019 non-GAAP results exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release and in the supplemental information section of our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have again included a corporate sales category for Q4 that represents sales to Covetrus under the transitional services agreements that has now expired just shy of 2 years since the completion of the spin-off of our Animal Health business to form Covetrus. We expect stranded costs related to the Animal Health spin-off to be in the $10 million to $12 million range for 2021. 
Turning now to our financial results. Total net sales for the quarter ended December 26, 2020, were $3.2 billion, reflecting growth of 18.6% compared with the prior year, with internally generated sales up 17.1% in local currencies, which was driven by sales of PPE, or personal protective equipment, as well as COVID-related products. Details of sales performance are contained in Exhibit E of our earnings press release issued earlier today. 
On a GAAP basis, our operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 5.7%, representing a decrease of 164 basis points compared with the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin of 5.9% contracted by 146 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Again, a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin can be found in the supplemental information page on the Investor Relations page of our website. 
Our operating margin was unfavorably impacted by significant inventory adjustments associated with PPE and COVID-related products as well as lower supplier rebates, and that was partially offset by lower expenses as a percentage of sales. It's important to note we do not expect any material inventory adjustments to continue into 2021. 
Our operating margin, as Stanley said, was also negatively impacted by 57 basis points due to a noncash nonrecurring intangible asset impairment charge recorded by Henry Schein One of approximately $18.1 million, which reduced both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by $0.07 per diluted share. 
Turning to taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 17.3%. This compares with 22.3% GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019. And on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 17.5%, which compares to a prior year non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22.2%. You can see a reconciliation of GAAP effective tax rate to non-GAAP effective tax rate again on our supplemental information page on our website. This lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 was favorably impacted by income tax resolutions in both the U.S. as well as internationally, which lowered income tax expense by approximately $14.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Excluding this impact, the effective tax rate would have been in the 26% range for both GAAP and non-GAAP. 
Moving on. Our GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $141.9 million or $0.99 per diluted share. This compares with the prior year GAAP net income from continuing operations of $330 million or $2.25 per diluted share, but remember that included a net gain on the sale of equity investments of $1.27. 
Our non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $143.6 million or $1 per diluted share, and this compares to the non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $143 million or $0.97 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of last year. Again, both our GAAP and non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was favorably impacted by the tax resolutions I just mentioned and unfavorably impacted by the onetime impairment charge. 
Our amortization of acquired intangibles for Q4 2020 was $25.3 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share. This excludes the nonrecurring $18.1 million impairment charge that we recorded in the current quarter and compares to $26.9 million pretax or $0.12 per diluted share for the same period last year. Similarly, for the full year 2020, amortization from acquired intangibles was $102.1 million pretax or $0.40 per diluted share. This excludes the combined $20.3 million in noncash asset impairment charges that we recorded in Q1 as well as in the current quarter and compares to $105.9 million pretax or $0.46 per diluted share in 2019.  
I'll also note that foreign currency had a very minor impact on our EPS. It positively impacted Q4 diluted EPS by less than $0.01 per share. 
Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the fourth quarter. Global Dental sales of $1.8 billion grew 7.2% compared with the same period last year, with internal sales growth of 5.1% in local currencies. Global Dental consumable merchandise internal sales increased by 10% in local currencies in the fourth quarter. And excluding PPE and COVID-related products, sales increase was 5.0%. I'll note that this 5.0% quarterly growth rate is among the highest that we've recorded at Henry Schein since 2017. 
North American internal sales in local currencies declined 0.7%, which included growth of 5.3% in dental consumable merchandise; 0.4%, excluding PPE and COVID-related products; and a 13.2% decline in sales of dental equipment. 
Our international dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 14.2%, which included 16.7% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise sales or 11.4% when excluding PPE and COVID-related products and 6.8% growth in sales of international dental equipment. 
Looking at dental consumable merchandise sales, we experienced very solid growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, China, Brazil and throughout most of Europe. We saw particular strength in France and Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Italy and Poland. However, the U.K. countries continue to experience lower sales as that country has moved into a stricter lockdown. 
Our North American dental equipment sales performance was impacted by a difficult prior year comparison, including the Dentsply Sirona World event moving to a virtual platform and production transitions as a key supplier exited traditional equipment categories. In addition, we believe some practices potentially held off on year-end equipment purchases as U.S. tax incentives may be more favorable in 2021. 
International dental equipment sales growth in Q4 was driven by strength in Germany, Austria, France as well as Australia and New Zealand. We experienced high single-digit internal sales growth in local currencies and traditional equipment and low single-digit growth in high-tech equipment internationally. We continue to be encouraged by the extent of customer engagement and interest in equipment and technology investments. Currently, both our North America and international equipment backlogs are exhibiting growth year-over-year. Please keep in mind that backlog represents sales orders at the end of the quarter that have not been shipped, but we also take a substantial amount of orders within the quarter that will drive our sales results for the current quarter. 
Given our current perspective, we are optimistic about our North American as well as international dental equipment sales growth for the first quarter of 2021. 
Our global dental specialty revenue in the fourth quarter totaled approximately $200 million, with internal growth of 2.2% in local currencies versus the prior year. The split was 1.7% growth in North America and 3.1% internationally. Our global dental implant growth in the fourth quarter was 4.3%. Our orthodontic sales decreased by 5%, primarily due to business interruption as we moved to a new distribution center in Q4 as well as a supplier exiting the market, which resulted in a shift of orders to alternate suppliers. We expect to see a sequential improvement in orthodontic sales in the first quarter of 2021. 
Turning now to Global Medical sales. They were $1.2 billion and growth of 48.5% compared to the same period last year, 48.2% of that was in local currencies and included 47.9% increase in North America and international sales growth of 63.1%. Our Medical sales results were driven by continued strong demand for PPE and COVID-19-related products. If you were to exclude the sales of these products to Global Medical, internal growth in local currencies was approximately 3.6%. I'll also note that we sold approximately $270 million in COVID tests in Q4, including some multi-assay flu and COVID-19 combination test. This was up from approximately $100 million in the third quarter. We believe solid COVID test sales growth is likely to continue while COVID cases remain at relatively high levels. We also experienced double-digit growth in sales of med-surg products in Q4. 
Turning to Technology and Value-Added Services sales. They were $138.7 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% compared with the prior year, including a decline in internally generated sales in local currencies of approximately 0.7%. In North America, tech and value-added services internal sales growth was 0.6% in local currencies. And I'll note that the sales growth was impacted by transactional revenue associated with the lower number of patient visits compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. We also faced a difficult prior year comparison that benefited hardware upgrades in the prior year as we help transition customers to address new operating system requirements. 
We are very pleased with our solid sales growth from our Dentrix Ascend cloud-based software solutions as well as financial services. Internationally, Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales declined by 8.4% in local currencies when compared to the prior year. The prolonged lockdown in the U.K. significantly impacted this international business. As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call last May, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program as a means to preserve cash in response to the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations and due to certain restrictions related to financial covenants. Prior to the suspension of this program in 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares at $61.49 average price, which represents a total of $73.8 million in cash. At the year-end, we had approximately $201 million authorized and available for future stock purchases. But remember, when we amended our credit facilities earlier this year, we also agreed to restrict stock repurchases until we report our second quarter 2020 financial results. 
Currently, we have significant access to liquidity, providing flexibility and financial stability in this challenging environment. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $345 million compared to $295 million for the fourth quarter of last year. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher net income in 2020 after adjusting for the pretax gain on the sale of equity investments in the prior year. As part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we recorded a pretax charge in Q4 2020 of $4.4 million or $0.02 per diluted share. This charge primarily relates to severance pay and facility closing costs and reflects opportunities to reduce expenses, drive operating efficiencies and mitigated stranded costs. We anticipate additional restructuring costs in 2021. 
I'll now provide a quick review of the full year of 2020 and then move on to 2021 guidance. During 2020, we achieved total net sales of $10.1 billion, up 1.3% from 29 -- from 2019, sorry, with internally generated sales up 0.8% in local currencies, and this is all despite the significant impact we saw earlier in the year regarding the COVID pandemic. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 40.1%, largely impacted by COVID-19 and the net gain on sale of equity investments in the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS declined 15% due to the impact of COVID-19. And again, we're pleased with solid operating cash flow for the year of almost $600 million with cash funds, which funds our balanced approach to capital allocation. 
Let me conclude my remarks on financial guidance. At this time, we're not providing a '21 GAAP guidance since we are unable to provide an accurate estimate of expenses related to the ongoing restructuring initiative. However, given the wide range of analyst EPS estimates for the year, we see a benefit in providing a high-level guidance. As such, we expect that our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein will be at or above 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations, which was $3.51. We believe this comparison to 2019 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is appropriate, given the COVID-19 impact on 2020 results. 
I think it's very important to note that our guidance is not a range, and it's not a specific EPS number. In fact, what we're trying to show and what we're intending is for this guidance of $3.51 -- at or above $3.51 to be a floor for our guidance and not a specific guidance number. So hopefully, it's taken as such. 
And keep in mind that guidance for 2021 non-GAAP EPS attributable to Henry Schein is for current operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but it does not include the potential for future acquisitions, if any, as well as restructuring expenses or share repurchases. Our guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates that are generally consistent with current levels and also assumes that the end markets remain stable and consistent with current market conditions. Of course, guidance does not assume any material market changes associated with COVID-19. 
So with that summary, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley."

I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our strategic planning process. We undertake a rolling formal planning initiative every 3 years, and we are currently in the midst of developing our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan, which we believe will help us focus on optimizing the long-term return on our investments and enable us to continue delivering value to our shareholders. We had deferred, of course, and I think the investors know this, our strategic planning process for 1 year as we focused on addressing the impact of COVID-19. Today, we'd like to offer a preview of our thinking around some key components of our strategic plan. 
First, a key element in our effort to grow closer to our customers is our One Schein initiative, which is a unified go-to-market approach that enables practitioners to work synergistically with Henry Schein's supply chain, equipment sales and service and other value-added services, allowing our customers to leverage the combined value that we offer through a single program. Specifically, One Schein provides customers with streamlined access to our comprehensive offering of, of course, national brand products, Henry Schein private label and proprietary specialty products and solutions, including surgical, endodontic and orthodontic products. In addition, customers have access to services, pretty wide range, probably the largest, we believe, in the marketplaces that we serve, including software and other value-added services. Ultimately, One Schein enables customers to benefit from the ability to enrich patient treatment options and outcomes and simplify business operations in addition to the opportunity to drive practice profitability. 
So looking more closely at our Technology and Value-Added Services and dental specialty businesses, let me start with a discussion on our Technology and Value-Added Services business, which comprises approximately $500 million of revenue, about 5% of Henry Schein's total sales in 2020. I would like to note that COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on this Technology and Value-Added Services business, at least from a sales point of view. Within this segment, Henry Schein One, our dental software offering, represents the lion's share of sales and is also one of the Henry Schein's highest-margin businesses, one of our large -- highest-margin businesses is reflected in the Henry Schein One business. Our comprehensive suite of integrated dental software solutions reaches far beyond practice management software, which is key to simplifying clinical and office-based processes in the physical office or in the cloud. So we go beyond the practice management software, which, of course, is quite effective and the leading systems in the world. We are also advancing patient demand generation with our expertise in website, search engine optimization, patient reviews and dental directories and dental savings plans. 
Our patient engagement solutions help practices communicate with patients engaged in market campaigns and facilitate online booking. And our revenue cycle management products facilitate insurance processing and patient payments. We believe that no other company offers a combined portfolio of products as broad and as extensive as Henry Schein One solutions and that our expertise is fundamental to the capabilities that practitioners value as a resource to help drive practice success.  
We are delighted that Mike Baird has joined us as CEO of Henry Schein One, taking over the role that Jon Koch, CEO of our Global Dental Group, held on an interim basis. In his new role, Mike will work with leaders across Henry Schein One, including our software businesses in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region, to continue promotion of our industry-leading practice management, patient engagement and patient demand-creation solutions. His team will also continue to collaborate closely with Henry Schein Dental and our specialty businesses to help drive the One Schein offering to dental professionals around the world. Prior to joining Henry Schein One, Mike held several leadership positions in the health care information technology space and most recently served as President of Health Systems at American Well. 
During the fourth quarter, we launched a number of product enhancements for Henry Schein One solutions, including directory online booking, which is a self-scheduling solution for the WebMD directory, allowing prospective patients to book appointments online through the WebMD directory; Patient Engagement Live, which provides dental practice teams with access to real-time patient notifications; the Patient Engage Mobile app, which enables practice functions on the go; Dentrix Ascend Pay and Dentrix Enterprise Pay, which integrate point-of-service card processing solutions for faster check-in/check-out processing after the procedure is completed; and Dentrix Ascend e-Rx, which is an integrated electronic prescribing solution that enables seamless electronically prescribing functionality with the Ascend practice management system. 
Our value-added services also includes Henry Schein Financial Services, which facilitates financing options, including equipment, technology, financing and leasing, working capital loans as well as patient finance and credit card options. 
Our business solutions offering, which is the third component in this group, offers a complete array of value-added services and include technology as well as resources for improving key business functions that contribute to the successful business operations and clinical effectiveness of dental and medical practices. So that's our Technology and Value-Added Services offering, which is described separately or reported separately in our financial statements. 
Let me now discuss our dental specialty business, which consists of dental implants and biomaterials for tooth replacement therapy, certain surgical pharmaceutical products, endodontics and rotary products as well as orthodontic products. Comprising approximately 12% of our global dental sales, this business generated sales of approximately $700 million in 2020. Of course, we are quite pleased with these results given the COVID-19 challenges we experienced, which had a significant negative impact on 2020 sales and particularly in the second quarter, although we did recover significantly and, in fact, did very well in the third and fourth quarter for the -- in other words, the second half of the year. Given the proprietary designs and unique value proposition of these specialized products, our dental specialties businesses command a higher margin than most core dental products that we distribute. Through our expertise across the entire value chain from research and development, production and distribution to marketing, education and value-added services offered by -- to practitioners undertaking specialty products -- procedures, our customers benefit from our high pace of innovation and our comprehensive portfolio of specialty products and related value-added services.
As a percentage of global dental specialty sales, implant tooth replacement, bone regeneration and oral surgery products represent the largest portion of dental specialty sales, with contributions from our by BioHorizons, CAMLOG, Medentis Medical, ACE Surgical and Southern Anesthesia businesses. Over the past several quarters, we believe we have been among the leading companies in premium implant segment sales performance, including strong sales in biomaterials. We expect this trend to continue based on our continued innovative -- innovation and investment in portfolio expansion and value-added services.
In addition, Medentis Medical, our value implant line, posted solid fourth quarter sales in the DACH region, which represents Medentis' largest region. The next largest piece in our specialties businesses -- business, is our endodontic products, which includes Brasseler Dental, our Henry Schein-branded endodontic ranges and other products as well as national brand products. We continue to invest in enhancing our selling capabilities and R&D around our endodontic platform, and we believe we have gained market share in key markets.
Last on the specialty side, our orthodontic business is comprised of sales from Ortho2, Ortho Technology and our Reveal Clear Aligner businesses. Although our orthodontic sales and, specifically, our clear aligner sales represent the smallest dental specialty business, part of our specialty business sales continued to grow, and we expect that trend to continue as we invest in enhancing the user experience through sales, marketing and manufacturing innovation, including with our software solutions.
On this group, in specialty group, in general, we continue to make progress in penetrating private practices, the mid-market and DSO customers that value the precision, quality and expertise that we deliver through our dental specialty solutions, in part due to our One Schein initiative.
So now let me just address PPE and COVID testing for a minute and COVID-related -- COVID-19 tests and other related products. In both the dental and medical markets, we expect we will continue to see sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products at elevated levels compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. We continue to firm up global sources of supply and have begun to utilize alternate domestic manufacturers to meet our customer supply needs. 
We are very pleased and proud, in fact, of the way we handled the whole PPE and testing availability of products during 2020 when we went -- had our extensive activities in seeking product, flu product in from around the world, ensure that our customers had adequate PPE products and test products as well, costing us a lot of money to do this, but well worth it from a customer service and satisfaction point of view. At this time, we believe that most dental and medical practices are able to access adequate supply of PPE, including face shields, masks, gowns and thermometers. 
The exceptions continue to be where the market is experiencing supply constraints for particular products such as nitrile gloves, medical wipes and, more recently, syringes and needle inventory to support vaccine rollout. We believe we have adequate availability for our current customer base and should be able to satisfy our customers' needs as we have during most of 2020. 
Now let me turn to M&A for a moment. On the acquisition side, although we suspended M&A activities from March through the summer, we closed 9 acquisitions with adequate sales of almost $300 million and deployed nearly $200 million in capital. These transactions are expected to be slightly dilutive in their first year and quite accretive thereafter.
In the new year, we announced the acquisition of Prism Medical Products. This transaction expands our U.S. medical business beyond our core base of office-based physicians and into the home health market. Specifically, home medical suppliers is a natural extension of our focus on the continuum of care delivery model. With revenues of $52 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, PRISM serves a broad network of nationally affiliated and independently operated wound care clinics as well as specialist practices. We believe this acquisition will allow us to move closer to the patient. It also strengthens our relationship with physicians who prescribe home medical supplies.
I would like to take a moment to address our investments in technology and business intelligence to enhance current e-commerce, digital marketing and customer engagement tools that, in turn, help our teams succeed in the market, providing, of course, greater customer satisfaction. Marketing automation, customer insights and analytics, personalization technologies and customer experience management tools are just a few of the many areas in which we have made considerable advancement in recent years. 
Consistent with our broad digital strategy, these investments leverage best-of-breed technologies to ensure we provide a rich customer experience adaptable as customers' needs evolve. As part of supporting our customers through every step of their buying journey, we are focused on using our global e-commerce platform for dental and medical, which we internally refer to as GEP, G-E-P. Successful implementation of current and future GEP investments will enable Henry Schein to remain a destination of choice over the long term for health care providers and suppliers. Keep in mind that we are early in the process of planning and implementing long-term phases -- the long-term phases of GEP market by market. 
The long-term phase of GEP will be rolled out beginning of 2022 and continue through 2024. We have a great team in place. And consistent with our history of rolling out advancements in the IT space on a consistent and reliable basis, we are extremely enthusiastic about the GEP investments. Again, we look forward to keeping you apprised of our evolving strategic plans as we enhance the breadth of our solutions and services offerings and look to deliver continued long-term value to our stakeholders, which takes me to a short discussion on ESG.
I'd like to comment on the significant work that Henry Schein has undertaken over the years in this area and particularly this past year to enhance our long-standing commitment to environmental, social and governance or as it's known, ESG initiatives. In 2019, we embarked on a journey to evolve our ESG disclosure with a goal of reporting on appropriate global reporting initiatives, also known as GRI, standards. We've had a broad cross-functional team working with our business and corporate teams on goals and targets for carbon dioxide, energy, waste supply chain, diversity and inclusion, safety, employee training, volunteering and community impact. Our diversity inclusion work has always been a part of our core values, and we have helped drive this conversation for more than 2 decades.
Building on our Women's Leadership Network employee resource group, we have added 3 additional employee resource groups this year -- last year, including our Black Legacy Professionals, Pride and Allies and Latin ERGs. We were pleased to earn 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's annual assessment of LGBTQ workplace equality and be named to Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies list for the 20th consecutive year, ranking actually first in our category for the last couple of years. With the support of Henry Schein's senior management and oversight by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, our ESG program reflects our long history as a purpose-driven, higher-ambition company that integrates our sense of purpose in the way we operate our business.
Last, let me just report on our Board of Directors. We recently announced changes as Paul Brons and Shira Goodman will not stand for reelection at our 2021 stockholder meeting. We thank, of course, Paul and Shira for their many years of service and valued contributions to the Henry Schein Board. At the same time, we welcome our newest board members, Mohamad Ali and Deborah Derby. Mohamad has extensive experience with successful technology transformation. And Deb brings broad operational, strategic and senior leadership experience with public companies. The addition of these directors complements the skill and experience of our current Board, and we are confident that the collective set of leaders will provide valuable perspectives as we continue to execute our strategy.
So I realize that was a lot, but there's a lot going on at Henry Schein. So now we're happy to open the floor to any Q&A or any questions that investors may have, and we will answer them. Thank you."

First, just, Steve, on 2021 guidance, I understand that you're not and you really never do, I guess, provide revenue guidance. I'd still be interested in hearing maybe how you're thinking about your core ex-PPE and COVID product revenues in dental and medical. Do they get back to 2019 levels this year? Or how to think about that?
And given the additional PPE and COVID revenues in '21 versus '19, it seems like your '21 EPS guidance, if I were to get down to that $3.51 level, your margins have to be down something like 60, 70 basis points versus '19. Is that a fair ballpark to think to get down to that $3.51 level?"

So again, I just want to make sure people understand that the guidance that we gave is the floor. We've debated, quite honestly, whether to give guidance or not this quarter.

We've debated, quite honestly, whether to give guidance or not this quarter. But leading up to the quarter with investor meetings, we were getting lots of questions on guidance, and we felt giving a floor was beneficial rather than giving nothing and having that total uncertainty out there. So please take it as the floor.
The other point I want to make before I directly answer your questions, Jeff, is that people seem to look at, as you are, the non-PPE core sales growth. And I think it's important to note that, if you look at North American dental consumables as an example, that growth was -- I think it was 0.4%, excluding PPE products, but that's given patient traffic is down 80% -- down 20% to 80%. And so that's, I think, a good number considering that.
And the other thing that's important to note is that we believe that PPE and COVID-related products will continue to be strong going forward. It will represent really the new standard of care for practitioners. So I wouldn't look at those revenues as nonrecurring. I would look at them as recurring. 
But given that, the growth in our sales, excluding PPE, to specifically answer your question, really is directly related to the continued improvement in the underlying market, having that patient traffic grow from 80% to a higher number. Given that we're not making predictions on that, it's hard really to specifically answer, but that's the correlation that we're looking for.
Also, I would say that while we're not giving specific margin items, we did note at least a couple of things in the call that negatively impact margin. One is stranded costs that we did say will be $10 million to $12 million for the current year for 2021. And we -- Stanley did describe our investments in G-E-P, or GEP, that's also included in that guidance. So I think as the year goes on, Jeff, we'll try to give even greater guidance, but we really felt that doing at least a floor for guidance was better than doing nothing."

There might be a change going on in the implant side of that relationship a bit.

I mean, just thinking about volumes being down 20% and your consumable numbers sort of being up, how do you sort of reconcile those two?
And then I'll ask my follow-up upfront. As we think about the $3.51 floor, does that just kind of assume no change in visit behavior? So if we continue to monitor these ADA surveys as kind of like a baseline, we're assuming no meaningful improvement from those levels in that $3.51? I guess that also assumes that the elevated sort of medical sales continue, as you just suggested, Steve, to kind of -- is also embedded in that $3.51? Sorry.

And the bottom line is the analyst estimates are all over the place. So what we decided to do was to provide a floor. That's by no means guidance in the traditional sense. We're not providing ranges, as Steven noted. It's a floor, number one. Number two is we do expect the visits to physicians and to dentists to continue to grow. We do expect, therefore, that our consumable business will grow. We'll go back to '19 levels and grow a little bit above that, too. The same with our specialties and, of course, our software and other value-added services. We do expect Henry Schein programs, in general, One Schein, the way in which our sales organization relates to our customers, all of that, to continue to perform well. 
Having said that, we are in the midst of a pandemic. And so it's hard to provide solid guidance in the sense that we offered in 2019 before -- and before. So we decided to give a floor, which we're pretty comfortable with. Actually, we're quite optimistic about the business. And if we just had a look at 2000 -- in the first quarter, and we had to stop things now, I would say we're very optimistic. 
Having said that, we can't tell where this pandemic is going to hit. No one can tell. And just like a year ago, we cautioned investors about the pandemic. We're doing the same now, although we're a little bit more confident today than we were in February and March of 2020. What we're saying is we're comfortable with the bottom, with the floor of the guidance we've given. We just can't give ranges. 
And yes, we believe our consumable business, our equipment business, our software business, our specialty businesses, are all poised to do well. And if the music stopped today, we think we'd have a very good 2021. But again, we can't tell where this is heading. I must say, though, that as one goes to the East and then comes West, things are getting better. Our Asia businesses are pretty much back to normal, doing quite well, Asia Pacific. 
Europe is okay, except for the U.K., where, hopefully, the reimbursement of dentists will encourage reimbursement for dentists to see more patients again. And in the U.S., it's pretty stable, both in dental and medical. And we're hopeful that the 80% will start going back to normal to the pre -- the 2019 levels as the year goes by. But exactly in which quarter, it's very hard to tell. All I can say is we are and we continue to be very optimistic about our business and are very pleased with the performance so far this year."

And we do believe that part of the reason why is that there's a higher acuity of procedures being done today than typically. So there's more tooth restorations. There's more implants. There's more, again, of the higher procedures that generally cause a higher level of consumable products. Things like prophies and general examinations as a percentage of the total procedures is not as high. So the type of procedure being done is helping us with that.
And just to quickly add on one of your questions, we're really not assuming much market improvement in that floor guidance. Because, again, we would not know when to assume it, and there's still a lot of uncertainty on when it improves. So there is potential upside if the market improves quicker because we really don't have that in our guidance at this point."

These are not our normal customers. I'm not talking about a lot of money in terms of sales, but we had to replenish this product at higher prices, including significant freight costs. We made a decision as a company to provide PPE products to our customers at as low a price as we could possibly do that. And so at the end of the day, we provided, I believe, great customer satisfaction while following through on the government's call, and I'm referring to the United States, for a request to empty our warehouses on PPE and send it to those areas, those hotspots that were the most challenged. This did have an impact on our 2020 margins for PPE and in general. But as Steven said, I think that is largely behind us, but I do believe that the history books will tell we made the right decisions from a morality point of view, and we are a higher-ambitions company, and we've made the right decision from our customers' point of view, number one.
Number two, on equipment. We had almost a perfect storm at the end of 2020 in North America. This particular situation did not occur outside of North America, where we did experience good consumable, by the way, and, of course, equipment growth. In the United States, and I'm not referring to Canada now, but specifically relating to the United States, we do report our North America numbers, but in the United States, for equipment, Dentsply Sirona World went virtual, which has been historically a terrific opportunity for us to generate business. We believe that we will generate that business largely in the first quarter and, to some extent, in the third quarter. We had a key supplier of traditional equipment exit the market, and that product that was ordered by that -- from that supplier through us, of course, could not be satisfied fully by the existing manufacturers who have brought their production up to speed. And we expect, again, for that to be satisfied in the second and third quarter.
And then there's the whole issue of whether dentists should have purchased equipment in the fourth quarter or not, given that the incomes were largely down, being that 80% of dentists in the United States were out of practice in the -- out of their practices in the second quarter, their earnings were not great. And with the expectation that tax rates will go up in 2021, there was quite a bit of deferment of purchases of equipment from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Taking that all into account, I think we are quite optimistic about our North American equipment business, U.S. business. Canada was a little bit different. It was good in general because these variations, these perfect storm variations do not apply in Canada.
As to the areas of sales that we expect, I think the traditional business, chairs, units, lights, as reported in prior quarters, is still an area where dentists are investing. I would say that the imaging area is an area, although pricing, as we've said in the past, has come down somewhat. And yes, the whole area of DI and chairside full milling of crowns and bridges will all be areas where we expect decent growth in '21 and beyond.
So Carolynne, do we have any -- do we have more time for questions? I think we're running out of time. But we can go over a little bit since there's a lot going on."

So we will expand our footprint. We will drive efficiency in that business and expect to increase our margins in general on the distribution side both in dental, as I noted now, in dental. But also, we are expanding our medical business abroad. We did not focus on our international medical business until about a year ago, 18 months ago, because we had so much going on in the U.S. But we have taken our small medical business in Europe, added resources to it, and we'll be adding more resources to it in the future and expect, of course, the medical distribution business to go beyond the U.S. and Europe, expanding in Canada, where it's very small today, and in other markets.
At the same time, specialty products will be important for us in dental. We expect to continue to grow. We've done very well in implants. We've done very well in endodontics. And we have a very good foundation in orthodontics. We had a peculiar fourth quarter again, a perfect storm. We had a manufacturer exiting that market, and so we had to replace that -- those products from elsewhere. And we had a move in our distribution center around the end of the year. That will all catch up. And so those are the areas we want to invest in, expanding our specialty platforms around the world. Of course, Henry Schein One is a huge opportunity for Henry Schein. We're investing in that area. We're very, very pleased to see the pickup in SaaS products, in cloud-based products. Of course, it does impact sales. But in the long run, it's a very profitable business, and we've done very well with our SaaS product. We're investing in that, too.
And then when it comes to medical devices, we expect to expand in that area in specialty devices. We already are a player in orthodontic saws -- sorry, orthopedic saws and expect to increase that platform as well. So I think it's about global expansion in our core business, in our specialty businesses, adding to those platforms that we have and also in the technology areas. So we have our dental distribution, our medical distribution, our practice management technology and other value-added services platforms and, of course, our specialty products. All of these are areas where there's great opportunity. And strategic planning, John, as you know, is not necessarily about what you can do, but what you want to prioritize on. So we have a lot of options, very excited. We have the best management team, I would say, in the company's history from a capabilities point of view of expanding these various platforms we've developed and are very excited about the future."

But just wondering your confidence in this momentum persisting going forward and to what extent there's maybe some pent-up demand that's supporting some of this growth versus core growth being reflective of maybe rising demand in some of these international markets.
And then just pivoting also to medical and the COVID testing revenue, $270 million is a big number for the quarter. But curious how you're factoring in price adjustments that are expected from the manufacturers in this market and future testing volumes, just really how you're planning for these cross currents this year."

Again, a lot of good questions on this call, I might add. So international, we continue to expect our international business to grow.

So international, we continue to expect our international business to grow. Internal growth, of course, we will add some acquisition growth as we've done in the past. It's hard to predict a quarter. I think one has to look at a trend for several quarters. But over several quarters, I think we are quite confident that we will grow our consumable and equipment businesses outside of North America, including Canada as part of the U.S. So it's part of our North American numbers. So I think it's fair to say we expect to grow our global consumables and equipment business and, in particular, are very enthused about our international business.
On the testing. So we had a shortage of, believe it or not, even with these good numbers, of tests in the point-of-care quick test arena. We believe the testing is now -- there's more testing available to us. The DPA is -- I wouldn't say being completely satisfied, but there's more product available for us than in the past. And I'm referring to COVID testing but also other tests, flu tests, et cetera. 
So I think it's fair to say that the price of these tests will come down because the larger machines that were used in the earlier stage will be replaced -- those with tests. A large number of those tests will be replaced by snap test with a lower cost per test. Having said that, the demand for tests is likely to grow, in our view. And in particular, they'll be more available for our channel, which is the office space practitioner environment and the workplace health environment. 
So in general, we think with the opening up of availability, the price coming down, but at the same time, the demand growing, we expect to have a good 2021 in tests. Of course, there's no way we can talk about any specific numbers because we don't know exactly, but we've built in our plans a fair amount of PPE sales and of testing sales. So these are 2 growth areas for us. It will grow as compared to 2019. Thank you for that question. And thank you for all the questions."

I'm sorry we went over today, but there was a lot in this call that we wanted to cover, a lot of unusual situations. Bottom line is we're quite optimistic about the future. Of course, no one can predict exactly where the virus is heading, although I think it's fair to say we will not go into a situation again where dental practices will be closed down and physician practices and ambulatory surgical centers will be closed down. 
If it gets worse, the virus, I think there'll be more precautions, but I can't see a total lockdown as occurred in the second quarter. Of course, as our investors know, we powered down significantly in the second quarter and powered up very quickly in the third quarter. This did cost us a lot. It certainly probably cost us a little bit of market share, but I think we've gained that back and some more. So overall, I would say we did the right things in 2021 from a cash preservation point of view. Taking care of our team is the #1 priority. 
And of course, in parallel with that, ensuring that our customers' service needs were taken care of, while at the same time, in particular, ensuring that PPE was made available to our customers at reasonable prices. Of course, the prices went up significantly, but we kept prices, to a large extent, within the range of what it cost us, rather than passing on unusual profits that we could have gained. 
And I think this will pay off in the long run with trust from our customers. And in the end, I think, well, Henry Schein has come out of this COVID period as a much stronger company in terms of brand recognition and appreciation of what full service does in the dental and medical market for our customers.
So with that in mind, I have to say, we're pretty optimistic about the future, although we are in this pandemic environment. Our plans will be finalized. There's a wide array of opportunities. We are operating right now under an interim refresh plan for 2021. But by the end of this year, we will firm up the key areas of focus. And I think we will, in turn, do well for our investors. We feel very comfortable.
I will end with this comment. This year is our 25th year as a public company. We've had EPS compounded annual growth at a rate of 12% and stock appreciation at a rate of 12% during this period. We are a company that provides stability, and we believe that we're in good markets with a great team. Thank you very much, everyone, for participating in this call today."

Good morning, everyone. I appreciate everyone calling in today. We're obviously very pleased with what we view as an exceptional first quarter for our financial -- our global financial performance for the year 2021 versus the comparable period last year, but also versus the first quarter of 2019. These good results are based on excellent planning and execution across all of our businesses. Our team really came through for our customers, for our investors, for our suppliers during 2020 and now the first quarter of 2021. We also delivered very strong operating margins for the quarter. 
While end markets in most geographies still face challenges due to the ongoing pandemic, the overall global market recovery and our improving results have continued. Our positive momentum reflects the adaptiveness of our business model. And as I noted, a deep commitment of Team Schein Members across the board to our customers, and in fact, the communities that we serve. Throughout these unprecedented times, Henry Schein has remained focused on the safety of our team above all and, yes, responding to our customers' needs, which were extremely varied across the world and went up and down as dynamics changed in an extremely dynamic environment. 
We, of course, continue to drive innovation across the platform. We gained market share, enhancing our margin and yes, focused on optimizing our cost structure as we have for many years. We believe all this positions us well to continue to drive earnings growth and create value over the long run. Our steady way in which we've driven the business for decades remains very much intact with very good momentum. 
In line with improving end market conditions, In the fourth quarter of 2020, we resumed acquisition activity. We have a lot of activity going on. Of course, no deal is completed until it's actually signed and inked and will then be reported on. In the first quarter of 2021, we closed 5 acquisitions across our Dental, Medical and Technology and Value-added Service businesses, across basically the company with the aggregate sales of nearly $140 million, reflecting our commitment to a balanced strategy that supplements solid organic growth with acquisition contributions. 
In addition, during the first quarter, we resumed share repurchases. The bottom line is that our solid cash flow enables us to invest in our business, reflecting our goal to continue to deliver an attractive return on capital. I will remind shareholders that we're into our 26th year as a public company, reflecting compounded annual growth of 12% on a non-GAAP basis and an increase in stock price of a similar number over this period on a compounded annual growth basis. 
Now returning to the current moment. The latest survey data published by the American Dental Association for the U.S. shows that dental practices are approximately 87% of pre-COVID-19 patient volume, a data point that continues to improve, and we are experiencing improvements throughout the system, specifically in the U.S. The ADA remains bullish on the outlook for the dental profession in the months ahead as vaccinations likely hit a tipping point. The ADA also recently issued a report after partnering with back-to-normal barometer to gain insights on customer sentiments related to dentistry. The survey found that a vast majority of patients who have not already visited dentists this past year are ready to return. As you know, we also closely monitor Henry Schein U.S. Dental eClaims data as a directional indicator. And we have a decent amount market share of that data, of those claims processes -- claims processed. 
This data continues to show that patients are returning to practices for a broad set of oral care procedures and, most recently, including the hygiene arena. In addition, our medical customers have been resilient throughout this pandemic, and we are committed to helping our practitioners, both dental and medical, ensure patients can safely return to routine care as well as elective procedures and, of course, nonelective procedures. 
As COVID-19 cases decline and more people are vaccinated, we expect to see traffic -- patient traffic to physician offices and ambulatory surgery centers normalized, although I must stress that we're not back to where we were with elective ambulatory surgical procedures. There's a lot published on this. And also the normal rate of vaccinations by our practitioners is somewhat down since the volume, including pediatric visits, is down. But it's slowly catching up to the 2019 volumes. 
Henry Schein has been deeply involved in efforts to promote more effective participation of primary care physicians and other office-based practitioners, including dentists in many states, who are allowed to administer the vaccination, and we are committed to driving vaccination rates nationwide with a particular focus on office-based practitioners. While many states provide these practitioners with access to the vaccine, it is extremely difficult and a complex process for office-based practitioners to receive an allotment of these vaccines. And at present, only about 1/3 of primary care physicians are able to offer the vaccine to their patients across the nation. 
COVID-19 vaccination efforts to get shots in the arms of the U.S. citizens have been quite extraordinary thus far. However, we also recognize that the country is now in a race against the variants. We continue to see equity challenges in the uptake of the vaccine, and there continues to be high rate of vaccine hesitancy in some areas of the country. We also recognize that the nation will swiftly need to prepare for delivery of booster vaccines and yes, pediatric vaccination. Henry Schein has been working closely with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, FEMA, the CDC, state and local authorities urging authorities to more effectively include primary care physicians and other office-based practitioners, as I noted, including dentists, by utilizing the existing and well-established distribution network to deliver vaccine to these providers. 
As part of this effort, we recently submitted the letter to the U.S. House Select Committee on the corona crisis. We firmly believe that primary care physicians are a vital resource in the COVID vaccination effort, because the high level of trust they enjoy amongst patients, the understanding of patients' health history and personal circumstances and their physical presence in every community around the country. The vast network of physicians and dentists in the U.S. can be immediately activated and, of course, literally overnight, more effectively advocating -- activating the cadre health professionals who are highly trusted leaders in their communities to vaccinate Americans through their practices. 
This is critical at this moment in the country's vaccination efforts to help overcome hesitancy, to address at-risk populations, reduce health in equities and ultimately ensure more patients are vaccinated. At the same time, more must be done to help other countries that face shortages of these critical vaccines, as equitable global access is crucial to ending the pandemic and the safety of the world's population, including Americans. Through our work with the World Economic Forum and our partnership with the Pandemic Supply Chain Network, Henry Schein has been working to support COVAX, the international entity led by CEPI, Gavi and the World Health Organization and Unicef to accelerate access to the COVID vaccine in low and middle-income countries around the world. 
So the business is in good shape. We continue to have very good momentum. We've been reporting on our results throughout this period in a little bit more detail than in the past, and continue to be very optimistic with the direction of the pandemic at the moment, although there are some setbacks in countries like India. And we are well positioned, we continue to be well positioned to help combat the pandemic and at the same time increase shareholder value. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Steven to discuss our quarterly financial performance, and I'll provide some additional commentary on current business conditions and our markets. Steven, please."

Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q1 2021 and Q1 2020 non-GAAP result",1430,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. 
Our Q1 2021 and Q1 2020 non-GAAP results exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release, and in the Supplemental Information section of our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have again included a corporate sales category for Q1 that represents prior year sales to Covetrus under the Transitional Services agreement, which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Turning now to our financial results. Total net sales for the quarter ended March 27, 2021 were $2.9 billion, reflecting growth of 20.4% compared with the prior period. Internally generated sales were up 14.9% in local currencies. And again, you could find our details of our sales performance contained in Exhibit A of our earnings press release. On a GAAP basis, our operating margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 7.9%, representing an increase of 70 basis points compared with the prior year. 
On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin was 8.4%, which was an increase of 104 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And it's important to note, we're really very pleased with our non-GAAP operating margin performance, which was the highest quarterly margin that we've achieved in the last 5 years. Again, a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin can be found in the Supplemental Information page on the Investor Relations page of our website. 
Turning to taxes. Our reported effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2021 was 25.1%. This compares to 22.4% GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was also 25.1% and compares to the prior year of 22.5%. A reconciliation of GAAP effective tax rate to non-GAAP effective tax rate is again included in the Supplemental Information page on the Investor Relations site of our website. We expect the effective tax rate to continue to be in the 25% range, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, for the remainder of the year. And of course, this assumes no significant changes in tax legislation. 
Moving on, our GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein for the first quarter of 2021 was $166.0 million or $1.16 per diluted share. This compares with the prior year GAAP net income from continuing operations of $130.5 million or $0.91 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2021 was $177.7 million or $1.24 per diluted share, and this compares with the same non-GAAP net income from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2020 of $134.1 million or $0.94 per diluted share. 
To provide a little bit more detail, amortization from acquired intangible assets for Q1 2021 was $29.7 million pretax or approximately $0.13 per diluted share. This is up slightly from $26.8 million or the same $0.13 per diluted share in the same period last year. Also, foreign currency exchange favorably impacted our Q1 '21 diluted EPS by
[Audio Gap]
Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Asia and throughout most of Europe. In Europe, we saw a particular strength in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and to a lesser extent, in Germany. However, the U.K. continued to experience lower sales as that country is just recently easing lockdown measures. 
In North America, the dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 10.9% and included 9.3% in dental consumable merchandise or 6.9% when excluding PPE and COVID-19 related products. Our North American dental equipment sales internal growth in local currencies was 17.4% and was driven by 31.6% internal sales growth in local currencies for high-tech equipment and also strong growth in traditional equipment, which was 10.6%. 
Our international dental sales growth in local currencies was 17.9% and included 19.2% growth in dental consumable merchandise, which is 16.7% growth when you exclude PPE and COVID-related products. International dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies was 12.9% in Q1 and was driven by strength in France, Italy, Austria, as well as Australia and New Zealand and the Netherlands and Brazil. We experienced 14.8% internal sales growth in local currencies and traditional equipment in the international market and high-tech equipment grew 10.3%. 
Our global dental specialty revenue in the first quarter totaled $222 million and had internal growth of 18.3% in local currencies versus the prior year. The growth was split between North America, which was up 19.3% and internationally, up 15.7%. So very strong growth across the globe. Global Medical sales during Q1 were $993 million, which grew 24% compared to the same period last year, including internal sales growth of 22.1% in local currencies. That 22.1% includes 22.4% increase in North America and 12.6% internationally. 
Our Medical sales results were driven by strong demand for PPE and COVID-related products. Excluding sales of these products, global medical internal sales in local currencies was down 6.8%. But this was, in part, resulting from an extremely mild influenza season that impacted both diagnostics and consumable merchandise sales as well as lower pharmaceutical sales related to fewer patient office visits related to COVID-19. 
We sold over $180 million of COVID-19 test kits in Q1, including some multi-assay flu and COVID-19 combination test. This compares with approximately $270 million in test kits in the fourth quarter. That said, we expect COVID-19 test kits to decline somewhat, primarily as a result of unit price erosion. 
Turning to Technology and Value-Added Service sales during Q1 were $143 million, an increase of 8.4% compared with the prior year, including internal growth in local currencies of 3.6%. In North America, the internal sales growth was 4% driven by the Henry Schein One business as well as strong financial services revenue, which benefited from double-digit equipment sales growth. Internationally, Technology and Value-added Service internal sales grew 1.1% compared with the prior year. Again, the prolonged lockdown in the U.K. impacted our international business again this quarter. 
As Stanley mentioned earlier, we resumed our share repurchases in Q1 and purchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $66.90 for a total of $88.7 million. The impact of this repurchase program on the first quarter EPS was immaterial. At the end of the first quarter, Henry Schein had $112.6 million authorized and available for future repurchases of common stock. 
Okay. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We have access to significant liquidity to provide flexibility and financial stability. Our operating cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter was $63.3 million. That compares to $78.8 million in the first quarter of last year. This modest year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher working capital requirements, partially offset by increased net income. As part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we recorded a pretax charge in Q1 of $2.9 million or $0.02 per diluted share. This is, again, a charge related primarily to severance pay and facility closing costs and reflects opportunities to continue to reduce expenses and drive operating efficiencies and mitigate stranded costs. 
Let me now conclude my remarks by updating our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance. At this time, we are not providing GAAP diluted EPS guidance, as we are unable to provide an accurate estimate of expenses related to the restructuring that I just mentioned. We are raising the guidance for 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein. And now we expect that floor, and it's important to note that it's a floor, of $3.70, and that compares to the previous floor that we had issued at $3.51. Again, remember, this is not traditional guidance where we typically give a range. This is really effectively the low end of the range and the floor, and we hope to continue to update guidance as the year progresses. 
Keep in mind that our guidance for 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is for continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of share repurchases, potential future acquisitions, if any, or restructuring expenses. Guidance also assumes that foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels, that the end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions and, of course, does not assume any material adverse market conditions related to COVID-19 pandemic. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley."

Last quarter, we discussed our One Schein initiative, which is a unified go-to-market approach that enables practitioners to work synergistically with Henry Schein's medical and dental supply chain, equipment sales and service, specialty businesses, Henry Schein One, and other value-added services. This allows our customers to leverage the combined value that we offer through a unique approach to managing customer engagement. 
Given our position as a large-scale distributor to both dental and medical practitioners, we are uniquely positioned to deliver value to our large customers by leveraging best practices and customer engagement and support while realizing internal synergies across our distribution businesses through common functions, processes and systems. We refer to these activities internally and related external and -- we refer to these activities and related external and internal benefits as One Schein. That's how we refer to it internally. So we have -- sorry, One Distribution, sorry. 
We have One Schein, which really provides the customers with a unique experience and One Distribution, which focuses on our internal infrastructure so that we can provide our customers with a unique experience. The benefit for our customers that purchase broadly across both dental and medical product categories, such as DSOs, for example, IDNs, large group practices, the government, community health centers and other enterprise organizations is a more streamlined interface for formulary construction, RFP management, contract compliance, analytics and, yes, commission processing. 
For example, a large DSO customer will benefit from our expertise and resources addressing challenges that we have already sold for the medical customers such as onboarding new practices, promoting formulary compliance, rebate negotiations and efficient order processing. DSOs benefit from our ability to deliver a specialty offering like implants, bone regeneration products, orthodontics, endodontics, all in combination with our distribution platform. And the same applies to Henry Schein One software solutions, which can be combined with the distribution offering, consumables equipment, our specialty products, all providing customers with a unique experience through [indiscernible] and through efficiencies internally through One Distribution. 
They also benefit from our capabilities, our customers that address distribution value-added services needed from one source. In fact, we believe that a number of our recent DSO wins were attributable to the unique value proposition offered by our One Schein strategy. 
Now let's spend a few minutes on the distribution side, looking more closely at our dental distribution. Our first quarter dental performance experienced, of course, strong sales growth in both North America and our international markets, including significant growth in North America dental equipment sales versus the fourth quarter of 2020. We experienced broad-based sales growth in North America and international dental consumable merchandise as the dental end markets have continued to improve. 
So now let's take a brief look at our specialty businesses. How does this fit in? As Steven noted, our global dental specialties generated double-digit year-over-year sales growth as we further penetrated these key specialty markets, both domestically and internationally. We also had a number of key strategic developments in each of these product categories. Our implants and oral surgery business, this is the largest of these 3 business units, including in our dental specialty business. This implant and oral surgery business unit experienced solid double-digit growth in the first quarter with significant contribution from BioHorizons and CAMLOG from specifically their implant lines. 
Sales growth in the U.S. was driven by new product introductions, growth with DSO customers, and also by a digital CAD/CAM related solution for implant procedures. New product launches include our progressive implant line across Europe, Canada and more recently, the U.S., as well as our Tapered Pro implant and Nova Matrix reconstruction tissue solutions. 
On the endodontic side, just a brief note. In the first quarter, the strength was driven by DSO -- by the DSO customer segment as well as by the launch of several nickel titanium products across the endo platform. In the orthodontic market, we continue to see a steady improvement in both orthodontic case volume and revenue, as dental practice patients volumes have improved. While our Reveal and SLX Clear Aligner business is currently a small portion of total dental sales, we believe this business will have a more meaningful contribution to growth over the long term. It's steady progress. 
We have expanded to offer Reveal in over 20 international markets, including recent launches in France and Poland, and we anticipate launching in several additional markets this year, including Ireland, Italy and Spain. Importantly, we continue to invest in advancing our orthodontic treatment software, including scanner integration, delivery -- delivering an intuitive solution that streamlines case submissions, clinical reviews and treatment tracking. We continue to invest further in innovation as we develop an enhanced treatment solutions for these markets. And we expect patient volume across our Dental business to continue to improve over time as infection rates decline. That's, I think, a global statement. 
So let's just now focus a little bit on Henry Schein One. This is highlighted within our Technology and Value-added Services business. Henry Schein One sales continue to improve towards prepandemic levels and our investment in R&D and our teams continue to make good progress in the area of our Henry Schein One business. In the first quarter of 2021, we introduced a number of new products enhancements, including new Dentrix imaging software, tools for processing insurance remittances and calculating payment adjustments, marketing campaign enhancements for the Lighthouse 360 platform and an online booking feature for our Sesame, that's primarily an orthodontic business software for those websites. 
Importantly, we are more closely aligning our Henry Schein One and Henry Schein Dental teams through the -- through our Henry Schein -- through our One Schein program, bringing together Henry Schein One and Henry Schein Dental teams to promote bundled solutions aimed at improving customer experience, retention and most importantly, practice efficiency. And this is, of course, primarily through digital integration. 
Now the Medical Distribution business. If you look at the performance of the medical distribution business, you will see why we are pleased with the strong double-digit sales growth in the first quarter. This was driven by PP&E and COVID-19 test sales. Similar to the dental end markets, we expect the physician ambulatory surgical center, alternate care home health markets to improve over time as infection levels abate and patient volumes normalize. We also have a focus on workplace health and sports medicine on both of those segments in the U.S., which is as important as employers consider cost-effective means for employee wellness. Our plans offer employers diagnostic testing support, PP&E and return-to-work consultation. 
Overall, our solutions portfolio remains a focus beyond traditional medical supplies. This includes a comprehensive telemarketing platform in the medical arena, a cyber security solution for health care that we offer to physicians and medical practices, and a digital diabetes care initiative. 
I'd like to point out that while PP&E sales have begun to moderate from recent quarterly growth levels in both dental and medical, both sides of the house, we anticipate that PP&E sales will remain at elevated levels as dentists and physicians implement new standards of care, new best practices as it relates to infection control. And so we do see this demand for PP&E products to continue, although there will be pricing deflation in several areas, but the units will continue to be relatively strong. 
So now, operator, if there's any questions, we can handle them. Thank you."

Let me just add something, a comment from a macro point of view, Jeff. We're feeling pretty good about the global dental market. It's bounced back, particularly strong in some of the specialty areas, at least in our business. The only caution we have to add is, we're in the midst of a pandemic. The pandemic is not finished. We saw what -- we can see what's going on in India and a number of other parts of the world. This could all come back. So I don't want to be a negative cloud over the dental industry or our performance as a company. But assuming things continue, assuming we do not have any major setbacks because of COVID, I remain extremely bullish about the dental markets. 
In particular, there is a growing understanding amongst payers that there's a direct correlation between good oral care and good health care. I expect that governments around the world will recognize this. It will be greater reimbursement for dentistry. Can't say it's going to be next quarter. But I think we can continue to be relatively bullish about the dental market with one big footnote. No one knows where this virus is going. And that's the basis under which Steven gave guidance at a floor. And we just can't give guidance on the upside because we just don't know where this virus is going to take us.

On the medical side, our Medical business has done well for several years in the base business, which is consumables, generally pharmaceuticals and equipment. There are a number of variables that are market or economy or public health dependent. The first is vaccinations. I'm not talking about the COVID vaccine now, I'm talking about general vaccination. The rate of visits to physician offices for these standard vaccinations is down. I expect -- and remember, the focus for us in the vaccination area is the United States. I expect as the COVID rates go down, more people will visit the doctor's office for their traditional vaccines, and that part of the business will grow once again. It's down quite a bit right now. 
The second relates to flu, the traditional flu. We shipped our traditional flu vaccines pretty early in the cycle in 2020. It was slightly above the previous year. I think it is fair to say, all things being equal, unless something comes out in the press that it's not a good idea to have a traditional flu vaccine, I expect that, that will continue in the 2021, 2022 vaccine period, flu vaccine period, which is generally sometime between August and October. 
Then there's the flu test, the traditional flu test. This is an area where there have been -- where there's been a significant issue. And of course, it's good for the public because the traditional flu was almost nonexistent this year. So we didn't sell many tests, was hardly sold any, in fact. And who knows where that's going to end up in '20 -- at the end of '21, early '22. I have to expect, as people wear less masks going towards the end of the year as COVID mitigates further, that there will be an increase in those tests and then back to '19 and '18 levels. And then the other area is, of course, the COVID test. The price of -- firstly, we are focused on the point-of-care rapid test. 
I think that there will be a continued demand for those tests, but the prices have come down substantially, both for the PCR and the antigen test. So factoring all of that in, you may have some volatility in our Medical business. Having said that, the core business is doing quite well as procedures move from the acute care setting into the physician's office, into the ambulatory care centers, and expect that this will recover as the public gets confidence in returning to the physician offices for traditional visits for their vaccinations and to the ambulatory surgical centers for elective surgery."

It's very difficult, Steve, to give you precise information on where our sales are coming from. But I could make a couple of general statements. The first is that we believe that the high-touch model is most appropriate for dentists. We provide all the online capabilities that are normal -- let's say, a traditional online-only provider provides. When I say traditional, these are online providers, have not been around that many years. But whatever they can offer in terms of online purchasing, we can offer. Our prices are competitive for customers that essentially use us as a primary supplier. And recent investment in TDSC confirms that if customers want to buy only from an online supplier, it's available. We have good software there. We're doing okay in sales. 
I don't see a huge switch overnight to any one sector, whether it's traditional or it's online only. Over the long run, I believe that our customers will appreciate the work that full-service does. Our DSOs, obviously, are a little bit more sophisticated buyers. They understand that. This whole idea of consumables, equipment, specialty products and the offering of Henry Schein One altogether is a compelling offering. I think the part of the market that relates to discount purchasing and quotes, not necessarily at a discount price but perceived discount, will continue to be there at similar rates, maybe it'll move a few percent one way or the other. 
But from a Henry Schein point of view, I feel confident that we will continue to gain overall market share in our Dental business as we have for decades. And -- but I don't see massive shifts one way or the other. Of course, PP&E was a unique situation. I know, from Henry Schein point of view, we were extremely conservative with the quality and the regulatory process that we went through on each PP&E product we sold. I'm not sure that was the case amongst every -- amongst the rest of the distribution channels, whether it was full service or digital only. I just don't know. 
But we are very, very conservative. And there were products probably that we could have bought and sold that we refused to do based on our standards. So that may have moved some product to different channels."

We don't necessarily have every brand in the quantities we would like, but I would say that in general, there's availability of all the -- all the products we need. There are some manufacturers that have not fully come back yet to matching our purchase orders with their shipments. I would say that most manufacturers have an issue in one way or another. I don't think we felt necessarily the disruption that you may read about in the paper as it relates to certain semiconductors or whatever, chips. But there are some manufacturers, I would say, across the board, there are manufacturers that don't -- can't ship everything we want. 
But generally, we can get products in every category. We may have to substitute, and that requires a lot of discussion with customers. I think this is one of the reasons why dentists and physicians appreciate full service distributors, because We can provide the guidance on dislocations in the marketplace. Having said that, I still remain very concerned with the global PP&E structure. It's not fully worked out yet. Providing subsidies to build a factory in the U.S. doesn't mean that those factories are going to be operational when the prices return to pre-COVID competitive purchasing, U.S. versus global pricing. 
So right now, we're okay, but there is a lot of work to be done on the global PP&E and other supply chain matters."

As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements.

Good morning, everyone. I appreciate everyone calling in today. We're obviously very pleased with what we view as an exceptional first quarter for our financial -- our global financial performance for the year 2021 versus the comparable period last year, but also versus the first quarter of 2019. These good results are based on excellent planning and execution across all of our businesses. Our team really came through for our customers, for our investors, for our suppliers during 2020 and now the first quarter of 2021. We also delivered very strong operating margins for the quarter.
While end markets in most geographies still face challenges due to the ongoing pandemic, the overall global market recovery and our improving results have continued. Our positive momentum reflects the adaptiveness of our business model and, as I noted, a deep commitment of Team Schein Members across the board to our customers and, in fact, the communities that we serve. Throughout these unprecedented times, Henry Schein has remained focused on the safety of our team above all and, yes, responding to our customers' needs, which were extremely varied across the world and went up and down as dynamics changed in an extremely dynamic environment.
We, of course, continued to drive innovation across the platform. We gained market share, enhancing our margin and, yes, focused on optimizing our cost structure as we have for many years. We believe all this positions us well to continue to drive earnings growth and create value over the long run. Our steady way in which we've driven the business for decades remains very much intact with very good momentum.
In line with improving end market conditions, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we resumed acquisition activity. We have a lot of activity going on. Of course, no deal is completed until it's actually signed and inked and will then be reported on. In the first quarter of 2021, we closed 5 acquisitions across our Dental, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services businesses, across basically the company with the aggregate sales of nearly $140 million, reflecting our commitment to a balanced strategy that supplements solid organic growth with acquisition contributions.
In addition, during the first quarter, we resumed share repurchases. The bottom line is that our solid cash flow enables us to invest in our business, reflecting our goal to continue to deliver an attractive return on capital. I will remind shareholders that we're into our 26th year as a public company, reflecting compounded annual growth of 12% on a non-GAAP basis and an increase in stock price of a similar number over this period on a compounded annual growth basis.
Now returning to the current moment. The latest survey data published by the American Dental Association for U.S. -- for the U.S. shows that dental practices are approximately 87% of pre-COVID-19 patient volume, a data point that continues to improve, and we are experiencing improvements throughout the system, specifically in the U.S. The ADA remains bullish on the outlook for the dental profession in the months ahead as vaccinations likely hit a tipping point.
The ADA also recently issued a report of partnering with Back to Normal Barometer to gain insights on customer sentiments related to dentistry. The survey found that a vast majority of patients who have not already visited dentists this past year are ready to return. As you know, we also closely monitor Henry Schein U.S. Dental eClaims data as a directional indicator. And we have a decent amount market share of that data -- of those claims processes -- claims processed.
This data continues to show that patients are returning to practices for a broad set of oral care procedures and, most recently, including the hygiene arena. In addition, our medical customers have been resilient throughout this pandemic, and we are committed to helping our practitioners, both dental and medical, ensure patients can safely return to routine care as well as elective procedures and, of course, nonelective procedures.
As COVID-19 cases decline and more people are vaccinated, we expect to see traffic -- patient traffic to physician offices and ambulatory surgery centers normalized, although I must stress that we're not back to where we were with elective ambulatory surgical procedures. There's a lot published on this. And also the normal rate of vaccinations by our practitioners is somewhat down since the volume, including pediatric visits, is down. But it's slowly catching up to the 2019 volumes.
Henry Schein has been deeply involved in efforts to promote more effective participation of primary care physicians and other office-based practitioners, including dentists in many states, who are allowed to administer the vaccination, and we are committed to driving vaccination rates nationwide with a particular focus on office-based practitioners. While many states provide these practitioners with access to the vaccine, it is extremely difficult and a complex process for office-based practitioners to receive an allotment of these vaccines. And at present, only about 1/3 of primary care physicians are able to offer the vaccine to their patients across the nation.
COVID-19 vaccination efforts to get shots in the arms of the U.S. citizens have been quite extraordinary thus far. However, we also recognize that the country is now in a race against the variants. We continue to see equity challenges in the uptake of the vaccine, and there continues to be high rate of vaccine hesitancy in some areas of the country.
We also recognize that the nation will swiftly need to prepare for delivery of booster vaccines and, yes, pediatric vaccination. Henry Schein has been working closely with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, FEMA, CDC, state and local authorities urging authorities to more effectively include primary care physicians and other office-based practitioners, as I noted, including dentists, by utilizing the existing and well-established distribution network to deliver vaccine to these providers.
As part of this effort, we recently submitted the letter to the U.S. House Select Committee on the corona crisis. We firmly believe that primary care physicians are a vital resource in the COVID vaccination effort because the high level of trust they enjoy amongst patients, the understanding of patients' health history and personal circumstances and their physical presence in every community around the country. The vast network of physicians and dentists in the U.S. can be immediately activated and, of course, literally overnight, more effectively advocating -- activating the cadre of health professionals who are highly trusted leaders in their communities to vaccinate Americans through their practices.
This is critical at this moment in the country's vaccination efforts to help overcome hesitancy, to address at-risk populations, reduce health inequities and ultimately ensure more patients are vaccinated. At the same time, more must be done to help other countries that face shortages of these critical vaccines, as equitable global access is crucial to ending the pandemic and the safety of the world's population, including Americans. Through our work with the World Economic Forum and our partnership with the Pandemic Supply Chain Network, Henry Schein has been working to support COVAX, the international entity led by CEPI, Gavi and the World Health Organization and Unicef to accelerate access to the COVID vaccine in low and middle-income countries around the world.
So the business is in good shape. We continued to have very good momentum. We've been reporting on our results throughout this period in a little bit more detail than in the past, and continued to be very optimistic with the direction of the pandemic at the moment, although there are some setbacks in countries like India. And we are well positioned -- continued to be well positioned to help combat the pandemic and at the same time increase shareholder value.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Steven to discuss our quarterly financial performance, and I'll provide some additional commentary on current business conditions and our markets. Steven, please."

Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis.Our Q1 2021 and Q1 2020 non-GAAP results",1517,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis.
Our Q1 2021 and Q1 2020 non-GAAP results exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release, and in the Supplemental Information section of our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have again included corporate sales category for Q1 that represents prior year sales to Covetrus under the transitional services agreement, which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Turning now to our financial results. Total net sales for the quarter ended March 27, 2021, were $2.9 billion, reflecting growth of 20.4% compared with the prior period. Internally generated sales were up 14.9% in local currencies. And again, you could find details of our sales performance contained in Exhibit A of our earnings press release.
On a GAAP basis, our operating margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 7.9%, representing an increase of 70 basis points compared with the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin was 8.4%, which was an increase of 104 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And it's important to note, we're really very pleased with our non-GAAP operating margin performance, which was the highest quarterly margin that we've achieved in the last 5 years. Again, a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin can be found in the Supplemental Information page on the Investor Relations page of our website.
Turning to taxes. Our reported effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2021 was 25.1%. This compares to 22.4% GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was also 25.1% and compares to the prior year of 22.5%. A reconciliation of GAAP effective tax rate to non-GAAP effective tax rate is again included in the Supplemental Information page on the Investor Relations site of our website. We expect the effective tax rate to continue to be in the 25% range, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, for the remainder of the year. And of course, this assumes no significant changes in tax legislation.
Moving on, our GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein for the first quarter of 2021 was $166.0 million or $1.16 per diluted share. This compares with the prior year GAAP net income from continuing operations of $130.5 million or $0.91 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2021 was $177.7 million or $1.24 per diluted share, and this compares with the same non-GAAP net income from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2020 of $134.1 million or $0.94 per diluted share.
To provide a little bit more detail, amortization from acquired intangible assets for Q1 2021 was $29.7 million pretax or approximately $0.13 per diluted share. This is up slightly from $26.8 million or the same $0.13 per diluted share in the same period last year. Also, foreign currency exchange favorably impacted our Q1 '21 diluted EPS by approximately $0.02 per share.
Let me now provide some detail on the sales results for the quarter, starting with global dental. Our global dental sales of $1.8 billion grew 21.3% compared with the same period last year, and internal sales growth of 13.7% in local currencies. Our global dental consumable merchandise internal sales increased by 13.2% in local currencies in the first quarter, and if you were to exclude PPE and COVID-19-related products, the sale increase was 10.9%.
We experienced very solid dental consumable merchandise sales growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Asia and throughout most of Europe. In Europe, we saw a particular strength in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and to a lesser extent, in Germany. However, the U.K. continued to experience lower sales as that country is just recently easing lockdown measures.
In North America, the dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 10.9% and included 9.3% in dental consumable merchandise or 6.9% when excluding PPE and COVID-19 related products. Our North American dental equipment sales internal growth in local currencies was 17.4% and was driven by 31.6% internal sales growth in local currencies for high-tech equipment and also strong growth in traditional equipment, which was 10.6%.
Our international dental sales growth in local currencies was 17.9% and included 19.2% growth in dental consumable merchandise, which is 16.7% growth when you exclude PPE and COVID-related products. International dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies was 12.9% in Q1 and was driven by strength in France, Italy, Austria, as well as Australia and New Zealand and the Netherlands and Brazil. We experienced 14.8% internal sales growth in local currencies in traditional equipment in the international market and high-tech equipment grew 10.3%.
Our global dental specialty revenue in the first quarter totaled $222 million and had internal growth of 18.3% in local currencies versus the prior year. The growth was split between North America, which was up 19.3%, and internationally, up 15.7%. So very strong growth across the globe.
Global Medical sales during Q1 were $993 million, which grew 24% compared to the same period last year, including internal sales growth of 22.1% in local currencies. That 22.1% includes 22.4% increase in North America and 12.6% internationally. Our Medical sales results were driven by strong demand for PPE and COVID-related products. Excluding sales of these products, Global Medical internal sales in local currencies was down 6.8%. But this was, in part, resulting from an extremely mild influenza season that impacted both diagnostics and consumable merchandise sales as well as lower pharmaceutical sales related to fewer patient office visits related to COVID-19.
We sold over $180 million of COVID-19 test kits in Q1, including some multi-assay flu and COVID-19 combination test. This compares with approximately $270 million in test kits in the fourth quarter. That said, we expect COVID-19 test kits to decline somewhat, primarily as a result of unit price erosion.
Turning to Technology and Value-Added Service. Sales during Q1 were $143 million, an increase of 8.4% compared with the prior year, including internal growth in local currencies of 3.6%. In North America, the internal sales growth was 4% driven by the Henry Schein One business as well as strong financial services revenue, which benefited from double-digit equipment sales growth. Internationally, Technology and Value-Added Service internal sales grew 1.1% compared with the prior year. Again, the prolonged lockdown in the U.K. impacted our international business again this quarter.
As Stanley mentioned earlier, we resumed our share repurchases in Q1 and purchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $66.90 for a total of $88.7 million. The impact of this repurchase program on the first quarter EPS was immaterial. At the end of the first quarter, Henry Schein had $112.6 million authorized and available for future repurchases of common stock.
Okay. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We have access to significant liquidity to provide flexibility and financial stability. Our operating cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter was $63.3 million. That compares to $78.8 million in the first quarter of last year. This modest year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher working capital requirements, partially offset by increased net income.
As part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we recorded a pretax charge in Q1 of $2.9 million or $0.02 per diluted share. This is, again, a charge related primarily to severance pay and facility closing costs and reflects opportunities to continue to reduce expenses and drive operating efficiencies and mitigate stranded costs.
Let me now conclude my remarks by updating our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance. At this time, we are not providing GAAP diluted EPS guidance, as we are unable to provide an accurate estimate of expenses related to the restructuring that I just mentioned. We are raising the guidance for 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein. And now we expect that floor, and it's important to note that it's a floor, of $3.70, and that compares to the previous floor that we had issued at $3.51. Again, remember, this is not traditional guidance where we typically give a range. This is really effectively the low end of the range and the floor, and we hope to continue to update guidance as the year progresses.
Keep in mind that our guidance for 2021, non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is for continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of share repurchases, potential future acquisitions, if any, or restructuring expenses. Guidance also assumes that foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels, that the end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions and, of course, does not assume any material adverse market conditions related to COVID-19 pandemic.
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley."
339447,711962433,2268597,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven. Last quarter, we discussed our One Schein initiative, which is a unified go-to-market approach that enables practitioners to work synergistically with Henry Schein's medical and dental supply chain, equipment sales and service, specialt",1234,"Thank you, Steven. Last quarter, we discussed our One Schein initiative, which is a unified go-to-market approach that enables practitioners to work synergistically with Henry Schein's medical and dental supply chain, equipment sales and service, specialty businesses, Henry Schein One, and other value-added services. This allows our customers to leverage the combined value that we offer through a unique approach to managing customer engagement.
Given our position as a large-scale distributor to both dental and medical practitioners, we are uniquely positioned to deliver value to our large customers by leveraging best practices and customer engagement and support while realizing internal synergies across our distribution businesses through common functions, processes and systems. We refer to these activities internally and related external and -- we refer to these activities and related external and internal benefits as One Schein. That's how we refer to it internally. So we have -- sorry, One Distribution, sorry.
We have One Schein, which really provides the customers with a unique experience, and One Distribution, which focuses on our internal infrastructure so that we can provide our customers with a unique experience. The benefit for our customers that purchase broadly across both dental and medical product categories, such as DSOs, for example, IDNs, large group practices, the government community health centers and other enterprise organizations is a more streamlined interface for formulary construction, RFP management, contract compliance, analytics and, yes, commission processing.
For example, a large DSO customer will benefit from our expertise and resources addressing challenges that we have already solved for the medical customers such as onboarding new practices, promoting formulary compliance, rebate negotiations and efficient order processing. DSOs benefit from our ability to deliver a specialty offering like implants, bone regeneration products, orthodontics, endodontics, all in combination with our distribution platform. And the same applies to Henry Schein One software solutions, which can be combined with the distribution offering, consumables equipment, our specialty products, all providing customers with a unique experience through One Schein and through efficiencies internally through One Distribution.
They also benefit from our capabilities, our customers, that address distribution value-added services needed from one source. In fact, we believe that a number of our recent DSO wins were attributable to the unique value proposition offered by our One Schein strategy.
Now let's spend a few minutes on the distribution side, looking more closely at our Dental distribution. Our first quarter Dental performance experienced, of course, strong sales growth in both North America and our international markets, including significant growth in North America dental equipment sales versus the fourth quarter of 2020. We experienced broad-based sales growth in North America and international dental consumable merchandise as the dental end markets have continued to improve.
So now let's take a brief look at our specialty businesses. How does this fit in? As Steven noted, our global dental specialties generated double-digit year-over-year sales growth as we further penetrated these key specialty markets, both domestically and internationally. We also had a number of key strategic developments in each of these product categories. Our implants and oral surgery business, this is the largest of these 3 business units, including in our dental specialty business. This implants and oral surgery business unit experienced solid double-digit growth in the first quarter with significant contribution from BioHorizons and CAMLOG from specifically their implant lines.
Sales growth in the U.S. was driven by new product introductions, growth with DSO customers, and also by a digital CAD/CAM related solution for implant procedures. New product launches include our progressive implant line across Europe, Canada and more recently, the U.S., as well as our Tapered Pro implant and NovoMatrix reconstruction tissue solutions.
On the endodontic side, just a brief note. In the first quarter, the strength was driven by DSO -- by the DSO customer segment as well as by the launch of several nickel titanium products across the endo platform. In the orthodontic market, we continued to see a steady improvement in both orthodontic case volume and revenue, as dental practice patient volumes have improved. While our Reveal and SLX Clear Aligner business is currently a small portion of total dental sales, we believe this business will have a more meaningful contribution to growth over the long term. It's steady progress.
We have expanded to offer Reveal in over 20 international markets, including recent launches in France and Poland, and we anticipate launching in several additional markets this year, including Ireland, Italy and Spain. Importantly, we continued to invest in advancing our orthodontic treatment software, including scanner integration, delivery -- delivering an intuitive solution that streamlines case submissions, clinical reviews and treatment tracking. We continue to invest further in innovation as we develop an enhance treatment solutions for these markets. And we expect patient volume across our Dental business to continue to improve over time as infection rates decline. That's, I think, a global statement.
So let's just now focus a little bit on Henry Schein One. This is highlighted within our Technology and Value-Added Services business. Henry Schein One sales continued to improve towards prepandemic levels and our investment in R&D and our teams continue to make good progress in the area of our Henry Schein One business.
In the first quarter of 2021, we introduced a number of new products, enhancements, including new Dentrix imaging software, tools for processing insurance remittances and calculating payment adjustments, marketing campaign enhancements for the Lighthouse 360 platform and an online booking feature for our Sesame, that's primarily an orthodontic business software for those websites.
Importantly, we are more closely aligning our Henry Schein One and Henry Schein Dental teams through the -- through our Henry Schein -- through our One Schein program, bringing together Henry Schein One and Henry Schein Dental teams to promote bundled solutions aimed at improving customer experience, retention and most importantly, practice efficiency. And this is, of course, primarily through digital integration.
Now the Medical distribution business. If you look at the performance of the Medical distribution business, you will see why we are pleased with the strong double-digit sales growth in the first quarter. This was driven by PP&E and COVID-19 test sales. Similar to the dental end markets, we expect the physician ambulatory surgical center, alternate care home health markets to improve over time as infection levels abate and patient volumes normalize. We also have a focus on workplace health and sports medicine on both of those segments in the U.S., which is as important as employers consider cost-effective means for employee wellness. Our plans offer employers diagnostic testing support, PP&E and return-to-work consultation.
Overall, our solutions portfolio remains a focus beyond traditional medical supplies. This includes a comprehensive telemarketing platform in the medical arena, a cybersecurity solution for health care that we offer to physicians and medical practices, and a digital diabetes care initiative.
I'd like to point out that while PP&E sales have begun to moderate from recent quarterly growth levels in both Dental and Medical, both sides of the house, we anticipate that PP&E sales will remain at elevated levels as dentists and physicians implement new standards of care, new best practices as related to infection control. And so we do see this demand for PP&E products to continue, although there will be pricing deflation in several areas, but the units will continue to be relatively strong.
So now, operator, if there's any questions, we can handle them. Thank you."

Let me just add something, a comment from a macro point of view, Jeff. We're feeling pretty good about the global dental market. It's bounced back, particularly strong in some of the specialty areas, at least in our business. The only caution we have to add is, we're in the midst of a pandemic. The pandemic is not finished. We saw what -- we can see what's going on in India and a number of other parts of the world. This could all come back.
So I don't want to be a negative cloud over the dental industry or our performance as a company. But assuming things continue, assuming we do not have any major setbacks because of COVID, I remain extremely bullish about the dental markets. In particular, there is a growing understanding amongst payers that there's a direct correlation between good oral care and good health care. I expect that governments around the world will recognize this. It will be greater reimbursement for dentistry. Can't say it's going to be next quarter.
But I think we can continue to be relatively bullish about the dental market with one big footnote. No one knows where this virus is going. And that's the basis under which Steven gave guidance at a floor. And we just can't give guidance on the upside because we just don't know where this virus is going to take us.

But in the markets we're in, we're doing quite well. I think that may be, to some extent, related to Henry Schein's uniqueness in those markets.

On the Medical side, our Medical business has done well for several years in the base business, which is consumables, generally pharmaceuticals and equipment. There are a number of variables that are market or economy or public health dependent. The first is vaccinations. I'm not talking about the COVID vaccine now, I'm talking about general vaccination. The rate of visits to physician offices for these standard vaccinations is down.
I expect -- and remember, the focus for us in the vaccination area is the United States. I expect as the COVID rates go down, more people will visit the doctor's office for their traditional vaccines, and that part of the business will grow once again. It's down quite a bit right now.
The second relates to flu -- the traditional flu. We shipped our traditional flu vaccines pretty early in the cycle in 2020. It was slightly above the previous year. I think it is fair to say, all things being equal, unless something comes out in the press that it's not a good idea to have a traditional flu vaccine, I expect that, that will continue in the 2021, 2022 vaccine period -- flu vaccine period, which is generally sometime between August and October.
Then there's the flu test, the traditional flu test. This is an area where there have been -- where there's been a significant issue. And of course, it's good for the public because the traditional flu was almost nonexistent this year. So we didn't sell many tests, hardly sold any, in fact. And who knows where that's going to end up in '20 -- at the end of '21, early '22. I have to expect, as people wear less masks going towards the end of the year, as COVID mitigates further that there will be an increase in those tests and then back to '19 and '18 levels.
And then the other area is, of course, the COVID test. The price of -- firstly, we are focused on the point-of-care rapid test. I think that there will be a continued demand for those tests, but the prices have come down substantially, both for the PCR and the antigen test. So factoring all of that in, you may have some volatility in our Medical business. Having said that, the core business is doing quite well as procedures move from the acute care setting into the physician's office, into the ambulatory care centers, and expect that this will recover as the public gets confidence in returning to the physician offices for traditional visits for their vaccinations and to the ambulatory surgical centers for elective surgery."

It's very difficult, Steve, to give you precise information on where our sales are coming from. But I could make a couple of general statements. The first is that we believe that the high-touch model is most appropriate for dentists. We provide all the online capabilities that are normal -- let's say, a traditional online-only provider provides. When I say traditional, these are online providers, have not been around that many years. But whatever they can offer in terms of online purchasing, we can offer. Our prices are competitive for customers that essentially use us as a primary supplier. And recent investment in TDSC confirms that if customers want to buy only from an online supplier, it's available. We have good software there. We're doing okay in sales.
I don't see a huge switch overnight to any one sector, whether it's traditional or it's online only. Over the long run, I believe that our customers will appreciate the work that full service does. Our DSOs, obviously, are a little bit more sophisticated buyers. They understand that. This whole idea of consumables equipment, specialty products and the offering of Henry Schein One altogether is a compelling offering.
I think the part of the market that relates to discount purchasing and quotes, not necessarily at a discount price but perceived discount, will continue to be there at similar rates, maybe it'll move a few percent one way or the other. But from a Henry Schein point of view, I feel confident that we will continue to gain overall market share in our Dental business as we have had -- as we have for decades. And -- but I don't see massive shifts one way or the other.
Of course, PP&E was a unique situation. I know, from Henry Schein point of view, we were extremely conservative with the quality and the regulatory process that we went through on each PP&E product we sold. I'm not sure that was the case amongst every -- amongst the rest of the distribution channels, whether it was full service or digital only. I just don't know. But we are very, very conservative. And there were products probably that we could have bought and sold that we refused to do based on our standards. So that may have moved some product to different channels."

Specialty product businesses, both in terms of geographic expansion and a little bit more tonnage in that regard, but also to add additional features to our product lines.

We don't necessarily have every brand in the quantities we would like, but I would say that in general, there's availability of all the -- all the products we need. There are some manufacturers that have not fully come back yet to matching our purchase orders with their shipments. I would say that most manufacturers have an issue in one way or another. I don't think we felt necessarily the disruption that you may read about in the paper as it relates to certain semiconductors or whatever, chips. 
But there are some manufacturers -- I would say, across the board, there are manufacturers that don't -- can't ship everything we want. But generally, we can get products in every category. We may have to substitute, and that requires a lot of discussion with customers. I think this is one of the reasons why dentists and physicians appreciate full service distributors, because we can provide the guidance on dislocations in the marketplace.
Having said that, I still remain very concerned with the global PP&E structure. It's not fully worked out yet. Providing subsidies to build a factory in the U.S. doesn't mean that those factories are going to be operational when the prices return to pre-COVID competitive purchasing, U.S. versus global pricing. So right now, we're okay, but there is a lot of work to be done on the global PP&E and other supply chain matters."

I think across Dental and Medical in the first quarter were about $370 million. But I'd imagine that kind of run rate coming out of the quarter is less, just given your comments around pricing. So Steve, I don't know if you can maybe help us think about how much pricing has come down recently as we think about sort of the right run rate for PPE and COVID testing over the balance of the year? And can you also remind us what the margin is on those products? And how you would expect margins to change as the sales volumes moderate over the balance of the year?"

So we're optimistic that we will continue to deliver good internal growth rates, supplemented by acquisitions, adding more to our platform, driving up sales, operating margin and EPS. We're committed, as Steven noted, to continuing to buy back stock in moderation as we have for many years, a good way to return capital to our shareholders in a tax advantage way.

We are most pleased to report record second quarter financial results as we continue to execute on our key strategies. 
Strengthening demand in the Global Dental and Medical markets drove strong year-over-year increases in sales versus the prior year when a significant number of dental and medical practices suspended activity because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Notably, compared with pre-COVID-19 data, environment of the second quarter of 2019 to be specific, Henry Schein's worldwide internal sales in local currencies increased by 15.2%. So if you go back to the second quarter of 2019, you will see that Henry Schein's worldwide internal sales growth in local currencies increased by 15.2% in 2021. Again, compared to 2019. 
We are also pleased with operating margin expansion that reflects a favorable product mix as well as operating expense leverage. 
As we continue to invest in our business to supplement solid organic growth, we completed several acquisitions during the second quarter of 2021 across the Dental and Technology and Value-Added Services businesses with aggregate annual sales of approximately $60 million. 
Our capital allocation strategy also includes share repurchases as a means to deliver value to our shareholders. Steven will provide greater detail on the approximately $113 million spent in the second quarter as part of our Board-approved share repurchase authorization. 
While the number of new COVID cases has risen in certain geographies, to date, we have not seen a material impact on patient traffic. Rather, practice visits have continued to improve as offices are generally open. 
Data for the end markets we serve points to continued global improvements as economies recover across the globe. The most recent American Dental Association data shows current patient traffic at 88% of pre-pandemic levels which we believe may underrepresent volume in certain practices. We've also seen other industry survey reports that show practice volumes either consistent with or slightly better than pre-pandemic levels. 
I will also note that Henry Schein One billings associated with dental claims processing are currently above the 100% pre-pandemic levels, in line with increased restorative and dental specialty procedures which are driving greater practice purchases. 
So the overall global market recovery and our improving financial results have continued. We believe dental patient traffic in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand is close to or above to 2019 levels. And we are also seeing improving patient traffic in Canada, Europe, Brazil and Asia, with higher numbers in certain specific European countries. 
That said, end markets in certain geographies continue to face challenges due to the ongoing pandemic. 
Patient traffic in the United States physician offices and ambulatory surgical centers is improving as we approach more normalized practice operations. 
With solid execution in the first half of 2021 and a favorable outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, today, we are raising our guidance for 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations to be at or above $3.85.  Let me stress, this is representing a floor for the fiscal 2021 year. 
So we continue to monitor any potential impact to our business as a result of COVID-19, particularly as certain U.S. states and some international geographies are experiencing an uptick in diagnosed cases, especially among those unvaccinated. And we're, of course, optimistic that the vaccination rate will go up. 
With these opening comments, I'd like to hand the call over to Steven to discuss our quarterly financial performance and provide more detail on our guidance. Then I'll be back to provide additional commentary on the current business conditions in our markets and our thoughts going forward. So Steven, please."
339447,1674563836,2360652,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations on an as-reported GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis. Our second quarter non-GAAP results for 2021",2033,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations on an as-reported GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis. Our second quarter non-GAAP results for 2021 and 2020 exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release and in the supplemental information section of our Investor Relations website. 
Please note that we have again included a corporate sales category for Q2 that represents prior year sales to Covetrus under the transitional services agreement. This concluded in the fourth quarter of 2020. While the agreement has ended, these sales are still reflected in the prior year comparative results. 
In addition to these comparisons with the prior year, I will also be comparing some key metrics with Q2 of 2019, given the height of impact of the pandemic on our business occurred in Q2 of 2020. 
So turning to our financial results. Total net sales for the quarter ended June 26, 2021, were $3 billion, reflecting growth of 76.2% compared with the prior year period. Internally generated sales were up 65.5% in local currencies. And compared with the pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019, internal sales in local currencies increased 15.2%. The details of our sales performance are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings press release which was issued earlier today. Note that on Exhibit A1, it also contains details of our sales performance compared with 2019. 
On a GAAP basis, operating margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 7.09%, reflecting an increase of 753 basis points compared with the prior year and an increase of 46 basis points compared with 2019. We are pleased with our operating margin performance in the second quarter. And on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin of 7.21% increased by 671 basis points compared to the prior year and an increase of 9 basis points versus 2019. You can find a reconciliation of our GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin also in the supplemental information page of our Investor Relations website. 
Turning to taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 23.4%. That compares with only a 5.9% GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020. And on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was also 23.4%. Note that on the prior year, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was impacted by the pretax loss. A reconciliation of the GAAP effective tax rate to non-GAAP effective tax rate is available in the supplemental page also on the Investor relations page of our website. 
We expect the effective tax rate to continue in approximately the 25% range, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the remainder of the year. And of course, that assumes no changes in tax legislation. 
Moving on. GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein for the second quarter of 2021 was $155.7 million or $1.10 per diluted share. This compares with the prior year GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $11.4 million or a loss of $0.08 per diluted share. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2021 was $157.3 million or $1.11 per diluted share and this compares to non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.6 million or $0.00 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020. 
Amortization from acquired intangible assets for Q2 '21 was $30.1 million pretax or approximately $0.13 per diluted share. This compares with $24.8 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share in the same period last year. 
For the first half of 2021, amortization from acquired intangible assets was $59.8 million or $0.26 per diluted share. This compares with $51.6 million pretax or $0.23 per diluted share in the same period last year. 
I'll also note that foreign currency exchange positively impacted our Q2 2021 diluted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share. 
Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. 
Our Global Dental sales of $1.9 billion increased 102.9% compared with the same period last year, with internal sales growth of 87% in local currencies.  Compared with Q2 2019, internal sales growth in local currencies was 12.1%. 
Global Dental consumable merchandise internal sales increased by 90.5% in the second quarter of 2021 versus the same period last year. And excluding PPE and COVID-related products, the sales increased was $96.2. When comparing it to Q2 of 2019, internal sales growth in local currencies increased 13.7% or 7.9% excluding PPE and COVID-related products. 
We experienced broad-based consumer merchandise sales growth in both North America and in our international businesses, particularly in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Brazil and Asia, with solid overall sales growth compared to 2019. 
In Europe, we saw a particular strength in dental consumable merchandise sales in France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland and the U.K. 
North American dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 105% compared with the prior year and 9% compared with Q2 2019. Our North American dental consumable merchandise sales in local currencies increased 112% compared to Q2 2020 or 119% excluding PPE and COVID-related products. Again, however, compared with Q2 2019, this growth was 11.5% or 4.8% when excluding PPE and COVID-related products. 
Our North American dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies was 82% versus Q2 2020 and 0.4% versus Q2 2019. Sales growth was modest compared with the second quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting delays with certain U.S. manufacturers of chairs, units and lights, resulting in longer lead times to our customers. We also experienced softer CAD/CAM sales growth compared to the same period in 2019 as we have seen more customers recently purchased scan-only solutions versus full chairside solutions. Longer term, we believe a large number of these customers will ultimately buy a full chairside system. 
At this time, we believe the potential impact to some U.S. traditional equipment sales resulting from the supply change -- supply chain challenges will also affect the second half of 2021. Further, we believe that the Q4 impact will be greater than the Q3 impact as we expect to satisfy equipment orders with existing inventory as well as incoming inventory in the current quarter. At this time though, it's important to note we are not experiencing any meaningful lead time challenges in high-tech equipment, including imaging, handpieces and sterilizing equipment. 
Based on our view today, some traditional orders placed in Q4 for U.S. practices are more likely to be installed in the early part of 2022 due to the extended manufacturer lead times and construction delays at practices. Just as a reminder, we recognize sales for capital equipment orders at the time the equipment is installed versus when the order is placed or other times. 
International dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 64.9% versus Q2 2020 and 17% compared with Q2 2019. The international dental consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies increased 64% versus Q2 '20 or 70% excluding PPE and COVID-related products. Comparing to Q2 2019, internal consumable merchandise sales growth in local currencies was 17.2% or 12.6% excluding PPE and COVID-related products. We also reported strong equipment growth in our international markets, mainly because there were no significant manufacturer delays. 
International dental equipment internal Sales growth in local currencies was 66% compared to Q2 '20 and 16.6% compared with Q2 2019. We reported strong dental equipment growth internationally with particular solid performance in France, Italy and Australia. 
Our Global Dental specialties revenue in the second quarter was $235 million, with internal growth of 91% in local currencies versus the prior year and growth of 14.0% versus 2019. Growth in North America was 119% on year-over-year and 15.1% versus Q2 2019. 
Internationally, dental specialties internal sales growth in local currencies was also strong at 44.8% versus Q2 2020 and 11.5% versus Q2 2019. Growth was strong in each of our dental specialty categories, including implants, oral surgery, endodontic and orthodontics, with all 3 businesses doing well in both North America and internationally. 
Turning to our Global Medical sales. During Q2, they were $904.8 million, an increase of 46.5% compared with the same period last year, including internal sales growth of 43.5%. Compared with Q2 2019, internal sales growth in local currencies increased 27.2%. The internal sales growth in local currencies increased 44% in North America compared with Q2 '21 and 27.1% compared to Q2 2019, while international sales increased 15.9% versus 2020 and 31.2% versus 2019. 
Our Medical sales experienced broad-based growth compared to 2019, including growth in medical surgical equipment and laboratory product sales. Excluding PPE and COVID-related product contribution, Global Medical sales in local currencies increased 39% compared with 2020 and 7.8% compared with Q2 2019. 
I'll also note that we sold approximately $75 million in COVID-19 tests in the second quarter of 2021, and that includes our multi assay flu and COVID-19 combination test. This compares with a higher number of $180 million in test sales in the first quarter of 2021. As we previously commented, we expected COVID-19 test sales to continue to moderate. 
And while our PPE sales in both our Dental and Medical businesses have declined since the onset of COVID-19, we expect demand to remain at elevated levels. 
Technology and Value-Added sales during Q2 were $152.1 million, an increase of 44.5% compared with the prior year, including internal growth of 33% in local currencies. Internal sales growth in local currencies increased 10.1% for the same period versus 2019. 
In North America, the Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth was 30% in local currencies and 10.6% versus 2019. 
Our Henry Schein One business performed well in the second quarter, as did our financial services businesses, which was driven primarily by practice transitions revenue. 
Internationally, the Tech and Value-Added Services internal sales increased 54% versus the prior year and 6.9% compared with 2019. 
We continued to repurchase common stock in the open market during the second quarter, buying approximately 1.5 million shares at an average price of $72.98 per share, and that totaled approximately $113 million for the quarter. The impact of the repurchase of these shares on our second quarter diluted EPS was immaterial. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $400 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases. 
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We have access to significant liquidity, providing flexibility and financial stability. 
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2021 was $158.4 million. That compared to negative operating cash flow of $91.6 million for the second quarter of -- the second quarter of last year. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to increases in net income and lower investment in working capital. 
As part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we recorded a pretax charge of $604,000 in Q2 '21, and that did not have any significant impact on our earnings per share. 
I will now conclude my remarks by updating our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance. At this time, we will not be providing GAAP diluted EPS guidance as we are unable to provide without unreasonable effort an estimate of costs related to the ongoing restructuring initiative, including the corresponding tax effect. 
Once again, we are raising our guidance for 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein which we now expect to be at or above $3.85. Bear in mind, this represents a floor for guidance. This compares with the previous guidance for non-GAAP diluted EPS which was a floor of $3.70. 
Our guidance for 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is from continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions and does not include the impact of future share repurchases, potential future acquisitions, if any, or restructuring expenses. Our guidance also assumes that foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels and that end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions. The guidance also assumes there are no material adverse market changes associated with COVID-19. 
With that summary, let me now turn the call back over to Stanley."

We believe Henry Schein's leadership positions in the global dental and medical distribution businesses serve as an excellent foundation to continue to expand our wide range of value-added solutions and services as well as our",1975,"Thank you very much, Steven. We believe Henry Schein's leadership positions in the global dental and medical distribution businesses serve as an excellent foundation to continue to expand our wide range of value-added solutions and services as well as our specialty products for practitioners, including self-manufactured products. We are focused on gross profit growth, outpacing operating expense growth over the long term, as we expand our mix of high-margin products and leverage efficiencies across our business, in part through One Schein and One Distribution strategies. These strategies were discussed in the last call and happy to discuss them further on this call. 
We believe we remain on the path to achieving our increased long-term profitability goals. In fact, we are very pleased with the performance of the business all around. 
We do expect to build on our track record of continued EPS growth, compounded EPS growth, with our 103rd quarter as a public company. In fact,  looking at results for 2020, our high-margin businesses, which are comprised of Technology and Value-Added Services and the dental specialties businesses, represented approximately 12% of worldwide sales. It's already contributed over 1/3 of our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income. 
When looking at the components of our high-margin businesses, Technology and Value-Added Services, including Henry Schein One, comprised about 5% of worldwide sales in 2020 and approximately 15% of worldwide operating income. On the dental specialty side, this comprised about 7% of worldwide sales in 2020, along with approximately 20% of worldwide operating income. 
Let's go a little bit deeper into the dental distribution business. We delivered excellent dental revenue growth during the second quarter, driven by sales of both consumable merchandise and equipment and, more specifically, consumable merchandise sales in North America. And our international markets experienced double-digit growth compared with 2019. So both in North America and our international markets, we experienced double-digit growth  -- internal growth during 2019. 
Steven discussed the state of supply challenges for the U.S. traditional dental equipment business. We expect lead times to eventually normalize and would like to stress that it is important to take a look at our equipment business over a few quarters and not 1 specific quarter. So for example, in the North American market, our dental equipment local currency in the first quarter was 17.4% growth. So it is important to look at the dental equipment growth over a couple of quarters. And we remain very optimistic and actually enthusiastic about our dental business, the equipment business, in the United States, in Canada, that's our North American business, as well as globally. 
What we hear and we continue to hear from dentists is that practice revenues are improving and practitioners plan to invest in technology solutions that promote more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning and, of course, workflow efficiency. 
As noted in both North America and, to some extent, internationally, we are seeing stronger sales of stand-alone digital scanners versus the full chairside systems as dentists and dental laboratories are carefully managing capital equipment purchases while still committing to investing in digital dentistry. 
I encourage investors to remain focused on the long-term prospects, in fact, even the medium-term prospects and trends that we believe will come from advancement of the digitalization of dentistry. 
So let's take a brief look at our Dental Specialties businesses, a category which now has sales annualized at over $900 million. As Steven noted, total global specialty -- Dental Specialties performed extremely well With double-digit internal sales growth versus 2019 as we further penetrate these key dental specialty markets, both domestically and internationally. 
We also had a number of key strategic developments in each of our dental specialty product categories during the second quarter. Our implant and oral surgery businesses, which, of course, include bone regeneration, products, implants and bone regeneration products is the largest of our global dental specialty businesses, and we continue to deliver new solutions as we seek to increase share in key dental markets. 
For instance, in the U.S., we recently launched our progressive CAMLOG implants with multiunit prosthetics addressing the full arch market. 
We also expect to introduce our fusion implant solution to enhance our offering for the value price segment to the implant market. This complements our line of Medentis value implants which have been very successful, particularly in the DACH region. 
Our implant strategy is focused on providing a broad set of solutions to address various customer pricing requirements while providing high-quality clinical solutions. We believe we're in a unique spot of providing value. In other words, the price quality equation works well for dentists in many parts of the world, specifically in the U.S. and in Europe, a particular focus in the DACH region, but now also gaining a foothold in Asia as well. Each of these enhancements is underpinned by our investment in differentiated technologies for high-value, high-quality implant treatment. 
By the end of the year, we also plan to launch a new line of next-generation bone tissue augmentation material. 
So -- let me just now turn to the endodontic business, where growth in the second quarter was driven by a strong performance overall, but specifically with large accounts and sales in the international markets. Our [ cofile ] and bioceramic portfolio continues to be well received globally, with particular strength in North America and Europe. 
In the orthodontic market, we are pleased with our Reveal Clear Aligner progress as we continue to enhance our platform and expand internationally. Today, we offer aligner solutions in 26 countries and continue to broaden reach with the recent launches in France, Poland, Ireland, Italy and Spain. We are providing customers with flexibility in the choice of integrated solutions. Reveal integrates with both 3Shape and planned mecascanners and soon with the Dentsply Sirona scanners. 
Looking ahead to enhancements in our Clear Aligner development, we are preparing to launch an update to our Studio Pro software in the U.S., which will bring advanced treatment planning and visualization tools that help dentists effectively scan and treat patients, with a launch internationally in 2022. 
We are currently expanding our DDX practice to lab workflow platform with integration between Ortho2 and our Dentrix practice management Software that will stream Reveal Clear Aligner integration and enhance practice efficiency. We also expect this integration will be available for our Dentrix Ascend cloud-based software solution by the end of the year. 
In addition, this summer, we will begin supplementing our manufacturing of aligners with the new North American manufacturing facility to ensure even faster delivery times to dentists in the United States. 
And we are also working with Henry Schein One and DentalPlans.com to expand promotion to Reveal Clear Aligners to patients. The DentalPlans direct-to-consumer platform is quite effective. 
Our Global Dental Specialties businesses are seeing continued strength in high acuity procedures across many of our key markets in addition to traditional oral care procedures. 
Let me now turn to the Technology and Value-Added Services business. Sales continued to improve from early days of the pandemic when patient traffic was hardest hit. During the quarter, Henry Schein One, the largest contributor to sales in this business reported a record high quarterly revenue. In particular, we saw solid growth across the board with the Dentrix Enterprise, Dentrix Ascend, Demandforce, DentalPlans.com solutions. We are focused on migration to the cloud and our cloud-based solutions to create flexibility and scalable services. 
In the second quarter of 2021, we recorded solid growth in the adoption of Dentrix Ascend, our cloud offering, versus the second quarter of 2020 and quite a bit compared to 2019 second quarter, too. In fact, sales of Ascend increased faster than traditional Dentrix sales when compared with both periods. 
We continue to invest in analytics and patient marketing solutions to drive practice efficiency and patient engagement. And we continue to enhance our revenue cycle management capabilities. A key priority for Henry Schein One is to tightly integrate solutions so that practices have a unified solution suite and can simplify customer relations with Henry Schein. We are seeing that our customers have expanded the use of Henry Schein One patient engagement and communication technologies. 
Let me reflect on our recently announced acquisitions related to expanding our integrated Value-Added Services offering. We are extremely excited about the prospects of our eAssist, Jarvis Analytics and Dentally businesses. 
eAssist Dental Solutions is a developer of key leading virtual dental billing outsourced services that will advance our mission to offer best-in-breed solutions to help dental practices operate more efficiently and profitability. 
Jarvis develops comprehensive business analytic tools to help dental practices leverage data to diagnose problems, strengthen decision-making and improve business performance, particularly well received amongst DSOs, but also now growing amongst the midsize and smaller practices. 
And Dentally is a cloud-based practice management company that offers an extensive suite of programs and services internationally, that enable dental professionals to be more efficient and to improve the ability to deliver high-quality care to patients. 
Turning now to the performance of our Medical business during the second quarter. We were pleased with the strong double-digit internal sales growth in local currencies. Trends in the physician, ambulatory, surgery center, alternate care and home care markets all continue to improve. We believe our medical sales continue to outpace market growth. Please take a look at the sales. Excluding COVID-type products, the internal growth of almost 8% is reflective of our growth in this market. 
As expected, sales of COVID test products have continued to decline. Although let me point out that in July, we did see a boost in demand. In the second quarter, infection rates, as I'm sure everyone on this call understands, generally subsided and pricing also declined accordingly. But we are seeing somewhat of a reversal of that trend. 
Our reduction in sales of tests, COVID tests in particular, the other tests that we sell are all doing quite well. It was partially offset by sales of PP&E products as well as other consumable and merchandise equipment to our medical customers. Generally, this business is doing quite well. 
We continue to expand our Medical business beyond core distribution with a differentiated -- with differentiated solution offerings that service the low acuity segments of the market, which, of course, is the most cost-effective setting for delivery of health care. 
Our outlook for PPE demand in both Dental and Medical businesses remains unchanged. PPE sales have moderated from levels in the height of the pandemic, yet we expect demand to remain at elevated levels. While pricing will continue to moderate, we believe unit sales will be driven by new health care protocols that we do not expect will revert to lower pre-pandemic levels. We remain quite comfortable that from a unit point of view, our PPE sales will continue to remain at elevated levels. 
Before we end this call, I'd like to comment briefly on our progress with environmental, social and governance initiatives that we're undertaking, so-called ESG, area of focus for Henry Schein now for decades actually. It just wasn't called ESG when we started with these kinds of initiatives well over 3 decades ago. 
In May, we issued our latest annual sustainability report. Among a number of newly disclosed goals, we discussed our plans for compliance with Global Reporting Initiative, with the GRI, and the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board in 2022. 
The next couple of years, we also plan to report in line with the task force on climate-related financial disclosure and to establish our science-based target. 
Recently, we hosted a panel with a number of ESG investors and analysts, also supply chain experts, and we participated in a panel hosted by IR Magazine discussing our work towards a diverse and inclusive workforce. You can find videos of these events as well as our CSR report on our website. 
So operator, we are ready to answer investor questions, please. Thank you."

Firstly, we are seeing strong demand for general equipment or equipment in general. And these particular manufacturers of these chairs, units and lights are experiencing significant demand, firstly, because of the elevated demand, but also because a manufacturer in this particular sector left the market. 
We are not experiencing any significant shortages in terms of supply on imaging equipment. In fact, we're doing okay in particular with 2D. There is no issue with delivery of CAD/CAM equipment at all, whether it's the scanners or the [ mills ]. And there are no issues with hand pieces, for example. 
Sterilizers, available, may not be every brand in every quantity. But generally, that's fine. 
Again, I do want to stress that when looking at equipment sales, please take a couple of quarters into account and don't look at 1 quarter in particular. And as I pointed out, this is a U.S. issue. Canada seems to be doing okay. And Europe is fine, too. And Australia and New Zealand business, which is quite active in equipment, also has an adequate source of product."

Number two is we are passing a lot of this on to our customers. But where we see this as a short-term issue, we're not doing that.

I mean I'm not saying it is a standard of use to use a scanner, but it's close to it. And I think in certain practices, value practices, say, and higher-value practices, I think the public is expecting scan-only. They've heard about scan only from friends and relatives. So we are moving clearly in that direction. There's still a huge number of dentists that don't have scanners. And there are also a number of scanners -- dentists that have scanners that have an older version. So there is quite a movement towards scanners. And I think dentists are investing in these scanners right now. 
We are comfortable that these scanners will, at some point, turn into full chairside, including CAD/CAM, in other words, adding a mill, maybe a couple of quarters out, because dentists have a lot to spend money on now. But clearly, the chairside -- clearly, the scanner is getting a lot of focus now. And I think it's going to be the case for the foreseeable future. And the full mill program will also gain momentum. 
Now we, of course, sell a number of major brand scanners and are growing with all our major brand scanners that are 1 or 2, 1 in particular that has a significant, [ 2 ] actually market share from our point of view. They are all doing well. And there are fewer manufacturers of the machines, the chairside mills. And there, I think the market share relative between the 1 and the other of the 2 major ones we sell is about stable. 
The other area where we're seeing quite a bit of activity is with dental labs. We are the largest provider of dental laboratory products in the world and labs are clearly digitalizing as well. 
So we're quite optimistic about this category, and I wouldn't read anything into this particular quarter. This particular quarter, we happen to have a very strong quarter in scanners. But I wouldn't view that as any kind of negative outlook on full chairside mills -- systems with mills."

And in Europe, we are not experiencing these supply chain issues and our equipment business is quite strong, again, with backlog, good backlogs in both the domestic and global markets. The equipment business is doing quite well."

I guess, first, it's kind of hard to think back to Q2 2019 for the dental industry, it feels like eons ago. But just regarding the international dental equipment growth of 16.6% this quarter versus 2Q '19, like a pretty strong number given that 2Q '19 was likely a tough comparison with the IDS trade show occurring in March of that year. recall that Europe was strong in the second quarter of '19. I think Brazil was a drag for some reasons. I just want to get your quick thoughts on that comparison. 
And also related to IDS, with the trade show set to resume in September of this year, are you assuming the normal bump in international dental equipment sales in 4Q '21? Or could it be more water down just given the potential impact of COVID on the trade show dynamics?"

I don't know, Steven, whether we disclose this kind of information. But generally, 2 things. One is please understand that equipment sales can be lumpy, number one. But number two is dental equipment purchases and demand in the markets we're in is quite solid. You do reference Brazil. We did exit a part of the equipment market in Brazil. Essentially, we defocused certain manufacturers and have added other manufacturers. That was a 1- or 2-quarter issue. And our Brazil equipment are now, although not significant in the context of Henry Schein as a company, is doing quite well. 
But overall, I would say our equipment market is doing well. Dentists are investing in their practices. They want their practices to look and feel modern. Interest rates are helpful. 
Of course, when you look at all these numbers, you have to take into account tax situations. Who knows what exactly what is going to be the tax situation at the end of the -- for the fourth quarter of 2021 in the United States? 
But generally, I would look at the trend and the trend for equipment sales domestically, Canada, mix up. North America and internationally is quite solid, all around. And this particular supply chain issue will be dealt with. And these are quality manufacturers who will deal with the issue. And I expect to continue to see solid equipment growth in all categories going forward."

Germany is -- has been strong throughout this period, that have a little bit of retraction there. But overall, it's quite strong. It's our biggest market in Europe. Parallels in size and scope to our Canadian business. And it's quite solid. 
Implants have done exceptionally well during this period of time. It's very important to us. very profitable. We, I believe, sell more implants in Germany than anyone else. Our prices are reasonable, by the way. 
And France has been solid. Italy and Spain recovered. U.K. is still in the process of recovering. Other markets like the Netherlands are okay. 
But we are not fully back in terms of visits, 100% back to where we were in 2019. I think there are certain markets we are. We're close. But compared to the U.S. where we think the market -- the patient visits are, on average, a little higher than '19, the data from the ADA doesn't contemplate exactly the right measurements for practices that are over 100% compared to '19 visits. 
Brazil is -- has a high COVID rate, but we're particularly doing well. And Australia and New Zealand is pretty stable. 
But I would say in all these markets, there's still room to go, to get back to '19 outside of the U.S. And Henry Schein clearly is gaining market share. We've been working very hard in Europe for a long time and believe we have an outstanding management team in Europe and internationally as well. 
In Asia, we're growing. In Australia and New Zealand and, of course, Brazil. All with a very good management team, very stable and dynamic and excellent management team, which is driving our consumables and equipment business as well as our technology businesses. 
Our Medical business is relatively slow -- small outside of the U.S., but is growing, added to management over there and investing in the business. 
So overall, we're quite optimistic about our international business. 
Carolynne, so is that it?"

I believe we have a very good management team in place. The strategies are good. We are putting the final touches to our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan. I would say more or less in line with what we've been focused on the past few years. Of course, we had, like everyone, a bump in the road in 2020. But I would say largely recovered from that. 
Although I think it is important, as Steven outlined, to be aware that we are in the midst of a pandemic. So once that concern dissipates, I think we can even be more optimistic. But overall, the business is doing well. We're performing on our strategies. Management is highly motivated. The team, in general, is motivated.  
And the dental markets have recovered to a very large extent. And the medical markets, almost there. So we believe that the growth in the ultimate care sites, from our point of view, is the right place to be, and that's what we're focused on. And we're putting our capital to work, I think, in an intelligent way, splitting it between investments and stock repurchase. The business is throwing off a lot of cash.

We are most pleased to report record second quarter financial results as we continue to execute on our key strategies. 
Strengthening demand in the global Dental and Medical markets drove strong year-over-year increases in sales versus the prior year when a significant number of dental and medical practices suspended activity because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Notably, compared with pre-COVID-19 data, environment of the second quarter of 2019 to be specific, Henry Schein's worldwide internal sales in local currencies increased by 15.2%. So if you go back to the second quarter of 2019, you will see that Henry Schein's worldwide internal sales growth in local currencies increased by 15.2% in 2021, again, compared to 2019. We are also pleased with operating margin expansion that reflects a favorable product mix as well as operating expense leverage. 
As we continue to invest in our business to supplement solid organic growth, we completed several acquisitions during the second quarter of 2021 across the dental and Technology and Value-Added Services businesses with aggregate annual sales of approximately $60 million. 
Our capital allocation strategy also includes share repurchases as a means to deliver value to our shareholders. Steven will provide greater detail on the approximately $113 million spent in the second quarter as part of our Board-approved share repurchase authorization. 
While the number of new COVID cases has risen in certain geographies, to date, we have not seen a material impact on patient traffic. Rather, practice visits have continued to improve as offices are generally open. 
Data for the end markets we serve points to continued global improvements as economies recover across the globe. The most recent American Dental Association data shows current patient traffic at 88% of pre-pandemic levels, which we believe may underrepresent volume in certain practices. We've also seen other industry survey reports that show practice volumes either consistent with or slightly better than pre-pandemic levels. 
I will also note that Henry Schein One billings associated with dental claims processing are currently above the 100% pre-pandemic levels, in line with increased restorative and dental specialty procedures which are driving greater practice purchases. 
So the overall global market recovery and our improving financial results have continued. We believe dental patient traffic in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand is close to or above to 2019 levels. And we are also seeing improving patient traffic in Canada, Europe, Brazil and Asia, with higher numbers in certain specific European countries. That said, end markets in certain geographies continue to face challenges due to the ongoing pandemic. 
Patient traffic in the United States physician offices and ambulatory surgical centers is improving as we approach more normalized practice operations. 
With solid execution in the first half of 2021 and a favorable outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, today, we are raising our guidance for 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations to be at or above $3.85.  Let me stress, this is representing a floor for the fiscal 2021 year. 
So we continue to monitor any potential impact to our business as a result of COVID-19, particularly as certain U.S. states and some international geographies are experiencing an uptick in diagnosed cases, especially among those unvaccinated. And we're, of course, optimistic that the vaccination rate will go up. 
With these opening comments, I'd like to hand the call over to Steven to discuss our quarterly financial performance and provide more detail on our guidance. Then I'll be back to provide additional commentary on the current business conditions in our markets and our thoughts going forward. So Steven, please."

Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations on an as-reported GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis. Our second quarter non-GAAP results for 2021",2029,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations on an as-reported GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis. Our second quarter non-GAAP results for 2021 and 2020 exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release and in the Supplemental Information section of our Investor Relations website. 
Please note that we have again included a corporate sales category for Q2 that represents prior year sales to Covetrus under the transitional services agreement. This concluded in the fourth quarter of 2020. While the agreement has ended, these sales are still reflected in the prior year comparative results. 
In addition to these comparisons with the prior year, I will also be comparing some key metrics with Q2 of 2019, given the height of impact of the pandemic on our business occurred in Q2 of 2020. 
So turning to our financial results. Total net sales for the quarter ended June 26, 2021, were $3 billion, reflecting growth of 76.2% compared with the prior year period. Internally generated sales were up 65.5% in local currencies. And compared with the pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019, internal sales in local currencies increased 15.2%. The details of our sales performance are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings press release which was issued earlier today. Note that on Exhibit A-1, it also contains details of our sales performance compared with 2019. 
On a GAAP basis, operating margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 7.09%, reflecting an increase of 753 basis points compared with the prior year and an increase of 46 basis points compared with 2019. We are pleased with our operating margin performance in the second quarter. And on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin of 7.21% increased by 671 basis points compared to the prior year and an increase of 9 basis points versus 2019. You can find a reconciliation of our GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin also in the Supplemental Information page of our Investor Relations website. 
Turning to taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 23.4%. That compares with only a 5.9% GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020. And on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was also 23.4%. Note that on the prior year, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was impacted by the pretax loss. A reconciliation of the GAAP effective tax rate to non-GAAP effective tax rate is available in the supplemental page also on the Investor Relations page of our website. 
We expect the effective tax rate to continue in approximately the 25% range, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the remainder of the year. And of course, that assumes no changes in tax legislation. 
Moving on. GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein for the second quarter of 2021 was $155.7 million or $1.10 per diluted share. This compares with the prior year GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $11.4 million or a loss of $0.08 per diluted share. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2021 was $157.3 million or $1.11 per diluted share, and this compares to non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.6 million or $0.00 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020. 
Amortization from acquired intangible assets for Q2 '21 was $30.1 million pretax or approximately $0.13 per diluted share. This compares with $24.8 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share in the same period last year. 
For the first half of 2021, amortization from acquired intangible assets was $59.8 million or $0.26 per diluted share. This compares with $51.6 million pretax or $0.23 per diluted share in the same period last year. I'll also note that foreign currency exchange positively impacted our Q2 2021 diluted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share. 
Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. Our global Dental sales of $1.9 billion increased 102.9% compared with the same period last year, with internal sales growth of 87% in local currencies.  Compared with Q2 2019, internal sales growth in local currencies was 12.1%. 
Global Dental consumable merchandise internal sales increased by 90.5% in the second quarter of 2021 versus the same period last year. And excluding PPE and COVID-related products, the sales increase was 96.2%. When comparing it to Q2 of 2019, internal sales growth in local currencies increased 13.7% or 7.9% excluding PPE and COVID-related products. 
We experienced broad-based consumer merchandise sales growth in both North America and in our international businesses, particularly in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Brazil and Asia, with solid overall sales growth compared to 2019. 
In Europe, we saw a particular strength in dental consumable merchandise sales in France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, The Netherlands, Italy, Poland and the U.K. 
North American dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 105% compared with the prior year and 9% compared with Q2 2019. Our North American dental consumable merchandise sales in local currencies increased 112% compared to Q2 2020 or 119% excluding PPE and COVID-related products. Again, however, compared with Q2 2019, this growth was 11.5% or 4.8% when excluding PPE and COVID-related products. 
Our North American dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies was 82% versus Q2 2020 and 0.4% versus Q2 2019. Sales growth was modest compared with the second quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting delays with certain U.S. manufacturers of chairs, units and lights, resulting in longer lead times to our customers. We also experienced softer CAD/CAM sales growth compared to the same period in 2019 as we have seen more customers recently purchased scan-only solutions versus full chairside solutions. Longer term, we believe a large number of these customers will ultimately buy a full chairside system. 
At this time, we believe the potential impact to some U.S. traditional equipment sales resulting from the supply change -- supply chain challenges will also affect the second half of 2021. Further, we believe that the Q4 impact will be greater than the Q3 impact as we expect to satisfy equipment orders with existing inventory as well as incoming inventory in the current quarter. At this time though, it's important to note we are not experiencing any meaningful lead time challenges in high-tech equipment, including imaging, handpieces and sterilizing equipment. 
Based on our view today, some traditional orders placed in Q4 for U.S. practices are more likely to be installed in the early part of 2022 due to the extended manufacturer lead times and construction delays at practices. Just as a reminder, we recognize sales for capital equipment orders at the time the equipment is installed versus when the order is placed or other times. 
International dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 64.9% versus Q2 2020 and 17% compared with Q2 2019. The international dental consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies increased 64% versus Q2 '20 or 70% excluding PPE and COVID-related products. Comparing to Q2 2019, internal consumable merchandise sales growth in local currencies was 17.2% or 12.6% excluding PPE and COVID-related products. We also reported strong equipment growth in our international markets, mainly because there were no significant manufacturer delays. 
International dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies was 66% compared to Q2 '20 and 16.6% compared with Q2 2019. We reported strong dental equipment growth internationally with particular solid performance in France, Italy and Australia. 
Our global Dental specialties revenue in the second quarter was $235 million, with internal growth of 91% in local currencies versus the prior year and growth of 14.0% versus 2019. Growth in North America was 119% year-over-year and 15.1% versus Q2 2019. 
Internationally, dental specialties' internal sales growth in local currencies was also strong at 44.8% versus Q2 2020 and 11.5% versus Q2 2019. Growth was strong in each of our dental specialty categories, including implants, oral surgery, endodontics and orthodontics, with all 3 businesses doing well in both North America and internationally. 
Turning to our global Medical sales. During Q2, they were $904.8 million, an increase of 46.5% compared with the same period last year, including internal sales growth of 43.5%. Compared with Q2 2019, internal sales growth in local currencies increased 27.2%. The internal sales growth in local currencies increased 44% in North America compared with Q2 '21 (sic) [ Q2 '20 ] and 27.1% compared to Q2 2019, while international sales increased 15.9% versus 2020 and 31.2% versus 2019. 
Our Medical sales experienced broad-based growth compared to 2019, including growth in medical-surgical equipment and laboratory product sales. Excluding PPE and COVID-related product contribution, global Medical sales in local currencies increased 39% compared with 2020 and 7.8% compared with Q2 2019. 
I'll also note that we sold approximately $75 million in COVID-19 tests in the second quarter of 2021, and that includes our multi-assay flu and COVID-19 combination tests. This compares with a higher number of $180 million in test sales in the first quarter of 2021. As we previously commented, we expected COVID-19 test sales to continue to moderate. And while our PPE sales in both our Dental and Medical businesses have declined since the onset of COVID-19, we expect demand to remain at elevated levels. 
Technology and Value-Added sales during Q2 were $152.1 million, an increase of 44.5% compared with the prior year, including internal growth of 33% in local currencies. Internal sales growth in local currencies increased 10.1% for the same period versus 2019.  In North America, the Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth was 30% in local currencies and 10.6% versus 2019. 
Our Henry Schein One business performed well in the second quarter, as did our financial services businesses, which was driven primarily by practice transitions revenue. 
Internationally, the Tech and Value-Added Services internal sales increased 54% versus the prior year and 6.9% compared with 2019. 
We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the second quarter, buying approximately 1.5 million shares at an average price of $72.98 per share, and that totaled approximately $113 million for the quarter. The impact of the repurchase of these shares on our second quarter diluted EPS was immaterial. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $400 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases. 
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We have access to significant liquidity, providing flexibility and financial stability. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2021 was $158.4 million. That compared to negative operating cash flow of $91.6 million for the second quarter of last year. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to increases in net income and lower investment in working capital. 
As part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we recorded a pretax charge of $604,000 in Q2 '21, and that did not have any significant impact on our earnings per share. 
I will now conclude my remarks by updating our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance. At this time, we will not be providing GAAP diluted EPS guidance as we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, an estimate of costs related to the ongoing restructuring initiative, including the corresponding tax effect. 
Once again, we are raising our guidance for 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein, which we now expect to be at or above $3.85. Bear in mind, this represents a floor for guidance. This compares with the previous guidance for non-GAAP diluted EPS which was a floor of $3.70. 
Our guidance for 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is from continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions and does not include the impact of future share repurchases, potential future acquisitions, if any, or restructuring expenses. Guidance also assumes that foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels and that end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions. The guidance also assumes there are no material adverse market changes associated with COVID-19. 
With that summary, let me now turn the call back over to Stanley."

We believe Henry Schein's leadership positions in the global Dental and Medical distribution businesses serve as an excellent foundation to continue to expand our wide range of value-added solutions and services as well as our",1968,"Thank you very much, Steven. We believe Henry Schein's leadership positions in the global Dental and Medical distribution businesses serve as an excellent foundation to continue to expand our wide range of value-added solutions and services as well as our specialty products for practitioners, including self-manufactured products. We are focused on gross profit growth, outpacing operating expense growth over the long term, as we expand our mix of high-margin products and leverage efficiencies across our business, in part through One Schein and One Distribution strategies. These strategies were discussed in the last call and happy to discuss them further on this call. 
We believe we remain on the path to achieving our increased long-term profitability goals. In fact, we are very pleased with the performance of the business all around. 
We do expect to build on our track record of continued EPS growth, compounded EPS growth, with our 103rd quarter as a public company. In fact,  looking at results for 2020, our high-margin businesses, which are comprised of Technology and Value-Added Services and the dental specialties businesses, represented approximately 12% of worldwide sales. It's already contributed over 1/3 of our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income. 
When looking at the components of our high-margin businesses, Technology and Value-Added Services, including Henry Schein One, comprised about 5% of worldwide sales in 2020 and approximately 15% of worldwide operating income. On the dental specialty side, this comprised about 7% of worldwide sales in 2020, along with approximately 20% of worldwide operating income. 
Let's go a little bit deeper into the dental distribution business. We delivered excellent dental revenue growth during the second quarter, driven by sales of both consumable merchandise and equipment and, more specifically, consumable merchandise sales in North America. And our international markets experienced double-digit growth compared with 2019. So both in North America and our international markets, we experienced double-digit growth, internal growth during 2019. 
Steven discussed the state of supply challenges for the U.S. traditional dental equipment business. We expect lead times to eventually normalize and would like to stress that it is important to take a look at our equipment business over a few quarters and not 1 specific quarter. So for example, in the North American market, our dental equipment local currency in the first quarter was 17.4% growth. So it is important to look at the dental equipment growth over a couple of quarters. And we remain very optimistic and actually enthusiastic about our dental business, the equipment business, in the United States, in Canada, that's our North American business as well as globally. 
What we hear and we continue to hear from dentists is that practice revenues are improving and practitioners plan to invest in technology solutions that promote more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning and, of course, workflow efficiency. 
As noted in both North America and, to some extent, internationally, we are seeing stronger sales of stand-alone digital scanners versus the full chairside systems as dentists and dental laboratories are carefully managing capital equipment purchases while still committing to investing in digital dentistry. 
I encourage investors to remain focused on the long-term prospects, in fact, even the medium-term prospects and trends that we believe will come from advancement of the digitalization of dentistry. 
So let's take a brief look at our dental specialties businesses, a category which now has sales annualized at over $900 million. As Steven noted, total global specialty -- dental specialties performed extremely well with double-digit internal sales growth versus 2019 as we further penetrate these key dental specialty markets, both domestically and internationally. 
We also had a number of key strategic developments in each of our dental specialty product categories during the second quarter. Our implant and oral surgery businesses, which of course, include bone regeneration,products, implants and bone regeneration products is the largest of our global dental specialty businesses, and we continue to deliver new solutions as we seek to increase share in key dental markets. 
For instance, in the U.S., we recently launched our progressive Camlog implants with multiunit prosthetics addressing the full-arch market. 
We also expect to introduce our Fusion implant solution to enhance our offering for the value price segment to the implant market. This complements our line of Medentis value implants which have been very successful, particularly in the DACH region. 
Our implant strategy is focused on providing a broad set of solutions to address various customer pricing requirements while providing high-quality clinical solutions. We believe we're in a unique spot of providing value. In other words, the price quality equation works well for dentists in many parts of the world, specifically in the U.S. and in Europe, a particular focus in the DACH region, but now also gaining a foothold in Asia as well. Each of these enhancements is underpinned by our investment in differentiated technologies for high-value, high-quality implant treatment. By the end of the year, we also plan to launch a new line of next-generation bone tissue augmentation material. 
So -- let me just now turn to the endodontic business, where growth in the second quarter was driven by a strong performance overall, but specifically with large accounts and sales in the international markets. Our core file and bioceramic portfolio continues to be well received globally, with particular strength in North America and Europe. 
In the orthodontic market, we are pleased with our Reveal Clear Aligner progress as we continue to enhance our platform and expand internationally. Today, we offer aligner solutions in 26 countries and continue to broaden reach with the recent launches in France, Poland, Ireland, Italy and Spain. We are providing customers with flexibility in their choice of integrated solutions. Reveal integrates with both 3Shape and Planmeca scanners and soon with the Dentsply Sirona scanners. 
Looking ahead to enhancements in our clear aligner development. We are preparing to launch an update to our Studio Pro software in the U.S., which will bring advanced treatment planning and visualization tools that help dentists effectively scan and treat patients, with a launch internationally in 2022. 
We are currently expanding our DDX practice to lab workflow platform with integration between Ortho2 and our Dentrix practice management Software that will stream Reveal Clear Aligner integration and enhance practice efficiency. We also expect this integration will be available for our Dentrix Ascend cloud-based software solution by the end of the year. 
In addition, this summer, we will begin supplementing our manufacturing of aligners with the new North American manufacturing facility to ensure even faster delivery times to dentists in the United States. 
And we are also working with Henry Schein One and DentalPlans.com to expand promotion of Reveal Clear Aligners to patients. The DentalPlans' direct-to-consumer platform is quite effective. 
Our global dental specialties businesses are seeing continued strength in high-acuity procedures across many of our key markets in addition to traditional oral care procedures. 
Let me now turn to the Technology and Value-Added Services business. Sales continued to improve from early days of the pandemic when patient traffic was hardest hit. During the quarter, Henry Schein One, the largest contributor to sales in this business reported a record-high quarterly revenue. In particular, we saw solid growth across the board with the Dentrix Enterprise, Dentrix Ascend, Demandforce, DentalPlans.com solutions. We are focused on migration to the cloud and our cloud-based solutions to create flexibility and scalable services. 
In the second quarter of 2021, we recorded solid growth in the adoption of Dentrix Ascend, our cloud offering, versus the second quarter of 2020 and quite a bit compared to 2019 second quarter, too. In fact, sales of Ascend increased faster than traditional Dentrix sales when compared with both periods. 
We continue to invest in analytics and patient marketing solutions to drive practice efficiency and patient engagement, and we continue to enhance our revenue cycle management capabilities. A key priority for Henry Schein One is to tightly integrate solutions so that practices have a unified solution suite and can simplify customer relations with Henry Schein. We are seeing that our customers have expanded the use of Henry Schein One patient engagement and communication technologies. 
Let me reflect on our recently announced acquisitions related to expanding our integrated Value-Added Services offering. We are extremely excited about the prospects of our eAssist, Jarvis Analytics and Dentally businesses. 
eAssist Dental Solutions is a developer of key leading virtual dental billing outsourced services that will advance our mission to offer best-in-breed solutions to help dental practices operate more efficiently and profitability. 
Jarvis develops comprehensive business analytic tools to help dental practices leverage data to diagnose problems, strengthen decision-making and improve business performance, particularly well received amongst DSOs, but also now growing amongst the midsize and smaller practices. 
And Dentally is a cloud-based practice management company that offers an extensive suite of programs and services internationally, that enable dental professionals to be more efficient and to improve the ability to deliver high-quality care to patients. 
Turning now to the performance of our Medical business during the second quarter. We were pleased with the strong double-digit internal sales growth in local currencies. Trends in the physician, ambulatory, surgery center, alternate care and home care markets all continue to improve. We believe our medical sales continue to outpace market growth. Please take a look at the sales. Excluding COVID-type products, the internal growth of almost 8% is reflective of our growth in this market. 
As expected, sales of COVID test products have continued to decline. Although let me point out that in July, we did see a boost in demand. In the second quarter, infection rates, as I'm sure everyone on this call understands, generally subsided and pricing also declined accordingly. But we are seeing somewhat of a reversal of that trend. 
Our reduction in sales of tests, COVID tests in particular, the other tests that we sell are all doing quite well. It was partially offset by sales of PP&E products as well as other consumable and merchandise equipment to our medical customers. Generally, this business is doing quite well. 
We continue to expand our Medical business beyond core distribution with a differentiated -- with differentiated solution offerings that service the low-acuity segments of the market, which of course, is the most cost-effective setting for delivery of health care. 
Our outlook for PPE demand in both Dental and Medical businesses remains unchanged. PPE sales have moderated from levels in the height of the pandemic, yet we expect demand to remain at elevated levels. While pricing will continue to moderate, we believe unit sales will be driven by new health care protocols that we do not expect will revert to lower pre-pandemic levels. We remain quite comfortable that from a unit point of view, our PPE sales will continue to remain at elevated levels. 
Before we end this call, I'd like to comment briefly on our progress with environmental, social and governance initiatives that we're undertaking, so-called ESG, area of focus for Henry Schein now for decades actually. It just wasn't called ESG when we started with these kinds of initiatives well over 3 decades ago. 
In May, we issued our latest annual sustainability report. Among a number of newly disclosed goals, we discussed our plans for compliance with Global Reporting Initiative, with the GRI, and the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board in 2022. 
The next couple of years, we also plan to report in line with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and to establish our science-based target. 
Recently, we hosted a panel with a number of ESG investors and analysts, also supply chain experts, and we participated in a panel hosted by IR Magazine discussing our work towards a diverse and inclusive workforce. You can find videos of these events as well as our CSR report on our website. 
So operator, we are ready to answer investor questions, please. Thank you."

So the manufacturers that we're buying from in North America are generally different for traditional equipment than internationally. So the delays that we're seeing from the traditional manufacturers of chairs, delivery units and lights are impacted in North America and not internationally because of that. 
It's hard to tell, John, whether -- how long this will take to be rectified by the manufacturers. It's related to raw materials that they're buying. We did say that we expect it to continue for the second half of this year, but it's really hard to tell. Stanley, do you want to add any more color to that?"

Let me just be clear that this relates to 1 sector and relates to U.S. manufacturers, 3 in particular, manufacturers of units, chairs and lights. 
Firstly, we are seeing strong demand for general equipment or equipment in general. And these particular manufacturers of these chairs, units and lights are experiencing significant demand, firstly, because of the elevated demand, but also because a manufacturer in this particular sector left the market. 
We are not experiencing any significant shortages in terms of supply on imaging equipment. In fact, we're doing okay in particular with 2D. There is no issue with delivery of CAD/CAM equipment at all, whether it's the scanners or the mills. And there are no issues with handpieces, for example. Sterilizers, available, may not be every brand in every quantity. But generally, that's fine. 
Again, I do want to stress that when looking at equipment sales, please take a couple of quarters into account and don't look at 1 quarter in particular. And as I pointed out, this is a U.S. issue. Canada seems to be doing okay. And Europe is fine, too. And Australia and New Zealand business, which is quite active in equipment, also has an adequate source of product."

So I know it's a lot to throw you in moving parts, but just directionally, can you elaborate on if the GMs are flat to up in the back half, why would we see sort of such an amount of deleverage in the OpEx line, especially relative to pre-pandemic levels?

Number two is we are passing a lot of this on to our customers. But where we see this as a short-term issue, we're not doing that. So we're not super worried, but there is some pressure here due to the supply chain not quite being back to where it was in 2019. Container costs are up. As I said, overtime is being incurred by manufacturers. 
So I don't think it's alarming at this point. And if it were sustained, we, of course, pass it on to our customers, but also work with manufacturers to contain this increase in costs."

And then do you sense the demand from dentists is at all being influenced by product positioning and promotions being offered by those manufacturers?"

I'm not saying it is a standard of use to use a scanner, but it's close to it. And I think in certain practices, value practices, say, and higher-value practices, I think the public is expecting scan only. They've heard about scan only from friends and relatives. So we are moving clearly in that direction. There's still a huge number of dentists that don't have scanners. And there are also a number of scanners -- dentists that have scanners that have an older version. So there is quite a movement towards scanners. And I think dentists are investing in these scanners right now. 
We are comfortable that these scanners will, at some point, turn into full chairside, including CAD/CAM, in other words, adding a mill maybe a couple of quarters out, because dentists have a lot to spend money on now. But clearly, the chairside -- clearly, the scanner is getting a lot of focus now. And I think it's going to be the case for the foreseeable future. And the full mill program will also gain momentum. 
Now we, of course, sell a number of major brand scanners and are growing with all our major brand scanners that are 1 or 2, 1 in particular that has a [ significance to actually ] market share from our point of view. They are all doing well. And there are fewer manufacturers of the machines, the chairside mills. And there, I think the market share relative between the 1 and the other of the 2 major ones we sell is about stable. 
The other area where we're seeing quite a bit of activity is with dental labs. We are the largest provider of dental laboratory products in the world and labs are clearly digitalizing as well. 
So we're quite optimistic about this category, and I wouldn't read anything into this particular quarter. This particular quarter, we happen to have a very strong quarter in scanners. But I wouldn't view that as any kind of negative outlook on full chairside mills -- systems with mills."

Our backlog both in the United States or in North America and internationally is very strong. There is a bit -- as I noted, there's 1 manufacturer that left the market in chairs, units and lights. That capacity had to be filled. Plus there is a demand in product. Dentists are investing in their practices. And so I see this as a demand increase coupled with a void that had to get filled, in particular with chairs, units and lights. But I wouldn't read anything else beyond that. And we are very, very comfortable with our equipment business, which is doing quite well with small practices, midsized practices and, of course, with the DSOs that are also investing heavily. 
So I won't read more into that than that. I'm referring to chairs, units, lights doing well. The imaging doing well, in particular, the 2D. And on CAD/CAM, at least for the last quarter, the scanners did well compared to the full. But I think, overall, the full will also pick up. And in Europe, we are not experiencing these supply chain issues and our equipment business is quite strong, again, with backlog, good backlogs in both the domestic and global markets.

But just regarding the international dental equipment growth of 16.6% this quarter versus 2Q '19, seems like a pretty strong number given that 2Q '19 was likely a tough comparison with the IDS trade show occurring in March of that year. Recall that Europe was strong in the second quarter of '19. I think Brazil was a drag for some reasons. I just want to get your quick thoughts on that comparison. 
And also related to IDS, with the trade show set to resume in September of this year, are you assuming the normal bump in international dental equipment sales in 4Q '21? Or could it be more water down just given the potential impact of COVID on the trade show dynamics?"

But number two is dental equipment purchases and demand in the markets we're in is quite solid. You do reference Brazil. We did exit a part of the equipment market in Brazil. Essentially, we defocused certain manufacturers and have added other manufacturers. That was a 1- or 2-quarter issue. And our Brazil equipment are now, although not significant in the context of Henry Schein as a company, is doing quite well. 
But overall, I would say our equipment market is doing well. Dentists are investing in their practices. They want their practices to look and feel modern. Interest rates are helpful. 
Of course, when you look at all these numbers, you have to take into account tax situations. Who knows what exactly what is going to be the tax situation at the end of the -- for the fourth quarter of 2021 in the United States? 
But generally, I would look at the trend and the trend for equipment sales domestically, Canada, mix up. North America and internationally is quite solid all around.

Germany is -- has been strong throughout this period, that have a little bit of retraction there. But overall, it's quite strong. It's our biggest market in Europe. Parallels in size and scope to our Canadian business. And it's quite solid. 
Implants have done exceptionally well during this period of time. It's very important to us. Very profitable. We, I believe, sell more implants in Germany than anyone else. Our prices are reasonable, by the way. 
And France has been solid. Italy and Spain recovered. U.K. is still in the process of recovering. Other markets like the Netherlands are okay. 
But we are not fully back in terms of visits, 100% back to where we were in 2019. I think there are certain markets we are. We're close. But compared to the U.S. where we think the market -- the patient visits are, on average, a little higher than '19, the data from the ADA doesn't contemplate exactly the right measurements for practices that are over 100% compared to '19 visits. 
Brazil is -- has a high COVID rate, but we're particularly doing well. And Australia and New Zealand is pretty stable. 
But I would say in all these markets, there's still room to go, to get back to '19 outside of the U.S. And Henry Schein clearly is gaining market share. We've been working very hard in Europe for a long time and believe we have an outstanding management team in Europe and internationally as well. 
In Asia, we're growing, in Australia and New Zealand and, of course, Brazil. All with a very good management team, I'd say very stable and dynamic and excellent management team, which is driving our consumables and equipment business as well as our technology businesses. 
Our Medical business is relatively slow -- small outside of the U.S., but is growing, added to management over there and investing in the business.

I would say more or less in line with what we've been focused on for the past few years. Of course, we had, like everyone, a bump in the road in 2020. But I would say largely recovered from that. 
Although I think it is important, as Steven outlined, to be aware that we are in the midst of a pandemic. So once that concern dissipates, I think we can even be more optimistic. But overall, the business is doing well. We're performing on our strategies. Management is highly motivated. The team, in general, is motivated.  
And the dental markets have recovered to a very large extent. And the medical markets, almost there. So we believe that the growth in the ultimate care sites, from our point of view, is the right place to be, and that's what we're focused on.

And of course, thank you for all you've done for the company over the last [indiscernible] years. 
So good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. Really, really happy today to report record third quarter financial results, driven by a keen focus on execution by the team. And the team has done a remarkable job since the virus -- the pandemic started back in March of 2020. And of course, there was a steady patient traffic pattern during this quarter, which also contributed to the very good and actually the excellent results. And we have excellent momentum across the entire company. 
So if we compare the results of sales a year ago, Henry Schein's worldwide internal sales that's in local currencies increased a robust 7.2%. But what's really important, if you exclude the sales of PP&E and COVID-19-related products, results are up 6.3%. That's the internal sales growth in local currencies. We believe that patient traffic was generally similar to the previous quarter for our customers, that's in the United States and globally, small adjustments in different parts of the world, but not material. And definitely, the pattern is improving for our medical customers. We mentioned in previous calls that business to physician offices had gone down compared to '19 and definitely in ambulatory surgical centers as well. We see this traffic as increasing again. 
In mid-September, we announced important changes to our senior distribution business leadership structure. And let me comment on these changes before I review the third quarter performance for each of our business groups or actually Steven will do that first and then I'll provide additional comments later. 
We have been pursuing an umbrella strategy which we internally refer to as One Distribution as part of the continuous operational improvement of Henry Schein as a company. 
More tightly the strategy of One Distribution more tightly integrates the management of our distribution businesses globally. Our newly announced structure, which we've been working on for about 18 months, seek to harness the benefits of consolidating the management of Henry Schein Dental and Medical distribution businesses in 2 regions, 2 geographies: North America, and the rest of the world, international. 
One distribution, will better position our management team to leverage functions, talent, processes, and yes, systems across Henry Schein's global distribution businesses. These changes are designed and expected to accelerate improved efficiency. And of course, that's been a goal of Henry Schein for decades to improve efficiency, but we're really focused on it now more than ever and actually doing a pretty good job at that. But I believe that this new management structure will advance our efficiency as an organization globally, but also. And quite importantly, the new structure will allow us to enhance the customer experience by operating in a more efficient manner. There's just no question that COVID -- this period, this COVID period has increased customers' expectations on the customer experience, and we are committed to fulfilling those expectations. In fact, exceeding them. 
Furthermore, these changes recognize the fact that medicine and dentistry are both part of the tariff continuum. And we've been talking about this for years as well, but it's really coming much closer together, the notion that medicine and dentistry are aligned in prevention and wellness. And today, we have a small, but nevertheless, increase in the amount of overlap between the 2 customer sets. We're starting to see practices emerge that are servicing both sides, the industry and medicine. We're starting to see our electronic medical records in dental schools for dentistry and practices starting to connect in an interoperable way with medical records. 
So this whole notion of the integration of Oral Care and Medicine is advancing, and we are aligned in this whole area of wellness and prevention, which is so important to providing better quality of care at a more competitive price or a lower price so-called value health care chain. 
Now our software Specialty Products and practice services businesses are also reflective of Henry Schein's longstanding commitment to help customers operate more efficient practices and support clinical care. We are continuing to sharpen our focus on these faster-growing and higher-margin markets through organic growth, and as you'll hear later already through some very interesting strategic acquisitions which we made just this year, and we will add to that. The whole notion that software, specialty products and practice service activities, those 3 business areas align with our 1 distribution strategy, different management teams, different focus. The whole idea is to provide better customer service while at the same time driving up our margins, our operating margins as well. 
Our customers increasingly rely upon Henry Schein's comprehensive offering of innovative solutions and services, along with our distribution network for their continued success in what is clearly a much more digital world than we went into in March of 2020. We believe we have a most accomplished leader team in place in our businesses across the world, both on the distribution side and in the software Specialty Products and practice services businesses side. They're ready to satisfy the needs of our customers, improve the experience, drive down costs and at the same time, therefore, provide an increased operating income and so create shareholder value. With these opening comments, I'd like to hand the call over to Steven discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance, which we are now providing for the remainder of 2021 and yes, for 2022 as well. Then I'll provide some additional commentary on the current business conditions and our markets. Steven, please?"
339447,1685545536,2421340,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our third quarter non-GAAP results for 20",1898,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our third quarter non-GAAP results for 2021 and 2020 and exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release as well as in the supplemental information section of our Investor Relations website. 
Please note that we have, again, included a corporate sales category for Q3 that represents the prior year sales to Covetrus under the transition services agreement, which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2020. While the agreement has ended, these sales are still reflected in the prior year comparative results. 
Turning now to our financial results. Total net sales for the quarter ended September 25, 2021, with $3.2 billion, reflecting growth of 11.9% compared with the prior year period. Internally generated sales were up 7.2% in local currencies, and you can again see the details of our sales performance in Exhibit A of the earnings press release that was issued earlier this morning. 
On a GAAP basis, our operating margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 6.63% and that's relatively flat that represents an increase of 2 basis points compared with the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin of 6.63% for the third quarter of 2021, that represents a decrease of 22 basis points compared with the prior year. Again, a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin can be found in the supplemental information page on our website. 
The year-over-year decline is due to higher expenses this quarter compared with Q3 2020, which reflected temporary expense reduction initiatives we put in place last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by gross margin expansion compared with Q3 2020, mainly as a result of lower inventory adjustments in the current quarter. 
Turning to our taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 23.9%. This compares with a 16.4% GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was also 23.9% and that compared with 16.7% in the third quarter of last year. 
Remember, our prior year tax rate was favorably impacted by U.S. federal income tax settlement, which lowered income tax expenses by approximately $15.6 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Again, this is the prior year taxes. Excluding this impact, the effective tax rate last year would have been in the 25% range for both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. You can also see the reconciliation of GAAP effective tax rate to non-GAAP effective tax rate on the Investor Relations page on our website. We expect our effective tax rate to continue to be in the 25% base range on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter. And of course, that assumes no changes in tax legislation. 
Moving on, GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein for the third quarter of 2021 was $162.3 million or $1.15 per diluted share and included a gain on sale of an equity investment of $0.05 per diluted share. This compares with the prior year GAAP net income continued GAAP net income from continuing operations of $141.7 million or $0.99 per share. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations for the current year was $154.8 million or $1.10 per diluted share, and that compares to net income from continuing operations of $147 million or $1.03 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020. 
Amortization from acquired intangible assets for Q3 2021 was $30.5 million pretax or $0.13 per diluted share. This compares with $25.2 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share for the third quarter of last year. 
And for the 9 months, our amortization acquired intangible assets was $90.3 million, pretax or $0.40 per diluted share and this compares with $76.8 million pretax or $0.34 per diluted share for the same period last year. 
I'll also note that foreign currency exchange positively impact our Q3 2021 diluted EPS and by approximately $0.01 per share. 
Let me now provide some additional detail on our sales results for the third quarter. Our global dental sales of $1.8 billion increased 10.5% compared with the same period last year. with internal sales growth of 5.2% in local currencies. 
Global Dental merchandise internal sales increased by 2.9% in local currencies for the third quarter of 2021 versus the same period last year. And if we were to exclude PPE and COVID-19 related products, internal sales growth in local currencies increased by 4.8%. 
Our North American dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.7% compared with Q3 2020, which is attributable primarily to stable merchandise growth and solid equipment growth. 
Our North American dental consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies was 3.9% with Q3 2020 or 5.7% when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-related items. 
If we look at our North American dental equipment, the internal sales growth in local currencies was 7.8% versus Q3 2020 with growth reflecting strong sales of high-technology equipment and modest growth of traditional equipment sales, which remain impacted by equipment manufacturing and office construction delays. 
Q3 sales of high-tech equipment was helped by DS World this year as this year's event was more impactful than the virtual event held in 2020. 
U.S. manufacturers of traditional equipment in North America, expect to continue to see delays until the second half of 2022. The pipeline for equipment orders remained strong, and we regard this delayed equipment installations into next year as a timing issue rather than any decrease in demand. 
DS World also has contributed to our strong backlog of orders going into the fourth quarter. 
Just as a reminder, we recognize sales for equipment and capital equipment orders at the time the equipment is installed rather than when the order is placed. 
Our international dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 5.9% versus Q3 of 2020. Our international dental consumable merchandise sales in local currencies increased 1% versus Q3 2020 or 3.5% growth, excluding PPE and COVID-related products. 
We also reported strong quarter sales growth of 28.1% in our international markets, which are not experiencing any supply chain issues of any significance at this time. 
In local currencies, internal sales increased 23.9% compared with Q3 2020. Our sales of dental specialty products was approximately $225 million in the third quarter with internal growth of 10.3% in local currencies versus the prior year. 
In North America, Internal sales growth in local currencies grew 8.5% over Q3 2020, and I'll note that Q3 2020 was also a strong quarter. And internationally, internal sales of dental specialty products grew at 15.3% in local currencies. 
Growth was strong in each of our dental specialty categories, namely oral surgery, implants, bone regeneration, endodontics, orthodontics, with all of these businesses doing well in both North America and internationally. 
Our global medical sales during Q3 was $1.2 billion and increased 15.5% compared with the same period last year. Internal sales growth was 13.1% in local currencies. Our internal sales growth increased 13.6% in North America versus the prior year, while international sales of our Medical business declined 7.5% year-over-year. 
North American medical sales experienced particularly strong growth across the board versus the third quarter of last year, including growth in COVID-19 test kits, equipment, laboratory product sales and pharmaceuticals. 
If you were to exclude PPE and COVID-related products, global Medical internal sales growth in local currencies increased 8.3% versus Q3 2020. 
I'll also note, we sold approximately $206 million in COVID-19 test kits in the third quarter of 2021. That includes about $28 million in multi-assay flu and COVID-19 combination test. This compares with $75 million in test kits in the second quarter of this year and $180 million in the first quarter of 2021. 
The increase in test kits was the result of the surge in demand related to the Delta variant, and we expect sales of test kits to moderate from these levels in the upcoming quarters. 
Technology and Value-Added Services sales during Q3 were $168.6 million, an increase of $21.9 million compared with the prior year, and that includes internal growth of 6.3% in local currencies. 
In North America, Tech and Value-Added Services internal sales growth was 5% in local currencies and this growth was primarily driven by Henry Schein One's Dentrix Ascend subscriptions as well as Dentrix technical support revenue and our practice services value-added businesses. 
Internationally, Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales increased by 15.3% in local currencies compared with the prior year, driven primarily by Henry Schein One with particular strength in software excellence business driven by the reopening in the U.K. 
We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the third quarter, buying approximately 650,000 shares at an average price of $76.77 per share for a total expenditure of approximately $50 million. 
The impact of these repurchases of shares in the third quarter was immaterial to diluted EPS. I'll also note, at the end of the quarter, Henry Schein had approximately $350 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases. 
If you take a look at our balance sheet, as well as cash flow, we have access to significant liquidity, providing flexibility and financial stability. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2021 was $211.2 million, and that compared to $261.3 million for the third quarter of last year. 
I'll note also as part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we have a small pretax credit in Q3 2021 of $175,000 and of course, that did not have a material impact on our diluted EPS. 
I'll conclude my remarks by updating our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance as well as introducing 2022 guidance. 
At this time, we are not providing 2021 GAAP diluted EPS guidance as we were unable to provide without unreasonable effort and estimated costs related to the ongoing restructuring initiative including the corresponding tax effect. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect EPS from continuing operations to be $4.27 to $4.35, reflecting a 44% to 46% growth for 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations. 
Turning to next year, we are introducing preliminary guidance for 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations. Also at this time, we're not providing guidance for 2022 GAAP diluted EPS for the same reason as we are unable to provide without unreasonable estimate and estimate of restructuring costs for 2021 and 2022 as well as the corresponding tax impact. 
We expect growth in 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the mid- to high single digits over 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations. 
Our guidance for both 2021 and 2022, non-GAAP diluted EPS is for current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of future share repurchases, potential future acquisitions, if any, or restructuring expenses. Guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels that the end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions, and there are no material adverse market changes associated with COVID-19. 
With that summary, let me turn the call back over to Stanley."

So let's provide some thoughts on each of our businesses. Third quarter dental revenue growth was solid, as you heard.

So let's provide some thoughts on each of our businesses. Third quarter dental revenue growth was solid, as you heard. Overall gains in consumable merchandise and equipment sales in North America and international markets reflect the continuing recovery. And as noted, this is coupled with key focus on execution by Team Schein. 
North American dental consumable merchandise internal growth in local currencies with and without PP&E and COVID-19-related products also was quite solid in the third quarter. Consumable merchandise sales continue to improve, which we believe was bolstered by a steady flow of patient traffic. 
Here in the U.S., the most recent American Dental Association data shows patient traffic is currently at about 90% of pre-pandemic levels, and Henry Schein One billings associated with general claims processing are, once again, about 100% and of pre-pandemic levels, a little over. These statistics are similar to those we reported in the second quarter, and we believe the market to be sequentially stable dropping slightly through improvement. Similar kind of data around the world. Some countries are a little ahead, some a little behind, but on balance, pretty stable on the dental side. You may recall that many of the international markets we serve posted a quick recover in sales and consumable merchandise in the third quarter of last year when we recorded at that time, record sales. This comparison resulted in slightly lower sales growth than we have seen in prior quarters. Most markets are back to normal, as I noted, with some modest weakness in the U.K., although it is better. And in Australia and New Zealand for a very short period of time to the main cities were on lockdown. But the market, the lockdown has been largely lifted and Australian and New Zealand are back to normal right now. But we had a dip in the third quarter. 
Last quarter, we discussed some of the delivery and installation delays facing the U.S. traditional dental equipment business. Overall, our equipment business is performing very well. and equipment demand is strong. As demonstrated by the third quarter sales we are reporting today, we expect the impact of those delays to be pronounced in the fourth quarter with manufacturing lead times returning to normal towards the second half of next year. 
As such, the traditional equipment manufacturers' delays along with delays in office construct are creating some timing differences in our reported sales between quarters. 
Again, these manufacturing delays are primarily impacting delivery and installation of traditional equipment in North America, namely the U.S. Canada is quite stable. Manufacturers seem to be able to provide us with adequate product, although we do have longer installation times even in Canada, but not as bad as in the U.S. 
That said, dentists continue to invest in technology solutions that promote more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning as well as workflow efficiency. This is really important. Dentists are focusing on digitalization of their practices. We remain extremely bullish about the future of digital dentistry and the long-term prospects and trends we believe will flow from advancements in the digitalization of dentistry. 
Among the dental equipment highlights each year is the Dentsply DS World, which took place at the end of September in Las Vegas right at the end of the quarter. This event was virtual in 2020. So it was exciting for Henry Schein to be on site and meeting in person once again with current and prospective customers. We are very pleased with the results from the show, which did have somewhat of a modest positive impact on our sales in the third quarter, but we expect much more of an impact in the fourth quarter. It's important to note that DS will features high technology equipment, and we believe the supply chain challenges I discussed do not generally at the delivery and installation of these products here in the United States. So we expect the good results from the equipment side, specifically digital and other Dentsply products to flow through in the fourth quarter with a challenge remaining on the traditional chairs, units and lights, which are manufactured largely in the United States by other manufacturers who fill the slack from one of our large manufacturers exiting the market last year. 
Now look, we've received lots of questions on comments have been written about pricing for dental, merchandise and equipment. So we expect that prices may increase for certain items in the near term. as some manufacturers work through a scarcity of raw materials as well as higher transportation and labor costs. 
Unfortunately, this can result in higher pricing for our customers as we typically pass on these increases. However, what's very important, and we're communicating this to our customers, Henry Schein is committed to working with our suppliers to improve supply chain efficiencies and to limit these price increases as best we can and to alerting our customers to upcoming price changes. We are doing all we can to mitigate this inflationary impact resulting from raw material shortages, higher transportation issues mitigate that for our customers. 
So now turning to the dental specialties. Sales of our dental specialty product performed extremely well during this quarter with double-digit internal sales growth in local currencies versus the prior year. Remember, the prior year, we did have good sales in the specialty category as well. So this is pretty good compounding. Approximately 2/3 of our dental specialties revenues are from our oral surgery implant-based tooth replacement products business. That includes the implants and the bone regeneration products. Our success share is driven largely by our premium value Horizons and Camlog implants and bone regeneration lines, where we also saw strong growth versus the prior year. 
Our leadership position in the oral surgery, that's both an implant and bone regeneration market as well as endodontic and orthodontics includes both proven solutions and a commitment to delivering new solutions as we further penetrate key dental specialty markets. 
At any given time, we have a number of product launches underway, which typically takes us 12 to 18 months for a full rollout. The pipeline was rich and remains rich, and we continue to bring exciting new products to market in all 3 categories. 
During the third quarter, we launched our progressive [indiscernible] implants with multiunit prosthetics addressing the full Arch market in North America. And during the fourth quarter, we expect to launch our fusion implant solution to enhance our offering of the value price segment of the implant market. Our priority in orthodontics is our reveal clear aligner with global reach now into more than 2 dozen countries. In the U.S., we are in the process of launching an update to our software, Studio Pro 4.0, which features advanced treatment planning and visualization tools. We expect to launch the software in certain international markets next year. 
So overall, we're very pleased with the performance of our Dental business globally, our dental specialty businesses, and we'll talk now about our medical distribution business. 
Turning now to our medical business. Internal sales growth in local currencies for the third quarter was, once again, very strong. But what's important to recognize the strength was in terms of growth was strong both measured with and without sales of PPE and COVID-19 related products. 
Trends in the physician office, ambulatory surgery center, alternate care markets, as noted in my opening remarks are all quite positive. We believe traffic in U.S. physician offices and ambulatory surgery centers is generally improving, as we approach more normalized practice operations for elective procedures that were deferred over the past 18 months, although we're still not back to normal, but the trend is good. 
We also have increased the number of accounts we serve. I think the medical group has done a very good job in expanding accounts and also penetrating existing accounts. 
Sales of COVID-19-related products should be lumpy, as you know, all year, with strength in the first quarter falling off -- with strength in the first quarter falling off in the second quarter and picking up again in the third quarter, pretty lumpy, as noted. 
In addition, pricing for COVID tests has also declined quite a bit. These volatile sales trends reflect the unpredictable spread of the Delta variant with upticks in cases and testing services being seen between quarters and within various geographies. We continue to expect price volatility for COVID-19 test to continue. 
This year's third quarter also included the sale of flu diagnostic products, whereas a year ago, we sold very few of these tests. In fact, we are selling the combination flu COVID-19 test to our physician office-based customers to help differentiate these 2 viruses that result in somewhat overlapping symptoms. Tests are important in the office-based practitioner environment in the office, although as noted, the volatility of the particular price per unit can be quite sharp. We are optimistic, I would say, extremely optimistic about the future of our medical group as medical procedures continue to move to alternate care settings, coupled with our belief that we are well positioned to continue to grow our market share. 
Also, as noted, elective procedures that patients have put off for 18 months are now being scheduled. But putting that even aside, I think the structural market shift from the acute care setting to the physician office and the ultimate care setting particularly the ambulatory surgical center is something that is moving in our direction, and we are well positioned to process this new business that is emerging. 
So one closing remark regarding our distribution businesses. As we have previously discussed, we believe we have entered a new normal for the use of personal protected products, excuse me, by both dental and medical practitioners. We envisage demand for PP&E products continuing at an elevated level for the foreseeable future driven by new health care protocols. 
We do not expect that the demand -- the unit demand for PPE will revert to pre-pandemic usage levels. However, we expect price volatility for PP&E products to continue. 
So now looking at the performance of our technology and value-added services businesses during the quarter. Henry Schein One, the largest contributor to the sales in this segment once again recorded record high quarterly revenue. 
As Steven noted, we saw solid North American sales growth in Dentrix's technical support. That's the support we provide to our existing customers. and really exciting, our Dentrix Ascend Cloud Solutions business is growing. 
Remember, historically, the systems we sold, we would book a sale for the product and the total value of the software we sold would be recognized as a sale. 
Now the Dentrix Ascend cloud solution is subscription-based software, which means it's a continuous revenue, and this is doing very well. Dentrix Ascend is doing well with small customers, midsize customers and growingly now with some of the larger DSOs. Also, our software excellent business excellence business in the U.K. had a good quarter. The software business in the U.K. had challenges while the U.K. dentists were in lockdown or largely on lockdown. 
We continue to focus on the migration to the cloud and our cloud-based solutions to create flexible, scalable services to drive practice efficiency and patient engagement and a more stable recurring revenue stream, as I noted, for these services. Short term may impact sales in that we do not book the full sale of the software upfront, but this recurring revenue is really very good business. And growingly the percentage of our business in the recurring revenue field of the total Henry Schein One sales is growing. 
So overall sales growth was accelerated also by acquisitions we made over the past year in software analytics in particular. And in particular, the services offered by Javis are being well received by our customers. This is a great business that takes data, a lot of it from our Dentrix systems and provides analytics to customers, small and large customers. Lastly, our practice services businesses are key components of the value added we provide our customers. And we were especially pleased with the strong growth this quarter, also driven by incremental investment that practices are making in their businesses. We are expanding the range of practice solutions or part of the strategic thinking we've shared with our investors. 
In this connection, we acquired eAssist Dental Solutions late in the second quarter, and I'm really happy to report that this virtual dental outsourced billing business is performing well. It's been well received by our customers. And of course, the goal is to reduce the administrative effort required of our customers for their collections. 
I'd like to spend the closing part of my remarks on ESG, environmental, social and governance. As we've discussed during past quarterly calls, environmental, social and governance, or ESG is an area of important focus for Henry Schein and an important topic all of us as we find new and innovative ways to create shared value for society as well as for our company, our businesses and for our investors. 
I think it is quite clear as we emerged on COVID and hopefully, we're starting the emerging part now, certainly in the developed world but it's clear that the business of business is no longer only business and the private sector has an important role to play in addressing the critical issues that face the world. This was expected our business now more than ever. 
But let me stress, although we didn't call it ESG, ESG has been part of the Henry Schein DNA for decades, as we balance the needs of our customers, suppliers, investors, society at large and the well-being of our team members. 
To that end, we continue to engage our more than 21,000 Team Schein members as ESG champions to advance the ESG efforts as we find new and innovative ways to create shared value for society as well as for company. Henry Schein is committed already. I think our shareholders should be aware of this, to reporting in accordance with GRI and SASB standards next year in 2022. We've also committed to issuing our initial task force on climate-related financial disclosures report next year, and we will set science-based targets. 
With specific respect now to the environmental side, we aim to operate more efficiently and reduce our carbon footprint as well as working towards our goal to achieve net 0 global emissions by 2050. Of course, this will be gradual towards that date -- gradual and cumulative. 
We participate in the World Economic Forum Alliance of CEO climate leaders and have signed the business ambition for 1.5 center grade and the race to 0 campaign, the 1.5 and the Race Zero campaign, which seeks to catalyze leadership and tangible action from the private sector for a healthy, resilient 0 carbon recovery and we will continue to do our part for a healthier planet. 
Again, these are areas that Henry Schein has been committed to for a long time, but we're now disclosing and visualizing what we're doing. 
Regarding our work under social or Team Schein members, our team shine members are our, of course, greatest asset. We are committed to creating a culture of wellness including very important mental health, which has become a big issue during COVID, providing our team with resources, education and hosting open dialogues, which allow for a meaningful connection on related topics. 
We have what we referred to internally as a holistic approach to diversity and inclusion, D&I, recognizing that D is important, but ears very important, maybe more important, inclusive part that encompasses talent, culture, marketplace and society, increasing the representation of underrepresented groups, including women in leadership roles, and pay equity are a particular area of focus for us as is providing access to the health care service to historically underrepresented populations. We have been, again, committed to this for a long time. 
We have a long-standing commitment to pandemic and disaster preparedness and response and helping to build a stronger, more resilient health care supply chain. And this was manifested in our being a founding member and private sector lead for the pandemic supply chain network, Happy if any investor has questions on that to provide more information. The PSCN network, I think, played an important role during COVID and is ready to continue to help with pandemic preparedness. 
Our commitment to ethical corporate governance starts with our largely independent and diverse Board of Directors and our nominating and governance committee, who provide oversight over our ESG programs. 
In addition, Team Schein members in partnership with our customers, suppliers and NGO partners drive a culture of ethics and compliance through our team shine values, worldwide business standards and global supplier code of conduct. So that's a lot. But I think it's important to understand that we are committed to ESG have been committed to alignment with the needs of society, doing well by doing good, as Benjamin Franklin referred to over 200 years ago. We've been committed to that for decades and believe that this is one of the reasons why we, as a company, have provided increased shareholder value each year for decades. 
So with that in mind, Steve and I are ready to answer any particular questions that investors may have."

But there are many",303,"Steven will address the second part -- the second question. So we have shared services in a number of areas already. Our distribution systems, our telesales customer service, for example, inventory management has been a shared service. But there are many other parts of our business, particularly the front end. For example, management of customer contracts, equipment service, financial services, order processing, the front end of order processing. Some of it is already corporate-wide and others parts of it are specific related to medical and dental. These areas, I think, operating under common management. So drive out costs and provide better customer service. The big area that we are preparing for is our new digital's front end, our global e-commerce platform that will launch in the middle of next year in the U.K. and then will be rolled out throughout the company carefully. We need common management because that system is geared towards digital interfacing with our customers, dental and medical. So to cut a long story short, our very large customers and our midsized customers are going through a lot of experiences that our medical team already undertook and went through a decade plus ago. So there's a lot of learning and this learning that our dental team can provide our medical team. So we've broken up our business into 2, a North American business, led by Brad Connett, who has run our medical business for decades; and Andrea Albertini, internationally, who's been with us also for about a decade and has significant experience in manufacturing as well and distribution. And they are all working very closely with David Grouse, who's responsible together with Rene Willi for our specialty businesses. So internally, it works very, very well to advance our strategic plan that will be unfolding in -- for 2022 to 2024."

First, I'll note that our guidance is up for the year quite significantly. Remember, we gave a floor of $3.85 for the full year, and now we're at $427 million to $435 million. But specific to Q4, we wanted to see a few things that will enumerate. 
One is North American equipment and availability of product. We have estimates for product being delayed into 2022. But there was still a little bit of volatility and uncertainty as to exactly how much product we'll get in Q4 for North America. And this is really the traditional equipment. So we're being conservative there. 
We also have seen a fair amount of volatility on 2 product items that we're trying to be a little bit conservative on. One is COVID test kits. You can see it's been jumping around. We had a very strong Q3. But we do expect COVID test kits to moderate sales to moderate a bit in Q4 as well as PPE pricing, we do expect PPE pricing to also moderate a bit in Q4. So there's some conservatism built into the Q4 numbers. I'll also note that if you compare the EPS to the EPS of last year. Remember, last year, we had that tax settlement that was $0.11 per share, and that obviously was nonrecurring. 
And finally, I'll say because there's been some notes and thought on inflationary. Obviously, any price inflationary items are fully considered, both in our 2021 and 2022 guidance."

With respect -- I know there were some questions earlier this -- last week actually on specific customers. And on that, we're not going to comment on specific terms and conditions for specific customers for competitive reasons. But again, we feel like inflation is a little bit higher, and it's not just on product costs, it's also on labor and other things.

The gross profit, first of all, we had a significant increase in gross profit year-over-year and that was primarily driven by lower inventory adjustments. I would say it's a little bit of mix. And the second thing I would point to in impacting the gross margin is pricing on PPE products. PPE products continue to have pricing declines. So while -- it's not as big an impact on margins. It does impact the absolute dollars as well as the mix because it is now not contributing as much to the mix. So it's primarily mix, Jon. And we do think that these pricing issues in PPE will be behind us, certainly during Q4. They've moderated a lot in Q3, but there still seems to be a little bit more to go. 
And going forward, we expect -- our goal is also to continue to drive towards high-margin businesses, those technology and specialty sales products, which carry a higher margin. And the goal is to help improve the margin with a positive mix shift."

Let's see if I can hit all.

By the way, I just wanted to note that when I -- in the prepared remarks when I was describing the technology sales growth in advert said 21.9 million, sales growth when I meant 21.9% growth. So just to correct that. 
With respect to guidance, there's a couple of things. We're not assuming any major change in foreign exchange because of guidance. We do have a preliminary budget, so our 2022 guidance is based off of that preliminary budget. When you look at the Q3 stock compensation expense, it was higher than normal because of the overperformance in Q3 as well as the full year. So Q3, we caught up based on that new projection on some of the stock-based compensation expense. That will be normalized in 2022. 
And like I said, we're trying to be a little bit conservative on 2022 also because of some of the uncertainty on test kits. We'll also see the benefit of the timing, Q4 timing on traditional equipment will be a headwind for us, but it will be a tailwind in 2022 as those orders that can't get installed in Q4 get installed sometime in 2022. 
Did I cover, Jason, the bulk of your question? Because you had a lot of sub-questions in there or something else that you want me to answer?"

I guess just at a high level, is there a point where you'd look to maybe procure product from elsewhere, bring in some international suppliers? I guess, just anything you can proactively do on your end to help mitigate this challenge from really dragging on deep into '22?"

Jason, we are talking about traditional equipment in the United States, chairs units and lights. All the other equipment is readily available and chairs units and lights are available outside of the United States. So we're dealing",665,"Yes. Thank you, Steven. Jason, we are talking about traditional equipment in the United States, chairs units and lights. All the other equipment is readily available and chairs units and lights are available outside of the United States. So we're dealing with a particular situation where a significant manufacturer of ours exited the chair's units and lights market. other manufacturers have scaled up their capacity. This also happened simultaneously with an increase in demand for equipment, traditional equipment, whether it's a direct result of our gaining market share or actually practitioners and/or practitioners investing in their practice. This business will not be last. 
Coincidentally, there is a delay in construction. I think this is a general economy issue. So even if we had the equipment, there would be several practices, quite a few that would not be ready to take them. So I don't think this is a need to add additional chairs units and lights manufacturers to our mix. We're very happy with the major manufacturers that supply us to these products here. It's not an international or non-U.S. issue where the manufacturers in general are providing us with product. And it certainly doesn't impact products like imaging, digital equipment, et cetera, there, we're experiencing a steady flow of product. Perhaps we can't get everything we want right away, but we're not talking about significant delays. 
So in general, we are happy with our manufacturers of equipment. We don't have our own private brand equipment line. We do not intend to have that for the large equipment. And so we are happy that our major manufacturers will supply us with the equipment we need. 
On the consumable side, there is some dislocation. And there, we are moving some product around if a manufacturer can't give us what we need, we'll move it to another manufacturer. But overall, equipment will be satisfied, and we expect even with the increased demand for us to be back to normal as we're hearing -- as we've been given this information by manufacturers mid-next year. 
So Steven, I think we are 7 minutes over, but we went a little bit on with the prepared remarks, which I apologize to the participants. But let me just end by saying thank you very much for calling in. Thank you for spending a few more minutes with us than was scheduled. As you can tell from our prepared remarks and from the answers, we remain extremely optimistic about our business, feel there is great momentum across the board, whether it's dental, medical, our specialty businesses, our value-added services in the software arena, the various kinds of services that we sell, that we build for all of these are going well. Of course, there are always challenges. This is not an easy time. Supply chain disruption is there. There's no doubt about it. And -- but we're working through these issues. Our team is committed. There were lots questions or lots of writings about the stability of our sales force. It's a stable as it's ever been. We are slightly moving the sales force around to more specialty features, featured salespeople. But generally, we did implement a new compensation program in the U.S. for our dental program, the dental sales people, relatively well received. We did not lose people because of that. There's lots and lots. It's been written lots of rumors. Bottom line, we have 3,500 field sales representatives, consultants around the world, of which well over -- almost 3,000 are in the North America, the other -- the rest are -- sorry, half in North America and half internationally. We are pretty stable in this area. And I'm quite optimistic that our sales organization remains highly motivated. 
So thank you very much for participating in this call today. If you have any questions, please reach out to Steven or to Graham in Investor Relations, and I look forward to speaking to everybody when we report our fourth quarter numbers. Thank you."

And of course, thank you for all you've done for the company over the last dozen-plus years.
So good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. Really, really happy today to report record third quarter financial results, driven by a keen focus on execution by the team. And the team has done a remarkable job since the virus -- the pandemic started back in March of 2020. And of course, there was a steady patient traffic pattern during this quarter, which also contributed to the very good and actually, the excellent results. And we have excellent momentum across the entire company.
So if we compare the results of sales a year ago, Henry Schein's worldwide internal sales that's in local currencies increased a robust 7.2%. But what's really important, if you exclude the sales of PP&E and COVID-19-related products, results are up 6.3%. That's the internal sales growth in local currencies.
We believe that patient traffic was generally similar to the previous quarter for our [ dental ] customers, that's in the United States and globally, small adjustments in different parts of the world, but not material. And definitely, the pattern is improving for our medical customers. We mentioned in previous calls that visits to physician offices had gone down compared to '19 and definitely in ambulatory surgical centers as well. We see this traffic as increasing again.
In mid-September, we announced important changes to our senior distribution business leadership structure. And let me comment on these changes before I review the third quarter performance for each of our business groups -- or actually, Steven will do that first and then I'll provide additional comments later.
We have been pursuing an umbrella strategy which we internally refer to as One Distribution as part of the continuous operational improvement of Henry Schein as a company. More tightly -- the strategy of One Distribution more tightly integrates the management of our distribution businesses globally. Our newly announced structure, which we've been working on for about 18 months, seeks to harness the benefits of consolidating the management of Henry Schein dental and medical distribution businesses in 2 regions, 2 geographies: North America, and the rest of the world, international.  
One Distribution, will better position our management team to leverage functions, talent, processes, and yes, systems across Henry Schein's global distribution businesses. These changes are designed and expected to accelerate improved efficiency. And of course, that's been a goal of Henry Schein for decades to improve efficiency, but we're really focused on it now more than ever and actually doing a pretty good job at that. But I believe that this new management structure will advance our efficiency as an organization globally.
But also. And quite importantly, the new structure will allow us to enhance the customer experience by operating in a more efficient manner. There's just no question that COVID -- this period, this COVID period has increased customers' expectations on the customer experience, and we are committed to fulfilling those expectations. In fact, exceeding them. Furthermore, these changes recognize the fact that medicine and dentistry are both parts of the tariff continuum.
And we've been talking about this for years as well, but it's really coming much closer together, the notion that medicine and dentistry are aligned in prevention and wellness. And today, we have a small, but nevertheless, increasing the amount of overlap between the 2 customer sets. We're starting to see practices emerge that are servicing both sides, the industry and medicine. We're starting to see our electronic medical records in dental schools for dentistry and practices starting to connect in an interoperable way with medical records.  
So this whole notion of the integration of oral care and medicine is advancing, and we are aligned in this whole area of wellness and prevention, which is so important to providing better quality of care at a more competitive price or a lower price so-called value health care chain.
Now our software specialty Products and practice services businesses are also reflective of Henry Schein's longstanding commitment to help customers operate more efficient practices and support clinical care. We are continuing to sharpen our focus on these faster-growing and higher-margin markets through organic growth, and as you'll hear later already, through some very interesting strategic acquisitions, which we made just this year, and we will add to that.
The whole notion that software, specialty products and practice service activities, those 3 business areas align with our One Distribution strategy, different management teams, different focus. The whole idea is to provide better customer service while at the same time driving up our margins, our operating margins as well. 
Our customers increasingly rely upon Henry Schein's comprehensive offering of innovative solutions and services, along with our distribution network for their continued success in what is clearly a much more digital world than we went into in March of 2020. We believe we have a most accomplished leader team in place in our businesses across the world, both on the distribution side and in the software specialty products and practice services businesses side.  They're ready to satisfy the needs of our customers, improve the experience, drive down costs and at the same time, therefore, provide an increased operating income and so create shareholder value.
With these opening comments, I'd like to hand the call over to Steven discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance, which we are now providing for the remainder of 2021 and yes, for 2022 as well. Then I'll provide some additional commentary on the current business conditions and our markets. Steven, please?"
339447,1685545536,2421513,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis.Our third quarter non-GAAP results for 2",1894,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis.
Our third quarter non-GAAP results for 2021 and 2020 and exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release as well as in the supplemental information section of our Investor Relations website. Please note that we have, again, included a corporate sales category for Q3 that represents the prior year sales to Covetrus under the transition services agreement, which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2020. While the agreement has ended, these sales are still reflected in the prior year comparative results.
Turning now to our financial results. Total net sales for the quarter ended September 25, 2021, was $3.2 billion, reflecting growth of 11.9% compared with the prior year period. Internally generated sales were up 7.2% in local currencies, and you can again see the details of our sales performance in Exhibit A of the earnings press release that was issued earlier this morning.
On a GAAP basis, our operating margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 6.63% and that's relatively flat, but represents an increase of 2 basis points compared with the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin of 6.63% for the third quarter of 2021. That represents a decrease of 22 basis points compared with the prior year. Again, a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin can be found in the supplemental information page on our website.
The year-over-year decline is due to higher expenses this quarter compared with Q3 2020, which reflected temporary expense reduction initiatives we put in place last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by gross margin expansion compared with Q3 2020, mainly as a result of lower inventory adjustments in the current quarter.
Turning to our taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 23.9%. This compares with a 16.4% GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was also 23.9% and that compared with 16.7% in the third quarter of last year.
Remember, our prior year tax rate was favorably impacted by U.S. federal income tax settlement, which lowered income tax expenses by approximately $15.6 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Again, this is the prior year taxes. Excluding this impact, the effective tax rate last year would have been in the 25% range for both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
You can also see the reconciliation of GAAP effective tax rate to non-GAAP effective tax rate on the Investor Relations page on our website. We expect our effective tax rate to continue to be in the 25% base range on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter. And of course, that assumes no changes in tax legislation. 
Moving on, GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein for the third quarter of 2021 was $162.3 million or $1.15 per diluted share and included a gain on sale of an equity investment of $0.05 per diluted share. This compares with the prior year GAAP net income from continuing operations of $141.7 million or $0.99 per share.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations for the current year was $154.8 million or $1.10 per diluted share, and that compares to net income from continuing operations of $147 million or $1.03 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020. 
Amortization from acquired intangible assets for Q3 2021 was $30.5 million pretax or $0.13 per diluted share. This compares with $25.2 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share for the third quarter of last year. And for the 9 months, our amortization, acquired intangible assets was $90.3 million pretax or $0.40 per diluted share and this compares with $76.8 million pretax or $0.34 per diluted share for the same period last year.  I'll also note that foreign currency exchange positively impact our Q3 2021 diluted EPS and by approximately $0.01 per share.  
Let me now provide some additional detail on our sales results for the third quarter. Our global dental sales of $1.8 billion increased 10.5% compared with the same period last year, with internal sales growth of 5.2% in local currencies. Global Dental merchandise internal sales increased by 2.9% in local currencies for the third quarter of 2021 versus the same period last year. And if we were to exclude PPE and COVID-19 related products, internal sales growth in local currencies increased by 4.8%.
Our North American dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.7% compared with Q3 2020, which is attributable primarily to stable merchandise growth and solid equipment growth. Our North American dental consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies was 3.9% with Q3 2020 or 5.7% when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-related products.
If we look at our North American dental equipment, the internal sales growth in local currencies was 7.8% versus Q3 2020 with growth reflecting strong sales of high-technology equipment and modest growth of traditional equipment sales, which remain impacted by equipment manufacturing and office construction delays.
Q3 sales of high-tech equipment was helped by DS World this year as this year's event was more impactful than the virtual event held in 2020. U.S. manufacturers of traditional equipment in North America expect to continue to see delays until the second half of 2022. The pipeline for equipment orders remained strong, and we regard this delayed equipment installations into next year as a timing issue rather than any decrease in demand. DS World also has contributed to our strong backlog of orders going into the fourth quarter.  Just as a reminder, we recognize sales for equipment and capital equipment orders at the time the equipment is installed rather than when the order is placed.
Our international dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 5.9% versus Q3 of 2020. Our international dental consumable merchandise sales in local currencies increased 1% versus Q3 2020 or 3.5% growth, excluding PPE and COVID-related products. We also reported strong equipment sales growth of 28.1% in our international markets, which are not experiencing any supply chain issues of any significance at this time.
In local currencies, internal sales increased 23.9%, compared with Q3 2020. Our sales of dental specialty products was approximately $225 million in the third quarter with internal growth of 10.3% in local currencies versus the prior year. In North America, internal sales growth in local currencies grew 8.5% over Q3 2020, and I'll note that Q3 2020 was also a strong quarter. And internationally, internal sales of dental specialty products grew at 15.3% in local currencies.
Growth was strong in each of our dental specialty categories, namely oral surgery, implants, bone regeneration, endodontics, orthodontics, with all of these businesses doing well in both North America and internationally. Our global medical sales during Q3 was $1.2 billion and increased 15.5% compared with the same period last year. Internal sales growth was 13.1% in local currencies. Our internal sales growth increased 13.6% in North America versus the prior year, while international sales of our Medical business declined 7.5% year-over-year. North American medical sales experienced particularly strong growth across the board versus the third quarter of last year, including growth in COVID-19 test kits, equipment, laboratory product sales and pharmaceuticals.
If you were to exclude PPE and COVID-related products, global medical internal sales growth in local currencies increased 8.3% versus Q3 2020. I'll also note, we sold approximately $206 million in COVID-19 test kits in the third quarter of 2021. That includes about $28 million in multi-assay flu and COVID-19 combination test. This compares with $75 million in test kits in the second quarter of this year and $180 million in the first quarter of 2021. The increase in test kits was the result of the surge in demand related to the Delta variant, and we expect sales of test kits to moderate from these levels in the upcoming quarters.
Technology and Value-Added Services sales during Q3 were $168.6 million, an increase of $21.9 million compared with the prior year, and that includes internal growth of 6.3% in local currencies. In North America, tech and value-added services internal sales growth was 5% in local currencies and this growth was primarily driven by Henry Schein One's Dentrix Ascend subscriptions as well as Dentrix technical support revenue and our practice services value-added businesses.
Internationally, technology and value-added services internal sales increased by 15.3% in local currencies compared with the prior year, driven primarily by Henry Schein One with particular strength in software excellence business driven by the reopening in the U.K.
We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the third quarter, buying approximately 650,000 shares at an average price of $76.77 per share for a total expenditure of approximately $50 million. The impact of these repurchases of shares in the third quarter was immaterial to diluted EPS. I'll also note, at the end of the quarter, Henry Schein had approximately $350 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases.
If you take a look at our balance sheet, as well as cash flow, we have access to significant liquidity, providing flexibility and financial stability. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2021 was $211.2 million, and that compared to $261.3 million for the third quarter of last year.
I'll note also as part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, we have a small pretax credit in Q3 2021 of $175,000 and of course, that did not have a material impact on our diluted EPS.
I'll conclude my remarks by updating our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance as well as introducing 2022 guidance. At this time, we are not providing 2021 GAAP diluted EPS guidance as we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, an estimated costs related to the ongoing restructuring initiative, including the corresponding tax effect.
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect EPS from continuing operations to be $4.27 to $4.35, reflecting a 44% to 46% growth for 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations. Turning to next year, we are introducing preliminary guidance for 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations.
Also at this time, we're not providing guidance for 2022 GAAP diluted EPS for the same reason as we are unable to provide without unreasonable estimate and estimate of restructuring costs for 2021 and 2022 as well as the corresponding tax impact. We expect growth in 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the mid- to high single digits over 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations.
Our guidance for both 2021 and 2022, non-GAAP diluted EPS is for current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of future share repurchases, potential future acquisitions, if any, or restructuring expenses. Guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels, that the end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions, and there are no material adverse market changes associated with COVID-19.
With that summary, let me turn the call back over to Stanley."
339447,1685545536,2421513,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Steven. So let's provide some thoughts on each of our businesses. Third quarter dental revenue growth was solid, as you heard.

So let's provide some thoughts on each of our businesses. Third quarter dental revenue growth was solid, as you heard. Overall gains in consumable merchandise and equipment sales in North America and international markets reflect the continuing recovery. And as noted, this is coupled with keen focus on execution by Team Schein.
North American dental consumable merchandise internal growth in local currencies with and without PP&E and COVID-19-related products also was quite solid in the third quarter. Consumable merchandise sales continue to improve, which we believe was bolstered by a steady flow of patient traffic.
Here in the U.S., the most recent American Dental Association data shows patient traffic is currently at about 90% of pre-pandemic levels, and Henry Schein One billings associated with dental claims processing are, once again, about 100% and of pre-pandemic levels, a little over. These statistics are similar to those we reported in the second quarter, and we believe the market to be sequentially stable, tilting slightly through improvement.
Similar kind of data around the world. Some countries are a little ahead, some a little behind, but on balance, pretty stable on the dental side. You may recall that many of the international markets we serve posted a quick recovery in sales and consumable merchandise in the third quarter of last year when we recorded, at that time, record sales. This comparison resulted in slightly lower sales growth than we have seen in prior quarters. Most markets are back to normal, as I noted, with some modest weakness in the U.K., although it is better. And in Australia and New Zealand, for a very short period of time, to the main cities were on lockdown. But the market, the lockdown has been largely lifted and Australia and New Zealand are back to normal right now. But we had a dip in the third quarter.
Last quarter, we discussed some of the delivery and installation delays facing the U.S. traditional dental equipment business. Overall, our equipment business is performing very well, and equipment demand is strong as demonstrated by the third quarter sales we are reporting today. We expect the impact of those delays to be pronounced in the fourth quarter with manufacturing lead times returning to normal towards the second half of next year.
As such, the traditional equipment manufacturers' delays, along with delays in office construction are creating some timing differences in our reported sales between quarters. Again, these manufacturing delays are primarily impacting delivery and installation of traditional equipment in North America, namely the U.S.. Canada is quite stable. Manufacturers seem to be able to provide us with adequate product, although we do have longer installation times even in Canada, but not as bad as in the U.S.
That said, dentists continue to invest in technology solutions that promote more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning as well as workflow efficiency. This is really important. Dentists are focusing on digitalization of their practices. We remain extremely bullish about the future of digital dentistry and the long-term prospects and trends we believe will flow from advancements in the digitalization of dentistry.
Among the dental equipment highlights each year is with Dentsply, DS World, which took place at the end of September in Las Vegas right at the end of the quarter. This event was virtual in 2020. So it was exciting for Henry Schein to be on site and meeting in person, once again, with current and prospective customers. We are very pleased with the results from the show, which did have somewhat of a modest positive impact on our sales in the third quarter, but we expect much more of an impact in the fourth quarter.
It's important to note that DS will features high technology equipment, and we believe the supply chain challenges I discussed do not generally, in fact, at the delivery and installation of these products here in the United States.
So we expect the good results from the equipment side, specifically digital and other Dentsply products to flow through in the fourth quarter with a challenge remaining on the traditional chairs, units and lights, which are manufactured largely in the United States by other manufacturers who fill the slack from one of our large manufacturers exiting the market last year.
Now look, we've received lots of questions and comments have been written about pricing for dental, merchandise and equipment. So we expect that prices may increase for certain items in the near term. as some manufacturers work through a scarcity of raw materials as well as higher transportation and labor costs.
Unfortunately, this can result in higher pricing for our customers as we typically pass on these increases. However, what's very important, and we're communicating this to our customers, Henry Schein is committed to working with our suppliers to improve supply chain efficiencies and to limit these price increases as best we can and to alerting our customers to upcoming price changes. We are doing all we can to mitigate this inflationary impact resulting from raw material shortages, higher transportation issues, mitigate that for our customers.
So now turning to the dental specialties. Sales of our dental specialty product performed extremely well during this quarter with double-digit internal sales growth in local currencies versus the prior year. Remember, the prior year, we did have good sales in the specialty category as well. So this is pretty good compounding. Approximately 2/3 of our dental specialties revenues are from our oral surgery, implant-based tooth replacement products business. That includes the implants and the bone regeneration products.
Our success share is driven largely by our premium value, BioHorizons and Camlog implants and bone regenerations lines, where we also saw strong growth versus the prior year. Our leadership position in the oral surgery, that's both in implant and bone regeneration market as well as in endodontic and orthodontics includes both proven solutions and a commitment to delivering new solutions as we further penetrate key dental specialty markets. At any given time, we have a number of product launches underway, which typically takes us 12 to 18 months for a full rollout. The pipeline was rich and remains rich, and we continue to bring exciting new products to market in all 3 categories.
During the third quarter, we launched our Progressive Conelog implants with multiunit prosthetics addressing the full arch market in North America. And during the fourth quarter, we expect to launch our Fusion implant solution to enhance our offering of the value price segment of the implant market. Our priority in orthodontics is our Reveal Clear Aligner with global reach now into more than 2 dozen countries. In the U.S., we are in the process of launching an update to our software, Studio Pro 4.0, which features advanced treatment planning and visualization tools. We expect to launch the software in certain international markets next year. So overall, we're very pleased with the performance of our Dental business globally, our Dental Specialty businesses, and we'll talk now about our Medical Distribution business.
Turning now to our Medical business. Internal sales growth in local currencies for the third quarter was, once again, very strong. But what's important to recognize, the strength was -- in terms of growth, was strong both measured with and without sales of PP&E and COVID-19 related products.
Trends in the physician office, ambulatory surgery center, alternate care markets, as noted in my opening remarks are all quite positive. We believe traffic in U.S. physician offices and ambulatory surgery centers is generally improving, as we approach more normalized practice operations for elective procedures that were deferred over the past 18 months, although we're still not back to normal, but the trend is good.
We also have increased the number of accounts we serve. I think the medical group has done a very good job in expanding accounts and also penetrating existing accounts. Sales of COVID-19-related products should be lumpy, as you know, all year, with strength in the first quarter, falling off in the second quarter and picking up again in the third quarter. Pretty lumpy, as noted.
In addition, pricing for COVID tests has also declined quite a bit. These volatile sales trends reflect the unpredictable spread of the Delta variant with upticks in cases and testing services being seen between quarters and within various geographies. We continue to expect price volatility for COVID-19 test to continue.
This year's third quarter also included the sale of flu diagnostic products, whereas a year ago, we sold very few of these tests. In fact, we are selling the combination flu COVID-19 test to our physician office-based customers to help differentiate these 2 viruses that result in somewhat overlapping symptoms. Tests are important in the office-based practitioner environment in the office, although as noted, the volatility of the particular price per unit can be quite sharp.
We are optimistic, I would say, extremely optimistic about the future of our medical group as medical procedures continue to move to alternate care settings, coupled with our belief that we are well positioned to continue to grow our market share. Also, as noted, elective procedures that patients have put off for 18 months are now being scheduled.
But putting that even aside, I think the structural market shift from the acute care setting to the physician office and the ultimate care setting, particularly the ambulatory surgical center is something that is moving in our direction, and we are well positioned to process this new business that is emerging.
So one closing remark regarding our distribution businesses. As we have previously discussed, we believe we have entered a new normal for the use of personal protection -- protective equipment products, excuse me, by both dental and medical practitioners. We envisage demand for PP&E products continued -- continuing at an elevated level for the foreseeable future, driven by new health care protocols. We do not expect that the demand -- the unit demand for PPE will revert to pre-pandemic usage levels. However, we expect price volatility for PP&E products to continue.
So now looking at the performance of our technology and value-added services businesses during the quarter. Henry Schein One, the largest contributor to the sales in this segment, once again recorded record high quarterly revenue. As Steven noted, we saw solid North American sales growth in Dentrix technical support. That's the support we provide to our existing customers. and really exciting, our Dentrix Ascend Cloud Solutions' business is growing.
Remember, historically, the systems we sold, we would book a sale for the product and the total value of the software we sold would be recognized as a sale. Now the Dentrix Ascend Cloud solution is subscription-based software, which means it's a continuous reoccurring revenue, and this is doing very well. Dentrix Ascend is doing well with small customers, midsized customers and growingly now with some of the larger DSOs. Also, our Software Excellence business in the U.K. had a good quarter. The Software business in the U.K. had challenges while the U.K. dentists were in lockdown or largely on lockdown.
We continue to focus on the migration to the cloud and our cloud-based solutions to create flexible, scalable services to drive practice efficiency and patient engagement and a more stable reoccurring revenue stream, as I noted, for these services.
Short term may impact sales in that we do not book the full sale of the software upfront, but this recurring revenue is really very good business. And growingly the percentage of our business in the reoccurring revenue field of the total Henry Schein One sales is growing. So overall sales growth was accelerated also by acquisitions we made over the past year in software analytics in particular. And in particular, the services offered by Jarvis are being well received by our customers. This is a great business that takes data, a lot of it from our Dentrix systems and provides analytics to customers, small and large customers.
Lastly, our Practice Services businesses are key components of the value added we provide our customers. And we were especially pleased with the strong growth this quarter, also driven by incremental investment that practices are making in their businesses. We are expanding the range of practice solutions or part of the strategic thinking we've shared with our investors.
In this connection, we acquired eAssist Dental Solutions late in the second quarter, and I'm really happy to report that this virtual dental outsourced billing business is performing well. It's been well received by our customers. And of course, the goal is to reduce the administrative effort required of our customers for their collections.
I'd like to spend the closing part of my remarks on ESG, environmental, social and governance arena. As we've discussed during past quarterly calls, environmental, social and governance, or ESG is an area of important focus for Henry Schein and an important topic all of us as we find new and innovative ways to create shared value for society as well as for our company, our businesses and for our investors.
I think it is quite clear as we emerged on COVID and hopefully, we're starting the emerging part now, certainly in the developed world. But it's clear that the business of business is no longer only business and the private sector has an important role to play in addressing the critical issues that face the world. This was expected of business now more than ever. But let me stress, although we didn't call it ESG, ESG has been part of the Henry Schein DNA for decades, as we balance the needs of our customers, suppliers, investors, society at large and the well-being of our team members.
To that end, we continue to engage our more than 21,000 Team Schein Members as ESG champions to advance the ESG efforts as we find new and innovative ways to create shared value for society as well as for our company. Henry Schein is committed to -- already, I think our shareholders should be aware of this, to reporting in accordance with GRI and SASB standards next year in 2022. We've also committed to issuing our initial task force on climate-related financial disclosures report next year, and we will set science-based targets.
With specific respect now to the environmental side, we aim to operate more efficiently and reduce our carbon footprint as well as working towards our goal to achieve net 0 global emissions by 2050. Of course, this will be gradual towards that date -- gradual and cumulative.
We participate in the World Economic Forum Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders and have signed the business ambition for 1.5 centigrade and the Race to Zero campaign, the 1.5 C and the Race to Zero campaign, which seeks to catalyze leadership and tangible action from the private sector for a healthy, resilient 0 carbon recovery and we will continue to do our part for a healthier planet. Again, these are areas that Henry Schein has been committed to for a long time, but we're now disclosing and visualizing what we're doing.
Regarding our work under social or Team Schein Members, our Team Schein Members are our, of course, greatest assets. We are committed to creating a culture of wellness, including very important mental health, which has become a big issue during COVID, providing our team with resources, education and hosting open dialogues, which allow for a meaningful connection on related topics.
We have what we referred to internally as a holistic approach to diversity and inclusion, D&I, recognizing that D is important, but I is very important, maybe more important, inclusive part that encompasses talent, culture, marketplace and society, increasing the representation of underrepresented groups, including women in leadership roles, and pay equity are a particular area of focus for us as is providing access to the health care service to historically underrepresented populations. We have been, again, committed to this for a long time.
We have a long-standing commitment to pandemic and disaster preparedness and response and helping to build a stronger, more resilient health care supply chain. And this was manifested in our being a founding member and private sector lead for the pandemic supply chain network, Happy if any investor has questions on that to provide more information. The PSCN network, I think, played an important role during COVID and is ready to continue to help with pandemic preparedness. Our commitment to ethical corporate governance starts with our largely independent and diverse Board of Directors and our nominating and governance committee, who provide oversight over our ESG programs.
In addition, Team Schein Members, in partnership with our customers, suppliers and NGO partners drive a culture of ethics and compliance through our Team Schein values, worldwide business standards and global supplier code of conduct. So that's a lot. But I think it's important to understand that we are committed to ESG, have been committed to alignment with the needs of society, doing well by doing good, as Benjamin Franklin referred to over 200 years ago. We've been committed to that for decades and believe that this is one of the reasons why we, as a company, have provided increased shareholder value each year for decades.
So with that in mind, Steve and I are ready to answer any particular questions that investors may have."

And I'll just ask my follow-up now and get off. The second question, Steve, is for you. I think the guidance implies a little bit of a sequential step down in earnings. Should we think about that as just because of basic equipment being lower? Or is there something else going on in Q4?"

So we have shared services in a number of areas already. Our distribution systems, our telesales customer service, for example, inventory management has been a shared service.
But there are many other parts of our business, particularly the front end. For example, management of customer contracts, equipment service, financial services, order processing, the front end order processing. Some of it is already corporate-wide and others -- parts of it are specific related to medical and dental. These areas, I think, operating under common management to drive out costs and provide better customer service.
The big area that we are preparing for is our new digital front end, our global e-commerce platform that we'll launch in the middle of next year in the U.K. and then will be rolled out throughout the company carefully. We need common management, because that system is geared towards digital interfacing with our customers, dental and medical.
So to cut a long story short, our very large customers and our midsized customers are going through a lot of experiences that our medical team already undertook and went through a decade plus ago. So there's a lot of learning and these are learnings that our dental team can provide our medical team.
So we've broken up our business into 2, our North American business, led by Brad Connett, who's run our medical business for decades; and Andrea Albertini, internationally, who's been with us also for about a decade and has significant experience in manufacturing as well and distribution. And they are all working very closely with David Brous, who's responsible together with René Willi for our Specialty businesses. So internally, it works very, very well to advance our strategic plan that will be unfolding in -- for 2022 to 2024."

First, I'll note that our guidance is up, for the year, quite significantly. Remember, we gave a floor of $3.85 for the full year, and now we're at $4.27to $4.35. But specific to Q4, we wanted to consider a few things that I'll enumerate.
One is North American equipment and availability of product. We have estimates for product being delayed into 2022. But there was still a little bit of volatility and uncertainty as to exactly how much product we'll get in Q4 for North America. And this is really the traditional equipment. So we're being conservative there.
We also have seen a fair amount of volatility on 2 product items that we're trying to be a little bit conservative on. One is COVID test kits. You can see it's been jumping around. We had a very strong Q3. But we do expect COVID test kits to moderate -- sales to moderate a bit in Q4 as well as PPE pricing. We do expect PPE pricing to also moderate a bit in Q4. So there's some conservatism built into the Q4 numbers. I'll also note that if you compare the EPS to the EPS of last year, remember, last year, we had that tax settlement that was $0.11 per share, and that obviously was nonrecurring.
And finally, I'll say because there's been some notes and thought on inflationary. Obviously, any price inflationary items are fully considered, both in our 2021 and 2022 guidance."

Generally, we try to pass through pricing to the end user, to the customer. But as Stanley said in his prepared remarks, we're also working with manufacturers to see how much we can limit those price increases and do other things. With respect -- I know there were some questions earlier this -- last week, actually, on specific customers. And on that, we're not going to comment on specific terms and conditions for specific customers for competitive reasons.
But again, we feel like inflation is a little bit higher, and it's not just on product costs, it's also on labor and other things. And all of that is baked into our guidance, best we can do at this time."

Was it the big medical number and PPE. And do we expect that to bounce back sort of into the fourth quarter and trajectory into '22?"

The gross profit, first of all, we had a significant increase in the gross profit year-over-year and that was primarily driven by lower inventory adjustments. I would say it's a little bit of mix. And the second thing I would point to in impacting the gross margin is pricing on PPE products. PPE products continue to have pricing declines.
So while -- it's not as big an impact on margins, it does impact the absolute dollars as well as the mix because it is now not contributing as much to the mix. So it's primarily mix, Jon. And we do think that these pricing issues in PPE will be behind us, certainly during Q4. They've moderated a lot in Q3, but there still seems to be a little bit more to go. And going forward, we expect -- our goal is also to continue to drive towards higher-margin businesses, those technology and specialty sales products, which carry a higher margin. And the goal is to help improve the margin with a positive mix shift."

And at the same time, advancing our specialty areas, namely software, the specialty products area and services. And maybe multiples to increase to some extent.
But there's lots of opportunity for us to create synergies and to bring new value-added services to our customer base. So we remain quite optimistic about the M&A area. Obviously, there's no deal until there's a deal. And our pipeline remains quite full. Having said that, again, we cannot commit to any particular quarter. And I think you heard from Steven's guidance that there's nothing in these numbers for M&A that is not announced."

First, I'd be curious in your level of confidence here today and margin expansion for the business next year and really trying to take into account the items that were impacting here real time in the quarter with respect to things like business mix and a step-up in stock comp.
And how we should be thinking about those items when it comes to operating margins for '22? And then also kind of within that guidance discussion, do you have an estimate on what the currency headwind you're assuming in earnings growth guidance for next year?"

You asked a lot of questions. Let's see if I can hit all of them. By the way, I just wanted to note that when I -- in the prepared remarks, when I was describing the technology sales growth, I inadvertently said $21.9 million sales growth when I meant 21.9% growth. So just to correct that.
With respect to guidance, there's a couple of things. We're not assuming any major change in foreign exchange because of guidance. We do have a preliminary budget, so our 2022 guidance is based off of that preliminary budget.
When you look at the Q3 stock compensation expense, it was higher than normal because of the overperformance in Q3 as well as the full year. So Q3, we caught up based on that new projection on some of the stock-based compensation expense. That will be normalized in 2022.
And like I said, we're trying to be a little bit conservative on 2022 also, because of some of the uncertainty on test kits. We'll also see the benefit of the timing, Q4 timing on traditional equipment will be a headwind for us, but it'll be a tailwind in 2022 as those orders that can't get installed in Q4 get installed sometime in 2022.
Did I cover, Jason, the bulk of your questions? Because you had a lot of sub-questions in there or something else that you want me to answer?"

And then just coming back to one other point you were making there, Steve, just on hitting on the basic equipment challenges here near term, but it also sounds like this issue, before it's fully resolved, it may be extend a bit deeper into '22 than what you were alluding to a few months ago. I guess just at a high level, is there a point where you'd look to maybe procure product from elsewhere, bring in some international suppliers? I guess, just anything you can proactively do on your end to help mitigate this challenge from really dragging on deep into '22?"

Jason, we are talking about traditional equipment in the United States, chairs, units, lights. All the other equipment is readily available and chairs, units and lights are available outside of the United States. So we're dealing with a particular situation where a significant manufacturer of ours exited the chairs, units and lights market.
Other manufacturers have scaled up their capacity. This also happened simultaneously with an increase in demand for equipment, traditional equipment, whether it's a direct result of our gaining market share or actually practitioners and/or practitioners investing in their practice. This business will not be lost.
Coincidentally, there is a delay in construction. I think this is a general economy issue. So even if we had the equipment, there would be several practices, quite a few that would not be ready to take them. So I don't think this is a need to add additional chairs, units and lights manufacturers to our mix. We're very happy with the major manufacturers that supply us with these products here.
It's not an international -- or non-U.S. issue where the manufacturers in general are providing us with product. And it certainly doesn't impact products like imaging, digital equipment, et cetera. There, we're experiencing a steady flow of product. Perhaps we can't get everything we want right away, but we're not talking about significant delays.
So in general, we are happy with our manufacturers of equipment. We don't have our own private brand equipment line. We do not intend to have that for the large equipment. And so we are happy that our major manufacturers will supply us with the equipment we need.
On the consumable side, there is some dislocation. And there, we are moving some product around. If a manufacturer can't give us what we need, we'll move it to another manufacturer. But overall, equipment will be satisfied, and we expect, even with the increase in demand, for us to be back to normal as we're hearing -- as we've been given this information by manufacturers mid-next year.
So Steven, I think we are 7 minutes over, but we went a little bit on with the prepared remarks, which I apologize to the participants. But let me just end by saying thank you very much for calling in. Thank you for spending a few more minutes with us than was scheduled.
As you can tell from our prepared remarks and from the answers, we remain extremely optimistic about our business, feel there is great momentum across the board, whether it's dental, medical, our specialty businesses, our value-added services in the software arena, the various kinds of services that we sell, that we build for all of these are going well.
Of course, there are always challenges. This is not an easy time. Supply chain disruption is there. There's no doubt about it. And -- but we're working through these issues. Our team is committed. There were lots questions or lots of writings about the stability of our sales force. It's as stable as it's ever been. We are slightly moving the sales force around to more specialty features, featured salespeople.
But generally, we did implement a new compensation program in the U.S. for our dental program -- dental sales people, relatively well received. We did not lose people because of that. There's lots and lots -- it's been written, lots of rumors. Bottom, bottom line, we have 3,500 field sales representatives, consultants around the world, of which well over -- almost 3,000 are in the North America, the other -- the rest are -- sorry, half in North America and half internationally. We are pretty stable in this area. And I'm quite optimistic that our sales organization remains highly motivated.
So thank you very much for participating in this call today. If you have any questions, please reach out to Steven or to Graham in Investor Relations, and I look forward to speaking to everybody when we report our fourth quarter numbers. Thank you."
