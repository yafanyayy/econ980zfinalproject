Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the current environment and our most recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. 
I would like to start my comments by expressing my appreciation for the perseverance shown by our employees as they work through the many challenges that we faced during 2020. Throughout the year, we maintained high employee engagement while continuing to support surgeons and caregivers around the world. 
Our fourth quarter organic sales declined roughly 1%, reflecting the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, offset by a continuation of emergent procedures and strong performance by our large capital products. We are also excited about closing the Wright Medical deal during the quarter and the category leadership that we gained in the fastest-growing segment within the orthopedics market. Preston will provide some additional updates on the integration shortly. 
Throughout the quarter, we maintained the financial discipline instituted at the beginning of the pandemic, which, combined with a favorable tax rate, led to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.81 in the quarter, up approximately 13% versus 2019. And we delivered impressive cash flow from operations, which exceeded $3 billion for the full year. 
In addition to closing the Wright Medical acquisition, we also made progress in many areas that will provide future growth opportunities. We have established a structure focused on digital, robotics and enabling technology, where we see a significant opportunity to create a company-wide unified digital ecosystem, including Mako. We maintained our commitment to drive innovation across our various business units, including Neurovascular, where we gained new product approvals across aspiration, stent retrievers and flow diverting stents, and in our MedSurg segment where we continue product introductions with a focus on safety and prevention. 
Finally, we successfully launched our ASC sales model, which leverages the Stryker portfolio to provide end-to-end solutions to meet the growing demand and shift to the outpatient setting. Our continued support for our customers and our commitment to innovation will position us well for growth as the pandemic eventually subsides. 
Turning to 2021. Our people and culture of execution remains strong, which will allow us to deliver on our commitment to make health care better and to resume our customary strong organic sales growth and leveraged earnings. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Preston."

My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and Orthosensor. During the fourth quarter, elective procedures",871,"Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and Orthosensor. During the fourth quarter, elective procedures were negatively pressured in most regions globally as localized infection and hospitalization rates surged through the month of December. As a result, growth was uneven and correlated to the state of the pandemic in each region. The areas impacted the most include the U.S. and many of the countries in Western Europe, most notably, the United Kingdom, driven by a countrywide lockdown. 
Even with the procedural variability, we saw growth in emerging markets, including China, which grew double digits over prior year quarter. Looking forward, hospitals are better equipped to handle this resurgence, and they are working to bring back the procedures that have been delayed. But we expect that the variability of elective procedures will continue during the first quarter until infection rates begin to decline and the distribution of the vaccines become more prevalent. This slowdown in elective procedures had a negative impact on our more deferrable businesses, which make up approximately 40% to 50% of our total sales. 
However, the slowdown this quarter was not as impactful as the decline in the second quarter as hospitals were better equipped to manage COVID patients while maintaining some level of elective surgeries. Despite the overall slowdown, we experienced continued growth in our Neurovascular, Medical, Mako and upper Extremities businesses. Specifically, demand for Medical's large capital products continued in the fourth quarter driven by the focus on expanding bed capacity, the need for our emergency care products, like Powercost and the LUCAS device, and the availability of some remaining CARES act funding in the U.S. In addition, the early trends in the launch of our new Procuity bed are positive and expect it to continue into 2021. 
During the year, our Mako installed base grew by 33% and exceeded another milestone with over 100 robots sold and installed in the fourth quarter. This growth continues to highlight the demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology as well as our ongoing success selling and installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs and competitive accounts. We are also excited about our recent approvals for Mako TKA in China, Russia and Brazil, which all provide opportunities for growth as these markets continue to embrace robotic, digital and enabling technologies. 
Turning to U.S. knee procedures. In the fourth quarter, approximately 44% of our total knees will make the need procedures, a trend that continues to increase. The shift towards cementless knees also continued, and in the fourth quarter, cementless knees made up 42% of our U.S. knee procedures. 
During the pandemic, feedback from surgeons has pointed to limited trialing of competitive products in businesses like joint replacement as surgeons work to perform procedures restricted by cancellations and deferrals. However, as the pandemic subsides and we return to a more normal environment, we expect to continue to outpace the market driven by our Mako installations throughout the year and our strong order book heading into 2021. 
We are also enthusiastic about the Wright Medical acquisition and the category leadership we gained in both upper extremities and foot and ankle through Wright's diverse portfolio of implants, biologics and enabling technology. The combination of Stryker and Wright will continue to drive innovation that enhances our customers' ability to address patient needs across the more than $3 billion extremities market. 
The integration has been progressing well over the last few months. The long period from sign to close was used to ensure that the appropriate integration plans were in place, leveraging our years of deal experience. To date, the teams have been focused on moving quickly to align the new combined organization. Considerable progress has been made, including the creation of specialized business units and sales forces for trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle, which is a key part of our overall decentralized strategy that allows us to remain close to the customer. 
The U.S. sales leadership organizational structure for these 3 specialized business units has been announced, and the rollout and full alignment of territories will be finalized during the first quarter as planned. 
Outside the U.S., the leadership team is working to align the sales forces throughout the year. Our teams are executing the sales integration while continuing to drive day-to-day business. And during the quarter, there was minimal disruption caused by the closing and integration activities. 
Finally, I want to restate our ongoing commitment to M&A, which was most recently demonstrated by our acquisition of Orthosensor, a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for joint replacement. Smart devices and implants will play an important role in the future of orthopedics, and the addition of Orthosensor will allow us to continue to innovate and advance smart sensor technology, including interoperative sensors, wearables and ultimately, smart implants. 
As it relates to 2021 guidance, Glenn will provide an update on our full year guidance for sales, operating margin and EPS. Updates to this annual guidance will be made each quarter as necessary throughout the year. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn."
94614,700117902,2182860,"Stryker Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Stryker Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter. As a reminde",1645,"Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. 
Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q4 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.8% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales. 
Early in the quarter, there was continued momentum from Q3. However, during November, the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the related cancellations of procedures, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, significantly impacted our sales momentum. However, we did see demand for certain capital products continue as we had strong results in our Mako, medical beds and emergency care products. 
For the quarter, U.S. organic sales declined 1.5%, reflecting the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, Medical products and Neurovascular products. International organic sales were flat, impacted by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in Europe, which was mostly offset by growth in Canada, China and Brazil. Organic sales declined for the year was 4.8%, with a U.S. decline of 5.8% and an international decline of 2.1%. 
2020 had 1 additional selling day compared to 2019. And for the year, price had an unfavorable 0.7% impact on sales. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.81 increased 12.9% from the prior year, reflecting strong financial discipline, good operating expense control and a favorable operational tax rate. Our fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by $0.03 from foreign currency. Our full year EPS was $7.43, which is a decline of 10%, reflecting the impact of lower sales, especially in Q2, as well as the impact of idling certain manufacturing facilities during the year, offset by strong expense discipline throughout the year. 
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 2.8% and an organic sales decline of 5.8%, including an organic decline of 5.7% in the U.S. This reflects a slowdown in elective procedures related to COVID-19 and a very strong prior year comparable as Q4 2019 U.S. organic growth was 7.2%. Other ortho grew 12.3% in the U.S. primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako Robotics platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. The Trauma and Extremities business also delivered positive growth, led by our core trauma and shoulder products. 
Internationally, Orthopaedics declined 6% organically which also reflects the COVID-19-related procedural slowdown, especially in Europe. This was somewhat offset by stronger performances in Australia and Canada. 
During the quarter, the Wright Medical acquisition was successfully closed. For the quarter, Wright delivered flat growth on a comparable basis. This included positive performances in U.S. shoulder, double-digit growth in U.S. ankle as well as strong international growth led by Australia. On a comparable basis for the full year, Wright had a 10.3% decline mainly driven by the COVID-19-related slowdown in the second quarter. 
In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency growth of 1.5% and organic growth of 1.3%, which included 2.2% growth in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 4.5%. In the quarter, sales growth was driven by gains in its power tool, waste management and smoke evacuation products and its service business. 
Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 7% primarily impacted by the slowdown in the capital businesses, offset by gains in the Sports Medicine business, which grew over 9% in the quarter. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 9.7%, reflecting solid performances in patient care, emergency care and its Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had an organic sales decline of 2.4%, reflecting a general slowdown in Instruments and Endoscopy businesses and strong comparables across most geographies. 
Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 2.1%. This growth reflects many strong performances within our Neurotech product line, including neuro-powered drills, SonoPet and Neurovascular, offset by the impact of procedural deferrals, especially in the U.S. Our Europe -- our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic decline of 1.2% as procedural deferrals impacted sales in the quarter. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 13.5%. This performance was driven by strong demand in Australia, Japan and China. 
Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.1% was unfavorable approximately 120 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin dilution was impacted by price, business mix and unabsorbed fixed costs as production was brought in line with reduced demand during the quarter. This was primarily offset by acquisitions and foreign exchange. 
Adjusted R&D spending was 5.5% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 30.3% of sales, which was favorable to the prior year quarter by 200 basis points. This reflects the continued focus on disciplined operating expense controls, which have been in place since the second quarter. These cover most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings and consultants. 
In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 29.2% of sales, which is a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and reflects the impact of the spending discipline previously discussed. 
Related to other income and expense as compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding related to the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. 
Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 8%. Our full year effective tax rate was 12.6%. These rates reflect onetime operational fluctuations that arose due to the pandemic, with a mix of foreign losses related to lower foreign manufacturing activity combined with reduced U.S.-sourced income that resulted from the sharp drop in sales at the end of the year. For 2021, we do not anticipate these circumstances arising as we expect to return to normalized operations during the year. And we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. 
Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $14 billion. During the quarter, we executed the Wright Medical acquisition, which resulted in the disbursement of $5.6 billion, inclusive of the retirement of Wright's convertible debt. 
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $3.3 billion. This historically strong performance resulted from the disciplined working capital management, somewhat offset by lower earnings. 
Turning to cash flow for 2021. We will not be repurchasing any shares, and we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately $650 million. Anticipating a more normalized year in 2021 and a ramping of investment in our businesses, we expect the free cash flow conversion rate as a percent of adjusted net earnings excluding the onetime impacts from the Wright Medical integration of 70% to 80%. 
And now I will provide 2021 guidance on a stand-alone legacy basis and further guidance, including Wright Medical. We are providing our guidance in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. As Preston indicated, we will be providing annual guidance on our organic sales growth and earnings, and we'll update this throughout the year as part of our regular earnings calls. 
As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. Given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2019. As a reference, our organic sales growth excludes Wright Medical. There are the same number of selling days in 2021 compared to 2019 and 1 less when comparing to 2020. 
Consistent with the pricing environment experienced in both 2019 and 2020, we would expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1%. Additionally, as we are comparing growth to 2019, our 2021 organic sales growth guidance includes 2 years of price reductions. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales in EPS will be modestly favorably impacted as compared to 2020 and 2019. 
For the full year 2021, we did not expect to deliver operating margin expansion as a result of the op margin dilution of the Wright Medical acquisition. However, excluding the dilutive impact from Wright, we do anticipate expansion of 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2021 for our legacy Stryker business compared to 2019. This includes anticipated increases in hiring, discretionary expenses and other costs that support future growth and business expansion as our businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels. 
Finally, for 2021, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $8.80 to $9.20 for the full year. This includes the previously announced $0.10 dilution driven by the addition of the Wright Medical business for the full year. While Wright Medical is dilutive in 2021, we expect it to be accretive starting in 2022. 
As it relates to other aspects of Wright Medical, we expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be in the low to mid-single digits in 2021 when compared to 2019. This includes the integration of Strike's legacy extremity business with Wright Medical, which will all be part of our Trauma and Extremities division. This growth is impacted by the recovery from COVID-19, partially offset by dis-synergies from the integration activities in 2021. We also reiterate our previous guidance on cost-saving synergies from the deal of approximately $100 million to $125 million over the next 3 years. 
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

On the low end, it could be all the way through Q2. On the better end, we start to see much more improvement towards the beginning of Q2. And it really is going to be variable depending on that. I mean we have passed our legacy Stryker business on the op margin front with 30 to 50 basis points improvement. But keep in mind, as you look at Q4 or if you even go back and look at Q3, it really reflected a pretty Draconian expense control in terms of hiring, travel, meetings, consultants, you name it, discretionary expenses, and we put the lid on that. So that's not sustainable, especially as you think about our aspirations to grow at the high end of med device. So we will start seeing that spending pick up as we continue to supplement and hire our sales forces, as we meet with customers, as we add to our prototypes and loaner pools, all those things will start to add to our expenses. And so that's really what's underlying the guidance."

As far as Wright Medical goes, we were pretty pleased with where their Q4 performance came out, but they're also subject to a lot of the same variability, which is why we're looking that once we integrate it with Trauma and Extremities, we will have some sales dis-synergies that just naturally occur. We felt that with K2 and Spine, and we will fill that with Wright Medical. So taking into account that variability, you're really looking at 8% to 10% for the -- for Stryker legacy and low to mid-single digits as we look at the combined Wright and Trauma and Extremities."

I would say, certainly, at the end of the year, really did we got that second wave, the spiking. And certainly, you saw that in the discretionary procedures, a pretty big slowdown after a pretty good month of October. And it really started to trail off November, December. 
On the large capital front, we're actually very excited. So what we experienced through Q2, Q3 and Q4 from an order book standpoint is continuing to be very strong. So that is really good news. It's good news for Mako. It's good news for Medical. 
On the small capital side, we've always said that, that tends to lag a little bit, the recovery in discretionary procedures. And you certainly saw that within certainly the Endoscopy division and the Instruments division, where I would say that those orders are maybe going to take a little longer to really come back in the same way. But overall, I mean, we have enough confidence now with the hospitals being ready to do these procedures as soon as the pandemic starts to subside, as soon as vaccines start to become more prevalent that they'll turn it on pretty quickly, and they'll be pretty agile. And that's why we feel pretty confident of being able to give, I think, a healthy guide, certainly going back off of '19, 8% to 10% organic. 
So we -- so it will spike throughout the year, starting with, obviously, a slower Q1. And the good news is we have the whole year. So even if the discretionary procedures drag a little bit -- we saw in Q3 a pretty big spike once things started getting healthy. So over the course of the year, we're hoping that and believe that the guidance we'll be able to sustain even if it's maybe a little softer in Q2 and a little stronger maybe in Q3."

So should we interpret that 8% to 10% number, Kevin, relative to the structural growth rate? And what are some of the key factors underpinning that? Or how do you think about the structural growth rate of Stryker here as we come out of COVID-19? And then I have a quick follow-up."

I mean without getting into every single division, what I would just give you as a macro comment is we feel that we have the right offense to continue to win in the market and to continue the strong growth. You saw for 7 straight years, we accelerated our organic growth, and 2019 culminated with over 8% organic growth. And I think that muscle that we developed, the structure that we have with our business units, the new product pipeline that we have, has positioned us to be an above-market grower. And we expect -- fully expect that, that will continue into 2021. 
There are obviously differences by divisions, but we feel like we're in a very healthy position overall. And that's what gives us confidence in the guide. 
Clearly, Wright Medical is a big acquisition. There are dis-synergies that we've assumed there. It was highly dilutive to the normal operation of our business. We'll see how that unfolds over the course of the year. The early signs of the integration are very positive, but we have put in some prudence there just based on what we've experienced with our K2M acquisition and what, frankly, all other implant companies have experienced with their integration."

No, we remain very bullish about our knee replacement business as well as Mako. You saw just the increase in Mako is pretty remarkable to have almost 1 out of 2 knees being done on Mako, and it's not been that many years since we launched the system. So unlike Navigation in the past, which obviously never had this type of an uptake, we continue to have strong, not only installations of robots but utilization. And even Hips, we're seeing that continue to increase as well. And the new Hips software was installed in about 400 accounts in Q4. So we had the approval, obviously, earlier in the year. But because of the pandemic, it's taken us time to actually be able to go in and do the upgrades, but that will pick up steam again into 2021. 
So again, looking at 1 quarter, whether it's a positive or negative in a pandemic world, is not something I'm too concerned about. It's just based on where your regional strength is. If you happen to be in a state or locality that is doing procedures, then you got benefit and if you didn't, you got hurt. So it's a little bit random during the pandemic, but structurally, I think we're in great shape with that business."

And so we would expect to see some of that flowing back into the numbers through 2021. 
I think the one caveat I would give you is you won't necessarily see a dramatic spike in those numbers just given certain aspects around capacity and things like that.

But clearly, we now see it's going to be significantly higher than 50%, which I think 5 years ago, nobody would have believed if we had said that. So that's pretty remarkable. 
In terms of the actual use of Mako. As you saw, we had a lot of robots installed this year. So I would expect that, that looking at the percentage of of having us done with Mako will continue to increase same with Hips. 
Outside the United States, it's taking a little longer, obviously, because of the approvals. But we're really excited about getting the totally approved in China, Brazil and Russia. And certainly, Japan and China are going to be very, very good markets for us. Japan, we've made some progress already. The approvals took a little longer there as well. But the new Hip software, of course, is also very important. As you know, there's a lot more hip procedures done in that part of the world. It's almost about the same as knees unlike the United States. So we love the fact that we have multiple applications all approved in those markets and would expect you're going to see a similar kind of growth that you saw in the United States. It may not be quite as quick as you've seen that, frankly, with Intuit in soft tissue robotics. The update is a little slower outside the United States. But we expect the same kind of runway longer term and are very bullish about the prospects, especially in China, Japan, Brazil, for sure, are going to be terrific markets to Mako."

So blooms and light certainly haven't been as positive as Mako and the beds and stretchers and certainly, the defibrillators because the Medical capital really did sort of write a bit of a pandemic tailwind, if you will. And booms and lights large construction sort of slowed down a little bit. That should pick up starting next year. And that's part of the drag that you see within the Endoscopy division is the booms and lights portion. But certainly, in ASCs, they're busy, but certainly the large capital spend projects were delayed a little bit. They're starting to pick back up again. So that's obviously a smaller business, but then the overall Stryker. 
But Medical, we continue to feel bullish. So it's -- so we did get a bit of pandemic benefit. But this new bed that we've launched is really a fantastic product, getting great customer feedback. Sage has also picked up. So that was really hit hard in the second quarter, third quarter, had a nice pickup in Q4. And that business will resume its high growth as the pandemic upside. 
So the diversity of our portfolio is really -- that gives us the optimism that we're going to continue to see strong growth in Medical.

The similarities may be buy in the foot and ankle side, where there is more of a true integration what's happening between the Stryker business and the Wright business. But for the upper extremities side, it's much more of just bringing them into Stryker and continuing on with the growth that they've had. 
So it's a little bit different from that perspective as we think about bringing on the acquisition of Wright versus K2. Just like with any -- in all of our previous acquisitions, we've learned and we've learned along the way and we do those learnings as we plan for additional or new acquisitions that are coming. The same was true with Wright. And so we utilized really that year-long period between sign and close to ensure that we're focused on getting the correct integration plans in place so that we can hit the ground running. And to date, that's what the team has done. They have executed to the plan. And as I'd mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've really done a lot of focus on ensuring that the sales organizations are being integrated in a timely fashion.

And I actually think it's not going to stop in the United States. There's already countries like the U.K. and even Canada looking at moving to lower cost sites of care. It's a good thing for health care overall. And these surgery centers make good money. They're very profitable. They don't have the burden of the cost of large inpatient hospitals.

I think we understand the opportunity with Mako pretty well. We've clearly got Orthosensor that's going to flow in, but maybe just help us understand what that means for the company longer term. Does it bring you close to your customers and prevent share loss or competitive loss? Are the new revenue streams that come in, just from a big-picture perspective, how should we be thinking about that over the next several years."

And so this is something we're really excited about. And we named Robert Cohen the head of that business on behalf of all of Stryker. 
And so we already had initiatives going on in different parts of the company. We're sort of bringing it all together to really create more leverage and really be able to have Centers of Excellence around different types of technology blocks.

You may recall for hip arthroscopy. 
More recently, we launched a lateral role anchor for shoulder, which has been, we call it, Omega product name, which is a fantastic product. We picked up -- through IVR, we picked up another product as well, which -- these are all key fundamental products, whether it's in knee, whether it's in hip or whether it's in shoulder. So now we have all 3 of the joints very well covered in sports. And we are just growing in a very, very robust rate. And the timing couldn't be better with the shift to the surgery center and being able to use sports combined with our other divisions.

And a lot of the Stryker business, frankly, were you be hip and knee surgeons that also did some volume of shoulder.

And cross-selling opportunities will exist. But as Preston mentioned before, this integration is not going to be as tricky as the integration on foot and ankle, just given that we tended to -- they tended to be strong with the, I'll call it, fully dedicated upper extremity surgeons. And we tended to be stronger with those surgeons that did a smaller number, just as a general statement. So I think this integration is going to be terrific. 
We were really thrilled to be able to have the leader from Wright Medical take over the combined business of upper extremities. And their Head of Sales is also running the combined sales organization, and they're both outstanding leaders. And we are delighted not only to bring the business and the products of Wright Medical but being able to bring over some of their key leadership.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the current environment and our most recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.  
I would like to start my comments by expressing my appreciation for the perseverance shown by our employees as they work through the many challenges that we faced during 2020. Throughout the year, we maintained high employee engagement while continuing to support surgeons and caregivers around the world.  
Our fourth quarter organic sales declined roughly 1%, reflecting the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, offset by a continuation of emergent procedures and strong performance by our large capital products. We are also excited about closing the Wright Medical deal during the quarter and the category leadership that we gained in the fastest-growing segment within the orthopedics market. Preston will provide some additional updates on the integration shortly.  
Throughout the quarter, we maintained the financial discipline instituted at the beginning of the pandemic, which, combined with a favorable tax rate, led to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.81 in the quarter, up approximately 13% versus 2019. And we delivered impressive cash flow from operations, which exceeded $3 billion for the full year.  
In addition to closing the Wright Medical acquisition, we also made progress in many areas that will provide future growth opportunities. We have established a structure focused on digital, robotics and enabling technology, where we see a significant opportunity to create a company-wide unified digital ecosystem, including Mako. We maintained our commitment to drive innovation across our various business units, including Neurovascular, where we gained new product approvals across Aspiration, stent retrievers and flow diverting stents, and in our MedSurg segment where we continue product introductions with a focus on safety and prevention.  
Finally, we successfully launched our ASC sales model, which leverages the Stryker portfolio to provide end-to-end solutions to meet the growing demand and shift to the outpatient setting. Our continued support for our customers and our commitment to innovation will position us well for growth as the pandemic eventually subsides.  
Turning to 2021. Our people and culture of execution remains strong, which will allow us to deliver on our commitment to make health care better and to resume our customary strong organic sales growth and leveraged earnings. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Preston."

My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and Orthosensor. During the fourth quarter, elective procedures",871,"Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and Orthosensor. During the fourth quarter, elective procedures were negatively pressured in most regions globally as localized infection and hospitalization rates surged through the month of December. As a result, growth was uneven and correlated to the state of the pandemic in each region. The areas impacted the most include the U.S. and many of the countries in Western Europe, most notably, the United Kingdom, driven by a countrywide lockdown.  
Even with the procedural variability, we saw growth in emerging markets, including China, which grew double digits over prior year quarter. Looking forward, hospitals are better equipped to handle this resurgence, and they are working to bring back the procedures that have been delayed. But we expect that the variability of elective procedures will continue during the first quarter until infection rates begin to decline and the distribution of the vaccines become more prevalent. This slowdown in elective procedures had a negative impact on our more deferrable businesses, which make up approximately 40% to 50% of our total sales.  
However, the slowdown this quarter was not as impactful as the decline in the second quarter as hospitals were better equipped to manage COVID patients while maintaining some level of elective surgeries. Despite the overall slowdown, we experienced continued growth in our Neurovascular, Medical, Mako and Upper Extremities businesses. Specifically, demand for Medical's large capital products continued in the fourth quarter, driven by the focus on expanding bed capacity, the need for our emergency care products, like power cot and the LUCAS device, and the availability of some remaining CARES Act funding in the U.S. In addition, the early trends in the launch of our new ProCuity bed are positive and expect it to continue into 2021.  
During the year, our Mako installed base grew by 33% and exceeded another milestone with over 100 robots sold and installed in the fourth quarter. This growth continues to highlight the demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology as well as our ongoing success selling and installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs and competitive accounts.  
We are also excited about our recent approvals for Mako TKA in China, Russia and Brazil, which all provide opportunities for growth as these markets continue to embrace robotic, digital and enabling technologies. 
Turning to U.S. knee procedures. In the fourth quarter, approximately 44% of our total knees were Mako Knee procedures, a trend that continues to increase. The shift towards cementless knees also continued, and in the fourth quarter, cementless knees made up 42% of our U.S. knee procedures.  
During the pandemic, feedback from surgeons has pointed to limited trialing of competitive products in businesses like joint replacement as surgeons work to perform procedures restricted by cancellations and deferrals. However, as the pandemic subsides and we return to a more normal environment, we expect to continue to outpace the market driven by our Mako installations throughout the year and our strong order book heading into 2021.  
We are also enthusiastic about the Wright Medical acquisition and the category leadership we gained in both upper extremities and foot and ankle through Wright's diverse portfolio of implants, biologics and enabling technologies. The combination of Stryker and Wright will continue to drive innovation that enhances our customers' ability to address patient needs across the more than $3 billion extremities market.  
The integration has been progressing well over the last few months. The long period from sign to close was used to ensure that the appropriate integration plans were in place, leveraging our years of deal experience. To date, the teams have been focused on moving quickly to align the new combined organization. Considerable progress has been made, including the creation of specialized business units and sales forces for trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle, which is a key part of our overall decentralized strategy that allows us to remain close to the customer.  
The U.S. sales leadership organizational structure for these 3 specialized business units has been announced, and the rollout and full alignment of territories will be finalized during the first quarter, as planned. Outside the U.S., the leadership team is working to align the sales forces throughout the year. Our teams are executing the sales integration while continuing to drive day-to-day business. And during the quarter, there was minimal disruption caused by the closing and integration activities.  
Finally, I want to restate our ongoing commitment to M&A, which was most recently demonstrated by our acquisition of Orthosensor, a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for joint replacement. Smart devices and implants will play an important role in the future of orthopedics, and the addition of Orthosensor will allow us to continue to innovate and advance smart sensor technology, including interoperative sensors, wearables and ultimately, smart implants.  
As it relates to 2021 guidance, Glenn will provide an update on our full year guidance for sales, operating margin and EPS. Updates to this annual guidance will be made each quarter as necessary throughout the year.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn."
94614,700117902,2183200,"Stryker Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Stryker Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.  Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter. As a remind",1645,"Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.  
Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q4 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.8% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales.  
Early in the quarter, there was continued momentum from Q3. However, during November, the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the related cancellations of procedures, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, significantly impacted our sales momentum. However, we did see demand for certain capital products continue as we had strong results in our Mako, medical beds and emergency care products.  
For the quarter, U.S. organic sales declined 1.5%, reflecting the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, Medical products and Neurovascular products. International organic sales were flat, impacted by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in Europe, which was mostly offset by growth in Canada, China and Brazil. Organic sales decline for the year was 4.8%, with a U.S. decline of 5.8% and an international decline of 2.1%.  
2020 had 1 additional selling day compared to 2019. And for the year, price had an unfavorable 0.7% impact on sales. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.81 increased 12.9% from the prior year, reflecting strong financial discipline, good operating expense control and a favorable operational tax rate. Our fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by $0.03 from foreign currency. Our full year EPS was $7.43, which is a decline of 10%, reflecting the impact of lower sales, especially in Q2, as well as the impact of idling certain manufacturing facilities during the year, offset by strong expense discipline throughout the year.  
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 2.8% and an organic sales decline of 5.8%, including an organic decline of 5.7% in the U.S. This reflects a slowdown in elective procedures related to COVID-19 and a very strong prior year comparable as Q4 2019 U.S. organic growth was 7.2%. Other ortho grew 12.3% in the U.S., primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako Robotics platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. The Trauma and Extremities business also delivered positive growth, led by our core trauma and shoulder products.  
Internationally, Orthopaedics declined 6% organically which also reflects the COVID-19-related procedural slowdown, especially in Europe. This was somewhat offset by stronger performances in Australia and Canada.  
During the quarter, the Wright Medical acquisition was successfully closed. For the quarter, Wright delivered flat growth on a comparable basis. This included positive performances in U.S. shoulder, double-digit growth in U.S. ankle as well as strong international growth led by Australia. On a comparable basis for the full year, Wright had a 10.3% decline, mainly driven by the COVID-19-related slowdown in the second quarter.  
In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency growth of 1.5% and organic growth of 1.3%, which included 2.2% growth in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 4.5%. In the quarter, sales growth was driven by gains in its power tool, waste management and smoke evacuation products and its service business.  
Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 7%, primarily impacted by the slowdown in the capital businesses, offset by gains in the Sports Medicine business, which grew over 9% in the quarter. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 9.7%, reflecting solid performances in patient care, emergency care and its Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had an organic sales decline of 2.4%, reflecting a general slowdown in Instruments and Endoscopy businesses and strong comparables across most geographies.  
Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 2.1%. This growth reflects many strong performances within our Neurotech product line, including neuro-powered drills, SonoPet and Neurovascular, offset by the impact of procedural deferrals, especially in the U.S. Our Europe -- our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic decline of 1.2% as procedural deferrals impacted sales in the quarter. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 13.5%. This performance was driven by strong demand in Australia, Japan and China.  
Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.1% was unfavorable approximately 120 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin dilution was impacted by price, business mix and unabsorbed fixed costs as production was brought in line with reduced demand during the quarter. This was primarily offset by acquisitions and foreign exchange.  
Adjusted R&D spending was 5.5% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 30.3% of sales, which was favorable to the prior year quarter by 200 basis points. This reflects the continued focus on disciplined operating expense controls, which have been in place since the second quarter. These cover most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings and consultants.  
In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 29.2% of sales, which is a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and reflects the impact of the spending discipline previously discussed. Related to other income and expense as compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding related to the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 8%. Our full year effective tax rate was 12.6%. 
These rates reflect onetime operational fluctuations that arose due to the pandemic, with a mix of foreign losses related to lower foreign manufacturing activity combined with reduced U.S.-sourced income that resulted from the sharp drop in sales at the end of the year. For 2021, we do not anticipate these circumstances arising as we expect to return to normalized operations during the year. And we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.  
Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $14 billion. During the quarter, we executed the Wright Medical acquisition, which resulted in the disbursement of $5.6 billion, inclusive of the retirement of Wright's convertible debt.  
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $3.3 billion. This historically strong performance resulted from the disciplined working capital management, somewhat offset by lower earnings.  
Turning to cash flow for 2021. We will not be repurchasing any shares, and we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately $650 million. Anticipating a more normalized year in 2021 and a ramping of investment in our businesses, we expect the free cash flow conversion rate as a percent of adjusted net earnings excluding the onetime impacts from the Wright Medical integration of 70% to 80%.  
And now I will provide 2021 guidance on a stand-alone legacy basis and further guidance, including Wright Medical. We are providing our guidance in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. As Preston indicated, we will be providing annual guidance on our organic sales growth and earnings, and we'll update this throughout the year as part of our regular earnings calls.  
As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. Given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2019. As a reference, our organic sales growth excludes Wright Medical. There are the same number of selling days in 2021 compared to 2019 and 1 less when comparing to 2020.  
Consistent with the pricing environment experienced in both 2019 and 2020, we would expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1%. Additionally, as we are comparing growth to 2019, our 2021 organic sales growth guidance includes 2 years of price reductions. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales in EPS will be modestly favorably impacted as compared to 2020 and 2019.  
For the full year 2021, we did not expect to deliver operating margin expansion as a result of the op margin dilution of the Wright Medical acquisition. However, excluding the dilutive impact from Wright, we do anticipate expansion of 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2021 for our legacy Stryker business compared to 2019. This includes anticipated increases in hiring, discretionary expenses and other costs that support future growth and business expansion as our businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels.  
Finally, for 2021, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $8.80 to $9.20 for the full year. This includes the previously announced $0.10 dilution driven by the addition of the Wright Medical business for the full year. While Wright Medical is dilutive in 2021, we expect it to be accretive starting in 2022.  
As it relates to other aspects of Wright Medical, we expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be in the low to mid-single digits in 2021 when compared to 2019. This includes the integration of Stryker's legacy extremity business with Wright Medical, which will all be part of our Trauma and Extremities division. This growth is impacted by the recovery from COVID-19, partially offset by dis-synergies from the integration activities in 2021. We also reiterate our previous guidance on cost-saving synergies from the deal of approximately $100 million to $125 million over the next 3 years.  
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

So when you mix all that together and you really look at what will Trauma and Extremities growth be in 2021 as compared to 2019, we do think it will be low to mid-single digits.

It's -- Vijay, I would tell you that based on what happened this year and the variability that we saw in our operations, we fully expect to continue to experience some variability on into Q2. And so our guidance range really reflects how that ramp comes back. 
On the low end, it could be all the way through Q2. On the better end, we start to see much more improvement towards the beginning of Q2. And it really is going to be variable depending on that. I mean we have passed our legacy Stryker business on the op margin front with 30 to 50 basis points improvement. But keep in mind, as you look at Q4 or if you even go back and look at Q3, it really reflected a pretty Draconian expense control in terms of hiring, travel, meetings, consultants, you name it, discretionary expenses, and we put the lid on that. 
So that's not sustainable, especially as you think about our aspirations to grow at the high end of med device. And So we will start seeing that spending pick up as we continue to supplement and hire our sales forces, as we meet with customers, as we add to our prototypes and loaner pools, all those things will start to add to our expenses.

As far as Wright Medical goes, we were pretty pleased with where their Q4 performance came out, but they're also subject to a lot of the same variability, which is why we're looking that once we integrate it with Trauma and Extremities, we will have some sales dis-synergies that just naturally occur. We felt that with K2 and Spine, and we will fill that with Wright Medical. So taking into account that variability, you're really looking at 8% to 10% for the -- for Stryker legacy and low to mid-single digits as we look at the combined Wright and Trauma and Extremities."

I would say, certainly, at the end of the year, really did we got that second wave spiking. And certainly, you saw that in the discretionary procedures, a pretty big slowdown after a pretty good month of October. And it really started to tail off November, December. 
On the large capital front, we're actually very excited. So what we experienced through Q2, Q3 and Q4 from an order book standpoint is continuing to be very strong. So that is really good news. It's good news for Mako. It's good news for Medical. 
On the small capital side, we've always said that, that tends to lag a little bit, the recovery in discretionary procedures. And you certainly saw that within certainly the Endoscopy division and the Instruments division, where I would say that those orders are maybe going to take a little longer to really come back in the same way. But overall, I mean, we have enough confidence now with the hospitals being ready to do these procedures as soon as the pandemic starts to subside, as soon as vaccines start to become more prevalent that they'll turn it on pretty quickly, and they'll be pretty agile. And that's why we feel pretty confident of being able to give, I think, a healthy guide, certainly going back off of '19, 8% to 10% organic. 
So we -- so it will spike throughout the year, starting with, obviously, a slower Q1. And the good news is we have the whole year. So even if the discretionary procedures drag a little bit, we saw in Q3 a pretty big spike once things started getting healthy. So over the course of the year, we're hoping that and believe that the guidance we'll be able to sustain. Even if it's maybe a little softer in Q2 and a little stronger maybe in Q3."

But the revenue goes a little higher, right? The 8% to 10% over '19 is a little better than the earnings growth guidance.

So should we interpret that 8% to 10% number, Kevin, relative to the structural growth rate? And what are some of the key factors underpinning that? Or how do you think about the structural growth rate of Stryker here as we come out of COVID-19? And then I have a quick follow-up."

And I think that muscle that we developed, the structure that we have with our business units, the new product pipeline that we have, has positioned us to be an above-market grower. And we expect -- fully expect that, that will continue into 2021. 
There are obviously differences by divisions, but we feel like we're in a very healthy position overall. And that's what gives us confidence in the guide. 
Clearly, Wright Medical is a big acquisition. There are dis-synergies that we've assumed there. It was highly dilutive to the normal operation of our business. We'll see how that unfolds over the course of the year. The early signs of the integration are very positive, but we have put in some prudence there just based on what we've experienced with our K2M acquisition and what, frankly, all other implant companies have experienced with their integration."

No, we remain very bullish about our general replacement business as well as Mako. You saw just the increase in Mako is pretty remarkable to have almost 1 out of 2 knees being done on Mako, and it's not been that many years since we launched the system. So unlike Navigation in the past, which obviously never had this type of an uptake, we continue to have strong, not only installations of robots but utilization. And even Hips, we're seeing that continue to increase as well. And the new Hips software was installed in about 400 accounts in Q4. So we had the approval, obviously, earlier in the year. But because of the pandemic, it's taken us time to actually be able to go in and do the upgrades, but that will pick up steam again into 2021. 
So again, looking at 1 quarter, whether it's a positive or negative in a pandemic world, is not something I'm too concerned about. It's just based on where your regional strength is. If you happen to be in a state or locality that is doing procedures, then you got benefit, and if you didn't, you got hurt. So it's a little bit random during the pandemic, but structurally, I think we're in great shape with that business."

So I'm not going to get into too much detail, just for competitive reasons, but I would say that I'm delighted with the ASC offense that we put in place. It involves people from different parts of Stryker that basically quarterback the deal and bring in multiple divisions based on the unique needs of every ASC. 
Every ASC is unique. Every deal is a customized deal. But the way we've navigated this enables incredible collaboration across our divisions. We've put just absolutely fantastic people in charge. And really, we have the breadth of our portfolio with capital, equipment, disposables and implants. And really, for the first time as a company, we're really leveraging that in the United States. We have had success with such models, sometimes in other countries around the world, but in the U.S., this ASC model has been truly fantastic, exceeded my expectations. And I'm bullish that they'll be able to continue to have great success in the ASCs. 
And frankly, Mako is often part of that formula in the ASC. Not always. We obviously had a presence before with sports, but that business, fortunately, has really started to grow. As you even heard in the fourth quarter, in spite of the pandemic, it grew over 9%. And so having a strong sports business plus all of our other businesses and now with Wright having Extremities, category-leading position, we just have a fantastic portfolio to serve the needs of the ASC, and now a commercial offense, again, not getting too specific, but let's just say, we make it easy for the ASC, and we provide customized solutions."

But clearly, we now see it's going to be significantly higher than 50%, which I think 5 years ago, nobody would have believed if we had said that. So that's pretty remarkable. 
In terms of the actual use of Mako. As you saw, we had a lot of robots installed this year. So I would expect that looking at the percentage of  knees done with Mako will continue to increase, same with hips. 
Outside the United States, it's taking a little longer, obviously, because of the approvals. But we're really excited about getting the total knee approved in China, Brazil and Russia. And certainly, Japan and China are going to be very, very good markets for us. Japan, we've made some progress already. The approvals took a little longer there as well. But the new hip software, of course, is also very important. As you know, there's a lot more hip procedures done in that part of the world. It's almost about the same as knees, unlike the United States. 
So we love the fact that we have multiple applications all approved in those markets and would expect you're going to see a similar kind of growth that you saw in the United States. It may not be quite as quick, and you've seen that, frankly, with Intuit in soft tissue robotics. The uptake is a little slower outside the United States. But we expect the same kind of runway longer term and are very bullish about the prospects, especially in China, Japan, Brazil, for sure, are going to be terrific markets for Mako."

And that's part of the drag that you see within the Endoscopy division is the booms and lights portion. But certainly, in ASCs, they're busy, but certainly the large capital spend projects were delayed a little bit. They're starting to pick back up again. So that's obviously a smaller business, but then the overall Stryker. 
But Medical, we continue to feel bullish. So it's -- so we did get a bit of pandemic benefit. But this new bed that we've launched is really a fantastic product, getting great customer feedback. Sage has also picked up. So that was really hit hard in the second quarter, third quarter. Had a nice pickup in Q4. And that business will resume its high growth as the pandemic subsides. 
So the diversity of our portfolio is really -- that gives us the optimism that we're going to continue to see strong growth in Medical.

But for the upper extremities side, it's much more of just bringing them into Stryker and continuing on with the growth that they've had. 
So it's a little bit different from that perspective as we think about bringing on the acquisition of Wright versus K2. Just like with any -- in all of our previous acquisitions, we've learned and we've learned along the way and we use those learnings as we plan for additional or new acquisitions that are coming. The same was true with Wright. And so we utilized really that year-long period between sign and close to ensure that we're focused on getting the correct integration plans in place so that we can hit the ground running. And to date, that's what the team has done. They have executed to the plan. And as I'd mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've really done a lot of focus on ensuring that the sales organizations are being integrated in a timely fashion.

It's a good thing for health care overall. And these surgery centers make good money. They're very profitable. They don't have the burden of the cost of large inpatient hospitals.

We've also made commitments to reduce our debt over the next few years. And so that will be something that's ongoing. And you'll see that in our financial performance. 
But because M&A is so important to our growth strategy -- and keep in mind that our normal M&A strategy is really just smaller tuck-in deals. It's what we do well. It's what we do best, and we can execute those quickly. So I think just like with Orthosensor, you'll see us continuing with smaller tuck-in acquisitions like we normally do through the year. And I don't anticipate that you'll see a sort of a big acquisition of the size of Wright Medical for a couple of years. 
And frankly, if you think back to even when we did Sage and when we did Physio, those were 2 very large acquisitions. We moved into a strategy for a year or 2 of just doing tuck-ins, which served us very well. And so I think it will play out very similar to that."

So certainly, you would expect that hips might be a little less deferrable than knees, just given the nature of the disease and degeneration. But at the same time, elective procedures, depending on where you were in the world, were being stopped. And so hips were not immune to that, like some of our other elective procedures.

And cross-selling opportunities will exist. But as Preston mentioned before, this integration is not going to be as tricky as the integration on foot and ankle, just given that we tended to -- they tended to be strong with the, I'll call it, fully dedicated upper extremity surgeons. And we tended to be stronger with those surgeons that did a smaller number, just as a general statement. So I think this integration is going to be terrific. 
We were really thrilled to be able to have the leader from Wright Medical take over the combined business of upper extremities. And their Head of Sales is also running the combined sales organization, and they're both outstanding leaders. And we are delighted not only to bring the business and the products of Wright Medical but being able to bring over some of their key leadership.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the current environment and our most recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.  
I would like to start my comments by expressing my appreciation for the perseverance shown by our employees as they work through the many challenges that we faced during 2020. Throughout the year, we maintained high employee engagement while continuing to support surgeons and caregivers around the world.  
Our fourth quarter organic sales declined roughly 1%, reflecting the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, offset by a continuation of emergent procedures and strong performance by our large capital products. We are also excited about closing the Wright Medical deal during the quarter and the category leadership that we gained in the fastest-growing segment within the orthopedics market. Preston will provide some additional updates on the integration shortly.  
Throughout the quarter, we maintained the financial discipline instituted at the beginning of the pandemic, which, combined with a favorable tax rate, led to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.81 in the quarter, up approximately 13% versus 2019. And we delivered impressive cash flow from operations, which exceeded $3 billion for the full year.  
In addition to closing the Wright Medical acquisition, we also made progress in many areas that will provide future growth opportunities. We have established a structure focused on digital, robotics and enabling technology, where we see a significant opportunity to create a company-wide unified digital ecosystem, including Mako. We maintained our commitment to drive innovation across our various business units, including Neurovascular, where we gained new product approvals across Aspiration, stent retrievers and flow diverting stents, and in our MedSurg segment where we continue product introductions with a focus on safety and prevention.  
Finally, we successfully launched our ASC sales model, which leverages the Stryker portfolio to provide end-to-end solutions to meet the growing demand and shift to the outpatient setting. Our continued support for our customers and our commitment to innovation will position us well for growth as the pandemic eventually subsides.  
Turning to 2021. Our people and culture of execution remains strong, which will allow us to deliver on our commitment to make health care better and to resume our customary strong organic sales growth and leveraged earnings. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Preston."

My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and Orthosensor. During the fourth quarter, elective procedures",871,"Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and Orthosensor. During the fourth quarter, elective procedures were negatively pressured in most regions globally as localized infection and hospitalization rates surged through the month of December. As a result, growth was uneven and correlated to the state of the pandemic in each region. The areas impacted the most include the U.S. and many of the countries in Western Europe, most notably, the United Kingdom, driven by a countrywide lockdown.  
Even with the procedural variability, we saw growth in emerging markets, including China, which grew double digits over prior year quarter. Looking forward, hospitals are better equipped to handle this resurgence, and they are working to bring back the procedures that have been delayed. But we expect that the variability of elective procedures will continue during the first quarter until infection rates begin to decline and the distribution of the vaccines become more prevalent. This slowdown in elective procedures had a negative impact on our more deferrable businesses, which make up approximately 40% to 50% of our total sales.  
However, the slowdown this quarter was not as impactful as the decline in the second quarter as hospitals were better equipped to manage COVID patients while maintaining some level of elective surgeries. Despite the overall slowdown, we experienced continued growth in our Neurovascular, Medical, Mako and Upper Extremities businesses. Specifically, demand for Medical's large capital products continued in the fourth quarter, driven by the focus on expanding bed capacity, the need for our emergency care products, like power cot and the LUCAS device, and the availability of some remaining CARES Act funding in the U.S. In addition, the early trends in the launch of our new ProCuity bed are positive and expect it to continue into 2021.  
During the year, our Mako installed base grew by 33% and exceeded another milestone with over 100 robots sold and installed in the fourth quarter. This growth continues to highlight the demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology as well as our ongoing success selling and installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs and competitive accounts.  
We are also excited about our recent approvals for Mako TKA in China, Russia and Brazil, which all provide opportunities for growth as these markets continue to embrace robotic, digital and enabling technologies. 
Turning to U.S. knee procedures. In the fourth quarter, approximately 44% of our total knees were Mako Knee procedures, a trend that continues to increase. The shift towards cementless knees also continued, and in the fourth quarter, cementless knees made up 42% of our U.S. knee procedures.  
During the pandemic, feedback from surgeons has pointed to limited trialing of competitive products in businesses like joint replacement as surgeons work to perform procedures restricted by cancellations and deferrals. However, as the pandemic subsides and we return to a more normal environment, we expect to continue to outpace the market driven by our Mako installations throughout the year and our strong order book heading into 2021.  
We are also enthusiastic about the Wright Medical acquisition and the category leadership we gained in both upper extremities and foot and ankle through Wright's diverse portfolio of implants, biologics and enabling technologies. The combination of Stryker and Wright will continue to drive innovation that enhances our customers' ability to address patient needs across the more than $3 billion extremities market.  
The integration has been progressing well over the last few months. The long period from sign to close was used to ensure that the appropriate integration plans were in place, leveraging our years of deal experience. To date, the teams have been focused on moving quickly to align the new combined organization. Considerable progress has been made, including the creation of specialized business units and sales forces for trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle, which is a key part of our overall decentralized strategy that allows us to remain close to the customer.  
The U.S. sales leadership organizational structure for these 3 specialized business units has been announced, and the rollout and full alignment of territories will be finalized during the first quarter, as planned. Outside the U.S., the leadership team is working to align the sales forces throughout the year. Our teams are executing the sales integration while continuing to drive day-to-day business. And during the quarter, there was minimal disruption caused by the closing and integration activities.  
Finally, I want to restate our ongoing commitment to M&A, which was most recently demonstrated by our acquisition of Orthosensor, a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for joint replacement. Smart devices and implants will play an important role in the future of orthopedics, and the addition of Orthosensor will allow us to continue to innovate and advance smart sensor technology, including interoperative sensors, wearables and ultimately, smart implants.  
As it relates to 2021 guidance, Glenn will provide an update on our full year guidance for sales, operating margin and EPS. Updates to this annual guidance will be made each quarter as necessary throughout the year.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn."
94614,700117902,2251565,"Stryker Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Stryker Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.  Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter. As a remind",1645,"Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.  
Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q4 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.8% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales.  
Early in the quarter, there was continued momentum from Q3. However, during November, the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the related cancellations of procedures, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, significantly impacted our sales momentum. However, we did see demand for certain capital products continue as we had strong results in our Mako, medical beds and emergency care products.  
For the quarter, U.S. organic sales declined 1.5%, reflecting the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, Medical products and Neurovascular products. International organic sales were flat, impacted by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in Europe, which was mostly offset by growth in Canada, China and Brazil. Organic sales decline for the year was 4.8%, with a U.S. decline of 5.8% and an international decline of 2.1%.  
2020 had 1 additional selling day compared to 2019. And for the year, price had an unfavorable 0.7% impact on sales. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.81 increased 12.9% from the prior year, reflecting strong financial discipline, good operating expense control and a favorable operational tax rate. Our fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by $0.03 from foreign currency. Our full year EPS was $7.43, which is a decline of 10%, reflecting the impact of lower sales, especially in Q2, as well as the impact of idling certain manufacturing facilities during the year, offset by strong expense discipline throughout the year.  
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 2.8% and an organic sales decline of 5.8%, including an organic decline of 5.7% in the U.S. This reflects a slowdown in elective procedures related to COVID-19 and a very strong prior year comparable as Q4 2019 U.S. organic growth was 7.2%. Other ortho grew 12.3% in the U.S., primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako Robotics platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. The Trauma and Extremities business also delivered positive growth, led by our core trauma and shoulder products.  
Internationally, Orthopaedics declined 6% organically which also reflects the COVID-19-related procedural slowdown, especially in Europe. This was somewhat offset by stronger performances in Australia and Canada.  
During the quarter, the Wright Medical acquisition was successfully closed. For the quarter, Wright delivered flat growth on a comparable basis. This included positive performances in U.S. shoulder, double-digit growth in U.S. ankle as well as strong international growth led by Australia. On a comparable basis for the full year, Wright had a 10.3% decline, mainly driven by the COVID-19-related slowdown in the second quarter.  
In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency growth of 1.5% and organic growth of 1.3%, which included 2.2% growth in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 4.5%. In the quarter, sales growth was driven by gains in its power tool, waste management and smoke evacuation products and its service business.  
Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 7%, primarily impacted by the slowdown in the capital businesses, offset by gains in the Sports Medicine business, which grew over 9% in the quarter. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 9.7%, reflecting solid performances in patient care, emergency care and its Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had an organic sales decline of 2.4%, reflecting a general slowdown in Instruments and Endoscopy businesses and strong comparables across most geographies.  
Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 2.1%. This growth reflects many strong performances within our Neurotech product line, including neuro-powered drills, Sonopet and Neurovascular, offset by the impact of procedural deferrals, especially in the U.S. Our Europe -- our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic decline of 1.2% as procedural deferrals impacted sales in the quarter. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 13.5%. This performance was driven by strong demand in Australia, Japan and China.  
Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.1% was unfavorable approximately 120 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin dilution was impacted by price, business mix and unabsorbed fixed costs as production was brought in line with reduced demand during the quarter. This was primarily offset by acquisitions and foreign exchange.  
Adjusted R&D spending was 5.5% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 30.3% of sales, which was favorable to the prior year quarter by 200 basis points. This reflects the continued focus on disciplined operating expense controls, which have been in place since the second quarter. These cover most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings and consultants.  
In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 29.2% of sales, which is a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and reflects the impact of the spending discipline previously discussed. Related to other income and expense as compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding related to the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 8%. Our full year effective tax rate was 12.6%. 
These rates reflect onetime operational fluctuations that arose due to the pandemic, with a mix of foreign losses related to lower foreign manufacturing activity combined with reduced U.S.-sourced income that resulted from the sharp drop in sales at the end of the year. For 2021, we do not anticipate these circumstances arising as we expect to return to normalized operations during the year. And we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.  
Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $14 billion. During the quarter, we executed the Wright Medical acquisition, which resulted in the disbursement of $5.6 billion, inclusive of the retirement of Wright's convertible debt.  
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $3.3 billion. This historically strong performance resulted from the disciplined working capital management, somewhat offset by lower earnings.  
Turning to cash flow for 2021. We will not be repurchasing any shares, and we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately $650 million. Anticipating a more normalized year in 2021 and a ramping of investment in our businesses, we expect the free cash flow conversion rate as a percent of adjusted net earnings excluding the onetime impacts from the Wright Medical integration of 70% to 80%.  
And now I will provide 2021 guidance on a stand-alone legacy basis and further guidance, including Wright Medical. We are providing our guidance in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. As Preston indicated, we will be providing annual guidance on our organic sales growth and earnings, and we'll update this throughout the year as part of our regular earnings calls.  
As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. Given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2019. As a reference, our organic sales growth excludes Wright Medical. There are the same number of selling days in 2021 compared to 2019 and 1 less when comparing to 2020.  
Consistent with the pricing environment experienced in both 2019 and 2020, we would expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1%. Additionally, as we are comparing growth to 2019, our 2021 organic sales growth guidance includes 2 years of price reductions. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales in EPS will be modestly favorably impacted as compared to 2020 and 2019.  
For the full year 2021, we did not expect to deliver operating margin expansion as a result of the op margin dilution of the Wright Medical acquisition. However, excluding the dilutive impact from Wright, we do anticipate expansion of 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2021 for our legacy Stryker business compared to 2019. This includes anticipated increases in hiring, discretionary expenses and other costs that support future growth and business expansion as our businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels.  
Finally, for 2021, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $8.80 to $9.20 for the full year. This includes the previously announced $0.10 dilution driven by the addition of the Wright Medical business for the full year. While Wright Medical is dilutive in 2021, we expect it to be accretive starting in 2022.  
As it relates to other aspects of Wright Medical, we expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be in the low to mid-single digits in 2021 when compared to 2019. This includes the integration of Stryker's legacy extremity business with Wright Medical, which will all be part of our Trauma and Extremities division. This growth is impacted by the recovery from COVID-19, partially offset by dis-synergies from the integration activities in 2021. We also reiterate our previous guidance on cost-saving synergies from the deal of approximately $100 million to $125 million over the next 3 years.  
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

So when you mix all that together and you really look at what will Trauma and Extremities growth be in 2021 as compared to 2019, we do think it will be low to mid-single digits. But keep in mind that also takes into account sales dis-synergies for Wright Medical that we fully expect will happen in 2021."

It's -- Vijay, I would tell you that based on what happened this year and the variability that we saw in our operations, we fully expect to continue to experience some variability on into Q2. And so our guidance range really reflects how that ramp comes back. 
On the low end, it could be all the way through Q2. On the better end, we start to see much more improvement towards the beginning of Q2. And it really is going to be variable depending on that. I mean we have passed our legacy Stryker business on the op margin front with 30 to 50 basis points improvement. But keep in mind, as you look at Q4 or if you even go back and look at Q3, it really reflected a pretty Draconian expense control in terms of hiring, travel, meetings, consultants, you name it, discretionary expenses, and we put the lid on that. 
So that's not sustainable, especially as you think about our aspirations to grow at the high end of med device. And So we will start seeing that spending pick up as we continue to supplement and hire our sales forces, as we meet with customers, as we add to our prototypes and loaner pools, all those things will start to add to our expenses. And so that's really what's underlying the guidance."

As far as Wright Medical goes, we were pretty pleased with where their Q4 performance came out, but they're also subject to a lot of the same variability, which is why we're looking that once we integrate it with Trauma and Extremities, we will have some sales dis-synergies that just naturally occur. We felt that with K2 and Spine, and we will fill that with Wright Medical. So taking into account that variability, you're really looking at 8% to 10% for the -- for Stryker legacy and low to mid-single digits as we look at the combined Wright and Trauma and Extremities."

I would say, certainly, at the end of the year, really did we got that second wave spiking. And certainly, you saw that in the discretionary procedures, a pretty big slowdown after a pretty good month of October. And it really started to tail off November, December. 
On the large capital front, we're actually very excited. So what we experienced through Q2, Q3 and Q4 from an order book standpoint is continuing to be very strong. So that is really good news. It's good news for Mako. It's good news for Medical. 
On the small capital side, we've always said that, that tends to lag a little bit, the recovery in discretionary procedures. And you certainly saw that within certainly the Endoscopy division and the Instruments division, where I would say that those orders are maybe going to take a little longer to really come back in the same way. But overall, I mean, we have enough confidence now with the hospitals being ready to do these procedures as soon as the pandemic starts to subside, as soon as vaccines start to become more prevalent that they'll turn it on pretty quickly, and they'll be pretty agile. And that's why we feel pretty confident of being able to give, I think, a healthy guide, certainly going back off of '19, 8% to 10% organic. 
So we -- so it will spike throughout the year, starting with, obviously, a slower Q1. And the good news is we have the whole year. So even if the discretionary procedures drag a little bit, we saw in Q3 a pretty big spike once things started getting healthy. So over the course of the year, we're hoping that and believe that the guidance we'll be able to sustain. Even if it's maybe a little softer in Q2 and a little stronger maybe in Q3."

So should we interpret that 8% to 10% number, Kevin, relative to the structural growth rate? And what are some of the key factors underpinning that?

I mean without getting into every single division, what I would just give you as a macro comment is we feel that we have the right offense to continue to win in the market and to continue the strong growth.

And we expect -- fully expect that, that will continue into 2021. 
There are obviously differences by divisions, but we feel like we're in a very healthy position overall. And that's what gives us confidence in the guide. 
Clearly, Wright Medical is a big acquisition. There are dis-synergies that we've assumed there. It was highly dilutive to the normal operation of our business. We'll see how that unfolds over the course of the year. The early signs of the integration are very positive, but we have put in some prudence there just based on what we've experienced with our K2M acquisition and what, frankly, all other implant companies have experienced with their integration."

And even Hips, we're seeing that continue to increase as well. And the new Hips software was installed in about 400 accounts in Q4. So we had the approval, obviously, earlier in the year. But because of the pandemic, it's taken us time to actually be able to go in and do the upgrades, but that will pick up steam again into 2021. 
So again, looking at 1 quarter, whether it's a positive or negative in a pandemic world, is not something I'm too concerned about. It's just based on where your regional strength is.

In terms of that patient backlog, certainly, we saw some of that being worked down in the third quarter as we saw the recovery starting to happen. And certainly, as then we saw more deferrals happening in the fourth quarter, you saw more people being added back to that backlog. 
And as Kevin and Glenn both articulated, as we see the recovery happening in 2021, we would expect to see some of that recovery include the backlog of patients that have been deferring now for -- anywhere from 3 to 6 months or so. And so we would expect to see some of that flowing back into the numbers through 2021. 
I think the one caveat I would give you is you won't necessarily see a dramatic spike in those numbers just given certain aspects around capacity and things like that. So you'll still see surgeons and hospitals working to fit additional surgeries in and things -- the same things that we saw in the third quarter. But you certainly won't see a significant dramatic spike at any one point in time as a result of that backlog."

There also is a synergy with the way that our system ensures an absolutely perfect cut and with haptics, which we're the only ones that have. That is very complementary with cementless.

So I'm not going to get into too much detail, just for competitive reasons, but I would say that I'm delighted with the ASC offense that we put in place. It involves people from different parts of Stryker that basically quarterback the deal and bring in multiple divisions based on the unique needs of every ASC. 
Every ASC is unique. Every deal is a customized deal. But the way we've navigated this enables incredible collaboration across our divisions. We've put just absolutely fantastic people in charge. And really, we have the breadth of our portfolio with capital, equipment, disposables and implants. And really, for the first time as a company, we're really leveraging that in the United States. We have had success with such models, sometimes in other countries around the world, but in the U.S., this ASC model has been truly fantastic, exceeded my expectations. And I'm bullish that they'll be able to continue to have great success in the ASCs. 
And frankly, Mako is often part of that formula in the ASC. Not always. We obviously had a presence before with sports, but that business, fortunately, has really started to grow. As you even heard in the fourth quarter, in spite of the pandemic, it grew over 9%. And so having a strong sports business plus all of our other businesses and now with Wright having Extremities, category-leading position, we just have a fantastic portfolio to serve the needs of the ASC, and now a commercial offense, again, not getting too specific, but let's just say, we make it easy for the ASC, and we provide customized solutions."

But clearly, we now see it's going to be significantly higher than 50%, which I think 5 years ago, nobody would have believed if we had said that. So that's pretty remarkable. 
In terms of the actual use of Mako. As you saw, we had a lot of robots installed this year. So I would expect that looking at the percentage of  knees done with Mako will continue to increase, same with hips. 
Outside the United States, it's taking a little longer, obviously, because of the approvals. But we're really excited about getting the total knee approved in China, Brazil and Russia. And certainly, Japan and China are going to be very, very good markets for us. Japan, we've made some progress already. The approvals took a little longer there as well. But the new hip software, of course, is also very important. As you know, there's a lot more hip procedures done in that part of the world. It's almost about the same as knees, unlike the United States. 
So we love the fact that we have multiple applications all approved in those markets and would expect you're going to see a similar kind of growth that you saw in the United States. It may not be quite as quick, and you've seen that, frankly, with Intuit in soft tissue robotics. The uptake is a little slower outside the United States. But we expect the same kind of runway longer term and are very bullish about the prospects, especially in China, Japan, Brazil, for sure, are going to be terrific markets for Mako."

And that's part of the drag that you see within the Endoscopy division is the booms and lights portion. But certainly, in ASCs, they're busy, but certainly the large capital spend projects were delayed a little bit. They're starting to pick back up again. So that's obviously a smaller business, but then the overall Stryker. 
But Medical, we continue to feel bullish. So it's -- so we did get a bit of pandemic benefit. But this new bed that we've launched is really a fantastic product, getting great customer feedback. Sage has also picked up. So that was really hit hard in the second quarter, third quarter. Had a nice pickup in Q4. And that business will resume its high growth as the pandemic subsides.

And it wasn't just sort of a pandemic bump and then will suddenly drop because of the innovation in our portfolio and, frankly, just really, really strong commercial execution."

So certainly, as I think about those 2 acquisitions, there are some similarities, and then there are some pretty big differences. The similarities maybe lie in the foot and ankle side, where there is more of a true integration what's happening between the Stryker business and the Wright business. But for the upper extremities side, it's much more of just bringing them into Stryker and continuing on with the growth that they've had. 
So it's a little bit different from that perspective as we think about bringing on the acquisition of Wright versus K2. Just like with any -- in all of our previous acquisitions, we've learned and we've learned along the way and we use those learnings as we plan for additional or new acquisitions that are coming. The same was true with Wright. And so we utilized really that year-long period between sign and close to ensure that we're focused on getting the correct integration plans in place so that we can hit the ground running. And to date, that's what the team has done. They have executed to the plan. And as I'd mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've really done a lot of focus on ensuring that the sales organizations are being integrated in a timely fashion. And so that's where we are at this point. And certainly, we'll continue to provide some updates as we continue with the integration throughout the year."

And I actually think it's not going to stop in United States. There's already countries like the U.K. and even Canada looking at moving to lower cost sites of care. It's a good thing for health care overall. And these surgery centers make good money. They're very profitable. They don't have the burden of the cost of large inpatient hospitals. So you can debate the actual pace of the curve, but there's no doubt in my mind that this is a trend that's going to continue to accelerate."

And I don't anticipate that you'll see a sort of a big acquisition of the size of Wright Medical for a couple of years. 
And frankly, if you think back to even when we did Sage and when we did Physio, those were 2 very large acquisitions. We moved into a strategy for a year or 2 of just doing tuck-ins, which served us very well. And so I think it will play out very similar to that."

And we tended to be stronger with those surgeons that did a smaller number, just as a general statement. So I think this integration is going to be terrific. 
We were really thrilled to be able to have the leader from Wright Medical take over the combined business of upper extremities.

And we are delighted not only to bring the business and the products of Wright Medical but being able to bring over some of their key leadership.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the current environment and our most recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.  
I would like to start my comments by expressing my appreciation for the perseverance shown by our employees as they work through the many challenges that we faced during 2020. Throughout the year, we maintained high employee engagement while continuing to support surgeons and caregivers around the world.  
Our fourth quarter organic sales declined roughly 1%, reflecting the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, offset by a continuation of emergent procedures and strong performance by our large capital products. We are also excited about closing the Wright Medical deal during the quarter and the category leadership that we gained in the fastest-growing segment within the orthopedics market. Preston will provide some additional updates on the integration shortly.  
Throughout the quarter, we maintained the financial discipline instituted at the beginning of the pandemic, which, combined with a favorable tax rate, led to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.81 in the quarter, up approximately 13% versus 2019. And we delivered impressive cash flow from operations, which exceeded $3 billion for the full year.  
In addition to closing the Wright Medical acquisition, we also made progress in many areas that will provide future growth opportunities. We have established a structure focused on digital, robotics and enabling technology, where we see a significant opportunity to create a company-wide unified digital ecosystem, including Mako. We maintained our commitment to drive innovation across our various business units, including Neurovascular, where we gained new product approvals across Aspiration, stent retrievers and flow diverting stents, and in our MedSurg segment where we continue product introductions with a focus on safety and prevention.  
Finally, we successfully launched our ASC sales model, which leverages the Stryker portfolio to provide end-to-end solutions to meet the growing demand and shift to the outpatient setting. Our continued support for our customers and our commitment to innovation will position us well for growth as the pandemic eventually subsides.  
Turning to 2021. Our people and culture of execution remains strong, which will allow us to deliver on our commitment to make health care better and to resume our customary strong organic sales growth and leveraged earnings. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Preston."

My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and Orthosensor. During the fourth quarter, elective procedures",871,"Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and Orthosensor. During the fourth quarter, elective procedures were negatively pressured in most regions globally as localized infection and hospitalization rates surged through the month of December. As a result, growth was uneven and correlated to the state of the pandemic in each region. The areas impacted the most include the U.S. and many of the countries in Western Europe, most notably, the United Kingdom, driven by a countrywide lockdown.  
Even with the procedural variability, we saw growth in emerging markets, including China, which grew double digits over prior year quarter. Looking forward, hospitals are better equipped to handle this resurgence, and they are working to bring back the procedures that have been delayed. But we expect that the variability of elective procedures will continue during the first quarter until infection rates begin to decline and the distribution of the vaccines become more prevalent. This slowdown in elective procedures had a negative impact on our more deferrable businesses, which make up approximately 40% to 50% of our total sales.  
However, the slowdown this quarter was not as impactful as the decline in the second quarter as hospitals were better equipped to manage COVID patients while maintaining some level of elective surgeries. Despite the overall slowdown, we experienced continued growth in our Neurovascular, Medical, Mako and Upper Extremities businesses. Specifically, demand for Medical's large capital products continued in the fourth quarter, driven by the focus on expanding bed capacity, the need for our emergency care products, like power cot and the LUCAS device, and the availability of some remaining CARES Act funding in the U.S. In addition, the early trends in the launch of our new ProCuity bed are positive and expect it to continue into 2021.  
During the year, our Mako installed base grew by 33% and exceeded another milestone with over 100 robots sold and installed in the fourth quarter. This growth continues to highlight the demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology as well as our ongoing success selling and installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs and competitive accounts.  
We are also excited about our recent approvals for Mako TKA in China, Russia and Brazil, which all provide opportunities for growth as these markets continue to embrace robotic, digital and enabling technologies. 
Turning to U.S. knee procedures. In the fourth quarter, approximately 44% of our total knees were Mako Knee procedures, a trend that continues to increase. The shift towards cementless knees also continued, and in the fourth quarter, cementless knees made up 42% of our U.S. knee procedures.  
During the pandemic, feedback from surgeons has pointed to limited trialing of competitive products in businesses like joint replacement as surgeons work to perform procedures restricted by cancellations and deferrals. However, as the pandemic subsides and we return to a more normal environment, we expect to continue to outpace the market driven by our Mako installations throughout the year and our strong order book heading into 2021.  
We are also enthusiastic about the Wright Medical acquisition and the category leadership we gained in both upper extremities and foot and ankle through Wright's diverse portfolio of implants, biologics and enabling technologies. The combination of Stryker and Wright will continue to drive innovation that enhances our customers' ability to address patient needs across the more than $3 billion extremities market.  
The integration has been progressing well over the last few months. The long period from sign to close was used to ensure that the appropriate integration plans were in place, leveraging our years of deal experience. To date, the teams have been focused on moving quickly to align the new combined organization. Considerable progress has been made, including the creation of specialized business units and sales forces for trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle, which is a key part of our overall decentralized strategy that allows us to remain close to the customer.  
The U.S. sales leadership organizational structure for these 3 specialized business units has been announced, and the rollout and full alignment of territories will be finalized during the first quarter, as planned. Outside the U.S., the leadership team is working to align the sales forces throughout the year. Our teams are executing the sales integration while continuing to drive day-to-day business. And during the quarter, there was minimal disruption caused by the closing and integration activities.  
Finally, I want to restate our ongoing commitment to M&A, which was most recently demonstrated by our acquisition of Orthosensor, a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for joint replacement. Smart devices and implants will play an important role in the future of orthopedics, and the addition of Orthosensor will allow us to continue to innovate and advance smart sensor technology, including interoperative sensors, wearables and ultimately, smart implants.  
As it relates to 2021 guidance, Glenn will provide an update on our full year guidance for sales, operating margin and EPS. Updates to this annual guidance will be made each quarter as necessary throughout the year.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn."
94614,700117902,2251568,"Stryker Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Stryker Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.  Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter. As a remind",1645,"Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.  
Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q4 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.8% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales.  
Early in the quarter, there was continued momentum from Q3. However, during November, the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the related cancellations of procedures, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, significantly impacted our sales momentum. However, we did see demand for certain capital products continue as we had strong results in our Mako, medical beds and emergency care products.  
For the quarter, U.S. organic sales declined 1.5%, reflecting the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, Medical products and Neurovascular products. International organic sales were flat, impacted by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in Europe, which was mostly offset by growth in Canada, China and Brazil. Organic sales decline for the year was 4.8%, with a U.S. decline of 5.8% and an international decline of 2.1%.  
2020 had 1 additional selling day compared to 2019. And for the year, price had an unfavorable 0.7% impact on sales. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.81 increased 12.9% from the prior year, reflecting strong financial discipline, good operating expense control and a favorable operational tax rate. Our fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by $0.03 from foreign currency. Our full year EPS was $7.43, which is a decline of 10%, reflecting the impact of lower sales, especially in Q2, as well as the impact of idling certain manufacturing facilities during the year, offset by strong expense discipline throughout the year.  
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 2.8% and an organic sales decline of 5.8%, including an organic decline of 5.7% in the U.S. This reflects a slowdown in elective procedures related to COVID-19 and a very strong prior year comparable as Q4 2019 U.S. organic growth was 7.2%. Other ortho grew 12.3% in the U.S., primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako Robotics platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. The Trauma and Extremities business also delivered positive growth, led by our core trauma and shoulder products.  
Internationally, Orthopaedics declined 6% organically which also reflects the COVID-19-related procedural slowdown, especially in Europe. This was somewhat offset by stronger performances in Australia and Canada.  
During the quarter, the Wright Medical acquisition was successfully closed. For the quarter, Wright delivered flat growth on a comparable basis. This included positive performances in U.S. shoulder, double-digit growth in U.S. ankle as well as strong international growth led by Australia. On a comparable basis for the full year, Wright had a 10.3% decline, mainly driven by the COVID-19-related slowdown in the second quarter.  
In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency growth of 1.5% and organic growth of 1.3%, which included 2.2% growth in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 4.5%. In the quarter, sales growth was driven by gains in its power tool, waste management and smoke evacuation products and its service business.  
Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 7%, primarily impacted by the slowdown in the capital businesses, offset by gains in the Sports Medicine business, which grew over 9% in the quarter. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 9.7%, reflecting solid performances in patient care, emergency care and its Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had an organic sales decline of 2.4%, reflecting a general slowdown in Instruments and Endoscopy businesses and strong comparables across most geographies.  
Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 2.1%. This growth reflects many strong performances within our Neurotech product line, including neuro-powered drills, Sonopet and Neurovascular, offset by the impact of procedural deferrals, especially in the U.S. Our Europe -- our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic decline of 1.2% as procedural deferrals impacted sales in the quarter. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 13.5%. This performance was driven by strong demand in Australia, Japan and China.  
Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.1% was unfavorable approximately 120 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin dilution was impacted by price, business mix and unabsorbed fixed costs as production was brought in line with reduced demand during the quarter. This was primarily offset by acquisitions and foreign exchange.  
Adjusted R&D spending was 5.5% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 30.3% of sales, which was favorable to the prior year quarter by 200 basis points. This reflects the continued focus on disciplined operating expense controls, which have been in place since the second quarter. These cover most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings and consultants.  
In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 29.2% of sales, which is a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and reflects the impact of the spending discipline previously discussed. Related to other income and expense as compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding related to the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 8%. Our full year effective tax rate was 12.6%. 
These rates reflect onetime operational fluctuations that arose due to the pandemic, with a mix of foreign losses related to lower foreign manufacturing activity combined with reduced U.S.-sourced income that resulted from the sharp drop in sales at the end of the year. For 2021, we do not anticipate these circumstances arising as we expect to return to normalized operations during the year. And we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.  
Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $14 billion. During the quarter, we executed the Wright Medical acquisition, which resulted in the disbursement of $5.6 billion, inclusive of the retirement of Wright's convertible debt.  
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $3.3 billion. This historically strong performance resulted from the disciplined working capital management, somewhat offset by lower earnings.  
Turning to cash flow for 2021. We will not be repurchasing any shares, and we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately $650 million. Anticipating a more normalized year in 2021 and a ramping of investment in our businesses, we expect the free cash flow conversion rate as a percent of adjusted net earnings excluding the onetime impacts from the Wright Medical integration of 70% to 80%.  
And now I will provide 2021 guidance on a stand-alone legacy basis and further guidance, including Wright Medical. We are providing our guidance in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. As Preston indicated, we will be providing annual guidance on our organic sales growth and earnings, and we'll update this throughout the year as part of our regular earnings calls.  
As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. Given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2019. As a reference, our organic sales growth excludes Wright Medical. There are the same number of selling days in 2021 compared to 2019 and 1 less when comparing to 2020.  
Consistent with the pricing environment experienced in both 2019 and 2020, we would expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1%. Additionally, as we are comparing growth to 2019, our 2021 organic sales growth guidance includes 2 years of price reductions. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales in EPS will be modestly favorably impacted as compared to 2020 and 2019.  
For the full year 2021, we did not expect to deliver operating margin expansion as a result of the op margin dilution of the Wright Medical acquisition. However, excluding the dilutive impact from Wright, we do anticipate expansion of 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2021 for our legacy Stryker business compared to 2019. This includes anticipated increases in hiring, discretionary expenses and other costs that support future growth and business expansion as our businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels.  
Finally, for 2021, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $8.80 to $9.20 for the full year. This includes the previously announced $0.10 dilution driven by the addition of the Wright Medical business for the full year. While Wright Medical is dilutive in 2021, we expect it to be accretive starting in 2022.  
As it relates to other aspects of Wright Medical, we expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be in the low to mid-single digits in 2021 when compared to 2019. This includes the integration of Stryker's legacy extremity business with Wright Medical, which will all be part of our Trauma and Extremities division. This growth is impacted by the recovery from COVID-19, partially offset by dis-synergies from the integration activities in 2021. We also reiterate our previous guidance on cost-saving synergies from the deal of approximately $100 million to $125 million over the next 3 years.  
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

It's -- Vijay, I would tell you that based on what happened this year and the variability that we saw in our operations, we fully expect to continue to experience some variability on into Q2. And so our guidance range really reflects how that ramp comes back. 
On the low end, it could be all the way through Q2. On the better end, we start to see much more improvement towards the beginning of Q2. And it really is going to be variable depending on that. I mean we have passed our legacy Stryker business on the op margin front with 30 to 50 basis points improvement. But keep in mind, as you look at Q4 or if you even go back and look at Q3, it really reflected a pretty Draconian expense control in terms of hiring, travel, meetings, consultants, you name it, discretionary expenses, and we put the lid on that. 
So that's not sustainable, especially as you think about our aspirations to grow at the high end of med device. And So we will start seeing that spending pick up as we continue to supplement and hire our sales forces, as we meet with customers, as we add to our prototypes and loaner pools, all those things will start to add to our expenses.

As far as Wright Medical goes, we were pretty pleased with where their Q4 performance came out, but they're also subject to a lot of the same variability, which is why we're looking that once we integrate it with Trauma and Extremities, we will have some sales dis-synergies that just naturally occur. We felt that with K2 and Spine, and we will fill that with Wright Medical. So taking into account that variability, you're really looking at 8% to 10% for the -- for Stryker legacy and low to mid-single digits as we look at the combined Wright and Trauma and Extremities."

I would say, certainly, at the end of the year, really did we got that second wave spiking. And certainly, you saw that in the discretionary procedures, a pretty big slowdown after a pretty good month of October. And it really started to tail off November, December. 
On the large capital front, we're actually very excited. So what we experienced through Q2, Q3 and Q4 from an order book standpoint is continuing to be very strong. So that is really good news. It's good news for Mako. It's good news for Medical. 
On the small capital side, we've always said that, that tends to lag a little bit, the recovery in discretionary procedures. And you certainly saw that within certainly the Endoscopy division and the Instruments division, where I would say that those orders are maybe going to take a little longer to really come back in the same way. But overall, I mean, we have enough confidence now with the hospitals being ready to do these procedures as soon as the pandemic starts to subside, as soon as vaccines start to become more prevalent that they'll turn it on pretty quickly, and they'll be pretty agile. And that's why we feel pretty confident of being able to give, I think, a healthy guide, certainly going back off of '19, 8% to 10% organic. 
So we -- so it will spike throughout the year, starting with, obviously, a slower Q1. And the good news is we have the whole year. So even if the discretionary procedures drag a little bit, we saw in Q3 a pretty big spike once things started getting healthy. So over the course of the year, we're hoping that and believe that the guidance we'll be able to sustain. Even if it's maybe a little softer in Q2 and a little stronger maybe in Q3."

Kevin, I was sort of comparing the revenue guide, the earnings guide. And your earnings guide is kind of interesting to me in that it's basically 12% earnings growth, which you guys were doing kind of the last couple of years minus Wright Medical. But the revenue goes a little higher, right? The 8% to 10% over '19 is a little better than the earnings growth guidance. So it's above your structural growth rate, but I think some would argue probably should be, just given in light of the recovery. So should we interpret that 8% to 10% number, Kevin, relative to the structural growth rate? And what are some of the key factors underpinning that? Or how do you think about the structural growth rate of Stryker here as we come out of COVID-19? And then I have a quick follow-up."

I mean without getting into every single division, what I would just give you as a macro comment is we feel that we have the right offense to continue to win in the market and to continue the strong growth. You saw for 7 straight years, we accelerated our organic growth, and 2019 culminated with over 8% organic growth. And I think that muscle that we developed, the structure that we have with our business units, the new product pipeline that we have, has positioned us to be an above-market grower. And we expect -- fully expect that, that will continue into 2021. 
There are obviously differences by divisions, but we feel like we're in a very healthy position overall. And that's what gives us confidence in the guide. 
Clearly, Wright Medical is a big acquisition. There are dis-synergies that we've assumed there. It was highly dilutive to the normal operation of our business. We'll see how that unfolds over the course of the year. The early signs of the integration are very positive, but we have put in some prudence there just based on what we've experienced with our K2M acquisition and what, frankly, all other implant companies have experienced with their integration."

No, we remain very bullish about our general replacement business as well as Mako. You saw just the increase in Mako is pretty remarkable to have almost 1 out of 2 knees being done on Mako, and it's not been that many years since we launched the system. So unlike Navigation in the past, which obviously never had this type of an uptake, we continue to have strong, not only installations of robots but utilization. And even Hips, we're seeing that continue to increase as well. And the new Hips software was installed in about 400 accounts in Q4. So we had the approval, obviously, earlier in the year. But because of the pandemic, it's taken us time to actually be able to go in and do the upgrades, but that will pick up steam again into 2021. 
So again, looking at 1 quarter, whether it's a positive or negative in a pandemic world, is not something I'm too concerned about. It's just based on where your regional strength is. If you happen to be in a state or locality that is doing procedures, then you got benefit, and if you didn't, you got hurt. So it's a little bit random during the pandemic, but structurally, I think we're in great shape with that business."

I think the one caveat I would give you is you won't necessarily see a dramatic spike in those numbers just given certain aspects around capacity and things like that.

So I'm not going to get into too much detail, just for competitive reasons, but I would say that I'm delighted with the ASC offense that we put in place. It involves people from different parts of Stryker that basically quarterback the deal and bring in multiple divisions based on the unique needs of every ASC. 
Every ASC is unique. Every deal is a customized deal. But the way we've navigated this enables incredible collaboration across our divisions. We've put just absolutely fantastic people in charge. And really, we have the breadth of our portfolio with capital, equipment, disposables and implants. And really, for the first time as a company, we're really leveraging that in the United States. We have had success with such models, sometimes in other countries around the world, but in the U.S., this ASC model has been truly fantastic, exceeded my expectations. And I'm bullish that they'll be able to continue to have great success in the ASCs. 
And frankly, Mako is often part of that formula in the ASC. Not always. We obviously had a presence before with sports, but that business, fortunately, has really started to grow. As you even heard in the fourth quarter, in spite of the pandemic, it grew over 9%. And so having a strong sports business plus all of our other businesses and now with Wright having Extremities, category-leading position, we just have a fantastic portfolio to serve the needs of the ASC, and now a commercial offense, again, not getting too specific, but let's just say, we make it easy for the ASC, and we provide customized solutions."

And again, we saw some continued performance in some of the markets outside the U.S. that had more stability in spine-related procedures like Japan and Canada as well. 
So I think all in all, it held up a little bit better. We definitely expect that business to continue to perform well as we go into 2021 and really harnessing the power across K2M, our legacy Spine business as well as the enabling technologies."

I don't think cementless will ever get to where it is with hips just because of bone stability. It's a weight-bearing joint. But clearly, we now see it's going to be significantly higher than 50%, which I think 5 years ago, nobody would have believed if we had said that. So that's pretty remarkable. 
In terms of the actual use of Mako. As you saw, we had a lot of robots installed this year. So I would expect that looking at the percentage of  knees done with Mako will continue to increase, same with hips. 
Outside the United States, it's taking a little longer, obviously, because of the approvals. But we're really excited about getting the total knee approved in China, Brazil and Russia. And certainly, Japan and China are going to be very, very good markets for us. Japan, we've made some progress already. The approvals took a little longer there as well. But the new hip software, of course, is also very important. As you know, there's a lot more hip procedures done in that part of the world. It's almost about the same as knees, unlike the United States. 
So we love the fact that we have multiple applications all approved in those markets and would expect you're going to see a similar kind of growth that you saw in the United States. It may not be quite as quick, and you've seen that, frankly, with Intuit in soft tissue robotics. The uptake is a little slower outside the United States. But we expect the same kind of runway longer term and are very bullish about the prospects, especially in China, Japan, Brazil, for sure, are going to be terrific markets for Mako."

So booms and lights certainly haven't been as positive as Mako and the beds and stretchers and certainly, the defibrillators because the Medical capital really did sort of have to ride a bit of a pandemic tailwind, if you will. And booms and lights large construction sort of slowed down a little bit. That should pick up starting next year. And that's part of the drag that you see within the Endoscopy division is the booms and lights portion. But certainly, in ASCs, they're busy, but certainly the large capital spend projects were delayed a little bit. They're starting to pick back up again. So that's obviously a smaller business, but then the overall Stryker. 
But Medical, we continue to feel bullish. So it's -- so we did get a bit of pandemic benefit. But this new bed that we've launched is really a fantastic product, getting great customer feedback. Sage has also picked up. So that was really hit hard in the second quarter, third quarter. Had a nice pickup in Q4. And that business will resume its high growth as the pandemic subsides. 
So the diversity of our portfolio is really -- that gives us the optimism that we're going to continue to see strong growth in Medical. And it wasn't just sort of a pandemic bump and then will suddenly drop because of the innovation in our portfolio and, frankly, just really, really strong commercial execution."

So certainly, as I think about those 2 acquisitions, there are some similarities, and then there are some pretty big differences. The similarities maybe lie in the foot and ankle side, where there is more of a true integration what's happening between the Stryker business and the Wright business. But for the upper extremities side, it's much more of just bringing them into Stryker and continuing on with the growth that they've had. 
So it's a little bit different from that perspective as we think about bringing on the acquisition of Wright versus K2. Just like with any -- in all of our previous acquisitions, we've learned and we've learned along the way and we use those learnings as we plan for additional or new acquisitions that are coming. The same was true with Wright. And so we utilized really that year-long period between sign and close to ensure that we're focused on getting the correct integration plans in place so that we can hit the ground running. And to date, that's what the team has done. They have executed to the plan. And as I'd mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've really done a lot of focus on ensuring that the sales organizations are being integrated in a timely fashion. And so that's where we are at this point. And certainly, we'll continue to provide some updates as we continue with the integration throughout the year."

And I actually think it's not going to stop in United States. There's already countries like the U.K. and even Canada looking at moving to lower cost sites of care. It's a good thing for health care overall. And these surgery centers make good money. They're very profitable. They don't have the burden of the cost of large inpatient hospitals.

And frankly, if you think back to even when we did Sage and when we did Physio, those were 2 very large acquisitions. We moved into a strategy for a year or 2 of just doing tuck-ins, which served us very well. And so I think it will play out very similar to that."

So I think Kevin outlined it pretty well before. I mean, I think overall, just looking at 1 quarter in the midst of a pandemic is tough to do because of the variability and really the localized impacts that we were seeing from an elective procedure standpoint. 
So certainly, you would expect that hips might be a little less deferrable than knees, just given the nature of the disease and degeneration. But at the same time, elective procedures, depending on where you were in the world, were being stopped. And so hips were not immune to that, like some of our other elective procedures. 
As we look forward, certainly, with the rollout of all of the installations for Mako that we've done this year as well as our new hips software, we're really expecting continued above-market growth from our hips and knees as we move forward."

One of them was Pivot, you may recall, for hip arthroscopy. 
More recently, we launched a lateral row anchor for shoulder, which has been, we call it, Omega, the product name, which is a fantastic product. We picked up -- through [ IVR ], we picked up another product as well, which -- these are all key fundamental products, whether it's in knee, whether it's in hip or whether it's in shoulder. So now we have all 3 of the joints very well covered in sports. And we are just growing at a very, very robust rate. And the timing couldn't be better with the shift to the surgery center and being able to use sports combined with our other divisions.

And a lot of the Stryker business, frankly, were you the hip and knee surgeons that also did some volume of shoulder.

And cross-selling opportunities will exist. But as Preston mentioned before, this integration is not going to be as tricky as the integration on foot and ankle, just given that we tended to -- they tended to be strong with the, I'll call it, fully dedicated upper extremity surgeons. And we tended to be stronger with those surgeons that did a smaller number, just as a general statement. So I think this integration is going to be terrific. 
We were really thrilled to be able to have the leader from Wright Medical take over the combined business of upper extremities. And their Head of Sales is also running the combined sales organization, and they're both outstanding leaders. And we are delighted not only to bring the business and the products of Wright Medical but being able to bring over some of their key leadership.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations.  For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical Integration. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. 
Despite the ongoing presence of the pandemic, we posted a strong quarter of organic sales growth of 4.7% versus Q1 2019. This was driven by outstanding international results, particularly in Asia Pacific and the benefits of our diversified business model. 
Across our franchises, Mako, Neurotech and Medical had excellent performances, each posting strong double-digit growth versus 2019, a trend that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year in these businesses. Mako followed up a very strong Q4 with a banner Q1 performance, including an uptake in international installations. 
As expected, elective procedures were negatively impacted to start the year which had the largest impact on our hip and knee businesses. However, the trends improved progressively throughout the quarter, with U.S. happen accelerating in March and into April, where we are seeing mid single-digit growth as compared to April 2019. We also saw improved growth in small capital within parts of Neurotech and instruments during the quarter. 
In addition, our order book has picked up across our capital businesses, which is a good sign of pending growth as procedure volumes return to more normal levels. These trends give us confidence in achieving our guidance of 8% to 10% full year organic sales growth compared to 2019, which is equivalent to 12% to 14% organic versus 2020, despite 1 less selling day. While the press release shows our performance versus both 2020 and '19, we believe that 2019 is a better reference point for comparison. 
Our momentum has continued regarding cost management and cash flow. And while spending will increase to support future growth, it will be done in a disciplined manner. Glenn will elaborate on our raised EPS guidance shortly. We also published our first annual comprehensive report during the quarter, which captures our environmental, social and governance strategy as well as commitments regarding our carbon footprint, diversity and equity inclusion and supply chain transparency. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in these areas. 
Overall, I am pleased with the strong start to the year and the momentum that is continuing to build. And while pandemic flash points are still occurring, we are well positioned to deliver growth at the high end of med tech, with leveraged adjusted earnings. I will now turn the call over to Preston."

During the quarter, our combine",463,"Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on first quarter performance in our combined trauma and extremities business, an update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical and on our most recent acquisition activity. 
During the quarter, our combined trauma and extremities business showed good resiliency, growing 2.6%, including Wright Medical compared to 2019 despite the ongoing impacts of COVID restrictions during the quarter. Our trauma business, which is less selective in nature, benefited from inclement weather in the U.S. and Europe in February. 
Performance in upper extremities and foot and ankle was driven by the recovery of elective procedures throughout the quarter, along with lower-than-expected sales dis-synergies through the initial stages of the integration. As a result of the strong performance of our trauma and extremities business in the first quarter, we now expect the combined business to deliver mid-single-digit growth for the full year when compared to 2019. 
We remain encouraged with the progress and pace that the team has delivered with bringing the businesses together throughout the Wright Medical Integration. As we have mentioned previously, we utilized the lengthy period from announce to close to build and resource the robust integration plan that we are now executing. 
As we move through the quarter, our teams made progress against many key integration milestones. To date, the team has established 3 distinct business units with specialized commercial, R&D and selling organizations. We believe this dedication and focus will be a core driver of future growth across trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle. 
In addition to establishing dedicated business units, the team made considerable progress with our U.S. sales integration, including the establishment of sales leadership, sales channel and territory alignment and identification of cross-selling priorities. Considerable progress has also been made on aligning the long-term portfolio and pipeline strategies. 
Our focus on the integration will remain a key priority for the remainder of 2021 as we balance the complexity of the integration while minimizing sales disruption. Over the next few quarters, we will conclude the U.S. commercial integration, including the initiation of cross-selling, and we will kick off sales integrations across our international markets over the next several months. 
Finally, our dedicated business development teams continue to identify and execute on tuck-in acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of TMJ Concepts, a medical device company that manufactures a patient-specific temporomandibular joint reconstruction prosthesis system. In our craniomaxillofacial business, personalized medicine plays a critical role and the acquisition of [ TMJ ] Concepts supports their business strategy of driving category leadership through innovation and purpose of restoring form, function and hope to patients. 
These acquisitions continue to demonstrate our focus on our strategy of driving category leadership and market-leading growth. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn."

Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results [Technical Difficulty] and the results our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. 
As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our organic sales growth was 4.7% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q1 2019 and 1 less day than 2020. Compared to 2019, pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4%. Versus Q1 2020, pricing was 0.9%, unfavorable. 
Foreign currency had a favorable 1.3% impact on sales. During the quarter, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related surgical procedure cancellations, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, negatively impacted our sales. However, towards the end of the quarter, we did see improvements in sales momentum, primarily in the U.S. and our Asia Pacific businesses. 
Also, as noted in the fourth quarter, demand for certain capital products continued as we saw strong results in our Mako and emergency care products. 
For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 1%, reflecting the continuing slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, medical products and neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 15% and impacted by positive sales momentum in China, Japan, Australia and Canada. 
Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.93 increased 2.7% from 2019, reflecting sales growth partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition as well as an overall disciplined ramp-up in operating costs. Our first quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.03. 
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 17.2%, an organic sales decline of 0.7%, including an organic decline of 1.7% in the U.S. This reflects a slowdown in elective procedures related to COVID-19. Other Ortho grew 49% in the U.S., primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. 
As noted previously, in March, we began to see good sales momentum in our U.S. orthopedic businesses, with all segments delivering positive organic growth as compared to March 2019. Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 1.5% organically, which reflects the COVID-19 related procedural slowdown in hips and knees, especially in Europe, offset by strong performances in Australia and Japan. 
For the quarter, our trauma and extremities business, which includes Wright Medical, delivered 2.6% growth on a comparable basis. This includes strong performances in U.S. shoulder and U.S. trauma. In the U.S., comparable growth was 4.4%. 
In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 5.3%, which included 1.6% growth in the U.S. Instruments had a U.S. organic sales decline of 3%, primarily impacted by continued procedural slowdown that impacted its power tool business, partially offset by gains in its waste management, smoke evacuation products and services business. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2019, Instruments had a very strong growth of approximately 18%. 
Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 5.7%, reflecting a slowdown in some of the capital businesses, which was partially offset by gains in our General Surgery, Video & Sports Medicine businesses, the latter of which grew over 11% in the quarter. The medical division had U.S. organic sales growth of 13.6%, reflecting double-digit performance in its emergency care and Sage businesses. 
Internationally, MedSurg had an organic sales growth of 19.9%, reflecting strong growth across Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan in Medical, Endoscopy and Instruments. 
Neurotechnology and spine had constant currency and organic growth of 12.8%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in our Interventional spine, neurosurgical and ENT businesses and 27% growth in our neurovascular business. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 12%, reflecting strong product growth in our neuro powered drills, SonoPet IQ, bipolar forceps, Bio reabsorbs and nasal implants. 
Additionally, within our U.S. neurovascular business, we had significant growth in all product categories, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally, Neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 31.7%. This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets. 
Now I will focus on operating highlights for the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.4% was unfavorable approximately 40 basis points from our first quarter 2019. Compared to the first quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by price, acquisitions and business mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our adjusted SG&A was 35.2% of sales, which was unfavorable to the first quarter of 2019 by 70 basis points. 
In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 23.5% of sales, which is 160 basis points decline over the first quarter of 2019. This reflects the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition, combined with the disciplined ramp-up in cost to fuel future growth, as well as the 2-year compounding of certain costs given the comparison to 2019. 
We also reiterate our operating margin expansion guidance of 30 to 50 basis points improvement over 2019 operating margin, excluding the impact of Wright Medical. 
Related to other income and expense as compared to the first quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13%, given our mix of income. Given our current circumstances and the outlook for the full year, we would expect to be at the lower end of our range for the full year guided effective tax rate of 15.5% to 16.5%. 
Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.1 billion. During the quarter, we repaid $750 million of maturing debt. 
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $450 million. This performance reflects the results of earnings, continued good management of working capital and approximately $170 million of onetime expenditures related to the Wright Medical Integration. 
Based on our first quarter performance and the current operating environment, we continue to expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%. We believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. As it relates to the sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be in the mid-single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. 
If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year, and this is included in our revised guidance range. 
Based on our first quarter performance and including consideration of our improved full year Wright Medical sales impact, disciplined cost management, and continued positive recovery outlook, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.05 to $9.30.

I was hoping you might give some early color or good way how to frame second quarter here. Coming out of the fourth quarter call, the Street had a wide range and didn't really update through the quarter as trends develop. So I was hoping maybe you could start off with giving some thoughts on where second quarter might shake out given the trends you're seeing here exiting first quarter."

We did indicate in my prepared remarks that U.S. hip and knee is currently growing in the mid-single digits, and that obviously was the business areas that were most impacted by the pandemic. So that recovery is pretty notable. If you look back in January and February, where we were declining. 
We -- at the end -- by the end of March, we started to pull ahead in to positive territory. And you can see that that's on the upswing. Difficult to predict with the flash points around the pandemic. But you can see we feel very good about confirming the full year organic sales growth. So whether that occurs in April, May, June, and July, parsing it by month is obviously very difficult. 
The other thing that makes us very confident on the full year outlook is the order book for capital equipment, both large capital and small capital, which is both picking up. So overall, we're feeling bullish. Obviously, growth has to accelerate to get to 8% to 10% organic when you start at 4.7% in the first quarter. But the exact pacing between Q2, Q3 and Q4, is still a little uncertain."

And a lot of that did flow through in Q1. And I think that impact was certainly reflected in our EPS. 
I think moving forward, as we think about it, we are optimistic about where we stand relative to sales dis-synergies and how that will play out for the remainder of the year. And so a lot -- some of that positivity is certainly reflected in our EPS guidance. And we fully expect that, that benefit will also contribute to, sort of, raising the guidance like we did. 
And then as it relates to the cost management and how that will play out in the year. We are encouraging divisions to ramp up some of their spendings to make sure that we are properly positioned for growth. That would also include spending and innovation. And so we are making sure that we are not doing anything to hold back product development and other innovation spending that, frankly, will be needed to really fuel growth even towards the end of this year or even on into next year. So I think we'll see growth in that spending. 
And then we did learn a lot from the experience that we went through and how we work. And so there are some benefits and savings that we fully expect to realize in the full year as it relates to primarily SG&A cost. And so it's kind of a balance of those things that really get us to a lot of the confidence we had in raising our guidance."

And if you think about the next couple of years, it means a pay down of $2 billion-plus in terms of what we'll do. We -- if you think about what we paid off in the fourth quarter and what we paid off this quarter, we're about $1 billion towards that goal. We probably have an opportunity to pay down a little more debt this year that we'll take advantage of, too. And so that's where we think we'll land. 
Once we do that, we think we'll be in a solid territory to sort of accelerate our programs around looking at, sort of, larger opportunities. But the organization is very focused on cash flow and reaching those debt pay down goals."

We have mixed management teams that are leading a lot of the Wright Medical leadership that's come over to key leadership roles, and the momentum is terrific.

Certainly, it's being enhanced by enabling technologies, certainly, our recent acquisition of Mobius being a part of that. 
And I think the other thing I would just point out to you, as we think about spine in relation to some of the other implant businesses, we certainly didn't see the same level of impact as a result of the COVID restrictions, particularly across this last quarter, like we saw in some of the other implant businesses. So it's just something to keep in mind as we think about the performance. 
But overall, like I said, we're encouraged by the performance. And we're -- with high expectations in terms of our spine business getting back to market levels and continuing to perform that way. 
As it relates to Sage, I think you hit it. I mean, really, it's a product that certainly was impacted by the procedural slowdowns. And so as hospitals ramp back up and get ready for that -- the procedures to pick back up, there's an element of Sage that will pick back up in terms of starting to get ready. But at the same time, I think you'll also begin to see the flow-through that's happening from a Sage perspective as well as more and more procedures are done in that catch-up of the recovery process."

And so you have 3 different businesses that, frankly, had -- last year, you had a little bit more contribution from acute care and emergency care, and not so much from Sage. 
I'm sure you're going to have a lot more Sage. Emergency care is going well. And acute care should pick up as we get into the latter course of this year.

I'm just wondering if we can sort of break that out between dis-synergy and pandemic and sort of what is the timing to get back to that high single-digit growth rate?"

So with regards to your question on robotics, I mean, from our perspective, really nothing's changed in our focus. And what you saw in the first quarter really is just a continuation of the effort that we had since we launched Mako. And so we're really seeing the uptick as a result of just selling in our technology. And overall, we really remain bullish about Mako and what it brings. Other competitive systems like Bellis or ROSA haven't slowed us down at all. And if anything, what they've done is they've increased the validation that robotics are here to stay. And really demand for Mako and our technology continues to be super strong as we saw by the results we posted. 
And then also, we believe we have the best solution. And so from a head-to-head comparison, it is something that we look forward to with the technologies that are on the market today. As you think about Wright Medical and again, the high single digits, I mean, it's all-inclusive in there. Obviously, we're coming off of a pandemic or still kind of coming out at the end of the pandemic. So there's certainly some impact there. 
There's dis-synergies that are associated with the deal itself. And then there's also just the integration happening in terms of the Wright business and our own business through cross-selling and things like that. So it's not something that we've parsed out in terms of the different components of it.

So China, as a whole, we're very small in China relative to other companies. But we grew incredibly fast, very, very high double-digit growth in Q1. The outlook for China for us is still very positive, given our lower relative market shares. It will be a very good Mako market. We're just getting started in China. 
I would say Japan, certainly, Australia is further ahead of where we are in China. So it's early days, but very promising, very encouraging. The one negative for China, of course, is this trend towards volume based procurement, which you've seen in the -- with the cardiac stents. And we know that, that's going to come down the pipe. And in fact, a couple of our businesses hasn't yet, but we're starting to and there'll be noise around that. 
But overall, China for us still remains a high priority market and will be a growth market for us, just given our relative position. But even as it relates to Mako, that -- that will be carved out of the tendering related to volume-based procurement. So we still have a significant runway for robotics, both in Japan and China.

We have efforts in inventory management and working very closely with the businesses so that we can forecast inventory needs better. We also look at distribution strategies that, sort of, are more efficient in terms of how much inventory we have to have on hand to serve customers. 
And then lastly, we are also working with our vendors in terms of accounts payable and how do we have more favorable terms in terms of payment terms on accounts payable.

And so one of the things we talked about is while we go through the integration of Wright, that we would continue to focus on M&A, but the focus that we'll have on M&A will be more of a tuck-in variety.

And so we go back to the end of the year, we had the orthosensor acquisition, and then we just talked about today the TMJ Concepts acquisition. So you'll continue to see those types of acquisitions in the near-term as we continue to go through the integration of Wright and the debt pay down that we've talked about as well. So I think that's how I would think about acquisitions for us as we think about going forward.

We actually have to go to the account, put the software on and do it in-servicing with our customers, because there's new information, they have to learn so there's actually a training regimen that goes with it. 
So right now, we're excited about the procedure growth in hip is increasing as more and more accounts have the software installed and are in service by our Stryker team. This will continue through the second quarter, probably through a good part of the third quarter before all of the accounts have the new hip software. But the feedback from the surgeon customer is terrific. There's -- it takes less time to register. So that speeds up the overall procedure time. And there's some very valuable information such as [indiscernible] which surgeons find very beneficial to make sure they're managing like ling discrepancies.

But I think the company that was able to keep the ACL in place is something -- is the area that we're exploring more from a science standpoint. So nothing that we launched imminently.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical Integration. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.
Despite the ongoing presence of the pandemic, we posted a strong quarter of organic sales growth of 4.7% versus Q1 2019. This was driven by outstanding international results, particularly in Asia Pacific and the benefits of our diversified business model. Across our franchises, Mako, Neurotech and Medical had excellent performances, each posting strong double-digit growth versus 2019, a trend that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year in these businesses.
Mako followed up a very strong Q4 with a banner Q1 performance, including an uptake in international installations. As expected, elective procedures were negatively impacted to start the year which had the largest impact on our hip and knee businesses. However, the trends improved progressively throughout the quarter, with U.S. hip and knee accelerating in March and into April, where we are seeing mid single-digit growth as compared to April 2019. We also saw improved growth in small capital within parts of Neurotech and instruments during the quarter. In addition, our order book has picked up across our capital businesses, which is a good sign of pending growth as procedure volumes return to more normal levels.
These trends give us confidence in achieving our guidance of 8% to 10% full year organic sales growth compared to 2019, which is equivalent to 12% to 14% organic versus 2020, despite 1 less selling day. While the press release shows our performance versus both 2020 and '19, we believe that 2019 is a better reference point for comparison. Our momentum has continued regarding cost management and cash flow. And while spending will increase to support future growth, it will be done in a disciplined manner. Glenn will elaborate on our raised EPS guidance shortly.
We also published our first annual comprehensive report during the quarter, which captures our environmental, social and governance strategy as well as commitments regarding our carbon footprint, diversity and equity inclusion and supply chain transparency. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in these areas. Overall, I am pleased with the strong start to the year and the momentum that is continuing to build. And while pandemic flashpoints are still occurring, we are well positioned to deliver growth at the high end of med tech, with leveraged adjusted earnings.
I will now turn the call over to Preston."

My comments today will focus on first quarter performance in our combined trauma and extremities business, an update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical and on our most recent acquisition activity.
During the quarter, our combined trauma and extremities business showed good resiliency, growing 2.6%, including Wright Medical compared to 2019 despite the ongoing impacts of COVID restrictions during the quarter. Our trauma business, which is less selective in nature, benefited from inclement weather in the U.S. and Europe in February. Performance in upper extremities and foot and ankle was driven by the recovery of elective procedures throughout the quarter, along with lower-than-expected sales dis-synergies through the initial stages of the integration. As a result of the strong performance of our trauma and extremities business in the first quarter, we now expect the combined business to deliver mid-single-digit growth for the full year when compared to 2019. We remain encouraged with the progress and pace that the team has delivered with bringing the businesses together throughout the Wright Medical Integration. As we have mentioned previously, we utilized the lengthy period from announce to close to build and resource the robust integration plan that we are now executing. As we move through the quarter, our teams made progress against many key integration milestones. To date, the team has established 3 distinct business units with specialized commercial, R&D and selling organizations. We believe this dedication and focus will be a core driver of future growth across trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle.
In addition to establishing dedicated business units, the team made considerable progress with our U.S. sales integration, including the establishment of sales leadership, sales channel and territory alignment and the identification of cross-selling priorities. Considerable progress has also been made on aligning the long-term portfolio in pipeline strategies. Our focus on the integration will remain a key priority for the remainder of 2021 as we balance the complexity of the integration while minimizing sales disruption. Over the next few quarters, we will conclude the U.S. commercial integration, including the initiation of cross-selling, and we will kick off sales integrations across our international markets over the next several months. Finally, our dedicated business development teams continue to identify and execute on tuck-in acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of TMJ Concepts, a medical device company that manufactures a patient-specific temporomandibular joint reconstruction prosthesis system. In our craniomaxillofacial business, personalized medicine plays a critical role and the acquisition of TMJ Concepts supports their business strategy of driving category leadership through innovation and purpose of restoring form, function and hope for patients. These acquisitions continue to demonstrate our focus on our strategy of driving category leadership and market-leading growth.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn."

Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the [Technical Difficulty] our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison t",1225,"Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the [Technical Difficulty] our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020.
Our organic sales growth was 4.7% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q1 2019, and 1 less day than 2020. Compared to 2019, pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4%. Versus Q1 2020, pricing was 0.9% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.3% impact on sales. During the quarter, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related surgical procedure cancellations, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, negatively impacted our sales. However, towards the end of the quarter, we did see improvements in sales momentum, primarily in the U.S. and our Asia Pacific businesses. Also, as noted in the fourth quarter, demand for certain capital products continued as we saw strong results in our Mako and emergency care products. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 1%, reflecting the continuing slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, medical products and neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 15% and impacted by positive sales momentum in China, Japan, Australia and Canada.
Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.93 increased 2.7% from 2019, reflecting sales growth partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition as well as an overall disciplined ramp-up in operating costs. Our first quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.03.
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 17.2%, an organic sales decline of 0.7%, including an organic decline of 1.7% in the U.S. This reflects a slowdown in elective procedures related to COVID-19. Other Ortho grew 49% in the U.S., primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. As noted previously, in March, we began to see good sales momentum in our U.S. orthopedic businesses, with all segments delivering positive organic growth as compared to March 2019. Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 1.5% organically, which reflects the COVID-19 related procedural slowdown in hips and knees, especially in Europe, offset by strong performances in Australia and Japan. For the quarter, our trauma and extremities business, which includes Wright Medical, delivered 2.6% growth on a comparable basis. This includes strong performances in U.S. shoulder and U.S. trauma. In the U.S., comparable growth was 4.4%.
In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 5.3%, which included 1.6% growth in the U.S. Instruments had a U.S. organic sales decline of 3%, primarily impacted by continued procedural slowdown that impacted its power tool business, partially offset by gains in its waste management, smoke evacuation products and services business. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2019, Instruments had a very strong growth of approximately 18%. Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 5.7%, reflecting a slowdown in some of the capital businesses, which was partially offset by gains in our General Surgery, Video & Sports Medicine businesses, the latter of which grew over 11% in the quarter. The medical division had U.S. organic sales growth of 13.6%, reflecting double-digit performance in its emergency care and Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had an organic sales growth of 19.9%, reflecting strong growth across Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan in Medical, Endoscopy and Instruments.
Neurotechnology and spine had constant currency and organic growth of 12.8%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in our Interventional spine, neurosurgical and ENT businesses and 27% growth in our neurovascular business. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 12%, reflecting strong product growth in our neuro-powered drills, SonoPet IQ, bipolar forceps, bioresorbables and nasal implants. Additionally, within our U.S. neurovascular business, we had significant growth in all product categories, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally, Neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 31.7%. This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets.
Now I will focus on operating highlights for the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.4% was unfavorable approximately 40 basis points from our first quarter 2019. Compared to the first quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by price, acquisitions and business mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our adjusted SG&A was 35.2% of sales, which was unfavorable to the first quarter of 2019 by 70 basis points. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 23.5% of sales, which is 160 basis points decline over the first quarter of 2019. This reflects the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition, combined with the disciplined ramp-up in cost to fuel future growth, as well as the 2-year compounding of certain costs given the comparison to 2019. We also reiterate our operating margin expansion guidance of 30 to 50 basis points improvement over 2019 operating margin, excluding the impact of Wright Medical.
Related to other income and expense as compared to the first quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13%, given our mix of income. Given our current circumstances and the outlook for the full year, we would expect to be at the lower end of our range for the full year guided effective tax rate of 15.5% to 16.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.1 billion. During the quarter, we repaid $750 million of maturing debt.
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $450 million. This performance reflects the results of earnings, continued good management of working capital and approximately $170 million of onetime expenditures related to the Wright Medical integration. Based on our first quarter performance and the current operating environment, we continue to expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%. We believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be in the mid-single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. 
If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year, and this is included in our revised guidance range. Based on our first quarter performance and including consideration of our improved full year Wright Medical sales impact, disciplined cost management, and continued positive recovery outlook, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.05 to $9.30.
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

We did indicate in my prepared remarks that U.S. hip and knees is currently growing in the mid-single digits, and that obviously was the business areas that were most impacted by the pandemic. So that recovery is pretty notable. If you look back in January and February, where we were declining. We -- at the end -- by the end of March, we started to pull ahead into positive territory. And you can see that that's on the upswing. Difficult to predict with the flash points around the pandemic. But you can see we feel very good about confirming the full year organic sales growth. So whether that occurs in April, May, June, and July, parsing it by month is obviously very difficult. The other thing that makes us very confident on the full year outlook is the order book for capital equipment, both large capital and small capital, which is both picking up. So overall, we're feeling bullish. Obviously, growth has to accelerate to get to 8% to 10% organic when you start at 4.7% in the first quarter. But the exact pacing between Q2, Q3 and Q4, is still a little uncertain."

And a lot of that did flow through in Q1. And I think that impact was certainly reflected in our EPS. I think moving forward, as we think about it, we are optimistic about where we stand relative to sales dis-synergies and how that will play out for the remainder of the year. And so a lot -- some of that positivity is certainly reflected in our EPS guidance. And we fully expect that, that benefit will also contribute to, sort of, raising the guidance like we did.
And then as it relates to the cost management and how that will play out in the year. We are encouraging divisions to ramp up some of their spendings to make sure that we are properly positioned for growth. That would also include spending on innovation. And so we are making sure that we are not doing anything to hold back product development and other innovation spending that, frankly, will be needed to really fuel growth even towards the end of this year or even on into next year. So I think we'll see growth in that spending. And then we did learn a lot from the experience that we went through and how we work. And so there are some benefits and savings that we fully expect to realize in the full year as it relates to primarily SG&A cost. And so it's kind of a balance of those things that really get us to a lot of the confidence we had in raising our guidance."

We are delighted with the ASC offerings that we've put together really over the last 2 years. We have a unique way that we go to the market for ASC, a new sales organization that we created. And we really bring the best of Stryker because we have everything that they need in the ASC. We have booms, we have lights, we have power tools, we have neck and waist management. We have operating tables, we have hips and knees in sports medicine and foot and ankle and shoulder, and ACDF procedures for spine. So we really are a one-stop shop that makes life very easy for the ASC customer. We're winning deals at a very, very large clip right now, which usually involve at least 5 of our business units in the last multiple years. And so we welcome this shift to the ASC. As of now, it's largely commercial pay that we're seeing. Those procedures are the ones moving to the ASC. So there really hasn't been much at all in the way of price pressure. Not to say that won't happen sometime in the future. But certainly for the next at least few years, we don't see much in the way of price pressure. And frankly, as a tailwind for us, just given our portfolio is really ideally suited and we've structured a very good offense to be able to sell to the ASC."

Certainly, it's being enhanced by enabling technologies, certainly, our recent acquisition of Mobius being a part of that.

So it's just something to keep in mind as we think about the performance. But overall, like I said, we're encouraged by the performance. And we're -- with high expectations in terms of our spine business getting back to market levels and continuing to perform that way. 
As it relates to Sage, I think you hit it. I mean, really, it's a product that certainly was impacted by the procedural slowdowns. And so as hospitals ramp back up and get ready for that -- the procedures to pick back up, there's an element of Sage that will pick back up in terms of starting to get ready.

So with regards to your question on robotics, I mean, from our perspective, really nothing's changed in our focus. And what you saw in the first quarter really is just a continuation of the effort that we had since we launched Mako. And so we're really seeing the uptick as a result of just selling in our technology. And overall, we really remain bullish about Mako and what it brings. Other competitive systems like BLS or Rosa haven't slowed us down at all. And if anything, what they've done is they've increased the validation that robotics are here to stay. And really demand for Mako and our technology continues to be super strong as we saw by the results we posted. 
And then also, we believe we have the best solution. And so from a head-to-head comparison, it is something that we look forward to with the technologies that are on the market today. As you think about Wright Medical and again, the high single digits, I mean, it's all-inclusive in there. Obviously, we're coming off of a pandemic or still kind of coming out at the end of the pandemic. So there's certainly some impact there. 
There's dis-synergies that are associated with the deal itself. And then there's also just the integration happening in terms of the Wright business and our own business through cross-selling and things like that.

I mean, obviously, we're not providing specifics on the quarter. But I think if you go back and look at what we said in the fourth quarter, that will give you some sense of where we are in total installation base, both from a U.S. or a global perspective. And you can make some assumptions about what that might mean, U.S. versus international. But if you think about what that total placement is and you think about the fact that there is the potential for 4,500 or so hospitals that could carry a Mako, that just gives you a sense of where we are penetration wise. But even then, I would tell you that many of these hospitals are able to take more than just one. So I think the bottom line with all of that is it's still early days in terms of penetration. So there's a lot of opportunity out there in terms of robotics and taking Mako and taking more than one Mako as we look forward."

But obviously, last year was very badly affected in the first quarter if you compare to 2020. 
So China, as a whole, we're very small in China relative to other companies. But we grew incredibly fast, very, very high double-digit growth in Q1. The outlook for China for us is still very positive, given our lower relative market shares. It will be a very good Mako market. We're just getting started in China. 
I would say Japan, certainly, Australia is further ahead of where we are in China. So it's early days, but very promising, very encouraging. The one negative for China, of course, is this trend towards volume based procurement, which you've seen in the -- with the cardiac stents. And we know that, that's going to come down the pipe. And in fact, a couple of our businesses hasn't yet, but we're starting to and there'll be noise around that. 
But overall, China for us still remains a high priority market and will be a growth market for us, just given our relative position. But even as it relates to Mako, that -- that will be carved out of the tendering related to volume-based procurement. So we still have a significant runway for robotics, both in Japan and China. Those are going to be both big markets, and we're very excited about our progress in both of those."

So I do think organizationally, we are well positioned relative to manage cash flow. We have efforts ongoing in terms of moving a lot more of our collections to standardize shared service centers. We have efforts in inventory management and working very closely with the businesses so that we can forecast inventory needs better. We also look at distribution strategies that, sort of, are more efficient in terms of how much inventory we have to have on hand to serve customers. 
And then lastly, we are also working with our vendors in terms of accounts payable and how do we have more favorable terms in terms of payment terms on accounts payable.

I think historically, and correct me if I'm wrong, but historically, you said there's not a lot of bundling that goes out at the hospital level across business units, things like that at this point. Obviously, in the ASCs, that seems to be happening more. 
Does that mean your incremental share gains in ASC should be even greater than what we've seen historically on the hospital side for you guys? It just seems like you're so well positioned there, given the diversification of the business model."

There is a very different buying that occurs at the ASC than it does in the hospital. The hospitals have very elaborate procurement divisions and departments, and they buy by service line, and it's very decentralized. The ASC is a very simple, sort of, customer that you have to interact with. There are not as many people. They can't receive 22 Stryker salespeople. They don't want to. That's not the way they want to do business. 
So we have a different offense for the ASC. And fortunately, we have a portfolio for the orthopedic ASC, which includes sports that is just perfect for what they're looking for. And so yes, we've adapted our offense. We have the portfolio, but it is a very different buying pattern. The hospital isn't as interested, frankly, in looking across our different divisions and hasn't historically been as interested, but the ASC customer certainly is. And the good news is we've adapted our offense. If we had continued with our -- the same way we used to sell, we wouldn't be having the success that we're having now. And really, I'm optimistic about this continuing in the future."

So the Mako hip application, if you remember we launched it last year, but we really couldn't get it out to all of our customers because of the pandemic. We've got roughly 50%, maybe a little bit more than 50% of the accounts have the new software. So it's not as simple as just, sort of, doing an upload over the web of the software. We actually have to go to the account, put the software on and do it in-servicing with our customers, because there's new information, they have to learn so there's actually a training regimen that goes with it. 
So right now, we're excited about the procedure growth in hip is increasing as more and more accounts have the software installed and are in service by our Stryker team. This will continue through the second quarter, probably through a good part of the third quarter before all of the accounts have the new hip software. But the feedback from the surgeon customer is terrific. There's -- it takes less time to register. So that speeds up the overall procedure time. And there's some very valuable information such as public health which surgeons find very beneficial to make sure they're managing like length discrepancies. 
And so the feedback, again, very positive, but we're still in the throes of this implementation. And it does take time because it requires that high-touch in-servicing. And due to the pandemic, we haven't been able to move as quickly as we would like in all of our accounts, in all of our regions."

And then the second question is just -- sorry, another ASC question. But for me, are you overrepresented in ASCs? That's our assumption. I just wanted to sanity check that. If you have higher share in ASCs than the rest of the U.S. and you just received approval for patients just in instrumentation for the triathlon.

That deal was designed to really have a very simple solution for the ASC customer that is not using Mako. And there will be ASCs. The deal, some of the deals we've won don't involve a Mako, where they will use manual procedures. That's where this solution will be terrific because it requires much less sterilization. And there's really custom design for the ASC. 
So we're excited to get that FDA approval, and we look forward to being able to offer that to our ASC customers. I think you asked about market share. I don't know, Preston, do you have a feel for whether we're over-indexed in ASC? I think it's fairly representative."

But I think the company that was able to keep the ACL in, in place is something -- is the area that we're exploring more from a science standpoint. So nothing that we launched imminently. 
But I do think that will be the future as new kind of implants that are thinner, that are curved, that only a robot will be to be able to implement into a patient.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical integration. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. 
Please note that our press release contains our results versus both 2020 and and 2019. For this call, our commentary will be based on our performance versus 2019, which we believe provides a more relevant point of comparison. 
For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 9.3%, reflecting growth versus 2019 for all our major businesses. This strong result was driven by standout performances from Neurovascular, Mako, emergency care, sports medicine and our U.S. shoulder and total ankle products. Each of these posted very strong double-digit growth. 
International organic growth outpaced the U.S. at 14.2% despite COVID challenges in some countries. We posted double-digit growth in most regions, including excellent results in South Pacific, China, Canada, South Korea and many countries in Western Europe. We were also pleased to see the continued rebound in elective procedures as both hips and knees saw quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement and both returned to growth. 
Also, now that we have a fuller appreciation of Wright Medical, we are delighted to have it within the Stryker family. With our first half organic growth of 7.1%, combined with continued recovery of electric procedures, a strong order book across our capital businesses and new product innovations, we have increased confidence in the full year outlook. This is reflected in our upward narrowing of organic sales guidance to 9% to 10% compared to 2019. 
Our sales performance carried through the rest of our results with strong margin performance and adjusted EPS growth and cash flow conversion of over 100% in the quarter. Through the remainder of the year, we do expect a disciplined increase in spending to support our future growth expectations. Our bullish sales outlook, combined with ongoing execution on margins and continued progress on Wright Medical integration has resulted in a raised full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $9.25 to $9.40 a share. 
I continue to be impressed with the resiliency of our people and culture, which positions us well for a successful 2021 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Preston."

My comments today will focus on the second quarter performance of our combined Trauma and Extremities business, including an update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical. During the quarter, our combined worldwide trauma and extremities business, including Wright Medical had a strong performance, growing 7% compared to 2019.  The performance in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. trauma and upper extremities businesses. U.S. businesses were benefited by the recovery from COVID-related restrictions, which continues to outpace the rest of the world as well as the ongoing execution of the U.S. selling integration. 
The Trauma business unit was positively impacted by the reopening of economies and the continued strong performance of key products, including T2 Alpha, and the mini frag plating system. Our U.S. upper extremities business, which remains #1 in shoulder arthroplasty, grew strong double digits in the quarter behind continued strength within reverse ARPA plastic portfolio with PERFORM Reverse and revision driving the growth. 
The upper extremities performance in the quarter was enhanced by the continued adoption of our blueprint planning software with approximately 50% of total shoulder cases completed using Blueprint. As a result of the strong performance of our Trauma and Extremities business, which grew approximately 5% in the first half of the year, we are confident in the combined business to grow at least 6% for the full year when compared to 2019. 
We are now about 9 months into the integration of Wright Medical and we remain very pleased with the progress and efficiency at which the team is moving through the integration. The U.S. integration is pacing ahead of our expectations and cross-selling has begun in a limited capacity. We expect to continue to execute on our cross-selling priorities during the second half of the year as we work to fortify the supply chain and processes to support cross-selling activities. 
Outside the U.S., the teams have successfully executed integration plans in several key markets, including the U.K., Germany, France, Japan and China with further countries to follow into 2022. In addition to the commercial activities, we are also executing on the integration of other operational areas, including the consolidation of distribution and sales offices, harmonization of key operational processes and executing on our manufacturing site strategy. 
Within R&D, the team also continues to make progress on aligning the long-term portfolio, pipeline strategies and harmonized design processes. While the team has moved through the integration, they have also remained focused on executing the critical existing projects in the pipeline. This includes the recent launch of the new Tornier perform humeral system, which offers clinical solutions for the simplest and most complex arthroplasty procedures and delivers on our mission to make health care better for surgeons in the patients they serve. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn."

Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 201",1245,"Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. 
Our organic sales growth was 9.3% in the quarter. The second quarter included the same number of selling days as Q2 2019 and Q2 2020. Compared to 2019, pricing in the quarter was unfavorable, 0.6% versus Q2 2020, pricing was 5% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.5% impact on sales. 
During the quarter, we saw a recovery ramp of elective procedures and accelerated sales momentum as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has eased in most geographies. However, the recovery ramp of elective procedures continues to be variable by region and geography and has a more pronounced impact on our orthopedic and spine implant businesses. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 7.5%, reflecting the recovery of our procedural business and continued strong demand for Mako, medical products and neurovascular products. During the quarter, we had strong sequential improvement in all our U.S. businesses. International organic sales showed strong growth of 14.2%. The -- Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.25 increased 13.6% from 2019, reflecting sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the Wright Medical acquisition and a somewhat higher quarterly effective tax rate. Our second quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04. 
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 26% and an organic sales growth of 6.7% and including an organic growth of 8% in the U.S. This reflects a ramp-up in elective procedures, especially in knees and trauma and extremities. Our niche business grew 7.5% in the U.S., reflecting the strong bounce back as the COVID-related restrictions were lifted. Other Orthopaedics grew 26.5% in the U.S., primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. 
Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 4% organically, which reflects sequential improvement as the COVID-19 impacts have started to ease in Europe, strong momentum in Mako internationally and strong performances in Australia. For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business, which includes Wright Medical, delivered 7% growth on a comparable basis. In the U.S., comparable growth was 12.5%, and which included double-digit growth in our upper extremities and trauma businesses. 
In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 8.3%, which included 6.4% growth in the U.S. Instruments had a U.S. organic sales growth of 0.9%, primarily related to growth in smoke evacuation, lighted instruments and skin closure products partially offset by slower growth in power tools. As a reminder, during the second quarter of 2019, Instruments had a very strong growth of approximately 19%. 
Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 6%, reflecting strong performances in our Sports Medicine, general surgery and video products. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 13.4%, reflecting continued double-digit performance in our emergency care business. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 15.9% and reflecting strong growth in the Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical businesses across Europe, Canada and Australia. Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 15.5%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in all 4 of our Neurotech: CMF, Neurovascular, neurosurgical and E&T. It also reflects very strong growth in our neurovascular business of approximately 30%. 
Our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 17.3% and highlighted by strong product growth in Sonopet IQ, bipolar forceps MAXACE, cryotherapy and nasal implants. Additionally, our U.S. Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of our products, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. 
Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 28.8%. This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets as well as Europe and Australia. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66% was a favorable approximately 15 basis points from second quarter 2019 compared to the second quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by business mix and acquisitions, primarily offset by price. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.6% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.4% of sales, which was slightly better than the second quarter of 2019. The reflects our continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by the impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. 
In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.9% of sales, which is 5 basis points improvement over the second quarter of 2019. This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum combined with the disciplined ramp-up in costs offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. Based on our positive momentum, we continue to reiterate our op margin guidance for the year of 30 to 50 basis points improvement over 2019, excluding the impact of Wright Medical. Related to other income and expense as compared to the second quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and an increase in interest expense resulting from the additional debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 17% and was impacted by our mix of U.S. non-U.S. income and some adverse discrete tax items included in our provision to return adjustments. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 15.2%. For the full year, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5% with some variability in the remaining quarters, including a slightly lower rate in the third quarter and a more normalized rate in the fourth quarter. 
Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. During the quarter, we fully repaid the $400 million of term loan debt related to the borrowings incurred for the acquisition of Wright Medical. Year-to-date, we have paid down $1.15 billion of debt. 
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.3 billion. This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. And now I will provide a summary of our revised guidance. 
Based on our performance in sales ramp in the second quarter as well as our capital orders pipeline, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 10%. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be at least 6% for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. 
If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Consistent with the upper range of our previous guidance, net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $0.10 in the full year, and this is included in our revised guidance range. 
Based on our performance in the first 6 months and including consideration of our improved full year rate medical performance impact, controlled spend ramp to facilitate growth and continued positive recovery outlook we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.25 to $9.40. And now I will open up the call up for Q&A."

So overall, we know there's going to be some disruption that is baked into our guidance, but we believe with the momentum that we have across not only our implant business, but as well as our capital businesses, and we feel pretty confident enough to raise the bottom end of our full year sales guidance. 
As it relates to Neurovascular, if you look at that business, we had an outstanding first quarter, it was around 27%. So this is 30%. So it's not really a huge acceleration. I would say we really have a great product cycle going on right now across flow-diverting stents, ischemic stroke, our hemorrhagic coils, our aspiration catheters. So we really have the bases covered, and we're having fantastic growth really globally, including terrific performances in Asia Pacific.

Just in terms of capital overall, I mean, we continue to see a pretty stable capital environment I think we've seen that really through the first couple of quarters and really evidenced by the continued strong sales in Medical, as you said, and also, of course, with our Mako technology. As it pertains specifically to Medical, so obviously, we have the Procuity Bed, which I'll talk about in just a second, but we also have really strong performances out of our emergency care business. We've seen that in the last couple of quarters as well. And so that continues to be very strong. And there's just been an uptick there really in the U.S. and outside the U.S. With regards to ProCuity itself, the team is very pleased with how that launch has gone and started. We've really gotten a lot of awareness out there. We certainly have a lot of engagement from our customers. And we're starting to see a building momentum in orders and sales in the U.S. and starting to kick off that launch outside the U.S. as well.

Thank you, Chris. First of all, I would say that the total ankle business did very well in the second quarter. As you know, the rest of foot and ankle is much more discretionary the podiatric volumes are coming back. So it was certainly a better quarter in Q2 than Q1, but it is lagging a little bit just like we're seeing with spine and with hips and knees. It is a bit more elective those foot and ankle procedures. But I'm very pleased with the stability of our sales force, the leadership that we put in place.

I mean there's a lot of variables that are going into trying to figure out what that is. What we do know is certainly over the last year that we haven't had the same level of procedures that we would have expected to as a result of the pandemic. And so super hard to predict exactly which percentages of patients that are back are from that deferred backlog or that are new patients. What we do know is that surgeons are continuing to try to work through as many patients as possible, finding different opportunities to add capacity into the scheduling or into their opportunity to perform those procedures. And so we don't expect that we're going to see any sort of outsized growth figures that happen in any 1 particular quarter or month. But that's something that we expect that we're going to be working through this backlog over the next several quarters. So we expect it to be a tailwind for us really over the next several quarters and into 2022 for sure. When you think about -- thinking about your other question with regards to Wright Medical, the cross-selling component is something that as I mentioned, is -- we're pleased with the start of that. It's early in the process. We're expecting that, as you mentioned, to continue for the rest of this year and into next year. We haven't provided a specific size of that opportunity, but it's baked within the overall guidance that we've provided for the overall combined trauma and extremities business, which, as I mentioned, we expect to grow at least 6% compared to 2019.

Just think about our portfolio, it absolutely covers the gamut of what they need in those surgery centers. So that really makes life easy for an operator in ASC to be able to contract with 1 company to cover such a huge portion of the procedures that are being done. So our portfolio really lines up beautifully for that. We also -- you may have read recently that we have this deal with Conformis that we worked on a couple of years ago. We have started and launched our first few cases of a very, very simplified streamlined offering that provides less sterilization. We call it kind of a knee in a box. The official name of it is Triathlon AS1 with personalized cutting guides for the procedure. And so that was designed specifically for the ASC, and that's now launched. But frankly, a few years ago, we didn't realize that Mako would be this popular in the surgery center as it's proving to be.

China has started. We still have -- it's a little bit behind Japan. Brazil, we now have our first few sales in Brazil. So that's probably 1 of the later ones in Russia as well. So we're in the early stages in those 4 markets. The demand is very high from surgeons, which is exciting. Brazil was a delayed a little bit by COVID, but we are starting to build momentum there as well. So it's very exciting. The surgeons, it's kind of taking us back to when we launched AkoTotalKnee here. in the United States. There's high demand for it, and you should expect strong performances in the quarters ahead."

And then on the lower extremity side, we knew that the foot and ankle is going to be a tougher integration, but it's going well. They're a little bit more elective of those procedures, but the total ankle is doing extremely well. So overall, the product portfolio is performing well. Our sales forces are integrating well. The U.S. integration is ahead of schedule. OUS is going to take a little longer, and we knew that. These countries take a little longer with the distributor arrangements that we have in place before they fully hit their stride. But if you recall, when we started the year, we said low to mid-single-digit growth on a combined basis. And we sort of moved it up to mid-single, and now we're kind of thinking it's really going to be 6-plus percent for this year.

We're not going to give guidance to next year, but I think you can tell by our tone that we're feeling very optimistic about the future of our Trauma aand Extremities business."

So listen, we knew they had a good business, and we knew that their culture was similar to Strykers, but there's been some pleasant surprises along the way. Their talent, is really excellent. And a lot of times, when we buy companies, we buy them for their products, but then we have to infuse a lot of our management. They're a leader for upper extremities, they're leader for lower extremities are leading our businesses, our Head of knees came from Wright Medical. And so we have an infusion of talent that for me has been a positive surprise. I mean really outstanding leaders. Their sales leader for upper extremities is outstanding. And so that's been 1 positive. The second I would say is their key opinion leaders. They absolutely work with fabulous key opinion leaders on both upper and lower extremities. And I would say that they are better key opinion leaders than we had within Stryker. And so those are 2 really, to me, pleasant surprises. And just the pipelines, we thought they were good. They've turned out to be a little better than we thought, and that really applies across the board. So there are certain things that you know when you do a public deal, you don't get to do the same amount of due diligence as you do with a private acquisition. And so those instincts -- you had instincts that things were going to be good. They're proving to be even better than we first thought."

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical integration. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. 
Please note that our press release contains our results versus both 2020 and 2019. For this call, our commentary will be based on our performance versus 2019, which we believe provides a more relevant point of comparison. 
For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 9.3%, reflecting growth versus 2019 for all our major businesses. This strong result was driven by standout performances from Neurovascular, Mako, emergency care, sports medicine and our U.S. shoulder and total ankle products. Each of these posted very strong double-digit growth. 
International organic growth outpaced the U.S. at 14.2% despite COVID challenges in some countries. We posted double-digit growth in most regions, including excellent results in South Pacific, China, Canada, South Korea and many countries in Western Europe. We were also pleased to see the continued rebound in elective procedures as both hips and knees saw quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement and both returned to growth. 
Also, now that we have a fuller appreciation of Wright Medical, we are delighted to have it within the Stryker family. With our first half organic growth of 7.1%, combined with continued recovery of electric procedures, a strong order book across our capital businesses and new product innovations, we have increased confidence in the full year outlook. This is reflected in our upward narrowing of organic sales guidance to 9% to 10% compared to 2019. 
Our sales performance carried through the rest of our results with strong margin performance and adjusted EPS growth and cash flow conversion of over 100% in the quarter. Through the remainder of the year, we do expect a disciplined increase in spending to support our future growth expectations. Our bullish sales outlook, combined with ongoing execution on margins and continued progress on Wright Medical integration has resulted in a raised full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $9.25 to $9.40 a share. 
I continue to be impressed with the resiliency of our people and culture, which positions us well for a successful 2021 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Preston."

My comments today will focus on the second quarter performance of our combined Trauma and Extremities business, including an update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical. During the quarter, our combined worldwide Trauma and Extremities business, including Wright Medical had a strong performance, growing 7% compared to 2019. The performance in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. Trauma and Upper Extremities businesses. U.S. businesses were benefited by the recovery from COVID-related restrictions, which continues to outpace the rest of the world as well as the ongoing execution of the U.S. selling integration. 
The Trauma business unit was positively impacted by the reopening of economies and the continued strong performance of key products, including T2 Alpha, and the mini-frag plating system. Our U.S. upper extremities business, which remains #1 in shoulder arthroplasty, grew strong double digits in the quarter behind continued strength within reverse ARPA plastic portfolio with Perform reverse and revision driving the growth. 
The upper extremities performance in the quarter was enhanced by the continued adoption of our BLUEPRINT planning software with approximately 50% of total shoulder cases completed using BLUEPRINT. As a result of the strong performance of our Trauma and Extremities business, which grew approximately 5% in the first half of the year, we are confident in the combined business to grow at least 6% for the full year when compared to 2019. 
We are now about 9 months into the integration of Wright Medical and we remain very pleased with the progress and efficiency at which the team is moving through the integration. The U.S. integration is pacing ahead of our expectations and cross-selling has begun in a limited capacity. We expect to continue to execute on our cross-selling priorities during the second half of the year as we work to fortify the supply chain and processes to support cross-selling activities. 
Outside the U.S., the teams have successfully executed integration plans in several key markets, including the U.K., Germany, France, Japan and China with further countries to follow into 2022. In addition to the commercial activities, we are also executing on the integration of other operational areas, including the consolidation of distribution and sales offices, harmonization of key operational processes and executing on our manufacturing site strategy. 
Within R&D, the team also continues to make progress on aligning the long-term portfolio, pipeline strategies and harmonized design processes. While the team has moved through the integration, they have also remained focused on executing the critical existing projects in the pipeline. This includes the recent launch of the new Tornier Perform humeral system, which offers clinical solutions for the simplest and most complex arthroplasty procedures and delivers on our mission to make health care better for surgeons and the patients they serve. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn."

During the quarter, we saw a recovery ramp of elective procedures and accelerated sales momentum as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has eased in most geographies. However, the recovery ramp of elective procedures continues to be variable by region and geography and has a more pronounced impact on our orthopedic and spine implant businesses. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 7.5%, reflecting the recovery of our procedural business and continued strong demand for Mako, medical products and neurovascular products. During the quarter, we had strong sequential improvement in all our U.S. businesses. International organic sales showed strong growth of 14.2%. 
Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.25 increased 13.6% from 2019, reflecting sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the Wright Medical acquisition and a somewhat higher quarterly effective tax rate. Our second quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04. 
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 26% and an organic sales growth of 6.7%, including an organic growth of 8% in the U.S. This reflects a ramp-up in elective procedures, especially in knees and trauma and extremities. Our knees business grew 7.5% in the U.S., reflecting the strong bounce back as the COVID-related restrictions were lifted. Other Orthopaedics grew 26.5% in the U.S., primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. 
Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 4% organically, which reflects sequential improvement as the COVID-19 impacts have started to ease in Europe, strong momentum in Mako internationally and strong performances in Australia. For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business, which includes Wright Medical, delivered 7% growth on a comparable basis. In the U.S., comparable growth was 12.5%, and which included double-digit growth in our Upper Extremities and Trauma businesses. 
In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 8.3%, which included 6.4% growth in the U.S. Instruments had a U.S. organic sales growth of 0.9%, primarily related to growth in smoke evacuation, lighted instruments and skin closure products partially offset by slower growth in power tools. As a reminder, during the second quarter of 2019, Instruments had a very strong growth of approximately 19%. 
Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 6%, reflecting strong performances in our Sports Medicine, general surgery and video products. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 13.4%, reflecting continued double-digit performance in our emergency care business. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 15.9% and reflecting strong growth in the Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical businesses across Europe, Canada and Australia. Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 15.5%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in all 4 of our Neurotech businesses: CMF, Neurovascular, Neurosurgical and ENT. It also reflects very strong growth in our neurovascular business of approximately 30%. 
Our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 17.3% and highlighted by strong product growth in Sonopet IQ, bipolar forceps, max space, cryotherapy and nasal implants. Additionally, our U.S. Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of our products, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. 
Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 28.8%. This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets as well as Europe and Australia. 
Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66% was a favorable approximately 15 basis points from second quarter 2019 compared to the second quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by business mix and acquisitions, primarily offset by price. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.6% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.4% of sales, which was slightly better than the second quarter of 2019. The reflects our continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by the impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. 
In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.9% of sales, which is 5 basis points improvement over the second quarter of 2019. This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum combined with the disciplined ramp-up in costs offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. Based on our positive momentum, we continue to reiterate our op margin guidance for the year of 30 to 50 basis points improvement over 2019, excluding the impact of Wright Medical. Related to other income and expense, as compared to the second quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and an increase in interest expense resulting from the additional debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 17% and was impacted by our mix of U.S. non-U.S. income and some adverse discrete tax items included in our provision to return adjustments. 
Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 15.2%. For the full year, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5% with some variability in the remaining quarters, including a slightly lower rate in the third quarter and a more normalized rate in the fourth quarter. 
Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. During the quarter, we fully repaid the $400 million of term loan debt related to the borrowings incurred for the acquisition of Wright Medical. Year-to-date, we have paid down $1.15 billion of debt. 
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.3 billion. This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. And now I will provide a summary of our revised guidance. 
Based on our performance in sales ramp in the second quarter as well as our capital orders pipeline, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 10%. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be at least 6% for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. 
If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Consistent with the upper range of our previous guidance, net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $0.10 in the full year, and this is included in our revised guidance range. 
Based on our performance in the first 6 months and including consideration of our improved full year Wright Medical performance impact, controlled spend ramp to facilitate growth and continued positive recovery outlook, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.25 to $9.40. And now we will open up the call up for Q&A."

And yes, with the Delta variant, you're starting to see pockets of disruption. But overall, the hospitals are very capable of being able to deal with this. And we're seeing in markets like Latin America and other markets, the situation is actually improving. 
So overall, we know there's going to be some disruption. That is baked into our guidance, but we believe, with the momentum that we have across not only our implant business, but as well as our capital businesses, we feel pretty confident enough to raise the bottom end of our full year sales guidance. 
As it relates to Neurovascular, if you look at that business, we had an outstanding first quarter, it was around 27%. So this is 30%. So it's not really a huge acceleration. I would say we really have a great product cycle going on right now across flow-diverting stents, ischemic stroke, our hemorrhagic coils, our aspiration catheters. So we really have the bases covered, and we're having fantastic growth really globally, including terrific performances in Asia Pacific. So I do expect that we'll continue to have very strong performance throughout the rest of this year."

We've seen that in the last couple of quarters as well. And so that continues to be very strong. And there's just been an uptick there really in the U.S. and outside the U.S. 
With regards to ProCuity itself, the team is very pleased with how that launch has gone and started. We've really gotten a lot of awareness out there.

Thank you, Chris. First of all, I would say that the total ankle business did very well in the second quarter. As you know, the rest of foot and ankle is much more discretionary.

It is a bit more elective, those foot and ankle procedures. But I'm very pleased with the stability of our sales force, the leadership that we put in place.

It was a marked improvement. We're not seeing the kind of disruption we saw early on with K2M through that integration. So very bullish on Wright overall.

I mean there's a lot of variables that are going into trying to figure out what that is. What we do know is certainly over the last year that we haven't had the same level of procedures that we would have expected to as a result of the pandemic. And so super hard to predict exactly which percentages of patients that are back are from that deferred backlog or that are new patients. 
What we do know is that surgeons are continuing to try to work through as many patients as possible, finding different opportunities to add capacity into the scheduling or into their opportunity to perform those procedures. And so we don't expect that we're going to see any sort of outsized growth figures that happen in any 1 particular quarter or month. But that's something that we expect that we're going to be working through this backlog over the next several quarters. So we expect it to be a tailwind for us really over the next several quarters and into 2022 for sure. 
When you think about -- thinking about your other question with regards to Wright Medical, the cross-selling component is something that as I mentioned, is -- we're pleased with the start of that.

But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit maybe about the color on any change in mix of placements versus sales? Or in particular, if you're starting to see any sort of cross effects between Upper Extremities and the robot as these 2 business lines kind of move towards convergence in that new application, whenever that comes 12, 24 months from now?

Just think about our portfolio, it absolutely covers the gamut of what they need in those surgery centers. 
So that really makes life easy for an operator in ASC to be able to contract with 1 company to cover such a huge portion of the procedures that are being done. So our portfolio really lines up beautifully for that. We also -- you may have read recently that we have this deal with Conformis that we worked on a couple of years ago. We have started and launched our first few cases of a very, very simplified streamlined offering that provides less sterilization. We call it kind of a knee in a box. 
The official name of it is Triathlon AS-i with personalized cutting guides for the procedure. And so that was designed specifically for the ASC, and that's now launched. But frankly, a few years ago, we didn't realize that Mako would be this popular in the surgery center as it's proving to be. So we now have both that we can offer because some surgery centers won't have a robot. But yes, it involves a huge portion of our portfolio across some of our MedSurg products as well as our implant businesses."

They're a little bit more elective of those procedures, but the total ankle is doing extremely well. So overall, the product portfolio is performing well. Our sales forces are integrating well. The U.S. integration is ahead of schedule. OUS is going to take a little longer, and we knew that. These countries take a little longer with the distributor arrangements that we have in place before they fully hit their stride. 
But if you recall, when we started the year, we said low to mid-single-digit growth on a combined basis. And we sort of moved it up to mid-single, and now we're kind of thinking it's really going to be 6-plus percent for this year.

And so we moved with more speed this time, learned some lessons from prior integrations. 
I would tell you that we think we're growing at least at the market if not above the market because you have to remember that at least 6% is for the full year, including a pretty depressed first quarter, right? So the first quarter of this year was not kind of a normal year as it relates to the Extremities business at all. So to have that over the full year, at least 6% on a combined basis, I think that's probably growing above the market.

So that, for us, was a product gap. 
We didn't have an easy to deploy empty catheter approach for flow diverting stent, and we didn't have a large bore aspiration catheter. So we plugged those, let's call them, product gaps. And we've had fantastic expansion around the world. And really, the Atlas stent in China as an adjunctive stent for hemorrhagic is performing exceptionally well. And this global business is really, really well run. 
We have an exceptional leadership team over there that have been executing very well.

Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.
For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 8.4% versus 2019, driven by excellent double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, but this was offset by softer sales in hip, knee and spine due to the resurgence of COVID-19. 
[Audio Gap] 
portfolio. In addition, we had strong performances from our more emergent businesses, including our core trauma business and another standout performance by Neurovascular.
International organic growth of 12%, again outpaced growth in the U.S., representing robust performances and lessening impacts of COVID-19 across most major geographies, including strong results across Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets.
Our year-to-date organic growth is 7.6%. And with the continued uncertainty related to COVID recovery as well as health care staffing shortages, we are updating our full year organic sales growth guidance to 7% to 8% compared to 2019. Our capital equipment order book remains strong, and we are well positioned for the eventual procedure recovery.
Our adjusted EPS grew 15% versus 2019, and we continued our focus on driving cash flow, leading to a year-to-date cash conversion of 87%. The EPS growth, although solid, was lower than our expectations and is reflected in our updated guidance, which Glenn will elaborate on. Meanwhile, we are pleased with our cash flow performance, which provides us with additional flexibility for future M&A opportunities.
While the quarter did not progress as we had anticipated due to the Delta variant, we remain confident in the outlook for our businesses as evidenced by our strong international MedSurg and Neurotechnology performances. We expect these businesses to continue to perform at high levels with the uncertainty most concentrated in deferrable procedures in the United States. We continue to feel bullish about our longer-term prospects as the pandemic recedes with our proven strategy and strong fundamentals. We are excited to share more with you at our upcoming Analyst Day on November 18.
I will now turn the call over to Preston."

My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment, including how certain products and geographies performed during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the continued integration of Wright Medical, including the performance of our combined trauma and extremities business.
During the quarter, significant spikes of the COVID-19 Delta variant drove increased infections and hospitalizations that require higher hospital bed utilization, which ultimately led to the deferral of elective procedures. In addition to increased hospitalization, hospital staffing shortages also pressured procedural volumes throughout the quarter. This primarily impacted our implant-related businesses including hips, knees and spine, which can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. However, the disease states that we treat are degenerative and the patients that defer their procedures will eventually return to have those procedures completed.
The impact on elective procedures was more pronounced in the United States than on other geographies outside the United States. Within the United States, there were areas of disruption in most states, but disruption was more widespread in the Southeast and Southwest portions of the country, impacting major markets like Florida and Texas throughout the quarter. Other markets around the world, including China, Japan and Australia experienced intermittent lockdowns throughout the quarter, which also drove uneven results across our implant-related businesses in those markets. During the quarter, Europe, which was more impacted by COVID in previous quarters, had impressive organic growth compared to 2019.
COVID-related hospitalizations in the United States began to trend upwards towards the end of July and then progressively worsened peaking at beginning of September. At the end of the quarter, infection and hospitalization rates were declining in impacted regions and has continued into October. As a result, we are beginning to see some improvements in our more impacted businesses through the first few weeks of October. However, we expect the recovery will be partially muted by discontinued hospital staffing challenges and ongoing COVID-related volatility. Our assumption for the fourth quarter is that deferrable procedures will gradually return, starting with a low base in October before returning to more normal levels by the end of the quarter. As a result, we expect that the fourth quarter growth rates for our more deferrable businesses will be similar to the third quarter.
Despite the ongoing challenges with elective procedures, we had strong performances in our more emerging businesses like Neurovascular, which grew strong double digits compared to 2019 as a result of continued market expansion and ongoing global demand for our innovative technologies. In addition, demand for our capital equipment remains healthy as evidenced by our continued strong sales performance and robust order book for small and large capital products, including our surgical technologies, emergency care and neurosurgical businesses.
The ongoing strength in capital is also reflected in the continued demand for our Mako robotic technology. Our industry-leading Mako robot continues to help surgeons improve patient outcomes by knowing more and cutting less. This trend across capital is expected to continue as hospitals take advantage of flexible financing and prioritize capital products like those within our portfolio that are critical to providing emergency care, driving profitable procedures and ensuring safe working environments for caregivers and patients.
Turning to the Wright Medical integration, which continues to progress in all regions and functions. United States commercial integration has moved past the sales force realignment and is now focused on continued business process improvements and system efficiencies. The teams have also developed long-term product pipeline strategy. Outside the United States, we continue to work through integration activities including sales force and indirect channel alignment across all key geographic regions. Overall, we remain pleased with the progress and the pace of integration over the past year.
Including Wright Medical, the combined U.S. Trauma and Extremities business has grown 8.1% year-to-date. The year-to-date growth in the United States has been driven by strong double-digit growth in both our core trauma and upper extremities businesses reflecting the execution of the sales integration in the United States. Outside the United States, sales have declined 3.8% year-to-date, driven by timing of distributor conversions in Latin America and Asia Pacific and declines in our legacy Trauson and Trauma business in China as a result of the provincial tendering process. Considering the latest results, ongoing COVID-related volatility and the provincial tenders in China, we now expect our combined Trauma and Extremities business to grow mid-single digits for the full year.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn."

Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019",1147,"Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020.
Our organic sales growth was 8.4% in the quarter. The third quarter included the same number of average selling days as Q3 2019 and Q3 2020. Compared to 2019, the 2-year impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 2.2%. Versus Q3 2020, pricing was 0.7% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales. Our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses saw another very strong quarter, continuing the growth momentum in the second quarter with double-digit growth in both segments. Our Orthopedics and Spine businesses have been adversely impacted by increases in hospitalization rates starting in early August, especially in the U.S. as a result of the Delta variant. The corresponding impact on elective procedures has significantly slowed the recovery in our Orthopedics and Spine implant businesses.
For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased 7.1%, reflecting the continued strong demand for Mako, instruments, medical and neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 12%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets.
Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.20 increased 15.2% from 2019, reflecting sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower quarterly effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix and higher interest charges resulting from the right acquisition. Our third quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04.
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 19.9% and organic sales growth of 2% including organic growth of 1% in the U.S. This reflects the impact of the slowdown in electric procedures as a result of the Delta variant, which primarily impacted our hip and knee implant businesses. Our knee business grew 0.9% organically in the U.S., reflecting the previously mentioned impact on elective procedures, offset by continued adoption of our robotic platform for total knee procedures.
Our U.S. trauma business grew 8.8%, reflecting solid performances across the portfolio. Other ortho grew 19.8% in the U.S., primarily reflecting demand for our Mako robotic platform partially offset by declines in bone cement. Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 4.1% organically, which reflects the strong performances in Europe and the momentum in Mako internationally, somewhat offset by the increased impact of restrictions imposed on elective procedures due to COVID, especially in Japan.
For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business, which includes tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and skin closure products. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.6%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio including video and general surgery products and strong double-digit growth of their communications and sports medicine businesses.
The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 12.5%, reflecting double-digit performances in its emergency care and Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 12%, reflecting strong growth in the Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical businesses across Europe and Australia. Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 11.8%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in our neurovascular, neurosurgical and interventional spine businesses. Our Neurovascular business had particularly strong growth of approximately 26% and makes up roughly 30% of this segment.
Our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 11.8%, reflecting strong product growth in Sonopet iQ bipolar forceps and bone mill. Our U.S. Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of products, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 24.6%. This performance was driven by strong neurotech demand in China and other emerging markets as well as Europe and Australia.
Now I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was favorable approximately 55 basis points from third quarter 2019. Compared to the third quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by acquisitions, which was partially offset by business mix and price.
Adjusted R&D spending was 6.7% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our SG&A was 34.1% of sales, which was slightly negative as compared to the third quarter of 2019. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by ramping of certain expenses, hiring to support future growth and the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition.
In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.4% of sales, which is approximately the same as third quarter 2019. This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum, offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, primarily Wright Medical.
Related to other income and expenses compared to the third quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14%, which was impacted by our mix of U.S., non-U.S. income and favorable discrete items during the quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 14.8%. For the year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5%.
Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. Year-to-date, we have paid down $1.2 billion of debt. In October, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and increased that facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion.
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $2.3 billion. This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Based on our performance in the third quarter, the continued volatility experienced as a result of COVID, procedural delays in hospital staffing shortages as well as uncertainty around the pace of recovery in the fourth quarter, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8%. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for Trauma & Extremities to be in the mid-single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%.
Adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year and this is included in our revised guidance range. Based on our performance in the first 9 months and including consideration of the aforementioned volatility impacting the recovery of elective procedures and the full year Wright Medical impact, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.08 to $9.15.
And now I will open the call for Q&A."

So while we do expect there to be some recovery happening in those implant businesses throughout the quarter, we do expect it to get back to more normal levels by the end. There are a few headwinds that are out there as well in terms of not only additional COVID hotspots or things like that, but also staffing being a potential headwind as well. So we're definitely monitoring those as we go. But we are seeing some improvement early in October versus where we ended in Q3.
As it relates to the other parts of the business, as both Kevin, Glenn and myself mentioned, our capital business continues to perform very well, and we still have high expectations that those are going to continue into Q4, really, and the way we look at that is just continuing to look at the order book as we ended the quarter and how that continues to progress in terms of growth. Same thing as we think about those more emergent businesses, whether it's trauma or neurovascular, again, those businesses are continuing to perform very well, and there's no reason to believe that they're going to slow down we think about Q4.

We feel very good about our position in the ASC. It's way ahead of our expectations, frankly, going into the pandemic. One measure that we look at is our Sports Medicine business, and that performed in the United States was north of 20% growth in Q3. So we're seeing strength, but the challenge on the hip and knee side of it is just time to build capacity. So it's growing, but it's going to just take time before it becomes a really, really meaningful part of our business. But we believe we're extremely well positioned both with Mako and even without Mako, with our portfolio of everything that they need for an ASC."

So hospitals even though they're struggling through the pandemic, their liquidity is very good, partially due to the CARES funding that was put in place. They're in strong position, and they are getting ready for the future. as we talked about on the last question about ASCs and construction of ASCs and investments in hospitals, the demand for technology is very strong. Our order book for capital is very strong. And there in fact, in Q3, there was actually even some slight delays of some of the capital. There were some challenges of actually having staff to receive some of the capital equipment and put it in place. But I would say I'm feeling very bullish and that capital cycle should continue speaking in the United States through all of next year.
As it relates to the deferrable procedures, hips knees, spine, those represent for Stryker a little less than 30% of our sales. And those are the ones that are most impacted. They will come back. And frankly, I'm excited about certainly hip and knee where the Mako volume continues to grow. And when those procedures come back, we're in a terrific position to capitalize on those because the Mako procedures we're putting in. Roughly half of those are going into competitive accounts. And so when volumes come back, we will be able to really take advantage of that, not just in our own Stryker-friendly accounts, but even in competitive accounts."

So in terms of the backlog itself, and so just starting with the implant-related backlog, I mean, obviously, the last 18 months has not been normal from a volume perspective. And so while we've had some good quarters and some slower quarters, that backlog has continued to exist. And in some cases, like this quarter, it's continued to build. And so it's hard to say exactly what it is because there's just so much variability that's happening across different regions. So if we look at this past quarter, obviously, the U.S. was more impacted than other areas. But it's safe to say that the backlog still exists. And as we think about what's going to happen with that, we think that over time, as we get back to more normal levels, that backlog will begin to work down. And so you'll see some improvement in terms of growth rates over time that will be sustained. You won't really see a big large outsized growth rate that will happen in any one particular quarter with regards to the backlog.
As we think about capital, I mean, there are areas for sure that there's been some pent-up demand and some of the uncertainty has just existed out there in terms of some of the hospital systems. But we're still seeing very strong demand for our products, like we talked about before. The order book remains really, really strong and it continues to grow as well as sales. So we feel very bullish, as Kevin said, with regards to how we think about capital as we go forward into 2022.
With regards to the impacts from a raw material or supply chain perspective. What I would tell you is there certainly are challenges just like everybody else has with regards to whether it's the tight labor market or shortages in things like electronics or resins. But as of now, we've been able to really effectively meet all of our customer needs. And so what that really has required is that our supply chain has really had to be much more active and its support in its partnership with the various supplier base that we have. And so we've been able to really make sure that we're maintaining our safety stock levels. We're really able to actively purchase critical components where necessary so that we can keep production going. And then also just around the logistics and distribution as well and working actively with those partners, all of that in anticipation of the fact that we think that there's going to continue to be some headwinds in this area. And so as a result, we have seen some increased costs as well in terms of inflation on those items. But to date, our supply chain and procurement teams have really just been able to manage that. And so we haven't seen anything really show up in terms of any major impacts on our financials.
And so while we expect that to continue into the rest of '21 and into 2022 as well, we do -- we want to make sure that whatever we have in our numbers has already been factored in some of those raw material challenges that we have. And we're going to just continue to monitor the situation as it progresses."

And frankly, the competition is actually raised the water level of robotics and raised the importance of robotics. So we love our position. And we believe that it's just going to increase the demand for Mako. More and more systems are ordering their second and third and fourth Mako. So we know we have a winning solution for customers.
We're very excited, frankly, with our hip software and our new hip application, which is now penetrated in all of our Mako accounts, and we're seeing a nice uptick. Even though the overall volumes are down because of COVID, we are seeing a nice uptick in the hip adoption given the new software, which makes it easier to do the procedure. So we feel like we're in a very good position. And the fact that there's more competitors to the space just validates the importance of orthopedics, and we like our chances.
As it relates to the shoulder program, we do have an active program. We're not in a position right now to talk about time lines or dates for that. But as you saw with our results in Q3, our shoulder business is doing very well, even before we have a solution with Mako."

Related to that question, I would say that the -- it's really ortho and spine related. That's the bigger factor. So we have products that are used in general surgery and our Endoscopy division and smoke evacuation and we're not seeing the same kind of fall off in those areas as we're seeing in hips and spine. So I do believe it's mostly procedure-related, which creates the difference that you're describing between us and some of the other med tech companies.
There's also regional. Stryker, of course, has a very strong presence in the United States. And so that regional impact. You even saw that with our own implant businesses that we had a more negative impact in the United States than we did in international. And so that's the secondary factor. But I would say the primary factor for what you're seeing versus other companies is that these procedures, hip and spine are more deferrable than some of the other procedures in some of our other med tech peers."

We've been sort of priming the organization to really start focusing and delivering on cash flow. I think as we entered into COVID, it was a real alarm bell for, hey, let's really start focusing on this so that we can sort of keep active in M&A. We can pay down debt, we can meet a lot of the sort of goals that we wanted to meet. So I think we're feeling a little bit of that. You look at performance on AR, we've started to move a lot of our AR into shared service centers, and so we're getting better on process. If you look at AP, we have a large initiative that's being driven by our GQO organization in terms of working with vendors and being smart about what our AP terms can be and should be.
And then all of our divisions are very focused on inventory management and just being smarter about what are the safety stock levels that you really need and what don't you need? And how can we make sure that we're having the right inventory at the right time when we need it.
And then I think the other thing that we're feeling a little bit is we have been fairly controlled and prudent as we look at allocating dollars to capital expenditures. And as you look at our Wright Medical integration, we've really been focused on that spend as well and are running probably a little ahead of where our goals were on that.

And so we're still working through with OUS, but in the U.S., very bullish about core trauma, upper extremities and lower. Now lower, of course, has been impacted somewhat by the deferral of procedures because they're more elective a lot of the foot and ankle procedures.

So it's a very small overall impact as we think about -- for Stryker. But I guess, just focusing on the tender itself, in mid-September, as everybody knows, the bidding was done for the national tender around joint replacements. Our bids were certainly competitive and we secured a position for both hips and knees for our business. Overall, as everybody also knows about 80% price reduction from the end market sale is going to be taking place across the entire industry. And so certainly, that has an impact on us as we think about going forward, but there's a lot of work still left to be done in terms of how that's going to actually be executed. So we're staying vigilant with the teams in China to try to understand how that's going to roll out, it's expected to roll out, I think, in the first quarter of next year. And so it will remain dynamic until we really understand how it's going to execute. In terms of '22, we're not giving guidance at this point in time, and it will certainly be factored in as we give guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call."

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.
For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 8.4% versus 2019, driven by excellent double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, but this was offset by softer sales of Hips, Knees and Spine due to the resurgence of COVID-19. The slowdown in deferrable procedures primarily impacted the U.S. and worsened through the quarter. While our implant businesses were challenged, we saw strong results for our Mako robotic technology and capital products across our MedSurg portfolio. In addition, we had strong performances from our more emergent businesses, including our core Trauma business and another standout performance by Neurovascular.
International organic growth of 12% again outpaced growth in the U.S., representing robust performances and lessening impacts of COVID-19 across most major geographies, including strong results across Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets.
Our year-to-date organic growth is 7.6%. And with the continued uncertainty related to COVID recovery as well as health care staffing shortages, we are updating our full year organic sales growth guidance to 7% to 8% compared to 2019. Our capital equipment order book remains strong, and we are well positioned for the eventual procedure recovery.
Our adjusted EPS grew 15% versus 2019. And we continued our focus on driving cash flow, leading to a year-to-date cash conversion of 87%. The EPS growth, although solid, was lower than our expectations and is reflected in our updated guidance, which Glenn will elaborate on. Meanwhile, we are pleased with our cash flow performance which provides us with additional flexibility for future M&A opportunities.
While the quarter did not progress as we had anticipated due to the Delta variant, we remain confident in the outlook for our businesses, as evidenced by our strong International, MedSurg and Neurotechnology performances. We expect these businesses to continue to perform at high levels with the uncertainty most concentrated in deferrable procedures in the United States. We continue to feel bullish about our longer-term prospects as the pandemic recedes with our proven strategy and strong fundamentals. We are excited to share more with you at our upcoming Analyst Day on November 18.
I will now turn the call over to Preston."

My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment, including how certain products and geographies performed during the quarter.

My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment, including how certain products and geographies performed during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the continued integration of Wright Medical, including the performance of our combined Trauma and Extremities business.
During the quarter, significant spikes of the COVID Delta variant drove increased infections and hospitalizations that required higher hospital bed utilization, which ultimately led to the deferral of elective procedures. In addition to increased hospitalization, hospital staffing shortages also pressured procedural volumes throughout the quarter. This primarily impacted our implant-related businesses, including Hips, Knees and Spine, which can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. However, the disease states that we treat are degenerative, and the patients that defer their procedures will eventually return to have those procedures completed.
The impact on elective procedures was more pronounced in the United States than on other geographies outside the United States. Within the United States, there were areas of disruption in most states, but disruption was more widespread in the Southeast and Southwest portions of the country, impacting major markets like Florida and Texas throughout the quarter. 
Other markets around the world, including China, Japan and Australia, experienced intermittent lockdowns throughout the quarter, which also drove uneven results across our implant-related businesses in those markets. During the quarter, Europe, which was more impacted by COVID in previous quarters, had impressive organic growth compared to 2019.
COVID-related hospitalizations in the United States began to trend upwards towards the end of July and then progressively worsened, peaking at beginning of September. At the end of the quarter, infection and hospitalization rates were declining in impacted regions and has continued into October. As a result, we are beginning to see some improvements in our more impacted businesses through the first weeks of -- few weeks of October. 
However, we expect the recovery will be partially muted by continued hospital staffing challenges and ongoing COVID-related volatility. Our assumption for the fourth quarter is that deferrable procedures will gradually return, starting with a low base in October before returning to more normal levels by the end of the quarter. As a result, we expect that the fourth quarter growth rates for our more deferrable businesses will be similar to the third quarter.
Despite the ongoing challenges with elective procedures, we had strong performances in our more emerging businesses like Neurovascular, which grew strong double digits compared to 2019 as a result of continued market expansion and ongoing global demand for our innovative technologies. In addition, demand for our capital equipment remains healthy as evidenced by a continued strong sales performance and robust order book for small and large capital products, including our surgical technologies, emergency care and neurosurgical businesses.
The ongoing strength in capital is also reflected in the continued demand for our Mako robotic technology. Our industry-leading Mako robot continues to help surgeons improve patient outcomes by knowing more and cutting less. This trend across capital is expected to continue as hospitals take advantage of flexible financing and prioritize capital products like those within our portfolio that are critical to providing emergency care, driving profitable procedures and ensuring safe working environments for caregivers and patients.
Turning to the Wright Medical integration, which continues to progress in all regions and functions. United States commercial integration has moved past the sales force realignment and is now focused on continued business process improvements and system efficiencies. The teams have also developed long-term product pipeline strategy. Outside the United States, we continue to work through integration activities, including sales force and indirect channel alignment across all key geographic regions. Overall, we remain pleased with the progress and the pace of integration over the past year.
Including Wright Medical, the combined U.S. Trauma and Extremities business has grown 8.1% year-to-date. The year-to-date growth in the United States has been driven by strong double-digit growth in both our core trauma and upper extremities businesses, reflecting the execution of the sales integration in the United States. 
Outside the United States, sales have declined 3.8% year-to-date, driven by timing of distributor conversions in Latin America and Asia Pacific and declines in our legacy Trauson trauma business in China as a result of the provincial tendering process. Considering the latest results, ongoing COVID-related volatility and the provincial tenders in China, we now expect our combined Trauma and Extremities business to grow mid-single digits for the full year.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn."

Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019",1216,"Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020.
Our organic sales growth was 8.4% in the quarter. The third quarter included the same number of average selling days as Q3 2019 and Q3 2020. Compared to 2019, the 2-year impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 2.2%. Versus Q3 2020, pricing was 0.7% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales. 
Our MedSurg and NeuroTech businesses saw another very strong quarter, continuing the growth momentum in the second quarter with double-digit growth in both segments. Our Orthopaedics and Spine businesses have been adversely impacted by increases in hospitalization rates starting in early August, especially in the U.S. as a result of the Delta variant. The corresponding impact on elective procedures has significantly slowed the recovery in our Orthopaedics and Spine implant businesses.
For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased 7.1%, reflecting the continued strong demand for Mako, Instruments, Medical and Neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 12%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets.
Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.20 increased 15.2% from 2019, reflecting sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower quarterly effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix and higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition. Our third quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04.
Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 19.9% and organic sales growth of 2%, including organic growth of 1% in the U.S. This reflects the impact of the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the Delta variant, which primarily impacted our Hip and Knee implant businesses. Our Knee business grew 0.9% organically in the U.S., reflecting the previously mentioned impact on elective procedures, offset by continued adoption of our robotic platform for total knee procedures.
Our U.S. Trauma business grew 8.8%, reflecting solid performances across the portfolio. Other ortho grew 19.8% in the U.S., primarily reflecting demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 4.1% organically, which reflects the strong performances in Europe and the momentum in Mako internationally, somewhat offset by the increased impact of restrictions imposed on elective procedures due to COVID, especially in Japan.
For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business, which includes Wright Medical, delivered 3.2% growth on a comparable basis. In the U.S., comparable growth was 7.4%, which included double-digit growth in our upper extremities business. 
In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 12%, which included 12% U.S. organic growth as well. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 15.9%, led by double-digit growth in their orthopedic implants and surgical technology businesses, which include power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and skin closure products. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.6%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including video and general surgery products, and strong double-digit growth of their communications and sports medicine businesses.
The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 12.5%, reflecting double-digit performances in its emergency care and Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 12%, reflecting strong growth in the Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical businesses across Europe and Australia. 
Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 11.8%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in our neurovascular, neurosurgical and interventional spine businesses. Our Neurovascular business had particularly strong growth of approximately 26% and makes up roughly 30% of this segment.
Our U.S. NeuroTech business posted an organic growth of 11.8%, reflecting strong product growth in Sonopet iQ, bipolar forceps and bone mill. Our U.S. Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of products, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 24.6%. This performance was driven by strong NeuroTech demand in China and other emerging markets as well as Europe and Australia.
Now I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was favorable approximately 55 basis points from third quarter 2019. Compared to the third quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by acquisitions, which was partially offset by business mix and price.
Adjusted R&D spending was 6.7% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our SG&A was 34.1% of sales, which was slightly negative as compared to the third quarter of 2019. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by ramping of certain expenses, hiring to support future growth and the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition.
In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.4% of sales, which is approximately the same as third quarter 2019. This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum, offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, primarily Wright Medical.
Related to other income and expenses compared to the third quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. 
Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14%, which was impacted by our mix of U.S., non-U.S. income and favorable discrete items during the quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 14.8%. For the year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5%.
Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. Year-to-date, we have paid down $1.2 billion of debt. In October, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and increased that facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion.
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $2.3 billion. This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Based on our performance in the third quarter, the continued volatility experienced as a result of COVID, procedural delays in hospital staffing shortages as well as uncertainty around the pace of recovery in the fourth quarter, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8%. 
As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be in the mid-single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%.
Adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year, and this is included in our revised guidance range. Based on our performance in the first 9 months and including consideration of the aforementioned volatility impacting the recovery of elective procedures and the full year Wright Medical impact, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.08 to $9.15.
And now I will open the call for Q&A."

So in terms of Q4, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw October starting to show some improvement as it relates to our implant-related businesses. And so we are seeing a bit of a pickup, but I think it's important to note that it's starting from a lower starting point. So while we do expect there to be some recovery happening in those implant businesses throughout the quarter, we do expect it to get back to more normal levels by the end. There are a few headwinds that are out there as well in terms of not only additional COVID hotspots or things like that, but also with staffing being a potential headwind as well. So we're definitely monitoring those as we go. But we are seeing some improvement early in October versus where we ended in Q3.
As it relates to the other parts of the business, as both Kevin, Glenn and myself mentioned, our capital business continues to perform very well, and we still have high expectations that those are going to continue into Q4, really, and the way we look at that is just continuing to look at the order book as we ended the quarter and how that continues to progress in terms of growth. Same thing as we think about those more emergent businesses, whether it's trauma or neurovascular, again, those businesses are continuing to perform very well.

We feel very good about our position in the ASC. It's way ahead of our expectations, frankly, going into the pandemic. One measure that we look at is our Sports Medicine business, and that performed in the United States was north of 20% growth in Q3. So we're seeing strength, but the challenge on the hip and knee side of it is just time to build capacity. So it's growing, but it's going to just take time before it becomes a really, really meaningful part of our business.

But one of the things that we hear often from your businesses and across the board is this sort of demand for capital equipment. And if we look at challenges and procedures and staffing issues and then, on the other hand, hospitals apparently investing fairly heavily in their capital equipment and infrastructure around revised surgery, et cetera.

So hospitals, even though they're struggling through the pandemic, their liquidity is very good, partially due to the CARES funding that was put in place. They're in strong position, and they are getting ready for the future. As we talked about on the last question about ASCs and construction of ASCs and investments in hospitals, the demand for technology is very strong. Our order book for capital is very strong. And there, in fact, in Q3, there was actually even some slight delays of some of the capital. There were some challenges of actually having staff to receive some of these capital equipment and put it in place. But I would say I'm feeling very bullish, and that capital cycle should continue, speaking in the United States, through all of next year.
As it relates to the deferrable procedures, hips, knees, spine, those represent for Stryker a little less than 30% of our sales, and those are the ones that are most impacted. They will come back. And frankly, I'm excited about certainly hip and knee where the Mako volume continues to grow. And when those procedures come back, we're in a terrific position to capitalize on those because the Mako procedures we're putting in, roughly half of those are going into competitive accounts. And so when volumes come back, we will be able to really take advantage of that, not just in our own Stryker-friendly accounts, but even in competitive accounts."

So in terms of the backlog itself, and so just starting with the implant-related backlog, I mean, obviously, the last 18 months has not been normal from a volume perspective. And so while we've had some good quarters and some slower quarters, that backlog has continued to exist. And in some cases, like this quarter, it's continued to build. And so it's hard to say exactly what it is because there's just so much variability that's happening across different regions. So if we look at this past quarter, obviously, the U.S. was more impacted than other areas. But it's safe to say that the backlog still exists. 
And as we think about what's going to happen with that, we think that over time, as we get back to more normal levels, that backlog will begin to work down. And so you'll see some improvement in terms of growth rates over time that will be sustained. You won't really see a big, large, outsized growth rate that will happen in any one particular quarter with regards to the backlog.
As we think about capital, I mean there are areas for sure that there's been some pent-up demand, and some of the uncertainty has just existed out there in terms of some of the hospital systems. But we're still seeing very strong demand for our products. Like we talked about before, the order book remains really, really strong, and it continues to grow as well as sales. So we feel very bullish, as Kevin said, with regards to how we think about capital as we go forward into 2022.
With regards to the impacts from a raw material or supply chain perspective, what I would tell you is there certainly are challenges, just like everybody else has, with regards to whether it's the tight labor market or shortages in things like electronics or resins. But as of now, we've been able to really effectively meet all of our customer needs. And so what that really has required is that our supply chain has really had to be much more active in its support and then in its partnership with the various supplier base that we have. 
And so we've been able to really make sure that we're maintaining our safety stock levels. We're really able to actively purchase critical components where necessary so that we can keep production going. And then also just around the logistics and distribution as well and working actively with those partners, all of that in anticipation of the fact that we think that there's going to continue to be some headwinds in this area. 
And so as a result, we have seen some increased costs as well in terms of inflation on those items. But to date, our supply chain and procurement teams have really just been able to manage that. And so we haven't seen anything really show up in terms of any major impacts on our financials. And so while we expect that to continue into the rest of '21 and into 2022 as well, we do -- we want to make sure that whatever we have in our numbers has already been factored in some of those raw material challenges that we have. And we're going to just continue to monitor the situation as it progresses."

So in spite of the procedural slowdowns, we're seeing strong demand for our system. We clearly have the leading system on the market with a big head start versus the competition. And frankly, the competition has actually raised the water level of robotics and raised the importance of robotics. So we love our position, and we believe that it's just going to increase the demand for Mako. More and more systems are ordering their second and third and fourth Mako. So we know we have a winning solution for customers.
We're very excited, frankly, with our hip software and our new hip application, which has now penetrated in all of our Mako accounts, and we're seeing a nice uptick. Even though the overall volumes are down because of COVID, we are seeing a nice uptick in the hip adoption given the new software, which makes it easier to do the procedure. So we feel like we're in a very good position. And the fact that there's more competitors to the space just validates the importance of orthopedics, and we like our chances.

Related to that question, I would say that the -- it's really ortho and spine-related. That's the bigger factor. So we have products that are used in general surgery and our Endoscopy division and smoke evacuation, and we're not seeing the same kind of falloff in those areas as we're seeing in hips, knees and spine. So I do believe it's mostly procedure-related, which creates the difference that you're describing between us and some of the other med tech companies.
There's also regional. Stryker, of course, has a very strong presence in the United States. And so that regional impact -- you even saw that with our own implant businesses that we had a more negative impact in the United States than we did in international.

So I think we're feeling a little bit of that. 
You look at performance on AR, we've started to move a lot of our AR into shared service centers, and so we're getting better on process. If you look at AP, we have a large initiative that's being driven by our GQO organization in terms of working with vendors and being smart about what our AP terms can be and should be. And then all of our divisions are very focused on inventory management and just being smarter about what are the safety stock levels that you really need and what don't you need, and how can we make sure that we're having the right inventory at the right time when we need it.
And then I think the other thing that we're feeling a little bit is we have been fairly controlled and prudent as we look at allocating dollars to capital expenditures. And as you look at our Wright Medical integration, we've really been focused on that spend as well and are running probably a little ahead of where our goals were on that.

As Preston mentioned, we still have work to do outside the United States. The timing is a little bit later with some of the conversions of our distributors. And so we're still working through it OUS, but in the U.S., very bullish about core trauma, upper extremities and lower. Now lower, of course, has been impacted somewhat by the deferral of procedures because they're more elective, a lot of the foot and ankle procedures. 
But love the leadership team that we have in place, love the pipeline that we have in place and really believe that the entire business of Trauma and Extremities will be accretive to overall Stryker. As you know, Extremities is probably the fastest-growing space within Orthopaedics. And we have a fantastic portfolio, a combined portfolio in both upper and lower extremities. 
But I think one of the side benefits of the Wright Medical integration has been for us to also have a dedicated business just on trauma. So 3 dedicated businesses, 3 terrific leaders of all businesses and great leadership teams. And so we're seeing that, frankly, as you saw with the U.S. number on a combined basis being over 8%, is really a terrific performance. In spite of a slowdown in the foot and ankle space, the overall business is performing very well. And I do expect in '22 and beyond that it will be accretive to Stryker's overall growth rate."

And so we'll talk about more at the analyst meeting sort of what we think that means. 
But what I will tell you is we have every intention to drive that goal once we exit the impacts of COVID. So the organization will not back away from that. And we'll -- even during COVID, we're very mindful of our discipline around spending and how important that is. So we'll expect to see some increases in spending in Q4, and those will set us up to grow in 2022. So we really will allow sort of spending around some of those sales force hiring and marketing initiatives to occur. But as far as it relates to 30 to 50 basis points, beyond what we feel in COVID, we will not back away from that goal."

So it's a very small overall impact as we think about for Stryker. 
But I guess, just focusing on the tender itself, in mid-September, as everybody knows, the bidding was done for the national tender around joint replacements. Our bids were certainly competitive, and we secured a position for both hips and knees for our business. Overall, as everybody also knows, about 80% price reduction from the end market sale is going to be taking place across the entire industry. And so certainly, that has an impact on us as we think about going forward, but there's a lot of work still left to be done in terms of how that's going to actually be executed. 
So we're staying vigilant with the teams in China to try to understand how that's going to roll out. It's expected to roll out, I think, in the first quarter of next year. And so it will remain dynamic until we really understand how it's going to execute. In terms of '22, we're not giving guidance at this point in time, and it will certainly be factored in as we give guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call."
