Before we begin, and on behalf of the entire Public Storage team, I hope you and your families are well as we all navigate through this pandemic. Looking back at the full range of events in 2020, i",483,"Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, and on behalf of the entire Public Storage team, I hope you and your families are well as we all navigate through this pandemic. Looking back at the full range of events in 2020, it was clearly a year of historic extremes. The year began with the predicted consequences from oversupply in several markets. In Q2, full focus shifted to managing a myriad of unknown issues tied to the virus. This included judging impacts on our employees, customers, operations, development approvals, acquisition volume and full company revenue with an overarching effort to maintain a safe environment and keep properties open. 
By Q3, we saw pronounced customer activity emerge as a result of both traditional and new drivers of demand. In the fourth quarter and into this year, we have seen sustained demand that has lifted the traditional seasonal slowdown in our business, resulting in historic occupancy and move in rate growth. I commend the Public Storage team on the numerous successes we had in 2020 and their ability to be nimble and creative in an environment we have never faced before. 
Now I would like to highlight 8 specific areas of success as I reflect on the full year and on the fourth quarter. First, the integration of technology unlocked a new contactless leasing channel, which we call e-rental, which now accounts for nearly 50% of our move-ins. Approximately 300,000 customers use this new offering in 2020. Second, move-in rates grew by 12% in Q4 compared to negative 14% in Q2. Third, we reached fourth quarter occupancy of 95.2%, a record for this time of the year. Fourth, the robust lease-up of our 32 million square foot non same-store portfolio led to 26% NOI growth for both the quarter and the year. Fifth, after 2 full years, our third-party management business has expanded to 120 properties with a growing backlog as we enter 2021. Sixth, our industry-leading development platform has produced a current pipeline of $560 million as we deliver generation 5 assets across the United States. Seventh, the acquisition team sourced nearly $800 million of assets in 2020, with over $500 million in Q4, and we are entering 2021 with an equally vibrant pipeline of $580 million. 
And last, our focus on the continued optimization of our balance sheet, with record low issuances of preferred equity and debt. As we begin 2021, we are well equipped and focused on driving company performance on several fronts. Our advantages include a well primed capital structure, broad and growing benefits of the digitization of our business, record occupancy and, of course, the most commanding platform and brand in the self-storage industry. The Public Storage leadership team and I look forward to sharing more of these strategies in our upcoming Investor Day on May 3. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Financial performance improved steadily through the second half of 2020, with a return to positive same-store revenue, NOI and full company core FFO growth in the fourth quarter. Our same-store revenue increased 0.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, which represents a sequential improvement in growth of 3.5% from the third quarter. There were 2 primary factors contributing to that improvement. First and foremost, move in rates, as Joe highlighted, were up double digits, while move out rates were roughly flat year-over-year, which led to improving in place rents. To a lesser extent, occupancy also increased with move in volume down, move out volume down Now on to expenses. The team did a great job driving same-store cost of operations down in the fourth quarter. 
Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, taxes, utilities and marketing. The net result was a return to positive NOI growth of 1.3% in the fourth quarter. On the reporting front, we enhanced the presentation of same-store expenses this quarter. We broke expenses into 2 categories: first, direct cost of operations; and second, indirect cost of operations. This provides enhanced disclosure into property level profitability which once again demonstrates our industry-leading operating margins. We also posted our first earnings supplement on our website last night, which we hope you found helpful along with our 10-K. 
Next, our balance sheet. It's in great shape with 2 drivers of cash flow growth. First, as we have for the last 5 years, we have the capability to fund acquisitions and development activity with retained cash flow and unsecured debt at historically low financing costs. And second, we have the opportunity to redeem preferred stock as we move through the year. As we enter 2021, we've seen continued strength in customer demand, with occupancies up 250 basis points and in place contract rent per occupied square foot turning into positive year-over-year territory in January. The outlook for revenue growth is good with support from demand and moderating supply. That said, we do see risk to both move-outs as well as lingering state of emergency pricing restrictions as we move through the year. We expect continued strong expense control in 2021. We provide line-by-line commentary on our disclosure. Property tax expense growth is expected to pick up with around a 5.5% increase for the year anticipated. But away from that, better performance by utilizing technology to change operating processes, and investing in energy efficiency, we anticipate continued savings on property, payroll and utilities and a better marketing expense environment as we're operating with lower vacancies. 
In sum, improving revenue outlook and strong expense control as we start 2021. With that, I'll turn it back to Ryan."

We're seeing some interesting and new areas of customer behavior surfacing. You could point to the work from home environment. So that's pronounced widespread. We're seeing it across literally all markets. It's provided an additive driver to the amount of activity that we're seeing. One of the things that we do on a regular basis to survey new customers coming into properties. And in 2020, one of the areas that was more pronounced was customers needing more space at home. So clearly ties to the entire work from home environment that's new and different through 2020. Likely to stay through a good chunk of 2021 and beyond because, frankly, I think many components of work from home are here for a much longer period of time than we might have predicted. Another thing that's been additive, home sales have been quite vibrant, even from a seasonality standpoint, we're seeing much more activity this time of the year than we normally do. So that too is added to the amount of activity and the overall demand that we're seeing across many markets. There's really been no distinction from activity in suburban versus urban areas. Frankly, it's highly consistent in both regard. So we're keeping a close track on many different cross currents. But overall business, as Tom noted, is quite good."

The acquisition environment, as I know, has been quite robust. And if you step back, even going to 2019, we started to see an increase of the amount of sellers that were coming to market many of whom had come into the self-storage industry over the last, say, 4 or 5 years. There's no question there's been a much more vibrant amount of new owners coming into the sector. Some of whom weren't intending to stay in the sector for a long period of time. So you've got some churn tied to that. You've also got a number of assets that have been built at historic volume levels over the last 3 or 4 years, many of which have not hit either occupancy or revenue pro forma expectations, that too has motivated a number of sellers to bring assets to market. We've been controlling the markets as we typically do very actively. And then in 2020, we saw a sizable uptick in opportunities, many of which that fit the explanation I just described on the types of sellers that are coming to market. The other thing that we've found an interesting opportunity to expand into buying assets that may not be highly stabilized or looking for a different level of value creation. So in 2020, the average occupancy of the assets we bought was approximately 65%. That speaks to the fact that these are newer assets. They haven't gone through a full lease-up cycle and sellers have been frustrated in many cases and not patient enough to want to take them through that full cycle. So we've been able to open up some very interesting opportunities tied to that. And the $580 million that we have either closed or are in contract for 2021 is a reflection of all those issues. The average occupancy of those assets is about the same, which is in the mid-60% range. Combination of one-off and some smaller portfolios, nothing as large as beyond portfolio that we closed in the fourth quarter. But our acquisition team continues to control markets, and they're very well known. We've got deep relationships. We're seeing a combination of both marketed and off market opportunities. And we're looked upon as a preferred buyer. So Tom spoke to the fact that the capital structure is well primed, and we're frankly just seeing a much larger set of opportunities."

And that's a good long-term sustainable FFO growth engine. So we think we do have a good amount of capacity there. And as Joe said, we have very good access across the capital markets, and we demonstrated that again in January with a 5-year bond offering, sub-1% on the coupon. So good access and cost, and we look forward to utilizing it to finance the external growth that Joe mentioned."

I think there's really a couple of things as we look out over the horizon into 2021 that we view as potential headwinds, I mentioned them briefly. One of them is move-outs. As we move through 2020, it was really a unique environment that we've spoken about on previous calls, where the customer behavior shifted as we moved into April and May and really persist through the year, across customer vintages, geographies, customer segments, where length of stays went longer and move-outs declined. And you can see that in our disclosures. That's one area that we do anticipate is likely to moderate as we move through 2021. Maybe it's into 2022. I mean it's uncertain as to when we do see that moderation. So far to start this year, we've continued to see very strong existing customer performance and lower move-outs. But we would anticipate that at some point, customer behavior returns to pre pandemic levels. And we see move-outs start to accelerate. So that's number one. The second one is the lingering impact of state of emergency pricing restrictions. And those impact our ability to increase move in rents as well as existing tenant price increases over time. And as those linger and we navigate through the dynamic health care environment that we have for the past year, that's a risk. We'll have to see. There's a myriad of different regulations across different states. Probably most notably here in the state of California, which is a good portion of our portfolio, and we'll -- that's an unpredictable element of rate restriction."

Literally, every one of our markets improved in occupancy in the quarter. And we continue to see very good and sustained demand coming through not only our same-store portfolio, but the lease-up of our nonsame-store is quite vibrant. The demand for self-storage has been very resilient through both the pandemic, and I think it reaffirms the attractiveness of the product itself. Supply though is still a factor in a number of markets. There's no question. And it has and will continue to be a headwind in the name markets that we've spoken to for the last 2 or 3 years as many markets have been burdened by oversupply. The Houston market, for instance, still is absorbing a lot of product, but we're seeing good traction though. And to your point on the Southeast Atlanta has got some headwinds around supply. Minneapolis, Florida, parts of New York, et cetera. But at the same time, demand is quite healthy. So we're very pleased with the amount of lease up that's going on. And we're very pleased with the acceleration and stabilization of our non same-store portfolio."

I mean, I guess I wouldn't highlight a particular occupancy or rate strategy for the back half of the year, given it's way too early to understand what the nature of the dynamics will be in the local submarkets with which we operate. I would highlight, clearly through 2020, we had the opportunity to anticipate lower move out volumes and lower inventory levels, which led to accelerating pricing, really starting in the second quarter and then accelerating through the second half of the year and now into the first quarter as well. So I think it's really been a rate focused strategy at this point given the low inventory levels, and that's been combined with lower promotional discounts, which we disclosed as well as lower marketing expense. As we move into the back half of 2021, if the picture you're painting is 1 where occupancy starts to fall significantly because of increased move out activity, that will definitely change the dynamics in the local market. But I think 1 of the key components that we'd have to understand is whether the durability of consumer demand that we're seeing now persists because that is a really strong and powerful driver to revenue growth and overall move-in rates and accommodations to customers. So we're ultimately looking to maximize revenues, and we need to understand the nature of the move-ins and move outs. But clearly, it's a combination of both occupancy and rent and operating trends continue to be quite good as we start 2021."

So obviously, we've talked about now for the last 2 to 3 years. We've been in a very strong delivery pattern of new assets. You go back to 2017, about $4 billion of new assets were added to the market nationally. It ticked up in 2018 and '19, which, at the moment, feels like a peak, that was about $5 billion of deliveries. In 2020, as expected, we saw that taper down by about 10% to 12%, where now we're at 2021, and we're thinking that there's likely another 10% to 15% reduction in deliveries. It's come to different markets. It's had, as I mentioned earlier, some pretty detrimental impacts where it hit certain submarkets with an inordinate amount of oversupply. We're encouraged, however, that it's cyclically starting to taper down, but it's still with us. And even at a level this year, that could be somewhere between $3.5 or so billion to maybe $3.75 billion of deliveries, it's -- that's still a fair amount of new assets being delivered in many markets. As I mentioned, it has provided an opportunity for us to go out and acquire assets on one front. On our development platform, it's also given us a pocket of opportunity that we haven't seen until the last year or 2, where we're actually not seeing as much competitive bidding on land sites. And it's creating another different opportunity that we uniquely enjoy because we do have an industry-leading development platform and our development teams out betting a higher level of land sites as we speak. So we're hopeful that, that continued decline of deliveries play through to counterbalance that. The self-storage sector is doing quite well. And funding is out there, and developers are still going to be encouraged in some areas to continue to put new product into markets. So we're tracking it actively. And we'll see how it plays through in the coming quarters."

It's something, Rick, that we're watching very closely, both the composition, as Joe mentioned, based on survey data and customer activity. As we move through 2020. The good thing is it's been really durable, and the momentum has continued. So looking at top of funnel demand trends, web visits and sales calls are up 10% plus, and that's against an inventory backdrop, where occupancies are higher, vacancies are lower. And as Joe just mentioned, lease-up assets are filling up faster. So a good environment to have strong top of funnel customer interest. In terms of the types of customers or the use cases of storage, one of them that Joe highlighted that we saw really accelerate in the April and May time period was consumers that were not moving, but we're looking to free up some space in their home. And that use case has continued to trend higher than prior years throughout the year. In other words, it wasn't an April, May but it has persisted throughout. And those customers tend to be good storage customers as they utilize the storage space as an extension of their home and tend to have longer length of stays. So that's a nice backdrop and characterization of the demand that we've seen to date, and we'll support the occupancy and customer tenure here going forward. How long that lasts, is anybody's guess. But we've been encouraged by how persistent it's been through 2020 and into 2021.

It was built around a very efficient and time-sensitive customer who wanted to be much more oriented toward a self-service transaction. So we've really seen good adaptability and adoption by customers. It's now approximately 50% of our move-in process. And to your point, it will likely have different kinds of beneficial impacts as we continue to study our operational model and the way that it too provides a different level of service to customers.

Before we begin, and on behalf of the entire Public Storage team, I hope you and your families are well as we all navigate through this pandemic. Looking back at the full range of events in 2020,",480,"Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, and on behalf of the entire Public Storage team, I hope you and your families are well as we all navigate through this pandemic. 
Looking back at the full range of events in 2020, it was clearly a year of historic extremes. The year began with the predicted consequences from oversupply in several markets. In Q2, full focus shifted to managing a myriad of unknown issues tied to the virus. This included judging impacts on our employees, customers, operations, development approvals, acquisition volume and full company revenue with an overarching effort to maintain a safe environment and keep properties open. 
By Q3, we saw pronounced customer activity emerge as a result of both traditional and new drivers of demand. In the fourth quarter and into this year, we have seen sustained demand that has lifted the traditional seasonal slowdown in our business, resulting in historic occupancy and move-in rate growth. I commend the Public Storage team on the numerous successes we had in 2020 and their ability to be nimble and creative in an environment we have never faced before. 
Now I would like to highlight 8 specific areas of success as I reflect on the full year and on the fourth quarter: First, the integration of technology unlocked a new contactless leasing channel, which we call e-rental, which now accounts for nearly 50% of our move-ins. Approximately 300,000 customers use this new offering in 2020. 
Second, move-in rates grew by 12% in Q4 compared to negative 14% in Q2. Third, we reached fourth quarter occupancy of 95.2%, a record for this time of the year. Fourth, the robust lease-up of our 32 million square foot non-same-store portfolio led to 26% NOI growth for both the quarter and the year. 
Fifth, after 2 full years, our third-party management business has expanded to 120 properties with a growing backlog as we enter 2021. Sixth, our industry-leading development platform has produced a current pipeline of $560 million as we deliver generation 5 assets across the United States. Seventh, the acquisition team sourced nearly $800 million of assets in 2020, with over $500 million in Q4, and we are entering 2021 with an equally vibrant pipeline of $580 million. And last, our focus on the continued optimization of our balance sheet, with record low issuances of preferred equity and debt. 
As we begin 2021, we are well equipped and focused on driving company performance on several fronts. Our advantages include a well-primed capital structure, broad and growing benefits of the digitization of our business, record occupancy and, of course, the most commanding platform and brand in the self-storage industry. The Public Storage leadership team and I look forward to sharing more of these strategies in our upcoming Investor Day on May 3. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
305520,703194288,2225378,"Public Storage, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Public Storage","Executives","Thanks, Joe. Financial performance improved steadily through the second half of 2020, with a return to positive same-store revenue, NOI and full company core FFO growth in the fourth quarter. Our same-store revenue increased 0.8% compared to the fourth qu",445,"Thanks, Joe. Financial performance improved steadily through the second half of 2020, with a return to positive same-store revenue, NOI and full company core FFO growth in the fourth quarter. Our same-store revenue increased 0.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, which represents a sequential improvement in growth of 3.5% from the third quarter. There were 2 primary factors contributing to that improvement. First and foremost, move-in rates, as Joe highlighted, were up double digits, while move-out rates were roughly flat year-over-year, which led to improving in-place rents. To a lesser extent, occupancy also increased with move-in volume down, move-out volume down lower. 
Now on to expenses. The team did a great job driving same-store cost of operations down in the fourth quarter. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, taxes, utilities and marketing. The net result was a return to positive NOI growth of 1.3% in the fourth quarter. 
On the reporting front, we enhanced the presentation of same-store expenses this quarter. We broke expenses into 2 categories: first, direct cost of operations; and second, indirect cost of operations. This provides enhanced disclosure into property level profitability which once again demonstrates our industry-leading operating margins. We also posted our first earnings supplement on our website last night, which we hope you found helpful along with our 10-K. 
Next, our balance sheet. It's in great shape with 2 drivers of cash flow growth. First, as we have for the last 5 years, we have the capability to fund acquisitions and development activity with retained cash flow and unsecured debt at historically low financing costs. And second, we have the opportunity to redeem preferred stock as we move through the year. 
As we enter 2021, we've seen continued strength in customer demand, with occupancies up 250 basis points and in-place contract rent per occupied square foot turning into positive year-over-year territory in January. The outlook for revenue growth is good with support from demand and moderating supply. That said, we do see risk to both move-outs as well as lingering state of emergency pricing restrictions as we move through the year. 
We expect continued strong expense control in 2021. We provide line-by-line commentary on our disclosure. Property tax expense growth is expected to pick up with around a 5.5% increase for the year anticipated. But away from that, better performance by utilizing technology to change operating processes, and investing in energy efficiency, we anticipate continued savings on property, payroll and utilities and a better marketing expense environment as we're operating with lower vacancies. 
In sum, an improving revenue outlook and strong expense control as we start 2021. With that, I'll turn it back to Ryan."

We're seeing some interesting and new areas of customer behavior surfacing. You could point to the work-from-home environment. So that's pronounced, widespread. We're seeing it across literally all markets. It's provided an additive driver to the amount of activity that we're seeing. One of the things that we do on a regular basis to survey new customers coming into properties. And in 2020, one of the areas that was more pronounced was customers needing more space at home. 
So clearly ties to the entire work-from-home environment that's new and different through 2020. Likely to stay through a good chunk of 2021 and beyond because, frankly, I think many components of work from home are here for a much longer period of time than we might have predicted. 
Another thing that's been additive, home sales have been quite vibrant, even from a seasonality standpoint, we're seeing much more activity this time of the year than we normally do. So that too is added to the amount of activity and the overall demand that we're seeing across many markets. There's really been no distinction from activity in suburban versus urban areas. Frankly, it's highly consistent in both regard. So we're keeping a close track on many different cross currents. But overall business, as Tom noted, is quite good."

The acquisition environment, as I note, has been quite robust. And if you step back, even going to 2019, we started to see an increase of the amount of sellers that were coming to market, many of whom had come into the self-storage industry over the last, say, 4 or 5 years. There's no question there's been a much more vibrant amount of new owners coming into the sector. Some of whom weren't intending to stay in the sector for a long period of time. So you've got some churn tied to that. 
You've also got a number of assets that have been built at historic volume levels over the last 3 or 4 years, many of which have not hit either occupancy or revenue pro forma expectations, that too has motivated a number of sellers to bring assets to market. We've been controlling the markets as we typically do very actively. And then in 2020, we saw a sizable uptick in opportunities, many of which that fit the explanation I just described on the types of sellers that are coming to market. 
The other thing that we've found an interesting opportunity to expand into buying assets that may not be highly stabilized or looking for a different level of value creation. So in 2020, the average occupancy of the assets we bought was approximately 65%. That speaks to the fact that these are newer assets. They haven't gone through a full lease-up cycle and sellers have been frustrated in many cases and not patient enough to want to take them through that full cycle. So we've been able to open up some very interesting opportunities tied to that. And the $580 million that we have either closed or are in contract for 2021 is a reflection of all those issues. 
The average occupancy of those assets is about the same, which is in the mid-60% range. Combination of one-off and some smaller portfolios, nothing as large as Beyond portfolio that we closed in the fourth quarter. But our acquisition team continues to troll markets, and they're very well known. We've got deep relationships. We're seeing a combination of both marketed and off-market opportunities. And we're looked upon as a preferred buyer. So Tom spoke to the fact that the capital structure is well primed, and we're frankly just seeing a much larger set of opportunities."

I think there's really a couple of things as we look out over the horizon into 2021 that we view as potential headwinds. I mentioned them briefly. One of them is move-outs. As we move through 2020, it was really a unique environment that we've spoken about on previous calls, where the customer behavior shifted as we moved into April and May and really persist through the year, across customer vintages, geographies, customer segments, where length of stays went longer and move-outs declined. And you can see that in our disclosures. 
That's one area that we do anticipate is likely to moderate as we move through 2021. Maybe it's into 2022. I mean it's uncertain as to when we do see that moderation. So far to start this year, we've continued to see very strong existing customer performance and lower move-outs. But we would anticipate that at some point, customer behavior returns to pre pandemic levels. And we see move-outs start to accelerate. So that's number one. 
The second one is the lingering impact of state of emergency pricing restrictions. And those impact our ability to increase move-in rents as well as existing tenant price increases over time. And as those linger and we navigate through the dynamic health care environment that we have for the past year, that's a risk. We'll have to see. There's a myriad of different regulations across different states. Probably most notably here in the state of California, which is a good portion of our portfolio, and we'll -- that's an unpredictable element of rate restriction."

The demand for self-storage has been very resilient through both the pandemic, and I think it reaffirms the attractiveness of the product itself. Supply though is still a factor in a number of markets. There's no question. And it has and will continue to be a headwind in the name markets that we've spoken to for the last 2 or 3 years as many markets have been burdened by oversupply. The Houston market, for instance, still is absorbing a lot of product, but we're seeing good traction though.

I would highlight, clearly through 2020, we had the opportunity to anticipate lower move-out volumes and lower inventory levels, which led to accelerating pricing, really starting in the second quarter and then accelerating through the second half of the year and now into the first quarter as well. So I think it's really been a rate focused strategy at this point given the low inventory levels, and that's been combined with lower promotional discounts, which we disclosed as well as lower marketing expense. 
As we move into the back half of 2021, if the picture you're painting is one where occupancy starts to fall significantly because of increased move-out activity, that will definitely change the dynamics in the local market. But I think 1 of the key components that we'd have to understand is whether the durability of consumer demand that we're seeing now persists because that is a really strong and powerful driver to revenue growth and overall move-in rates and accommodations to customers. So we're ultimately looking to maximize revenues, and we need to understand the nature of the move-ins and move-outs.

And it's creating another different opportunity that we uniquely enjoy because we do have an industry-leading development platform and our development teams out betting a higher level of land sites as we speak. 
So we're hopeful that, that continued decline of deliveries play through to counterbalance that. The self-storage sector is doing quite well. And funding is out there, and developers are still going to be encouraged in some areas to continue to put new product into markets. So we're tracking it actively. And we'll see how it plays through in the coming quarters."

As I mentioned, currently, we've got the program up to 120 properties, a sizable percentage of the assets that are coming into our pipeline are development assets. So it's another view of how much of that activity is on the front lines in many markets. That's helpful. We've actually bought 4 assets thus far from the platform itself. So it can be many times a different relationship opportunity to identify and actually acquire assets. And it's always helpful to get outside feedback on the different operational methodologies that we use, the reaction we've got from owners, the way that they're looking at the performance of assets. 
So holistically, it's been very additive, and it's given us yet again a different perspective on the industry in many different ways. So we're encouraged about our opportunities going into this year. The pipeline continues to grow. It is not fully weighted, but it is heavily weighted around continued construction activity or development activity, but we're also finding a number of owners that have given us, say, 1, 2 or 3 assets initially, and now they're giving us more. So it's another way for us to continue to build relationships, and we look forward to strengthening relationships as we continue -- as the program continues to expand."

It's something, Rick, that we're watching very closely, both the composition, as Joe mentioned, based on survey data and customer activity as we move through 2020. The good thing is it's been really durable, and the momentum has continued. So looking at top of funnel demand trends, web visits and sales calls are up 10% plus, and that's against an inventory backdrop, where occupancies are higher, vacancies are lower. And as Joe just mentioned, lease-up assets are filling up faster. So a good environment to have strong top of funnel customer interest. 
In terms of the types of customers or the use cases of storage, one of them that Joe highlighted that we saw really accelerate in the April-May time period was consumers that were not moving, but were looking to free up some space in their home. And that use case has continued to trend higher than prior years throughout the year. In other words, it wasn't an April-May blip but it has persisted throughout. And those customers tend to be good storage customers as they utilize the storage space as an extension of their home and tend to have longer length of stays. So that's a nice backdrop and characterization of the demand that we've seen to date, and we'll support the occupancy and customer tenure here going forward. 
How long that lasts, is anybody's guess. But we've been encouraged by how persistent it's been through 2020 and into 2021. And as Joe mentioned, we do think some elements of the reaction to really individuals daily lives being disrupted through the pandemic will persist as we go forward, be it with the ability to work from home for more days or just generally spending more time at home. So we're encouraged by that, but no guidepost into the future as to what exactly or what day or time period those could shift."

Before we begin, we continue to wish everyone good health as we all face the many impacts from the pandemic. This morning, Tom and I will begin the call by covering a few areas tied to Q1 perform",621,"Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, we continue to wish everyone good health as we all face the many impacts from the pandemic. 
This morning, Tom and I will begin the call by covering a few areas tied to Q1 performance, along with our inaugural guidance for 2021. As you know, on May 3, we are hosting an Investor Day virtually and hope you can join us. We will share our key strategies and introduce you to the executive leadership team that will drive our growth in the coming years. 
Looking at Q1, a number of historic metrics play through. Customer demand for self-storage has remained elevated. We continue to see consistent customer behavior across all markets with increased move in rates, extended customer length of stay and more latitude to resume traditional rate increases to existing customers. 
Demand has been tied to both historic drivers coupled with the longer-lasting impacts from more consumers needing storage. This includes work-from-home, study-from-home, elevated home sales and remodeling and the migration in and out of metropolitan markets. 
With the economy improving and additional government stimulus, consumer balance sheets are healthy and our customers' payment patterns remain strong. Both same-store and non-same-store assets are performing well. With lease ups, particularly in non-same-store assets outpacing our projections as NOI grew by 46%. 
To investments, 2021 is shaping up to be a robust year of acquisition activity. With the addition of the recently announced easy storage portfolio, our year-to-date 2020 acquisition activity either closed or under contract is $2.5 billion. Of note, since 2019, we have acquired, developed and redeveloped approximately 22 million square feet and have expanded our portfolio by 13%, having invested $4.3 billion. 
In regard to the Easy Storage acquisition, I would like to mention a few highlights of this significant transaction and how it matched 4 specific areas tied to our unique capabilities. First, the integration of the assets into the Public Storage brand and operating platform will be seamless as we already had a broad presence in these markets with 115 assets. We now enjoy even stronger presence with now 163 assets with unmatched brand presence across the mid-Atlantic region. 
Second, 8 of the Easy Storage assets are poised for expansion, along with 1 that has begun ground-up development. The Public Storage development team has taken lead on these opportunities and is ready to execute on each 1 of them allowing us to expand the portfolio by approximately 10% over the next 24 months. 
As you know, Public Storage has the only development team among the self-storage REITs and is well poised to unlock more value from this portfolio by virtue of our unique development capabilities. Third, our ability to fund a large acquisition and close in a very short time line. In this case, 6 weeks from selection to close was due to our efficient and primed capital structure. 
This transaction is immediately accretive to FFO and NOI. And fourth, our well-earned reputation of being a buyer of choice in the investment community. I want to thank the Manganaro family and the Easy Storage team for choosing Public Storage and the great work they put into this outstanding portfolio over the last 2-plus decades. 
We appreciate their assistance in integrating this outstanding portfolio into our platform and welcome many of their employees and customers to Public Storage. Looking to full 2021 we are encouraged by core customer demand, our well-located portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the quality and dedication of the 5,000-plus team members at Public Storage, all of whom are committed to enhancing the leading brand in the self-storage industry. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Tom."
305520,710900659,2262936,"Public Storage, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Public Storage","Executives","Thanks, Joe. I'll start with financial performance. Our financial performance has improved steadily through the second half of 2020 into the first quarter of 2021. In the same-store, our revenue increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020, which",590,"Thanks, Joe. I'll start with financial performance. Our financial performance has improved steadily through the second half of 2020 into the first quarter of 2021. In the same-store, our revenue increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020, which represents a sequential improvement in growth of 2.6% from the fourth quarter. 
There were 2 primary factors contributing to that improvement. First and foremost, move-in rates were up double digits, while move-out rates were roughly flat year-over-year, leading to improving in place rents. 
Secondly, occupancy also increased through the quarter with move-in volume down but move-out volume also lower. 
Now on to expenses. The team did a great job driving same-store cost of operations down in the first quarter. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property tax specifically, we will expense our estimate ratably through the year, leading to a benefit in the first 3 quarters and reversing to a headwind in the fourth quarter. 
This will lead to more stable quarter-over-quarter property tax in the future. The benefit this quarter was worth $0.05 of FFO. 
Some of the technology and operating model evolution will discuss on Monday at our Investor Day, showed up in our first quarter numbers, with property payroll down 13% in the quarter, given efficiency improvements. We look forward to sharing more on Monday. 
For the first time, we included 2021 core FFO guidance in our earnings release and supplement. In conjunction with the line-by-line commentary in our supplemental, it's a guide to our outlook and the key drivers of our business. And as we started 2021, we've seen continued strength, as Joe mentioned, in customer demand, with occupancies up 260 basis points and in place contract rent per occupied square foot turning into positive year-over-year territory in January. 
We anticipate same-store revenue to grow from 4% to 5.5% in 2021. That outlook is supported by good customer demand and moderating supply. That said, we do see risk to move-outs going higher as we move through the year comping against what was really extraordinary existing tenant performance in 2020. 
Our current expectations are for occupancy to be down 100 basis points plus in the fourth quarter compared to 2020. We expect continued strong expense control in the same-store in 2021. Our expectations are for 1% to 2% same-store expense growth. Property tax expense growth will pick up this year with our expectations around a 5% increase for the year, again, recognized ratably through the year. 
Our guidance includes the acceleration of our external growth initiatives with Easy Storage and will add to FFO growth through our non same-store portfolio this year and next. 
In total, our outlook is for core FFO per share of $11.35 to $11.75 for 2021. 
I'll now shift gears to the balance sheet. As Joe mentioned, we used our growth-oriented balance sheet to fund the purchase of Easy Storage entering the bond market the day after announcement and having fully funded the transaction within 2 days. The offering comprised of 3, 7 and 10 year tranches with a weighted average cost of about 1.6%. 
After effect of the transaction, we have the longest duration balance sheet in the REIT industry with 1 of the lowest cost profiles. And we remain in a great position to continue to use the balance sheet to fund our growth initiatives, and we'll share more at our Investor Day on Monday. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Angela to open the line up for questions."

First question is just really the main incoming investor question we get, and it's around the customers, demand drivers and Joe, you discussed this, I guess, in your opening remarks a bit. But -- and then again, you talked about a decrease in occupancy in the fourth quarter. 
Can you just, I guess, dig in a little bit more on why you feel the customer -- some of the drivers we saw last year, may fade? And can you confirm the 100 bps drops in the fourth quarter is that just normal seasonality? How does that compare to normally what you see in the fourth quarter?"

One of the things that is hard to predict, even going out another couple of quarters is what could revert to some degree to what you would call normal seasonality. So to Tom's point, we're looking at that as a potential event, but still to be determined. As we've seen now for the last several quarters, the sustainability of consumer and business demand for that matter has been quite elevated. 
As I noted, there are consistent market trends, literally in every area that we operate in the business right now. And consumers continue to look for and need storage for a whole host of both traditional and I would say, new and different reasons. We're encouraged by the fact that there's even generationally entirely new pool of customers coming to storage for the first time. We think that can be additive as well. And as we've seen with home sales, as I mentioned, the additional pickup of the economy, overall demand has been quite healthy, and we feel it's sustainable, but could be impacted for more seasonality reasons, closer to the end of the year, but to be determined."

We're on the ground. We're dealing with a lot of very vibrant data relative to knowledge of other owners, the traction that we're seeing in markets, the way that we balance, the focus that we've got on going deeper in any particular market. 
And looking at the Easy Storage acquisition, as I noted, we already had a top ownership position in that market by quite a large margin. The Easy Storage portfolio was highly regarded and was known nationally as a very top-tier national operator. By virtue of pulling those 48 assets on top of what we already had, which was a very strong presence in that market. We were able to magnify our presence there quite dramatically. 
And that could play through in many other markets nationally, whether it's on something as sizable as Easy Storage or something more limited from a specific asset base, whether it's a single or a smaller portfolio or 1 that could be more widespread. Give you another example in the fourth quarter of 2020, we bought the Beyond Storage portfolio, unlike the easy storage portfolio, the Beyond Storage portfolio was in multiple markets, but again, very easy for us to integrate, very easy for us to underwrite. And we had very good ability to move quickly which leads to the fact that we are, without question, a preferred buyer. 
And with that, the team continues to see a very strong collection of different opportunities nationally. We're seeing good quality of assets come into the markets. I would say about half of them come to us privately off-market and the other half, more through traditional means, but we've got very good relationships, deep seated. By virtue of the fact that we've been and operate in these markets and have a very strong reputation as a preferred buyer."

So that has been a drag in each of the quarters since the onset of the pandemic. And so you started to see that really take hold in the second quarter of last year. And so we will have lapped that comp. 
We do anticipate, as Joe mentioned, continued strong payment activity. So we don't think that those those fee collections will -- those fees will be charged or collected for the remainder of the year, but we won't be comping against the previous year where we had been collecting them. 
So that should go away from a comp standpoint in the next 3 quarters. In terms of cadence through the year, I mentioned the occupancy point in the fourth quarter in our base case. And I think that, that is really driven, as Joe mentioned, by typical seasonality as we get into the second part of the year. We'd anticipate that as the the economy starts to open up. 
We see more governors talking about getting back to normal through the summer period and employers encouraging folks to get back into the office as we move through the summer and into the fall. We would anticipate a more seasonal pattern to reemerge and occupancies to fall like they do in any typical year as we move into the third quarter and fourth quarter. 
In terms of any other items I'd highlight as we talked about last year, 1 of the drivers of the drop in in-place rents last second quarter, in particular, was the fact that we had paused on our existing tenant rate increase program. And as Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are executing on that plan throughout the year this year. So we will have easy comps from an existing tenant rate increase program standpoint in the second quarter. But then we did resume those last year in the thir quarter and fourth quarter."

As we moved into April, we obviously are now comping the onset of the pandemic last year where we did see reduced customer demand and lower move-in rates. 
So moving rates year-over-year through April are up 40% plus. And I think the most encouraging thing is we start to look at a typical seasonal pattern, we're looking at 2019 as a benchmark, and our April move-in rents are up double digits versus April 2019 as well, indicating that continued positive trajectory of rents and good performance there. 
So we continue to be encouraged by customer demand. And frankly, we have limited inventory within the same-store pool. So rates are going higher."

We're still focusing on quality assets, quality markets and properties that we know that can be accretive in additive to the overall platform, but we're confident that we're going to continue to see good activity there. It's just the predictability. And from a competitive standpoint, what we're going to face as we go deeper into the year. 
As Tom has noted, what the balance sheet is more than well primed to continue to support our acquisition and development activity. And with that, we'll continue to seek out and find and pursue many different types of opportunities, whether they're portfolio related or on a one-off basis. 
If you look at the the $500 or so million that we've got in our acquisition pipeline. As we speak, it's more oriented toward either one-off or smaller concentrations of assets. The consistent playbook that is always in our mix. And then what can be more unpredictable is just what can come through in the larger portfolios. 
So we still think we're in very good shape to continue to pursue opportunities, but we'll see how that plays through as the year goes on.

Many of those restrictions have started to fade away which is encouraging. So as we think about it on a year-over-year basis, 2021 is a better pricing regulatory environment than 2020 was. 
The 1 big notable state of emergency pricing restriction that's in place, and it has been for the last several years now is in Los Angeles County. And several other counties here in California related to fires that have taken place over the last several years. 
So Los Angeles is our largest market. And we've been restricted on pricing because of Section 396 in California since the fall of 2018. So that remains in place. It's not scheduled to expire until December 31. So it doesn't factor into our guidance per se, but it remains a headwind in Los Angeles. 
And you can see Los Angeles is doing quite well, but it's certainly not seeing the same level of revenue growth that we are in some of our other markets, given some of the pricing restrictions there."

In 2021, we're predicting another leg down in that 10% to 15% range again. 
Going into 2022, it's always a little bit more cloudy to figure out what could play through. We do think that this, however, has been a very good cycle for us to continue to find and source land sites with less competitive activity out there. Our development team is very busy sourcing those kinds of opportunities. 
So it's been a good window for us actually to jump in and look for land sites, either that have or have not been through different levels of entitlements. And we're going to continue to look for and extract very good value from our development activities, where we typically are able to drive the highest return on invested capital through the investment that we put into development and/or redevelopment. 
So we're uniquely positioned to do so. As I mentioned, we have the only development platform in the public arena, and by far, we have the biggest development team in the self-storage industry. It's national, we're deep, great relationships, just like we're able to tap into on the acquisition front.

But I would say internally, we definitely do see the opportunity around maturing generational demand. There's been a consistent and confidently, we're optimistic about the type of demand factors are now playing through in, again, the newer generation users many of whom are actually coming to use storage for the exact same reasons, their predecessors did. 
So life events in general, needing more space, cost of housing, working from home in this particular environment, all the things that play through relative to changes in family dynamics, et cetera, are very powerful to the use case and continued adoption and absorption of self-storage nationally. 
The Self-storage Association tracks this on an annual basis, and it has continued to grow over time, and we're confident it will do just that. And then on the external side, there's a good population of quality assets, many of which have been delivered, say, over the last 4 or 5 years, in particular, by individual developers that we've been able to tap. 
We haven't been shy about buying assets that are less than stabilized. Our average occupancy of the assets that we have under contract, for instance, right now is about 50%. So there's a good pool of assets out there that are far from stabilization that have been good opportunities for us to go out and acquire. 
We're still buying stabilized assets as well. But there's a healthy amount of inventory from a group of developers that have come into the self-storage sector for the first time, weren't intending necessarily to be here for the long haul. And that has elevated our opportunity set to go out and acquire and be confident about our external growth, knowing that, that inventory level is quite strong, and the quality is quite good, too, in many cases.

So even as either consumers or businesses are coming back into some level of normality demand is still very good. In fact, if anything, it's percolating higher than it was on the early side of the pandemic. So it's a validation that there are other additive drivers that are going on, whether it's with the economy at large, home sales, in migration, all the other factors that can drive overall demand for storage. 
And we've really seen no evidence yet that there's any change that would point to the fact that there's something reversing or that we're going to see any near-term anyway, something that would shift strongly that has -- on the opposite side, been very additive to overall business metrics.

Before we begin, we continue to wish everyone good health as we all face the many impacts from the pandemic. 
This morning, Tom and I will begin the call by covering a few areas tied to Q1 performance, along with our inaugural guidance for 2021. As you know, on May 3, we are hosting an Investor Day virtually and hope you can join us. We will share our key strategies and introduce you to the executive leadership team that will drive our growth in the coming years. 
Looking at Q1, a number of historic metrics play through. Customer demand for self-storage has remained elevated. We continue to see consistent customer behavior across all markets with increased move-in rates, extended customer length of stay and more latitude to resume traditional rate increases to existing customers. 
Demand has been tied to both historic drivers coupled with the longer-lasting impacts from more consumers needing storage. This includes work-from-home, study-from-home, elevated home sales and remodeling and the migration in and out of metropolitan markets. 
With the economy improving and additional government stimulus, consumer balance sheets are healthy and our customers' payment patterns remain strong. Both same-store and non-same-store assets are performing well. With lease ups, particularly in non-same-store assets outpacing our projections as NOI grew by 46%. 
To investments, 2021 is shaping up to be a robust year of acquisition activity. With the addition of the recently announced ezStorage portfolio, our year-to-date 2020 acquisition activity either closed or under contract is $2.5 billion. Of note, since 2019, we have acquired, developed and redeveloped approximately 22 million square feet and have expanded our portfolio by 13%, having invested $4.3 billion. 
In regard to the ezStorage acquisition, I would like to mention a few highlights of this significant transaction and how it matched 4 specific areas tied to our unique capabilities. First, the integration of the assets into the Public Storage brand and operating platform will be seamless as we already had a broad presence in these markets with 115 assets. We now enjoy even stronger presence with now 163 assets with unmatched brand presence across the mid-Atlantic region. 
Second, 8 of the ezStorage assets are poised for expansion, along with 1 that has begun ground-up development. The Public Storage development team has taken lead on these opportunities and is ready to execute on each one of them, allowing us to expand the portfolio by approximately 10% over the next 24 months. 
As you know, Public Storage has the only development team among the self-storage REITs and is well poised to unlock more value from this portfolio by virtue of our unique development capabilities. Third, our ability to fund a large acquisition and close in a very short time line, in this case, 6 weeks from selection to close was due to our efficient and primed capital structure. 
This transaction is immediately accretive to FFO and NOI. And fourth, our well-earned reputation of being a buyer of choice in the investment community. I want to thank the Manganaro family and the ezStorage team for choosing Public Storage and the great work they put into this outstanding portfolio over the last 2-plus decades. 
We appreciate their assistance in integrating this outstanding portfolio into our platform and welcome many of their employees and customers to Public Storage. Looking to full 2021, we are encouraged by core customer demand, our well-located portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the quality and dedication of the 5,000-plus team members at Public Storage, all of whom are committed to enhancing the leading brand in the self-storage industry. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Tom."
305520,710900659,2263052,"Public Storage, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Public Storage","Executives","Thanks, Joe. I'll start with financial performance. Our financial performance has improved steadily through the second half of 2020 into the first quarter of 2021. In the same-store, our revenue increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020, which",586,"Thanks, Joe. I'll start with financial performance. Our financial performance has improved steadily through the second half of 2020 into the first quarter of 2021. In the same-store, our revenue increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020, which represents a sequential improvement in growth of 2.6% from the fourth quarter. 
There were 2 primary factors contributing to that improvement. First and foremost, move-in rates were up double digits, while move-out rates were roughly flat year-over-year, leading to improving in-place rents.
Secondly, occupancy also increased through the quarter with move-in volume down but move-out volume also lower.
Now on to expenses. The team did a great job driving same-store cost of operations down in the first quarter. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property tax specifically, we will expense our estimate ratably through the year, leading to a benefit in the first 3 quarters and reversing to a headwind in the fourth quarter. 
This will lead to more stable quarter-over-quarter property tax in the future. The benefit this quarter was worth $0.05 of FFO.
Some of the technology and operating model evolution we'll discuss on Monday at our Investor Day, showed up in our first quarter numbers, with property payroll down 13% in the quarter, given efficiency improvements. We look forward to sharing more on Monday. 
For the first time, we included 2021 core FFO guidance in our earnings release and supplement. In conjunction with the line-by-line commentary in our supplemental, it's a guide to our outlook and the key drivers of our business. And as we started 2021, we've seen continued strength, as Joe mentioned, in customer demand, with occupancies up 260 basis points and in-place contract rent per occupied square foot turning into positive year-over-year territory in January. 
We anticipate same-store revenue to grow from 4% to 5.5% in 2021. That outlook is supported by good customer demand and moderating supply. That said, we do see risk to move-outs going higher as we move through the year comping against what was really extraordinary existing tenant performance in 2020. 
Our current expectations are for occupancy to be down 100 basis points plus in the fourth quarter compared to 2020. We expect continued strong expense control in the same-store in 2021. Our expectations are for 1% to 2% same-store expense growth. Property tax expense growth will pick up this year with our expectations around a 5% increase for the year, again, recognized ratably through the year. 
Our guidance includes the acceleration of our external growth initiatives with ezStorage and will add to FFO growth through our non same-store portfolio this year and next. In total, our outlook is for core FFO per share of $11.35 to $11.75 for 2021. 
I'll now shift gears to the balance sheet. As Joe mentioned, we used our growth-oriented balance sheet to fund the purchase of ezStorage entering the bond market the day after announcement and having fully funded the transaction within 2 days. The offering comprised of 3, 7 and 10 year tranches with a weighted average cost of about 1.6%. 
After effect of the transaction, we have the longest duration balance sheet in the REIT industry with 1 of the lowest cost profiles. And we remain in a great position to continue to use the balance sheet to fund our growth initiatives, and we'll share more at our Investor Day on Monday.
With that, I'll turn it over to Angela to open the line up for questions."

Can you just, I guess, dig in a little bit more on why you feel the customer -- some of the drivers we saw last year may fade? And can you confirm the 100 bps drops in the fourth quarter, is that just normal seasonality? How does that compare to normally what you see in the fourth quarter?"

One of the things that is hard to predict, even going out another couple of quarters is what could revert to some degree to what you would call normal seasonality. So to Tom's point, we're looking at that as a potential event, but still to be determined. As we've seen now for the last several quarters, the sustainability of consumer and business demand for that matter has been quite elevated. 
As I noted, there are consistent market trends, literally in every area that we operate in the business right now. And consumers continue to look for and need storage for a whole host of both traditional and, I would say, new and different reasons. We're encouraged by the fact that there's even generationally entirely new pool of customers coming to storage for the first time. We think that can be additive as well. And as we've seen with home sales, as I mentioned, the additional pickup of the economy, overall demand has been quite healthy, and we feel it's sustainable, but could be impacted for more seasonality reasons, closer to the end of the year, but to be determined."

We're on the ground. We're dealing with a lot of very vibrant data relative to knowledge of other owners, the traction that we're seeing in markets, the way that we balance, the focus that we've got on going deeper in any particular market. 
And looking at the ezStorage acquisition, as I noted, we already had a top ownership position in that market by quite a large margin. The ezStorage portfolio was highly regarded and was known nationally as a very top-tier national operator, by virtue of pulling those 48 assets on top of what we already had, which was a very strong presence in that market. We were able to magnify our presence there quite dramatically. 
And that could play through in many other markets nationally, whether it's on something as sizable as ezStorage or something more limited from a specific asset base, whether it's a single or a smaller portfolio or one that could be more widespread. Give you another example in the fourth quarter of 2020, we bought the Beyond Storage portfolio, unlike the ezStorage portfolio, the Beyond Storage portfolio was in multiple markets, but again, very easy for us to integrate, very easy for us to underwrite. And we had very good ability to move quickly which leads to the fact that we are, without question, a preferred buyer. 
And with that, the team continues to see a very strong collection of different opportunities nationally. We're seeing good quality of assets come into the markets. I would say about half of them come to us privately off-market and the other half, more through traditional means, but we've got very good relationships, deep seated, by virtue of the fact that we've been and operate in these markets and have a very strong reputation as a preferred buyer."

So that has been a drag in each of the quarters since the onset of the pandemic. And so you started to see that really take hold in the second quarter of last year. And so we will have lapped that comp. 
We do anticipate, as Joe mentioned, continued strong payment activity. So we don't think that those fee collections will -- those fees will be charged or collected for the remainder of the year, but we won't be comping against the previous year where we had been collecting them. 
So that should go away from a comp standpoint in the next 3 quarters. In terms of cadence through the year, I mentioned the occupancy point in the fourth quarter in our base case. And I think that, that is really driven, as Joe mentioned, by typical seasonality as we get into the second part of the year. We'd anticipate that as the economy starts to open up, we see more governors talking about getting back to normal through the summer period and employers encouraging folks to get back into the office as we move through the summer and into the fall. We would anticipate a more seasonal pattern to reemerge and occupancies to fall like they do in any typical year as we move into the third and fourth quarter.
In terms of any other items I'd highlight as we talked about last year, one of the drivers of the drop in in-place rents last second quarter, in particular, was the fact that we had paused on our existing tenant rate increase program. And as Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are executing on that plan throughout the year this year. So we will have easy comps from an existing tenant rate increase program standpoint in the second quarter. But then we did resume those last year in the third and fourth."

As we moved into April, we obviously are now comping the onset of the pandemic last year where we did see reduced customer demand and lower move-in rates.
So move-in rates year-over-year through April are up 40% plus. And I think the most encouraging thing is we start to look at a typical seasonal pattern. We're looking at 2019 as a benchmark, and our April move-in rents are up double digits versus April 2019 as well, indicating that continued positive trajectory of rents and good performance there.
So we continue to be encouraged by customer demand. And frankly, we have limited inventory within the same-store pool. So rates are going higher."

We're still focusing on quality assets, quality markets and properties that we know that can be accretive and additive to the overall platform, but we're confident that we're going to continue to see good activity there. It's just the predictability, and from a competitive standpoint, what we're going to face as we go deeper into the year. 
As Tom has noted, what the balance sheet is more than well primed to continue to support our acquisition and development activity. And with that, we'll continue to seek out and find and pursue many different types of opportunities, whether they're portfolio related or on a one-off basis. 
If you look at the $500-or-so million that we've got in our acquisition pipeline. As we speak, it's more oriented toward either one-off or smaller concentrations of assets. That's the consistent playbook that is always in our mix. And then what can be more unpredictable is just what can come through in the larger portfolios. 
So we still think we're in very good shape to continue to pursue opportunities, but we'll see how that plays through as the year goes on.

The ONE thing I'd highlight is we think it was above and beyond AutoPay change as we moved into April. Our AutoPay was pretty consistent through the months of February, March, April, May last year, but we saw a significant acceleration in payment patterns at the onset of the pandemic. So I wouldn't point to AutoPay specifically. 
That said, AutoPay has been trending higher over the last several years, and we expect it to continue to, given our e-rental platform, which now comprises about half of our move-in volumes today and that auto enrolls folks into AutoPay if they elect that move-in method. 
And so we do anticipate that AutoPay will increase. But it's not really the main driver of what we've seen on customer payment patterns. I think that's more consumer balance sheets being excellent and some of the operational processes we put around and at the time of the pandemic."

We've been talking about pricing restrictions through the pandemic, but many of those restrictions have started to fade away which is encouraging. So as we think about it on a year-over-year basis, 2021 is a better pricing regulatory environment than 2020 was.
The 1 big notable state of emergency pricing restriction that's in place, and it has been for the last several years now is in Los Angeles County and several other counties here in California related to fires that have taken place over the last several years. 
So Los Angeles is our largest market. And we've been restricted on pricing because of Section 396 in California since the fall of 2018. So that remains in place. It's not scheduled to expire until December 31. So it doesn't factor into our guidance per se, but it remains a headwind in Los Angeles.
And you can see Los Angeles is doing quite well, but it's certainly not seeing the same level of revenue growth that we are in some of our other markets, given some of the pricing restrictions there."

Going into 2022, it's always a little bit more cloudy to figure out what could play through. We do think that this, however, has been a very good cycle for us to continue to find and source land sites with less competitive activity out there. Our development team is very busy sourcing those kinds of opportunities. 
So it's been a good window for us actually to jump in and look for land sites, either that have or have not been through different levels of entitlements. And we're going to continue to look for and extract very good value from our development activities, where we typically are able to drive the highest return on invested capital through the investment that we put into development and/or redevelopment. 
So we're uniquely positioned to do so. As I mentioned, we have the only development platform in the public arena, and by far, we have the biggest development team in the self-storage industry. It's national. We're deep, great relationships, just like we're able to tap into on the acquisition front.

But I would say internally, we definitely do see the opportunity around maturing generational demand. There's been a consistent and confidently, we're optimistic about the type of demand factors that are now playing through in, again, the newer generation users, many of whom are actually coming to use storage for the exact same reasons, their predecessors did.
So life events in general, needing more space, cost of housing, working from home in this particular environment, all the things that play through relative to changes in family dynamics, et cetera, are very powerful to the use case and continued adoption and absorption of self-storage nationally. 
The Self Storage Association tracks this on an annual basis, and it has continued to grow over time, and we're confident it will do just that. And then on the external side, there's a good population of quality assets, many of which have been delivered, say, over the last 4 or 5 years, in particular, by individual developers that we've been able to tap. 
We haven't been shy about buying assets that are less than stabilized. Our average occupancy of the assets that we have under contract, for instance, right now is about 50%. So there's a good pool of assets out there that are far from stabilization that have been good opportunities for us to go out and acquire. 
We're still buying stabilized assets as well. But there's a healthy amount of inventory from a group of developers that have come into the self-storage sector for the first time weren't intending necessarily to be here for the long haul. And that has elevated our opportunity set to go out and acquire and be confident about our external growth, knowing that, that inventory level is quite strong, and the quality is quite good, too, in many cases.

So even as either consumers or businesses are coming back into some level of normality, demand is still very good. In fact, if anything, it's percolating higher than it was on the early side of the pandemic. So it's a validation that there are other additive drivers that are going on, whether it's with the economy at large, home sales, in migration, all the other factors that can drive overall demand for storage. 
And we've really seen no evidence yet that there's any change that would point to the fact that there's something reversing or that we're going to see any near-term anyway, something that would shift strongly that has, on the opposite side, been very additive to overall business metrics.

The amount of demographic analysis that we do, overall ability to predict and see good demand factors over time based on any particular new development.

Tom and I will walk you through some highlights from Q2 as well as our perspective on the second half of the year. And then we will open up the call for questions. I'd like to start by stating the obvious. Business is excellent. Move-in rates are up 27% from where they were in 2019, and there is little evidence that pricing strength is abating. 
A meaningful wave of new first-time customers are using storage based on a combination of traditional and nontraditional reasons. In 2021, we have welcomed nearly 700,000 new customers to our platform, many having never used self-storage before. Demand has been strong for several quarters with upward pressure tied to vibrant home sales up 34% year-over-year. In addition, a hybrid work home environment is being planned by 68% of companies according to a recent Deloitte survey. This certainly gives us confidence that overall adoption of self-storage will continue to grow and is looked upon favorably by consumers and businesses a cost-efficient alternative to storing goods in residential or commercial space. I'd like to step back for a moment and reflect on our May 3 Investor Day. The public storage leadership team took you behind the orange door and outlined several strategic initiatives. I am pleased to say many of these strategies are taking hold in 2021 and I'd like to highlight 3 areas that were particularly evident in our Q2 results. 
First, organic growth powered by innovation. Our multiyear and continued investment in technology has allowed us to give customers what they want and efficient and more consistent leasing experience with the support of a knowledgeable and helpful property manager when needed. Our industry-leading online e-rental platform opened up an entirely new channel for customers to rent a self-storage unit and adoption has been impressive. Nearly 50% of our customers now select this option. It's fast, intuitive and simple. What's even better, the quality of the customers using this option has been excellent, and our employees have embraced it as well. We are already seeing the impact this new channel will have on labor utilization while improving customer satisfaction. This has clearly been a win-win for customers and our operations team. In 2021, we also launched the PS storage app, giving customers a new tool to access their property via smartphone, along with the ability to manage their account, including automatic payment of rent. 
Second, our 4-factor growth platform. Public Storage is uniquely positioned to drive growth through acquisitions, development, redevelopment and third-party management. All areas took steps forward in Q2. Acquisition volume is robust. Year-to-date, we have closed or are under contract on nearly $3 billion of assets. The $1.8 billion easy storage portfolio closed 90 days ago, and the integration and performance of those assets has exceeded expectations. 
Our development and redevelopment pipeline continues to grow, up $150 million this quarter as we are seeing good opportunities to expand the largest development program in the industry. And third-party management is growing with assets under management to 131 properties, along with a deepening pipeline of assets under review. Our goal is to reach 500 assets by 2025. Overall, our non-same-store assets added $0.20 of FFO this quarter with NOI up 138%, driven by improving yields on both development redevelopment and acquisitions. This 34 million square foot base of assets is now 86% occupied compared to the same-store portfolio at 96.5% and with strong momentum to drive additional shareholder value. 
And third, the utilization of our exceptional balance sheet. This quarter, we funded $2.3 billion in transactions through bond issuances, driving down our blended cost of leverage to 3.1%. The Public Storage has the longest duration balance sheet in the REIT industry with one of the lowest cost profiles with room to fund significant additional growth. Overall, we remain optimistic about the core drivers in our business, along with the commanding capabilities tied to the Public Storage brand. Our industry-leading ownership position in core national markets, all led by a talented and committed team of professionals in every part of our business. Now I'll hand the call over to Tom."

Our financial performance accelerated into the second quarter, driven by both strong demand from customers and execution from the team.

Our financial performance accelerated into the second quarter, driven by both strong demand from customers and execution from the team. Our same-store revenue increased 10.8% compared to the second quarter of 2020. That performance represented a sequential improvement in growth of 7.4% from the first quarter driven by rate. 
Two factors led to the acceleration in realized rent per foot. First, about half came from strong demand and limited inventory, which allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 48% versus 2020. And as Joe mentioned, 27% and versus pre-pandemic 2019. Secondly, existing tenant rate increases also made up about half of the improvement comparing against the period when we did not send increases at the onset of the pandemic in 2020.  
Now on to expenses. The team did a great job executing in this environment. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property payroll, we discussed at our Investor Day the operating model transformation underway. About half of the year-over-year decline in payroll expense was attributable to those initiatives to use technology and role specialization to drive improvements in customer experience, employee experience and our expense levels. And the other half of the payroll decline is comparing against the onset of the pandemic last year when we put in place a program that we call the PS Cares program to provide additional support to our operations team, including a $3 per hour incentive for property managers. 
On property tax, we will expense our annual estimate ratably through the year, leading to an approximately $0.05 benefit in each of the first 3 quarters of the year and reversing to a $0.15 headwind in the fourth quarter. This will lead to a more stable quarter-over-quarter expense profile in the future. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 21.7% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, as Joe mentioned, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities was also a standout in the quarter, adding $35 million in NOI or $0.20 of FFO. As we sit here today at the peak of the leasing season, customer demand remains robust and business is good. 
So let's shift to the outlook. We raised our core FFO guidance by $0.55 at the midpoint or 4.8%. Looking at the drivers, we increased our outlook for same-store revenue to grow from 7% to 8.5% in 2021. That outlook implies a faster rate of growth in the second half compared to our 7.1% growth in the first half. Our current expectations are for occupancy to moderate from here by about 300 basis points from peak now to trough at the end of the year. This would generally reflect a return to typical seasonality of the business, albeit at higher occupancies than historically achieved. But big picture, the baton has clearly been passed to rate growth in the second quarter which will be the driver of performance in the second half. We also expect continued strong expense control throughout 2021. Our expectations are for 0% to 1% same-store expense growth. And we also increased our guidance for nonsame-store performance given the acceleration of acquisitions and the strong lease-up of our unstabilized facilities. 
The balance sheet, as Joe mentioned, is poised for incremental activity in the second half of this year. To wrap up, business is good and the strategies we discussed at our Investor Day in May are evident in this quarter. With that, I'll turn it over for questions."

The thing that's questionable, but could play through as a reversion to some degree of what we would say normal seasonality. And some of the metrics that we've seen historically, which have gone into our guidance for the second half of the year. Now clearly, if the momentum that we've seen for the last several quarters continues to be as strong as it has, that soften or not be as typical as what we see from a seasonality standpoint, but that's to be determined. We were very pleased by the continued level of demand that we're seeing from customers and our pricing abilities based on that demand clearly across all markets. To some degree, we're seeing a little bit of shifting in markets that may not have quite as pronounced in migration or overall movement, but still on a relative basis, very healthy demand."

So how should we think about that, I guess, in the second half of the year? At what point were, I guess, rate bumps reinstituted last year, if you could remind us? And does that mean that rate growth then decelerates as that easy comp goes away or not necessarily because you're still having strong kind of a growth to new customers? You said you're nearly 30% above 2019 levels. So if you could just help us think about those 2 components relative to your experience this year and how that plays out in the second half."

So last year, we did send those increases that we didn't send in the second quarter, we sent them in the third quarter. But I wouldn't highlight that as a headwind in the second half of this year, and the primary reason is driven by the fact that the magnitude of the increases that we can send this year are more elevated versus previous year. And that goes back to really two factors: One, moving rents being up as significantly as they are, which gives us pricing power with existing tenants as well. And then secondly, last year, we were under pricing regulations in many, many of our markets with this year, the majority of those having been expired. So those are both tailwinds to existing tenant rate magnitude as we move to the second half. So we don't anticipate a big give back on existing tenants in the third quarter."

There's a fair amount of very attractive good quality assets that we've been very pleased to go out and capture at what we feel are good values, many of which has been asset quality that we build to as well. So from a value standpoint and a capital allocation standpoint, we've been very pleased with the pool of candidates that we've been able to acquire. Much of this has also been predicated on some of the unique tools that we have, some of which we talked about in our Investor Day relative to the amount of data that we have market to market that guides us to the targeted parts of markets or new markets that we're entering that may be underserved from a storage standpoint. So that, too, is a different way in which that we're underwriting and choosing to acquire assets. 
Valuations are competitive. There's no doubt about it. To your point, we are seeing a fair amount of capital that's still anxious to get into self-storage. One of the ways that we've been able to maneuver around that is buying assets that are not as stabilized. More stabilized assets can typically attract far greater levels of competition, tighter yields. If on average, you look at the pool of assets that we bought this year outside of ezStorage, average occupancies, plus or minus 50% to 60%. And those have been great assets for us to put right into our platform. Lease them up, see good revenue growth and very good returns by virtue of that. So going forward, there's continued activity in many sellers are looking at this environment is a good time to bring product to market, whether it's on a one-off basis or there's a few larger portfolios likely to hit in the second half of 2021. Our capital structure is well primed. As I mentioned, we've been able to optimize the cost and efficiency of our own leverage, and we see very good opportunities to continue to allocate capital, and we'll continue to underwrite a fair amount of assets."

And we obviously outlined in the Investor Day in May, plans to increase it a good bit further from there. In addition to that, though, we are finding good deals that will meet not just a marginal debt cost of capital, but ultimately, our overall cost of capital and provide good returns based on our ability to take properties, as Joe mentioned, lease them up and earn a good return to stabilization and then rent growth from there. So overall, we're still finding good high-quality deals that will exceed our cost of capital across the board, and we have the balance sheet flexibility to use attractively priced unsecured debt to fund that."

So maybe looking at market-by-market performance, there's clear differentiation in the market dynamics across the country. We do have many markets, if you look in the supplemental that highlight 96% to 98% occupancies that are really strong versus historical. And that's really being driven by the ability of us to attract new customers, but also the fact that our existing tenants are performing quite well, and that's something we spent a lot of time talking about last year that has persisted into 2021. So it's allowed occupancies to creep higher. But at this point, with 97% occupancy or even falling modestly from there, it's about driving rate. And as I mentioned, that was really the story in the second quarter and through the second half versus trying to drive incremental occupancy here. We're trying to balance that occupancy versus inventory, but clearly looking to drive rate. 
In terms of strength within the markets, there are some standouts. If you look at what's going on, for instance, in the state of Florida, we have particular strength there. Population growth, housing activity, as Joe discussed, we're seeing really strong activity there and really across the economy there. We view that as encouraging as we think about those strong procyclical demand drivers, driving our business, which is a counter to last year when we did see some more countercyclical drivers that were driving the business at this point in time. So we're encouraged by that, and we will see some variation there by market. 
In terms of your question on occupancy, which markets will fall, which will stay? There's definitely trends in different markets that will influence it. For instance, our colder markets tend to see a [ bigular ] seasonal swing in occupancy than our warmer markets, but it will vary."

The amount of new supply coming in those markets, for the most parts, limited. But on the other side of the barbell, which is really tight right now, Houston, which has been a poster child for lower occupancy, high supply. I mean, Houston is at 95%. That speaks to what Tom just talked about, which is another added driver that we're seeing in different parts of the country, primarily Texas and the Southeast is amplified levels of activity because of in-migration. And we're even looking for signals can some of that tapered down, and it's not at all. And even -- as many of those markets actually return to some level of normal, again, activity from opening up businesses, et cetera, we really see no degradation in demand and/or occupancy levels. So we continue to fill up of even higher supply markets has been quite pronounced. And we're pleased to see that, and we're continuing to look for any signals if there's any reversion. But as we speak, the band of very tight occupancy market-to-market is quite strong."

We're seeing good continued tenancy, good integration with our own existing portfolio. And we've just begun the expansion process about 10% expansions possible by, again, magnifying in some cases, the size of properties in certain markets that had already been pre-entitled. So that too is taking place. The properties of -- for the most part, gone through the first wave of rebranding. They look great in orange.

To your point, it is a process where there is a high level of activity tied to new development. I mentioned that our backlog continues to grow, and we've seen a number of one-off developers and some with multiple properties come to our platform that are in various stages of development. It's a different lens, clearly, that points to the fact that the development part of our industry is still active. And we're seeing the opportunity to grow the platform through that. Now having said that, we are also finding some good opportunities to bring existing assets into the program as well. Many of the owners have started off with, say, 1 or 2 assets and are now starting to give us multiple assets. So that's, I think, indicative of the performance that we continue to show to the owners that have come into the platform and the benefit they're seeing by being within the Public Storage brand. 
The other thing I'd point out is we've now actually acquired 10 assets that have come into the program as well. So it's another avenue or channel for us to get closer to many owners who actually are coming back to us and saying, would we have interest in actually acquiring these assets? So there's multiple drivers that we're going to continue to focus on as we build the program. We've got a team that's focused nationally. The assets that we've added and have in our backlog are literally widespread across the 39 states that we operate in.

We're clearly very deep into the development cycle in our own portfolio and understand and see the various headwinds that are playing through right now. Fortunately, we've got different ways to combat some of the cost pressures that are coming through that a one-off developer might not have the advantage to do so, whether it's bulk buying or knowing and understanding how to prebid certain assets or components of assets. But with that, we're likely to see, again, that leg down that you talked to in 2021. 2022, I would be surprised if it accelerates.

I mean, you look at all of our markets in the second quarter, really strong growth and acceleration from the first quarter. I think what you're highlighting is there's some variation, which is something we see with a strong nationally diversified portfolio. What I highlighted earlier was a shift that I think I'll reiterate because we view it as pretty meaningfully internally. where last year at this time, some of our absolute strongest markets, we're experiencing some what I would consider pandemic related dislocation and you can put the New York or San Franciscos into that bucket. And so they were our strongest markets. And you fast forward a year and our strongest markets now, as Joe and I had mentioned earlier on the call, Florida, Texas, Sunbelt markets as well as some others, Chicago, I would put in there as well. But there's some clear relationship between some of the macro drivers in the Florida and Texas and Sunbelt markets, for instance, that are driving demand. Housing clearly being one of them, population inflows. And we're seeing real strength. To highlight one market, as an example, Miami, which is our fifth largest market. We have about 90 stores there in the same-store pool. Moving rents up 43% versus 2019. So a big market being fueled by macro drivers and real strength. 
In terms of what we're seeing in some of the bigger coastal markets, we're seeing good demand there and still really strong occupancies and the ability to push rate. Year-over-year comps, frankly, are tougher in those markets right now as we sit compared to say, Miami, for instance. But if you look at performance versus 2019, still quite good, and we're encouraged by the demand trends there. I mean what we're seeing in Los Angeles is really strong, north of 98% occupancy here in Los Angeles and strong demand drivers across the board. So generally pretty encouraged, but there are some factors that are causing some differentiation. And I would add that we're going to continue to see new supply coming to some of these markets and impact performance from here just like we have over the last 5 years."

For the most part, those have expired, and there was a big push through the first half of this year and many local governments to move past those state of emergency and pricing restrictions. And so for the most part, they're no longer in place. The one I would highlight that is meaningful for us is the pricing restrictions from the state of emergency tied to wildfires here in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is our #1 market with about 15% of our revenue, and we continue to be constrained here on rental activity. So that's one I'd highlight. The others have largely expired. There are a few here and there. That fact is a tailwind as we move to the second half, where last year, we were restricted on rent in many, many markets across the country. but it will take time to move existing tenants back up to where they would have otherwise been. 
And then your second question was on late fees. We did see some local jurisdictions put those in place. Some of the restrictions as it relates to our delinquent tenant processes remain in place. But similar to rent regulations, those are expiring and governments are looking to get back to regular business. So nothing material I'd highlight there from a financial impact in the quarter. And I would -- I know Ki Bin, we've talked about this throughout last year. Fees -- Ron, sorry, the fees were a big drag last year, and we saw -- now for the first time, we've lapped that fee drag and don't anticipate that to continue to be a negative driver and as we move through the second half.

We have a lot of analytics that help us look to the optimized level of labor. E-rental, as I mentioned, is having a pronounced effect. If you kind of step back and think about the traditional operating model for the entire self-storage industry historically, it's always been centered on and interaction necessary at the counter with a property manager. And in our case, if 50% or so of our customers are choosing to do this electronically and self-directed, that typical 30- to 45-minute transaction process that would happen at a counter is no longer necessary for, again, about half the customers that are at their own election choosing that option. So it's giving us the opportunity to retool and reprioritize levels of labor utilization, while also not preserving, but actually enhancing customer satisfaction. So as I mentioned, we think that that's working well both from a customer perspective and from an operations perspective. We continue to look at a variety of different tools through the amount of data that we collect at properties relative to activity levels, whether it's time of the week, time of the month. And again, using those, again, analytics to put people in the right places at the right times. So good things to come from that, and we're continuing to see different levels of optimization as this, again, plays out from a customer standpoint in a much more optimized way."

Tom and I will walk you through some highlights from Q2 as well as our perspective on the second half of the year. And then we will open up the call for questions. 
I'd like to start by stating the obvious. Business is excellent. Move-in rates are up 27% from where they were in 2019, and there is little evidence that pricing strength is abating. A meaningful wave of new first-time customers are using storage based on a combination of traditional and nontraditional reasons. 
In 2021, we have welcomed nearly 700,000 new customers to our platform, many having never used self-storage before. Demand has been strong for several quarters with upward pressure tied to vibrant home sales up 34% year-over-year. In addition, a hybrid work home environment is being planned by 68% of companies according to a recent Deloitte survey. This certainly gives us confidence that overall adoption of self-storage will continue to grow and is looked upon favorably by consumers and businesses as a cost-efficient alternative to storing goods in residential or commercial space. 
I'd like to step back for a moment and reflect on our May 3 Investor Day. The Public Storage leadership team took you behind the Orange Door and outlined several strategic initiatives. I am pleased to say many of these strategies are taking hold in 2021 and I'd like to highlight 3 areas that were particularly evident in our Q2 results.
First, organic growth powered by innovation. Our multiyear and continued investment in technology has allowed us to give customers what they want, an efficient and more consistent leasing experience with the support of a knowledgeable and helpful property manager when needed. 
Our industry-leading online eRental platform opened up an entirely new channel for customers to rent a self-storage unit and adoption has been impressive. Nearly 50% of our customers now select this option. It's fast, intuitive and simple. 
What's even better, the quality of the customers using this option has been excellent, and our employees have embraced it as well. We are already seeing the impact this new channel will have on labor utilization while improving customer satisfaction. This has clearly been a win-win for customers and our operations team.
In 2021, we also launched the PS storage app, giving customers a new tool to access their property via smartphone, along with the ability to manage their account, including automatic payment of rent.
Second, our 4-factor growth platform. Public Storage is uniquely positioned to drive growth through acquisitions, development, redevelopment and third-party management. All areas took steps forward in Q2. Acquisition volume is robust. 
Year-to-date, we have closed or are under contract on nearly $3 billion of assets. The $1.8 billion ezStorage portfolio closed 90 days ago, and the integration and performance of those assets has exceeded expectations.
Our development and redevelopment pipeline continues to grow, up $150 million this quarter as we are seeing good opportunities to expand the largest development program in the industry. And third-party management is growing with assets under management to 131 properties, along with a deepening pipeline of assets under review. 
Our goal is to reach 500 assets by 2025. We Overall, our non-same-store assets added $0.20 of FFO this quarter with NOI up 138%, driven by improving yields on both development, redevelopment and acquisitions. This 34 million square foot base of assets is now 86% occupied compared to the same-store portfolio at 96.5% with strong momentum to drive additional shareholder value. 
And third, the utilization of our exceptional balance sheet. This quarter, we funded $2.3 billion in transactions through bond issuances, driving down our blended cost of leverage to 3.1%. Public Storage has the longest duration balance sheet in the REIT industry with one of the lowest cost profiles with room to fund significant additional growth. 
Overall, we remain optimistic about the core drivers in our business, along with the commanding capabilities tied to the Public Storage brand. Our industry-leading ownership position in core national markets, all led by a talented and committed team of professionals in every part of our business. Now I'll hand the call over to Tom."
305520,1673976624,2362768,"Public Storage, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Public Storage","Executives","Thanks, Joe. Our financial performance accelerated into the second quarter, driven by both strong demand from customers and execution from the team.

Our financial performance accelerated into the second quarter, driven by both strong demand from customers and execution from the team. Our same-store revenue increased 10.8% compared to the second quarter of 2020. That performance represented a sequential improvement in growth of 7.4% from the first quarter driven by rate.
Two factors led to the acceleration in realized rent per foot. First, about half came from strong demand and limited inventory, which allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 48% versus 2020. And as Joe mentioned, 27% versus pre-pandemic 2019. 
Secondly, existing tenant rate increases also made up about half of the improvement comparing against the period when we did not send increases at the onset of the pandemic in 2020.
Now on to expenses. The team did a great job executing in this environment. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property payroll, we discussed at our Investor Day the operating model transformation underway. About half of the year-over-year decline in payroll expense was attributable to those initiatives that use technology and role specialization to drive improvements in customer experience, employee experience and our expense levels. 
And the other half of the payroll decline is comparing against the onset of the pandemic last year when we put in place a program that we call the PS Cares program to provide additional support to our operations team, including a $3 per hour incentive for property managers.
On property tax, we will expense our annual estimate ratably through the year, leading to an approximately $0.05 benefit in each of the first 3 quarters of the year and reversing to a $0.15 headwind in the fourth quarter. This will lead to a more stable quarter-over-quarter expense profile in the future. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 21.7% in the quarter. 
In addition to the same-store, as Joe mentioned, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities was also a standout in the quarter, adding $35 million in NOI or $0.20 of FFO. As we sit here today at the peak of the leasing season, customer demand remains robust and business is good.
So let's shift to the outlook. We raised our core FFO guidance by $0.55 at the midpoint or 4.8%. Looking at the drivers, we increased our outlook for same-store revenue to grow from 7% to 8.5% in 2021. That outlook implies a faster rate of growth in the second half compared to our 7.1% growth in the first half. 
Our current expectations are for occupancy to moderate from here by about 300 basis points from peak now to trough at the end of the year. This would generally reflect a return to typical seasonality of the business, albeit at higher occupancies than historically achieved. But big picture, the baton has clearly been passed to rate growth in the second quarter which will be the driver of performance in the second half. 
We also expect continued strong expense control throughout 2021. Our expectations are for 0% to 1% same-store expense growth. And we also increased our guidance for nonsame-store performance given the acceleration of acquisitions and the strong lease-up of our unstabilized facilities.
The balance sheet, as Joe mentioned, is poised for incremental activity in the second half of this year. To wrap up, business is good and the strategies we discussed at our Investor Day in May are evident in this quarter. With that, I'll turn it over for questions."

The thing that's questionable, but could play through is a reversion to some degree of what we would say normal seasonality.

Now clearly, if the momentum that we've seen for the last several quarters continues to be as strong as it has, that soften or not be as typical as what we see from a seasonality standpoint, but that's to be determined. We were very pleased by the continued level of demand that we're seeing from customers and our pricing abilities based on that demand clearly across all markets. 
To some degree, we're seeing a little bit of shifting in markets that may not have quite as pronounced in migration or overall movement, but still on a relative basis, very healthy demand."

So how should we think about that, I guess, in the second half of the year? At what point were, I guess, rate bumps reinstituted last year, if you could remind us? And does that mean that rate growth then decelerates as that easy comp goes away or not necessarily because you're still having strong kind of a growth to new customers? You said you're nearly 30% above 2019 levels. So if you could just help us think about those 2 components relative to your experience this year and how that plays out in the second half?"

So last year, we did send those increases that we didn't send in the second quarter, we sent them in the third quarter. But I wouldn't highlight that as a headwind in the second half of this year, and the primary reason is driven by the fact that the magnitude of the increases that we can send this year are more elevated versus previous year. 
And that goes back to really two factors: one, move-in rents being up as significantly as they are, which gives us pricing power with existing tenants as well. And then secondly, last year, we were under pricing regulations in many, many of our markets. With this year, the majority of those having been expired. So those are both tailwinds to existing tenant rate magnitude as we move to the second half. So we don't anticipate a big give back on existing tenants in the third quarter."

We expect to continue to be busy. There's a fair amount of product that's in the market. If you step back and think about how much new product has been delivered to the sector over the last 4 or 5 years with peak deliveries hitting in 2019, plus or minus 500 new assets being delivered to the market in 2019 and then tapering down a bit 10% to 15% in 2020, and again, another similar tapering down this year. 
But again, you take that whole pool of assets year-by-year that has been ranging over the last, say, 5 or 6 years from 300 to 500 properties per year. There's a fair amount of very attractive good quality assets that we've been very pleased to go out and capture at what we feel are good values. Many of which has been asset quality that we build to as well. 
So from a value standpoint and a capital allocation standpoint, we've been very pleased with the pool of candidates that we've been able to acquire. Much of this has also been predicated on some of the unique tools that we have, some of which we talked about in our Investor Day relative to the amount of data that we have market to market that guides us to the targeted parts of markets or new markets that we're entering that may be underserved from a storage standpoint. So that, too, is a different way in which that we're underwriting and choosing to acquire assets.
Valuations are competitive. There's no doubt about it. To your point, we are seeing a fair amount of capital that's still anxious to get into self-storage. One of the ways that we've been able to maneuver around that is buying assets that are not as stabilized. More stabilized assets can typically attract far greater levels of competition, tighter yields. If on average, you look at the pool of assets that we bought this year outside of ezStorage, average occupancies, plus or minus 50% to 60%. And those have been great assets for us to put right into our platform. Lease them up, see good revenue growth and very good returns by virtue of that. 
So going forward, there's continued activity and many sellers are looking at this environment as a good time to bring product to market, whether it's on a one-off basis or there's a few larger portfolios likely to hit in the second half of 2021. Our capital structure is well primed. As I mentioned, we've been able to optimize the cost and efficiency of our own leverage, and we see very good opportunities to continue to allocate capital, and we'll continue to underwrite a fair amount of assets."

In addition to that, though, we are finding good deals that will meet not just a marginal debt cost of capital, but ultimately, our overall cost of capital and provide good returns based on our ability to take properties, as Joe mentioned, lease them up and earn a good return to stabilization and then rent growth from there. 
So overall, we're still finding good high-quality deals that will exceed our cost of capital across the board, and we have the balance sheet flexibility to use attractively priced unsecured debt to fund that."

So maybe looking at market-by-market performance, there's clear differentiation in the market dynamics across the country. We do have many markets, if you look in the supplemental that highlight 96% to 98% occupancies that are really strong versus historical. And that's really being driven by the ability of us to attract new customers, but also the fact that our existing tenants are performing quite well, and that's something we spent a lot of time talking about last year that has persisted into 2021. 
So it's allowed occupancies to creep higher. But at this point, with 97% occupancy or even falling modestly from there, it's about driving rate. And as I mentioned, that was really the story in the second quarter and through the second half versus trying to drive incremental occupancy here. We're trying to balance that occupancy versus inventory, but clearly looking to drive rate.
In terms of strength within the markets, there are some standouts. If you look at what's going on, for instance, in the state of Florida, we have particular strength there. Population growth, housing activity, as Joe discussed, we're seeing really strong activity there and really across the economy there. 
We view that as encouraging as we think about those strong procyclical demand drivers, driving our business, which is a counter to last year when we did see some more countercyclical drivers that were driving the business at this point in time. So we're encouraged by that, and we will see some variation there by market.
In terms of your question on occupancy, which markets will fall, which will stay? There's definitely trends in different markets that will influence it. For instance, our colder markets tend to see a bigger seasonal swing in occupancy than our warmer markets, but it will vary."

And Michael, just to add, our West Coast markets from Seattle all the way down to San Diego, are dealing with extremely high occupancy levels. The amount of new supply coming in those markets, for the most parts, limited. But on the other side of the barbell, which is really tight right now, Houston, which has been a poster child for lower occupancy, high supply. I mean, Houston is at 95%. That speaks to what Tom just talked about, which is another added driver that we're seeing in different parts of the country, primarily Texas and the Southeast is amplified levels of activity because of in-migration. And we're even looking for signals can some of that tapered down, and it's not at all. 
And even -- as many of those markets actually return to some level of normal, again, activity from opening up businesses, et cetera, we really see no degradation in demand and/or occupancy levels. So the continued to fill-up of even higher supply markets has been quite pronounced. And we're pleased to see that, and we're continuing to look for any signals if there's any reversion. But as we speak, the band of very tight occupancy market-to-market is quite strong."

The portfolio today is at about 94% occupied. If you remember, one of the things that we had talked about is the prior owner was a very good operator, but also didn't have some of the sophisticated tools that we've been able to apply into that portfolio in relation to existing customer tactics or strategies. We're starting to deploy those. Seeing a very good level of transition and integration. 
We inherited about 43,000 customers. We're seeing good continued tenancy, good integration with our own existing portfolio. And we've just begun the expansion process, about 10% expansions possible by, again, magnifying, in some cases, the size of properties in certain markets that had already been pre-entitled. So that too is taking place. 
The properties have, for the most part, gone through the first wave of rebranding. They look great in orange. And we've also seen a very good integration from hiring a number of very strong property managers and district managers that have come into our portfolio as well. So overall, very pleased with what we've seen. And we, as I mentioned, have a very strong presence in that market, far beyond any other operator. And the quality of these assets is very additive to what we've continued to do and see from a benefit standpoint in the Washington metro market."

To your point, it is a process where there is a high level of activity tied to new development. I mentioned that our backlog continues to grow, and we've seen a number of one-off developers and some with multiple properties come to our platform that are in various stages of development. 
It's a different lens, clearly, that points to the fact that the development part of our industry is still active. And we're seeing the opportunity to grow the platform through that. Now having said that, we are also finding some good opportunities to bring existing assets into the program as well. Many of the owners have started off with, say, 1 or 2 assets and are now starting to give us multiple assets. So that's, I think, indicative of the performance that we continue to show to the owners that have come into the platform and the benefit they're seeing by being within the Public Storage brand.
The other thing I'd point out is we've now actually acquired 10 assets that have come into the program as well. So it's another avenue or channel for us to get closer to many owners who actually are coming back to us and saying, would we have interest in actually acquiring these assets? So there's multiple drivers that we're going to continue to focus on as we build the program. 
We've got a team that's focused nationally. The assets that we've added and have in our backlog are literally widespread across the 39 states that we operate in. So we're pleased by that as well, and look forward to continuing to grow the program."

One thing that we're seeing is slow approval processes at multiple cities. And that, coupled with the fact that component costs are elevated, whether it's steel, labor, concrete, et cetera. So that's, I think, stalling some of the development starts that might have been predicted either for 2021 and going into 2022. So we're keeping a close eye on it. 
We're clearly very deep into the development cycle in our own portfolio and understand and see the various headwinds that are playing through right now. Fortunately, we've got different ways to combat some of the cost pressures that are coming through that a one-off developer might not have the advantage to do so, whether it's bulk buying or knowing and understanding how to prebid certain assets or components of assets. 
But with that, we're likely to see, again, that leg down that you talked to in 2021. 2022, I would be surprised if it accelerates. It could take either a moderate step down or could be flatlined based on the amount of activity that we're seeing in 2021. And then what's more unclear is what could happen in 2023 and beyond.

I mean, you look at all of our markets in the second quarter, really strong growth and acceleration from the first quarter. I think what you're highlighting is there's some variation, which is something we see with a strong nationally diversified portfolio. 
What I highlighted earlier was a shift that I think I'll reiterate because we view it as pretty meaningfully internally, where last year at this time, some of our absolute strongest markets, were experiencing some what I would consider pandemic-related dislocation and you can put the New Yorks or San Franciscos into that bucket. And so they were our strongest markets. And you fast forward a year and our strongest markets now, as Joe and I had mentioned earlier on the call, Florida, Texas, Sunbelt markets as well as some others, Chicago, I would put in there as well. 
But there's some clear relationship between some of the macro drivers in the Florida and Texas and Sunbelt markets, for instance, that are driving demand. Housing clearly being one of them, population inflows. And we're seeing real strength. To highlight one market, as an example, Miami, which is our fifth largest market. We have about 90 stores there in the same-store pool. Move-in rent's up 43% versus 2019. So a big market being fueled by macro drivers and real strength.
In terms of what we're seeing in some of the bigger coastal markets, we're seeing good demand there and still really strong occupancies and the ability to push rate. Year-over-year comps, frankly, are tougher in those markets right now as we sit compared to say, Miami, for instance. But if you look at performance versus 2019, still quite good, and we're encouraged by the demand trends there. 
I mean what we're seeing in Los Angeles is really strong, north of 98% occupancy here in Los Angeles and strong demand drivers across the board. So generally pretty encouraged, but there are some factors that are causing some differentiation. And I would add that we're going to continue to see new supply coming to some of these markets and impact performance from here just like we have over the last 5 years."

So tenants that were in-house or moved in last year have continued to perform really, really well and ahead of pre-pandemic expectations.
Customers that have moved in this year have behaved more like our typical storage customers from 2019, for instance, still performing really well, but not at that market improvement that we saw last year. The one thing I'd highlight from a lifetime value is clearly the rate portion of the equation.

For the most part, those have expired, and there was a big push through the first half of this year and many local governments to move past those state of emergency and pricing restrictions. And so for the most part, they're no longer in place. 
The one I would highlight that is meaningful for us is the pricing restrictions from the state of emergency tied to wildfires here in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is our #1 market with about 15% of our revenue, and we continue to be constrained here on rental activity. So that's one I'd highlight. 
The others have largely expired. There are a few here and there. That fact is a tailwind as we move to the second half, where last year, we were restricted on rent in many, many markets across the country. but it will take time to move existing tenants back up to where they would have otherwise been.
And then your second question was on late fees. We did see some local jurisdictions put those in place. Some of the restrictions, as it relates to our delinquent tenant processes, remain in place; but similar to rent regulations, those are expiring and governments are looking to get back to regular business. So nothing material I'd highlight there from a financial impact in the quarter. 
And I would -- I know Ki Bin, we've talked about this throughout last year. Fees -- Ron, sorry, the fees were a big drag last year, and we saw -- now for the first time, we've lapped that fee drag and don't anticipate that to continue to be a negative driver and as we move through the second half.

It points to the variety of things that we're doing from the infusion and the digitization of the business. We have a lot of analytics that help us look to the optimized level of labor. eRental, as I mentioned, is having a pronounced effect. If you kind of step back and think about the traditional operating model for the entire self-storage industry historically, it's always been centered on and interaction necessary at the counter with a property manager. 
And in our case, if 50% or so of our customers are choosing to do this electronically and self-directed, that typical 30- to 45-minute transaction process that would happen at a counter is no longer necessary for, again, about half the customers that are at their own election choosing that option. So it's giving us the opportunity to retool and reprioritize levels of labor utilization, while also not preserving, but actually enhancing customer satisfaction. 
So as I mentioned, we think that that's working well both from a customer perspective and from an operations perspective. We continue to look at a variety of different tools through the amount of data that we collect at properties relative to activity levels, whether it's time of the week, time of the month. And again, using those, again, analytics to put people in the right places at the right times. So good things to come from that, and we're continuing to see different levels of optimization as this, again, plays out from a customer standpoint in a much more optimized way."

I do want to thank the entire team at Public Storage for their efforts. Our team members from our properties to the corporate office and back are focused on driving this level of performance. Across our industry and consistently throughout our markets, more customers than ever before have been drawn to the benefits of using self storage. We have often characterized additive demand coming from life events, which we referred to as the 4 Ds, divorce, death, dislocation and disasters. 
For the last several quarters, a fifth D has emerged, decluttering. Customers need more space at home due to the shifts in working and living environments across all markets. Unfortunately, the customers that have come to us during the pandemic are now behaving more like traditional customers meaning they are staying in place as they have come to appreciate the convenience and cost benefit of using self storage, particularly as residential and commercial spaces become more expensive. With that said, demand remains historically strong. 
In the third quarter, our revenue, NOI and cash flow per share foot reached record levels once again. As we wrap up 2021, the outlook for 2022 and beyond is favorable as well. The utilization rate of self-storage continues to climb as it has for decades which is now at 11% of the U.S. population. Millennials and Gen Zs, 2 big user groups, are aging into our core customer life stage, driven once again by the 5 Ds. And Public Storage is leading the self-storage industry's transformation towards a customer experience that provides digital as well as traditional options across the entire customer journey. We have a deep-seated commitment to listen to what our customers want, and they are giving us vibrant input that directs our priorities. 
This has led to some exciting changes in our customer offerings. One example we have spoken to is our industry-leading eRental platform. Today, nearly 50% of our customers are renting with us through the eRental online lease. Year-to-date, nearly 500,000 customers have chosen eRental to secure a unit. It's fast, intuitive and self-directed, taking just a few minutes to complete eRental. An option many customers have been anxious to use, and the quality of this customer has been impressive. 
In early 2021, we also introduced the PS app, which nearly 1 million customers have now downloaded, allowing easy tools to manage your account and navigate our properties digitally and hands-free. These are 2 great examples of how our investment in technology is transforming our operating model, and it's a win-win for both customers and our operating efficiencies. Daily headlines across multiple industries, however, remind us there are challenging consequences impacting the economy in terms of labor pressure, and self storage is not immune. We are actively investing in our team through increased wages and new, more specialized positions that are providing even greater upward mobility for our skilled property teammates. 
On the leadership front,  we have also strengthened our ranks and announced yesterday that David Lee has joined Public Storage as Chief Operating Officer. David previously served as Senior Vice President of Operations for the UPS store with responsibility for more than 5,200 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada. We are excited to have him on board. Now to another area, I'm pleased to share with you our external growth initiatives. Our 4-factor external growth platform is centered on acquisitions, development, redevelopment and third-party management. All areas are seeing strong growth. 
Starting with acquisitions. In 2021, the self-storage industry will likely see approximately $18 billion or more of assets trade. This is a tremendous amount of volume and opportunity. Owners have been motivated to bring assets to market to monetize their investments, while some also plan for potential tax changes. Year-to-date, we have acquired or under contract on $5.1 billion of acquisitions or about 30% of the industry volume this year. This is comprised of 233 properties across 21.1 million square feet with average occupancy of 56%, which is providing a significant embedded growth opportunity once we place these assets onto the Public Storage platform. 
The transaction span a wide spectrum of geographies, portfolios and one-off purchases with both market and off-market deals. We continue to be looked at as a preferred buyer based on our knowledge, transaction efficiency and ability to easily fund transactions. Of note, 65% of this quarter's volume is tied to the All Storage portfolio, which we are acquiring for $1.5 billion. All Storage is a high-quality portfolio of 56 properties, primarily located in Dallas-Fort Worth. Dallas-Fort Worth has been one of the best storage -- self-storage markets over the past 15 years, with population growth nearly 2x that of the national average. 
Our own portfolio in Dallas-Fort Worth produced annual NOI growth of 150 basis points higher than our national average. The All Storage properties also give us additional exposure to new higher-growth submarkets, particularly in and around Fort Worth. Many of the properties were recently developed, resulting in the current 75% occupancy level, which provides significant upside as we move them on to our industry-leading platform. The transaction is immediately accretive to FFO and accretion will accelerate through to stabilization at nearly 6% direct NOI yield. And combined with owned and other assets under contract, we are expanding our already significant platform in this vibrant market to approximately 200 assets or by 64%. 
The remaining 35% or $1.1 billion of the acquisitions closed or under contract will provide significant growth as well. These assets are geographically diversified across the country comprised of single acquisitions to smaller portfolios ranging in size from $40 million to $200 million, totaling 3.9 million square feet, with average occupancy of 50% at $179 per square foot. Now to development and redevelopment, where our pipeline has grown by $70 million to $731 million this quarter. We are seeing good opportunity to build new properties from the ground up, in addition to expanding our existing assets. 
Nationally, our development team is underwriting well-located land sites as we continue to leverage our expertise as the largest developer in the self-storage industry. This quarter, we also added 28 properties to our third-party management platform, increasing properties under management to 145. We plan to reach 500 assets by 2025. Of note, we have also acquired 14 assets from our third-party management platform as well. In summary, since the beginning of 2019, we have expanded our portfolio square footage by 22% with a total investment of approximately $7 billion, equaling 36 million square feet for an average of $193 per square foot, which has clearly produced strong growth and value creation that we expect will continue. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Our same-store revenue increased 14% compared to the third quarter of 2020.  That performance represented a sequential improvement in growth of 3.2% from the second quarter, driven by rate. Two factors led to the acceleration in realized rent per foot. First, strong demand and limited inventory, which allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 24% versus 2020 and 33% versus 2019. Secondly, existing tenant rate increases contributed comparing to a period in 2020, and we were significantly impacted by rental rate regulation in many markets. 
Now on to expenses. The team did a great job executing in this environment once again. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property payroll, as Joe discussed, on October 1, we increased property manager wages, which will lead to higher expenses going forward, but will be partially offset by efficiencies in labor hours tied to the operating model transformation we discussed at our Investor Day in May. 
On property tax, we will expense our annual estimate ratably through the year, leading to an approximately $0.13 benefit year-to-date and reversing to a $0.13 headwind in the fourth quarter. This will lead to more stable quarter-over-quarter expenses in the future. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 21.7% in the quarter. In addition to the same store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities was also a standout in the quarter, adding $53 million in NOI in the quarter or $0.30 in FFO. 
As we sit here today, coming off the peak part of the leasing season, existing customer behavior is solid with move-outs down year-over-year in the quarter and new customer demand remaining robust. So with that, let's shift to the outlook. We raised our core FFO guidance by $0.55 at the midpoint or 4.5%. Looking at the drivers, we increased our outlook for same-store revenue to grow from 9.5% to 10.5% in 2021. That outlook implies a modest deceleration in revenue growth in the fourth quarter against very tough comps. Our current expectations are for occupancy to moderate from here by about 150 basis points to the end of the year. That would land occupancy at the healthy 2020 levels at the end of the year. 
But big picture, the baton has clearly been passed to rate growth where we continue to see strength. Our expectations are for 0% to 0.5% same-store expense growth. As a reminder,  that implies an increase of circa 30% in the fourth quarter, driven by the property tax timing I discussed. We also increased our guidance for non-same-store performance given the acceleration of acquisitions and strong lease-up of our unstabilized facilities. Now on the balance sheet. We have one of the industry's leading balance sheet set up well to finance the transaction volumes we've seen this year. We plan on funding the All Storage acquisition with unsecured debt, and we remain poised to grow with capacity to fund the continued activity that Joe has discussed. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to you, Joe."

So Dave is joining us at an exciting time. His role will be to continue leading what we call the customer journey, where we're unlocking and delivering new tools to our teams and offering different channels and experiences right at the front lines for our customers. 
And with that, his engagement with the team as a whole will be very important as we move the entire team forward through a very dynamic time, not only for the company, but for the industry. Clearly, his skills were attractive based on his 20 years or so with the UPS organization, the UPS store platform more particularly. So we're very excited about his fresh perspective as we continue the various changes to our overall operating model and definitely look forward to the contributions he brings to the entire management team."

We've talked about that for some time, where this year, there's likely to be about $3.5 billion or so of new deliveries put into the markets nationally compared to the peak that we saw in 2019 of about $5 billion. We're likely to see that number trend down again in 2022, particularly with some of the hurdles that are out there from a development standpoint that we clearly see day in and day out. That includes the time it takes to get a property entitled. Many of the cities are clearly understaffed, and we're seeing longer processes actually to get something as simple as a permit or a use or an occupancy use permit for a property come through to more commanding issues that we're seeing even from the cost and availability of components of construction and then labor itself. 
So there's some different, and I would say, commanding issues that any developer today has to go through to operate in this kind of an environment. So that's likely to produce, again, this down draft that we're predicting for 2022. Now having said all that, our industry, as you well know, is very fragmented. The development industry as a whole tied to self storage is too very fragmented, and it's hard to predict what level of activity might resurface in different markets based on, frankly, the continued very strong performance of the sector. 
So we're keeping a very close eye on that as we've talked about we've got a deep team across the entire national set of opportunities that we're working on. And we're also seeing activity that's coming through our third-party management platform as well that is tied to future development. So it will be with us. The question is how much more momentum comes out of the environment we're dealing with as we speak, which is one of the long-term attributes of self storage. It's a great business. So we'll see and monitor the impact that's likely to have. But we feel at this point, we continue to have a very good run rate to go out and capture good land sites with the deep development team and the knowledge we've got across all of our markets."

We've seen, as I mentioned in my opening comments, good growth that's come out of that market. You're right, it has been a market that's been prone to an outside level -- an outsized level of development from time to time. But frankly, the embedded growth that we see that's tied to a very business friendly, economy, low costs, including taxes, cost of housing, et cetera, centrally located within the United States, great infrastructure. It's a huge draw for both business and overall population growth. 
So what came with this portfolio was an opportunity to leapfrog our position that was already a top position in that market where we have had approximately 120 existing assets as well as a dozen or so third-party management properties and leapfrogging by another 52 or 53 properties. So huge opportunity to grow and actually put additional presence in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth market, particularly Fort Worth that we were lighter in. 
And Fort Worth, for instance, like Dallas as a whole or the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, is growing dramatically. So we're really encouraged by that. Population growth is very strong, good household income, and we really like the multiple attributes that we will see and continue to see with our industry-leading position in that particular market. Mike McGowan is with us. I'm going to hand the mic over to him. He can give you a little color on what came through with the process we went through to actually capture the portfolio."

It was quietly marketed with more or less a few select people that could take down a transaction of this size. In reference to your question about the location, the new supply coming in, this developer really did a great job of putting a footprint of 50 properties in markets that were so far ahead of his time out in areas that are having high barriers for new storage to come in, he built large properties in those marketplaces, kept a lot of competitors out at the same time. 
And really for us, we're starting to see the same type of issues with zoning of getting new storage in a lot of these newer areas in these high-growth areas, which are the better areas of the Dallas-Fort Worth market. So for us, it puts us in a great position to be in new markets that we want to be in and gives us a very strong presence in all those markets to do it that builds big gaps for us at the same time."

So as Joe mentioned, a lot of the activity in the third quarter into the fourth quarter is unstabilized activity. And so what if you think about average occupancies in the 50%, I would have that in your mindset. And then from a yield standpoint, we obviously gave you a sense for All Storage what those yields are, call it, 2.6% on their operating platform in the third quarter. So that gives you a starting point. And I would say across the other properties, probably similar-type yields, even with a little bit lower occupancy. 
So I think that gives you a starting point. Clearly, we have confidence in our ability to lease these properties up. One of the things that Joe mentioned earlier around our confidence in our operating platform in Dallas-Fort Worth, similar to Washington, D.C., if you look at our transaction from earlier in the year, where we acquired that at 86% occupied, we got it to 94% through the busy season, and really strong growth in a market where we're out of inventory. 
So to give you a sense, a few of those properties, we took over in the 40% occupancies and got them up to 90% by the end of the busy season, which is clearly strong leasing activity. In Dallas, similarly, we're out of inventory. We've successfully leased up our activity that we've built and bought over the last several years and are poised to take over these All Storage properties here over the next several months."

So I'm curious what the appetite is like for additional larger-scale deals? And then we saw that you're issuing $80 million of units for the deals under contract. Should we assume that PSA is open to issuing more equity or equity today as part of the funding plans going forward?"

The move-out rates are starting to catch up with move-in rates. They have not caught up yet, but they're starting to catch up, and that will start to be a headwind on the contribution from the move-in and move outside, but we will still have existing tenant rate increases as a tailwind from here given the market rent increases that we've seen across the country."

And I think  the way to think about that is one of the benefits of the current environment is higher market rents and that lowers the cost to replace that tenant if they elect to leave. The tenant base continues to be quite sticky, which gives us confidence to continue to send increases out to the tenant base. 
As we think about where we're going forward, in fact, one of the contributors to higher move-out rates is actually the fact that we're being successful in increasing rental rates on that existing tenant base. So I would say almost the reverse, which is, as we're successful on existing tenant rate increases, I'd anticipate that, that move-out rate will move higher.  Move-out rate meaning that the rent that the people are paying that do elect to leave us."

So as I've spoken to, we've got a very deep seated team across the entire portfolio that we operate today and in markets that we continue to look for additional growth as well. The opportunity to acquire land over the last 1.5 years or so has been somewhat elevated because we've seen that tapering down of delivery, so not quite as much as ground-up development momentum, again, coming from a very fragmented set of developers out there. But land is still very competitive. 
There's a lot of knowledge you need to have to find and locate the exact right location that's complementary to future growth of the particular asset, the kind of dynamics that come from competition as well as population growth, et cetera. So a lot of different factors come into the way that we're able to select land sites very differently than most because of the amount of data that we have day in and day out relative to our presence already across 39 states and being a top owner in nearly every one of those submarkets. 
The business, though it's very entrepreneurial from an overall self-storage standpoint. So there's competition that can come through. And as I mentioned, in some cases, that may become more elevated than we've seen over the last 1.5 years. So keeping a very close eye on it, but we feel like we've got very good tools to not only find great land sites but to actually execute even in an environment where it's tough to get either entitlements and/or justify the costs that are tied, particularly from component costs and labor costs that are playing through to actually develop facilities in an environment where we're seeing a high degree of inflation at the moment."

But if you look at the markets with the strongest growth, really driven by macroeconomic, demographic and population shift that we think are poised to continue here, which is helpful. So clearly, there's been a move in market rents higher and existing tenant rate increases have been moving the current tenant base higher alongside that. 
Now over the course of last year and really through a good portion of this year and in some markets is continuing today, we have had pricing regulations on us because of the state of emergencies and the impact of the  health care environment. And that's definitely been a headwind as it relates to the existing tenant base and moving them in the same manner that market rents are going. So I think that  another way to say that is there is some embedded rate growth that's available to the extent that we continue to see normalization from a health care standpoint and state of emergencies continue to expire.  The most notable of which is in Los Angeles County, not related to pandemic, but related to fire several years ago that we continue to monitor."

So there's a couple of components there. One is, obviously, we've been ramping the size of that business and one of the most vibrant areas of demand from our customer base for that business line is from folks that have developed new properties. And so as we take on those properties, the profitability of a new property is less than one of one that has stabilized, obviously, given the revenue nature of the fees. And so as we ramp that program similar to our development business almost, there's a ramping of the profitability of each individual store. 
So said another way, it's going to take several years before the volumes that we're anticipating really start to produce the P&L impact that you might anticipate. The second piece of your question relates to what are the margins of that business. And there's a couple of factors there. So one is clearly the geographic mix of the properties themselves, what the operating costs are that tie to them. But if you just look at them overall, and you say, okay, where can we get to from a margin basis versus the fees we're charging, I think a reasonable margin is probably in the 20s% to 30%. But again, a lot of variability as we add a significant number of properties, so that's store base over the next several years."

So the role that David's coming into is new to the company in the context of our goals and the strategies that we have. It's just an added level of leadership that we think is prudent as we move the business forward, and we're accelerating the pace of change that ties to the amount of investment that we're making in our people directly as well as the technological platforms, particularly as it relates to the digitization of the business. So it's one added layer of leadership that we think is well timed, and we really look forward to continuing to optimize the way that we're running the portfolio as a whole, including the way that we're also engaging in giving a variety of different opportunities to our existing employee base.

I wouldn't necessarily say it's an occupancy-based item. It relates to what we're seeing in the customer funnel. So advertising has a benefit to increased top of funnel, right? The number of people that are, say, searching for Public Storage or finding Public Storage when they go to search for self storage. And so  that is helpful in markets where we're seeing top of funnel demand erode. But we have other tools as we're managing revenue, be it pricing, promotion, et cetera, that will impact conversion within that funnel. 
And so I would say, we're watching the different components of the funnel and what the returns are associated with pulling those different levers. To date, we continue to see strong top-of-funnel demand across the board. Web visits, for instance, in the quarter, were up north of 20% across the system.  Calls into our call center were roughly flat. So overall, still very solid top of funnel demand, which led to the decision making around marketing in the quarter. As we've demonstrated in the past, if we start to see those dynamics change, we typically do see pretty good returns on our advertising spend, and we'll pull that lever as well."

And so we go through our underwriting process of seeing what our stores in the area and what competition is and ultimately, what we think we can squeeze from a revenue standpoint within our own revenue management platform and we'll underwrite those there. 
And then on the stabilized stores, we call them stabilized, but the reality is they're not in our platform. And like we're seeing in acquisitions to date, really through last year, we have an opportunity to put our operating platform and systems in place and drive further improvement. So you can see, for instance, where our overall Dallas portfolio rental rates are. And obviously, these properties are -- have their own submarkets and underwritten rates, but gives you a sense as to the upside in rental rates that we think we can achieve in the portfolio over time."

One of the things that is different relative to the opportunity that we see at this point to bring in, as I characterize even more fresh perspective and more additive leadership capability to that overall role, is the dramatic growth and change in our business. I've noted we've acquired a sizable amount of assets over the last couple of years, literally the size of some of our competitors. And  it's been a great opportunity for us to continue to think about how the business is changing, the different tools that we're putting in place, the investments that we're making and as importantly, the skills and the development of our employee base tied to operations.

So even when it's highly concentrated to what you saw with ezStorage and now, again, with the All Storage portfolio in 2 big metropolitan markets, but it points to the ability that we have from a structure and a scale and operating prowess standpoint. 
So we're deep in these markets. We've got very strong teams that run these assets day in and day out. Our systems allow very efficient integration. And we've been doing this for many, many years. And with the investment we've made with our technological platform, we certainly can do it in higher degrees of volume and higher degrees of concentration. The  yields that we will likely see from this integration or as we've mentioned, compelling, again, it ties to the fact that we have the inherent skill and benefit from the investments that we've made in to do just this. 
So our capital structure is well due to continue to fund the kind of growth that we've seen.

So last year was certainly a unique year, where we saw different seasonal patterns because of the nature of the health care environment last year, and we didn't see much, if any, of an occupancy decline as we move through the year. This year, we did see a more seasonal pattern and frankly, had the benefit of some of the seasonal demand drivers, things like home sales and DOI projects over the summer, for instance, college students, et cetera, that will add to demand in the summer, but then we'll then move out as we move into the fall. 
So there was that additive demand this year, but we are seeing a little bit more moderation. One of the reasons why we're seeing that moderation is the continued stickiness of the tenant base. And so we've had fewer move-ins this year. And so recent move-ins are the most likely to move out. And so we've had a contribution of that benefit and a little bit more seasonality this year. I do think that the seasonal demand drivers that have been driving self-storage demand for years will continue to play out over the next several years. And so we operate a seasonal business, and it will be going forward. The degree of it only to see year in and year out.

I do want to thank the entire team at Public Storage for their efforts. Our team members from our properties to the corporate office and back are focused on driving this level of performance.
Across our industry and consistently throughout our markets, more customers than ever before have been drawn to the benefits of using self-storage. We have often characterized additive demand coming from life events, which we refer to as the 4 Ds: divorce, death, dislocation and disasters.
For the last several quarters, a fifth D has emerged, decluttering. Customers need more space at home due to the shifts in working and living environments across all markets. Unfortunately, the customers that have come to us during the pandemic are now behaving more like traditional customers, meaning they are staying in place as they have come to appreciate the convenience and cost benefit of using self-storage, particularly as residential and commercial spaces become more expensive. With that said, demand remains historically strong.
In the third quarter, our revenue, NOI and cash flow per share foot reached record levels once again. As we wrap up 2021, the outlook for 2022 and beyond is favorable as well. The utilization rate of self-storage continues to climb as it has for decades, which is now at 11% of the U.S. population. Millennials and Gen Zs, 2 big user groups, are aging into our core customer life stage, driven once again by the 5 Ds.
And Public Storage is leading the self-storage industry's transformation towards a customer experience that provides digital as well as traditional options across the entire customer journey. We have a deep-seated commitment to listen to what our customers want, and they are giving us vibrant input that directs our priorities.
This has led to some exciting changes in our customer offerings. One example we have spoken to is our industry-leading eRental platform. Today, nearly 50% of our customers are renting with us through the eRental online lease. Year-to-date, nearly 500,000 customers have chosen eRental to secure a unit. It's fast, intuitive and self-directed, taking just a few minutes to complete eRental, an option many customers have been anxious to use. And the quality of this customer has been impressive.
In early 2021, we also introduced the PS app, which nearly 1 million customers have now downloaded, allowing easy tools to manage your account and navigate our properties digitally and hands-free. These are 2 great examples of how our investment in technology is transforming our operating model, and it's a win-win for both customers and our operating efficiencies.
Daily headlines across multiple industries, however, remind us there are challenging consequences impacting the economy in terms of labor pressure, and self-storage is not immune. We are actively investing in our team through increased wages and new, more specialized positions that are providing even greater upward mobility for our skilled property teammates.
On the leadership front, we have also strengthened our ranks and announced yesterday that David Lee has joined Public Storage as Chief Operating Officer. David previously served as Senior Vice President of Operations for The UPS Store, with responsibility for more than 5,200 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, We are excited to have him onboard.
Now to another area, I'm pleased to share with you our external growth initiatives. Our 4-factor external growth platform is centered on acquisitions, development, redevelopment and third-party management. All areas are seeing strong growth.
Starting with acquisitions. In 2021, the self-storage industry will likely see approximately $18 billion or more of assets trade. This is a tremendous amount of volume and opportunity. Owners have been motivated to bring assets to market to monetize their investments, while some also plan for potential tax changes. Year-to-date, we have acquired or under contract on $5.1 billion of acquisitions or about 30% of the industry volume this year. This is comprised of 233 properties across 21.1 million square feet with average occupancy of 56%, which is providing a significant embedded growth opportunity once we place these assets on to the Public Storage platform.
The transactions span a wide spectrum of geographies, portfolios and one-off purchases with both market and off-market deals. We continue to be looked at as a preferred buyer based on our knowledge, transaction efficiency and ability to easily fund transactions. Of note, 65% of this quarter's volume is tied to the All Storage portfolio, which we are acquiring for $1.5 billion. All Storage is a high-quality portfolio of 56 properties, primarily located in Dallas-Fort Worth.
Dallas-Fort Worth has been one of the best storage -- self-storage markets over the past 15 years, with population growth nearly 2x that of the national average. Our own portfolio in Dallas-Fort Worth produced annual NOI growth of 150 basis points higher than our national average.
The All Storage properties also give us additional exposure to new higher-growth submarkets, particularly in and around Fort Worth. Many of the properties were recently developed, resulting in the current 75% occupancy level, which provides significant upside as we move them on to our industry-leading platform. The transaction is immediately accretive to FFO, and accretion will accelerate through to stabilization at nearly 6% direct NOI yield. And combined with owned and other assets under contract, we are expanding our already significant platform in this vibrant market to approximately 200 assets or by 64%.
The remaining 35% or $1.1 billion of the acquisitions closed or under contract will provide significant growth as well. These assets are geographically diversified across the country, comprised of single acquisitions to smaller portfolios ranging in size from $40 million to $200 million, totaling 3.9 million square feet with average occupancy of 50% at $179 per square foot.
Now to development and redevelopment, where our pipeline has grown by $70 million to $731 million this quarter. We are seeing good opportunity to build new properties from the ground up in addition to expanding our existing assets. Nationally, our development team is underwriting well-located land sites as we continue to leverage our expertise as the largest developer in the self-storage industry.
This quarter, we also added 28 properties to our third-party management platform, increasing properties under management to 145. We plan to reach 500 assets by 2025. Of note, we have also acquired 14 assets from our third-party management platform as well.
In summary, since the beginning of 2019, we have expanded our portfolio square footage by 22% with a total investment of approximately $7 billion, equaling 36 million square feet for an average of $193 per square foot, which has clearly produced strong growth and value creation that we expect will continue. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
305520,1684903778,2421722,"Public Storage, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Public Storage","Executives","Thanks, Joe. Our financial performance accelerated into the third quarter. Our same-store revenue increased 14% compared to the third quarter of 2020.

Our same-store revenue increased 14% compared to the third quarter of 2020.  That performance represented a sequential improvement in growth of 3.2% from the second quarter, driven by rate.
Two factors led to the acceleration in realized rent per foot. First, strong demand and limited inventory, which allowed us to achieve move-in rates that were up 24% versus 2020 and 33% versus 2019. Secondly, existing tenant rate increases contributed comparing to a period in 2020, and we were significantly impacted by rental rate regulation in many markets.
Now on to expenses. The team did a great job executing in this environment once again. Lower expenses were driven by property payroll, utilities, marketing and a timing benefit on property taxes. On property payroll, as Joe discussed, on October 1, we increased property manager wages, which will lead to higher expenses going forward, but will be partially offset by efficiencies in labor hours tied to the operating model transformation we discussed at our Investor Day in May.
On property tax, we will expense our annual estimate ratably through the year, leading to an approximately $0.13 benefit year-to-date and reversing to a $0.13 headwind in the fourth quarter. This will lead to more stable quarter-over-quarter expenses in the future.
In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 21.7% in the quarter. In addition to the same store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities was also a standout in the quarter, adding $53 million in NOI in the quarter or $0.30 in FFO.
As we sit here today, coming off the peak part of the leasing season, existing customer behavior is solid, with move-outs down year-over-year in the quarter and new customer demand remaining robust.
So with that, let's shift to the outlook. We raised our core FFO guidance by $0.55 at the midpoint or 4.5%. Looking at the drivers, we increased our outlook for same-store revenue to grow from 9.5% to 10.5% in 2021. That outlook implies a modest deceleration in revenue growth in the fourth quarter against very tough comps.
Our current expectations are for occupancy to moderate from here by about 150 basis points to the end of the year. That would land occupancy at the healthy 2020 levels at the end of the year. But big picture, the baton has clearly been passed to rate growth where we continue to see strength.
Our expectations are for 0% to 0.5% same-store expense growth. As a reminder, that implies an increase of circa 30% in the fourth quarter, driven by the property tax timing I discussed. We also increased our guidance for non-same-store performance, given the acceleration of acquisitions, and strong lease-up of our unstabilized facilities.
Now on the balance sheet. We have one of the industry's leading balance sheet set up well to finance the transaction volumes we've seen this year. We plan on funding the All Storage acquisition with unsecured debt, and we remain poised to grow with capacity to fund the continued activity that Joe has discussed.
So with that, I'll turn it back to you, Joe."

We've talked about that for some time, where this year, there's likely to be about $3.5 billion or so of new deliveries put into the markets nationally compared to the peak that we saw in 2019 of about $5 billion. We're likely to see that number trend down again in 2022, particularly with some of the hurdles that are out there from a development standpoint that we clearly see day in and day out.
That includes the time it takes to get a property entitled. Many of the cities are clearly understaffed, and we're seeing longer processes actually to get something as simple as a permit or a use or an occupancy use permit for a property come through to more commanding issues that we're seeing even from the cost and availability of components of construction and then labor itself.
So there's some different and, I would say, commanding issues that any developer today has to go through to operate in this kind of an environment. So that's likely to produce, again, this downdraft that we're predicting for 2022. Now having said all that, our industry, as you well know, is very fragmented. The development industry as a whole tied to self-storage is too very fragmented, and it's hard to predict what level of activity might resurface in different markets based on, frankly, the continued very strong performance of the sector.
So we're keeping a very close eye on that. As we've talked about, we've got a deep team across the entire national set of opportunities that we're working on. And we're also seeing activity that's coming through our third-party management platform as well that is tied to future development. So it will be with us.
The question is how much more momentum comes out of the environment we're dealing with as we speak, which is one of the long-term attributes of self-storage. It's a great business. So we'll see and monitor the impact that's likely to have. But we feel, at this point, we continue to have a very good run rate to go out and capture good land sites with the deep development team and the knowledge we've got across all of our markets."

We've seen, as I mentioned in my opening comments, good growth that's come out of that market. You're right, it has been a market that's been prone to an outside level -- an outsized level of development from time to time. But frankly, the embedded growth that we see that's tied to a very business-friendly economy, low costs, including taxes, cost of housing, et cetera, centrally located within the United States, great infrastructure, it's a huge draw for both business and overall population growth.
So what came with this portfolio was an opportunity to leapfrog our position that was already a top position in that market where we have had approximately 120 existing assets as well as a dozen or so third-party management properties and leapfrogging by another 52 to 53 properties. So huge opportunity to grow and actually put additional presence in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth market, particularly Fort Worth that we were lighter in.
And Fort Worth, for instance, like Dallas as a whole or the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, is growing dramatically. So we're really encouraged by that. Population growth is very strong, good household income. And we really like the multiple attributes that we will see and continue to see with our industry-leading position in that particular market.

It was quietly marketed with, more or less, a few select people that could take down a transaction of this size. In reference to your question about the location, the new supply coming in, this developer really did a great job of putting a footprint of 50 properties in markets that were so far ahead of his time out in areas that are having high barriers for new storage to come in. He built large properties in those marketplaces, kept a lot of competitors out at the same time.
And really for us, we're starting to see the same type of issues with zoning of getting new storage in a lot of these newer areas in these high-growth areas, which are the better areas of the Dallas-Fort Worth market. So for us, it puts us in a great position to be in new markets that we want to be in and gives us a very strong presence in all those markets to do it that builds big gaps for us at the same time."

And so what -- if you think about average occupancies in the 50%, I would have that in your mindset. And then from a yield standpoint, we obviously gave you a sense for All Storage what those yields are, call it, 2.6% on their operating platform in the third quarter. So that gives you a starting point. And I would say across the other properties, probably similar-type yields, even with a little bit lower occupancy.
So I think that gives you a starting point. Clearly, we have confidence in our ability to lease these properties up. One of the things that Joe mentioned earlier around our confidence in our operating platform in Dallas-Fort Worth, similar to Washington, DC, if you look at our ez transaction from earlier in the year, where we acquired that at 86% occupied, we got it to 94% through the busy season, and really strong growth in a market where we're out of inventory.
So to give you a sense, a few of those properties, we took over in the 40% occupancies and got them up to 90% by the end of the busy season, which is clearly strong leasing activity. In Dallas, similarly, we're out of inventory. We've successfully leased up our activity that we've built and bought over the last several years and are poised to take over these All Storage properties here over the next several months."

With All Storage now, you've disclosed you're taking up leverage to 4.3x on a pro forma basis. And there are a couple of other larger-scale portfolios reportedly on the market and a lot more product besides those portfolios that you discussed. You still have room to take leverage up. Obviously, you have a lot of access to capital as well. But your dry powder is decreasing a bit if you're looking to stay in that 4 to 5x range that you discussed at the Investor Day earlier in the year.
So I'm curious what the appetite is like for additional larger-scale deals. And then we saw that you're issuing $80 million of units for the deals under contract. Should we assume that PSA is open to issuing more equity or equity today as part of the funding plans going forward?"

I would put them roughly on par with each other in terms of the contribution. I do think, going forward, one of the things we disclosed is our move-out activity and the move-out rates.
The move-out rates are starting to catch up with move-in rates. They have not caught up yet, but they're starting to catch up. And that will start to be a headwind on the contribution from the move-in and move outside.

And I think the way to think about that is one of the benefits of the current environment is higher market rents, and that lowers the cost to replace that tenant if they elect to leave. The tenant base continues to be quite sticky, which gives us confidence to continue to send increases out to the tenant base.
As we think about where we're going forward, in fact, one of the contributors to higher move-out rates is actually the fact that we're being successful in increasing rental rates on that existing tenant base. So I would say almost the reverse, which is, as we're successful on existing tenant rate increases, I'd anticipate that, that move-out rate will move higher. Move-out rate meaning that the rent that the people are paying that do elect to leave us."

So as I've spoken to, we've got a very deep-seated team across the entire portfolio that we operate today and in markets that we continue to look for additional growth as well. The opportunity to acquire land over the last 1.5 years or so has been somewhat elevated because we've seen that tapering down of delivery, so not quite as much as ground-up development momentum, again, coming from a very fragmented set of developers out there. But land is still very competitive.
There's a lot of knowledge you need to have to find and locate the exact right location that's complementary to future growth of the particular asset, the kind of dynamics that come from competition as well as population growth, et cetera. So a lot of different factors come into the way that we're able to select land sites very differently than most because of the amount of data that we have day in and day out relative to our presence already across 39 states and being a top owner in nearly every one of those submarkets.
The business, though, it's very entrepreneurial from an overall self-storage standpoint. So there's competition that can come through. And as I mentioned, in some cases, that may become more elevated than we've seen over the last 1.5 years.
So keeping a very close eye on it, but we feel like we've got very good tools to not only find great land sites, but to actually execute even in an environment where it's tough to get either entitlements and/or justify the costs that are tied, particularly from component costs and labor costs that are playing through to actually develop facilities in an environment where we're seeing a high degree of inflation at the moment."

And so I understand the question you're suggesting, but I think we continue to see strong demand for self-storage across the country. But if you look at the markets with the strongest growth, really driven by macroeconomic, demographic and population shift that we think are poised to continue here, which is helpful. So clearly, there's been a move in market rents higher and existing tenant rate increases have been moving the current tenant base higher alongside that.
Now over the course of last year and really through a good portion of this year and in some markets is continuing today, we have had pricing regulations on us because of the state of emergencies and the impact of the health care environment. And that's definitely been a headwind as it relates to the existing tenant base and moving them in the same manner that market rents are going.
So I think that another way to say that is there is some embedded rate growth that's available to the extent that we continue to see normalization from a health care standpoint and state of emergencies continue to expire. The most notable of which is in Los Angeles County, not related to pandemic, but related to fire several years ago that we continue to monitor."

I don't have it for this quarter.

Or could you talk a little bit about the crossover point when you kind of get firmly into the green in that business?
And then like from a margin perspective, what do you think that could potentially scale to?

One is, obviously, we've been ramping the size of that business. And one of the most vibrant areas of demand from our customer base for that business line is from folks that have developed new properties. And so as we take on those properties, the profitability of a new property is less than one of one that is stabilized, obviously, given the revenue nature of the fees. And so as we ramp that program, similar to our development business almost, there's a ramping of the profitability of each individual store.
So said another way, it's going to take several years before the volumes that we're anticipating really start to produce the P&L impact that you might anticipate. The second piece of your question relates to what are the margins of that business. And there's a couple of factors there. So one is clearly the geographic mix of the properties themselves, what the operating costs are that tie to them. But if you just look at them overall, and you say, okay, where can we get to from a margin basis versus the fees we're charging, I think a reasonable margin is probably in the 20s to 30%. But again, a lot of variability as we add a significant number of properties, so that's store base over the next several years."

So the role that David is coming into isn't new to the company in the context of our goals and the strategies that we have. It's just an added level of leadership that we think is prudent as we move the business forward. And we're accelerating the pace of change that ties to the amount of investment that we're making in our people directly as well as the technological platforms, particularly as it relates to the digitization of the business.

It relates to what we're seeing in the customer funnel. So advertising has a benefit to increased top of funnel, right? The number of people that are, say, searching for Public Storage or finding Public Storage when they go to search for self-storage. And so that is helpful in markets where we're seeing top-of-funnel demand erode. But we have other tools as we're managing revenue, be it pricing, promotion, et cetera, that will impact conversion within that funnel.
And so I would say, we're watching the different components of the funnel and what the returns are associated with pulling those different levers. To date, we continue to see strong top-of-funnel demand across the board. Web visits, for instance, in the quarter, were up north of 20% across the system. Calls into our call center were roughly flat. So overall, still very solid top-of-funnel demand, which led to the decision making around marketing in the quarter. As we've demonstrated in the past, if we start to see those dynamics change, we typically do see pretty good returns on our advertising spend, and we'll pull that lever as well."

And then on the stabilized stores, we call them stabilized, but the reality is they're not in our platform. And like we're seeing in acquisitions to date, really through last year, we have an opportunity to put our operating platform and systems in place and drive further improvement. So you can see, for instance, where our overall Dallas portfolio rental rates are. And obviously, these properties are -- have their own submarkets and underwritten rates, but gives you a sense as to the upside in rental rates that we think we can achieve in the portfolio over time."

So a combination of a number of those things. But I would point you to the presentation where you can see our same-store rents in Dallas punching at $15 per foot versus the in-place rents there in the third quarter at about $11. So there's definitely occupancy and rental rate upside."

But it points to the ability that we have from a structure and a scale and operating prowess standpoint.
So we're deep in these markets. We've got very strong teams that run these assets day in and day out. Our systems allow very efficient integration. And we've been doing this for many, many years. And with the investment we've made with our technological platform, we certainly can do it in higher degrees of volume and higher degrees of concentration. The yields that we will likely see from this integration are, as we've mentioned, compelling. Again, it ties to the fact that we have the inherent skill and benefit from the investments that we've made in to do just this.
So our capital structure is well suited to continue to fund the kind of growth that we've seen.

So last year was certainly a unique year, where we saw different seasonal patterns because of the nature of the health care environment last year. And we didn't see much, if any, of an occupancy decline as we moved through the year. This year, we did see a more seasonal pattern and, frankly, had the benefit of some of the seasonal demand drivers, things like home sales and DIY projects over the summer, for instance, college students, et cetera. And that will add to demand in the summer, but then we'll then move out as we move into the fall.
So there was that additive demand this year, but we are seeing a little bit more moderation. One of the reasons why we're seeing that moderation is the continued stickiness of the tenant base. And so we've had fewer move-ins this year. And so recent move-ins are the most likely to move out. And so we've had a contribution of that benefit and a little bit more seasonality this year.
I do think that the seasonal demand drivers that have been driving self-storage demand for years will continue to play out over the next several years. And so we operate a seasonal business, and it will be going forward. The degree of it, we'll need to see year in and year out.
