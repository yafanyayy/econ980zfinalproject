Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we highlighted last week during our CAGNY presentation, our results for the third quarter exceeded our expectations, reflecting the continued elevated at home consumption, improved execution of our strategy, and momentum for our brands. Net sales increased 5% versus the prior year, while comparable sales increased 7%. And we delivered net sales growth across all 3 of our U.S. retail segments, with coffee sales increasing 12%, comparable sales within consumer Foods increasing 16% and our Pet food and Pet snacks sales increasing 6%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 4%, driven by increased sales volume, partially offset by higher cost and SG&A expenses, inclusive of incremental marketing investments supporting our brands. Due to stronger-than-anticipated results through the first-3 quarters of the fiscal year and updated assumptions for the fourth quarter, we are pleased to increase our full year expectations to include net sales growth of 2% versus the prior year, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.70 to $8.90 and free cash flow of $1.1 billion. We are delivering exceptional financial performance while significantly increasing investments in our brands, strengthening our balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders, all of which are important building blocks for supporting long-term growth and increasing shareholder value. At our Investor Day and last week's CAGNY conference, we provided details around our current priorities that will strengthen our executional capabilities and unlock the full potential of our strategy. These include driving commercial excellence, streamlining our cost infrastructure, reshaping our portfolio and unleashing our organization to win. We made significant progress against these priorities in the quarter, specifically in the areas of improving commercial execution and reshaping our portfolio. We continue to benefit from strong demand for our brands and achieved a fourth consecutive quarter of net sales and earnings growth. Our performance reflects the outstanding work our teams have done to increase production and ensure our products are getting on shelf while minimizing any potential disruptions. We continued our trend of improving market share across our portfolio as we increased our dollar market share in core consumer and coffee segments as well as for our Cat food business. Highlighting the strength of our broad brand portfolio in these categories. In aggregate, we grew share for brands representing 53% of our sales. Up from 46% in the second quarter. We are confident the actions we are taking, along with the macro events that have occurred over the past year will translate to sustained tailwinds for our business. We are well positioned to maintain a meaningful portion of increased consumption for the long term, supported by our marketing investments enhanced commercial execution and improvement in share trends. Our confidence is further supported by external factors including retailers' desire to simplify assortment, providing more shelf space for our leading brands. Approximately half the U.S. workforce is expected to work remotely on a part or full-time basis post pandemic compared to just 30% before the pandemic. Driving increased at home breakfast and lunch occasions, benefiting our coffee and consumer Foods businesses. And tailwinds for the pet category with consumption projected to grow approximately 5% over the next few years as nearly 10 million households adopted a cat or dog over the past 12 months. We have made great progress in reshaping our portfolio, having completed the sales of the Crisco and natural balance businesses in the quarter. These divestitures underscore our commitment to further our focus on brands and categories that have the greatest growth opportunities over the long term. As we move ahead, we will continue to evaluate all elements of the portfolio and make changes when necessary to ensure our portfolio is positioned for growth. Turning to our segment results. In Pet food, our market-leading dog snacks and our cat food businesses delivered another quarter of net sales growth. Sales for dog snacks increased 14%, led by gains for the Milk-Bone, Pup-Peroni and Rachael Ray Nutrish Brands. Sales growth for the meal mix brand-led cat food growth of 9%, representing the 14th consecutive quarter of cat food growth. With our share increasing in both the dry and wet cat categories. In dog food, sales for our largest brand, Nutrish, grew 4%. The in consumption, share trends for Nutrish dog food have stabilized with repeat rates and dollars per buyer increasing versus the prior year. For the total brand, Nutrish net sales were up 8% in the quarter, reflecting the growth for dog food as well as increases for cat food, dog snacks and cat snacks. Turning to our coffee business. We delivered net sales growth for all brands and segments in our market-leading coffee portfolio as total segment net sales increased 12%. Led by the Dunkin' and Folgers brands. The Dunkin' and Cafe Bustelo brands as well as K-Cups have become an increasingly important part of our portfolio.
Collectively growing over 20% and accounting for over 50% of segment net sales in this quarter. Cafe Bustelo and Dunkin' are the 2 fastest-growing brands in the coffee category. With 52-week sales up 28% and 21%, respectively. The Dunkin' brand has eclipsed $1 billion in all channel retail sales dollars. Inclusive of club and e-commerce over the past 12 months. The Folgers brand gained 3 million new households at the height of the pandemic and had the highest repeat rate by new consumers during the holiday season. Further, our portfolio brands gained more incremental households in the last year than any other manufacturer and has gained share in all channel consumption, inclusive of club and e-commerce. In our Consumer Foods segment, growth across all categories drove a 16% increase in comparable sales. The actions we have taken on the JIF brand led to over 20% sales growth on core peanut butter offerings. In Multi outlet retail sales, JIF was the fastest-growing national brand in the quarter, increasing over 13% and more than twice the category average. This growth reflects benefits of improved distribution and in stocks, strong marketing support, pricing actions in response to higher costs and competitive supply disruption. The JIF brand gained over 3 points of volume and dollar share sequentially from the second quarter, and our total peanut butter portfolio grew to over a 50% share of the peanut butter category. Our Smucker's uncrustables business also continued to deliver exceptional growth. With third quarter net sales increasing 21%. Household penetration is up 23% compared to 1 year ago. For our combined U.S. retail and away-from-home segments, the Uncrustables brand delivered $100 million of net sales this quarter, recording its 27th consecutive quarter of growth. The brand is on pace to deliver over $400 million of net sales this year and is on track to exceed our $500 million target in fiscal year 2023.
Underpinning the improvement in net sales and market share across our businesses has been strong commercial execution, optimize marketing investments to align with consumer behavior and a continued commitment to financial discipline. We plan for a continued step-up in marketing investments in the fourth quarter inclusive of Mass media, targeted digital consumer engagement, e-commerce and click and collect programs as we continue to reinvest to support our brands. Finally, we are sharpening our efforts to address issues that impact the quality of life for people and pets. This evolved agenda helps meet their needs for quality food, education, equitable and ethical treatment, community resources and a healthier planet. Additional details are available on our corporate website. In summary, I would like to reinforce a few key points. First, we continue to deliver strong financial results and the actions we are taking to deliver our priorities are leading to improvement in key metrics, including market share that position us well for the remainder of the year and beyond. Second, we continue to make progress against our consumer-centric growth strategy. Third, through our executional priorities, we are becoming a more focused, efficient and agile organization. And fourth, we are strengthening our core capabilities, which position us as a stronger company set up for delivering sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. These actions will ensure we continue to deliver consistent sales and profit growth beyond the pandemic, leveraging a strong portfolio of brands and world-class commercial capabilities, all of which are powered by our unique culture and dedicated employees, who I would like to thank for their outstanding contributions. I'll now turn the call over to Tucker."

Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving an overview of third quarter results before providing an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. The net sales increased 5%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange",1379,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving an overview of third quarter results before providing an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. The net sales increased 5%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales increased 7%, primarily driven by favorable volume mix in each of the U.S. retail segments partially offset by an anticipated decline in the away-from-home business. Adjusted gross profit increased $23 million or 3% from the prior year, mostly driven by the positive contribution from volume mix partially offset by higher costs and the non-comparable impact of the divested businesses. Adjusted operating income grew $8 million or 2%, reflecting the increased gross profit partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. The increase in SD&A expenses was primarily driven by incentive compensation and increased marketing investment, partially offset by reduced distribution costs. Below operating income, interest expense decreased $2 million, and the adjusted effective income tax rate was in line with the prior year at 23.1%. Factoring all this in, along with shares repurchase that resulted in a weighted average share count of $112.6 million, third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.45 compared to $2.35 in the prior year, an increase of 4%. Let me now turn to segment results, beginning with pet foods. Net sales increased 6% versus the prior year primarily driven by favorable volume mix for dog snacks and cat food, partially offset by lower net price realization, the reduction in net pricing primarily reflects investment in e-commerce and new product launches. Growth was led by our 3 largest brands in the segment, including increases of 8% for Nutrish, 9% for Meow mix and 11% for Milk-Bone. Pet Foods segment profit declined 7% and reflecting the lapping of an $8 million legal settlement received in the prior year. Excluding the settlement in the prior year, segment profit declined 2%, primarily reflecting lower net pricing and higher costs. Partially offset by the favorable volume mix. The increased costs were mostly driven by higher transportation expense.
Turning to the coffee segment. Net sales increased 12% and driven by a 13-percentage-point increase from volume mix, partially offset by lower net pricing. Growth occurred across all brands and formats in the portfolio, led by the Dunkin' growth of 19%, Folgers growth of 7% and Cafe Bustelo growth of 26%. Our K-Cup portfolio, which is growing nearly twice the category rate continues to be an increasingly important growth driver. As sales increased 27% and accounted for over 30% of the segment's net sales. Coffee segment profit increased 11%, driven by the favorable volume mix partially offset by lower net pricing and higher marketing expense. In Consumer Foods, net sales increased 6%. Excluding the prior year noncomparable sales for the divested Crisco business net sales increased 16%, driven by volume mix growth of 10% and a 5-percentage-point impact from higher net pricing, primarily due to a list price increase taken on peanut butter in the second quarter. Growth was led by the JIF brand, which grew 14%, while Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches grew 21% and Smucker's fruit spreads grew 15%. The prior year discontinuation of Power-Ups was a $6 million headwind in the quarter. Consumer Foods segment profit increased 32%, primarily reflecting the increase from volume mix a favorable net impact of higher price and costs and lapping of a $7.5 million equipment write-off for JIF Power-Ups in the prior year. These tailwinds were partially offset by the noncomparable profit from the divested Crisco business and increased marketing expense. Lastly, in international and away from home, net sales declined 13% and the away-from-home business contracted 27%, primarily driven by declines in coffee and portion control products due to the continued impact of COVID-19. International growth of 9% was primarily driven by increases in Canada across most categories, including baking, pet food and snacks, peanut butter and fruit spreads. International away-from-home segment profit decreased 50%, primarily driven by the reduced volume mix and increased costs, partly attributable to the deleveraging of fixed costs in the away-from-home business. Third quarter free cash flow was $417 million, which represented a decrease from the prior year due to a less favorable benefit from net working capital requirements, increased capital expenditures and a decline in net income adjusted for noncash items. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, with the increase over the prior year, primarily related to capacity expansion for uncrustables frozen sandwiches. During the quarter, the company received total net proceeds from the divested businesses of $569 million, inclusive of transaction costs and initial working capital adjustments. We used $522 million to repurchase 4.5 million common shares, of which 4.3 million settled in the third quarter for $498 million, and the remainder settled at the beginning of the fourth quarter. These repurchases decreased the number of shares outstanding by approximately 4%. The we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalent balances at $502 million. We paid down $314 million of debt during the quarter, resulting in a total debt balance of $4.8 billion. Based on a trailing 12-month EBITDA of approximately $1.9 billion, our leverage ratio stands at 2.5x. We anticipate maintaining a balanced capital deployment model that prioritizes the use of cash toward dividends and debt repayments, while evaluating other strategic uses of cash for future growth and shareholder value creation, including the potential for future share repurchases.
Let me now provide additional color on our revised outlook for fiscal 2021. The severity and length of the pandemic and related implications continue to create uncertainty in our financial outlook. Changes in consumer purchasing behavior, retailer inventory levels, macroeconomic conditions and any manufacturing or supply chain disruption could materially impact our actual results. Further, we have experienced some weather-related disruption and tightening in the supply chain this month. That said, we are sharing our expectations based on our current performance and understanding of the overall environment. Net sales are now anticipated to be up approximately 2% compared to the prior year, which reflects the sales performance for the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year and an expected 10% decline in the fourth quarter, elements taken into consideration for the fourth quarter net sales include the lapping of $185 million benefit in the prior year related to the initial consumer stock up purchasing during the beginning of the pandemic. Lapping sales related to the divested businesses of approximately $124 million and continued elevated at-home consumption benefiting the U.S. retail coffee and consumer food segments. We anticipate full year gross profit margin to approximate 38%. The projected gross margin includes fourth quarter incremental trade spend investments, primarily for the pet business, timing of fixed cost expenses related to manufacturing absorption and increased freight and transportation costs. SG&A expenses for the full year are projected to increase 3% to 4% and primarily reflecting increased marketing spend and incentive compensation. Total marketing spend is expected to approximate 6.5% or greater of net sales with incremental fourth quarter brand reinvestments across all U.S. retail businesses, most notably for pet food. We continue to anticipate net interest expense of $180 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of 24%. We anticipate a full year weighted average share count of $112.6 million, which includes a fourth quarter share count of $109.6 million reflecting the impact of shares repurchased in the third quarter. Taking all these factors into consideration, we anticipate full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.70 to $8.90 at the midpoint of our range, fourth quarter adjusted EPS is anticipated to decline around $1 versus the prior year due to decreases in net sales, gross profit margin decline, incremental marketing investments and the net impact of divestitures and shares repurchased. Full year free cash flow is anticipated to be approximately $1.1 billion with capital expenditures of $300 million versus prior guidance of   $315 million  . In closing, let me reiterate Mark's opening comments, we are pleased with our third quarter results, which show the strength of our brand portfolio and the health of our categories with continued financial discipline we are committed to delivering sustainable and consistent long-term value for our shareholders.

So we will lose some level of manufacturing absorption along with the continued impact on our away-from-home business.
And then as we have shared, we are experiencing increased freight and transportation expenses this year due to tight supply chains. But on a longer-term basis, we remain committed to a healthy gross profit margin, achieving that 38% or better."

We can make adjustments to our assortments if we need to, on the fly, and it does have high ROI. So it really is a win-win-win. It's a win for us. It's a win for our customers as well as our consumers and we really continue to remain very focused on the click and collect model, which is a very productive channel. And we have #1 brands there from a digital shelf standpoint. Specifically, skewing towards coffee, peanut butter and pet snacks."

And as a result of the lost top line, we are seeing a pretty significant impact to lost manufacturing absorption and other fixed cost absorption as well. And you have to recall that it's not only in the manufacturing side, we also have a very big installed equipment base or coffee brewing.
And so as we're not putting volume across that, it also has an impact. So as we see a return to growth and the top line for the away-from-home business and the segment in its entirety, that will also have a corresponding improvement to the profit base as well."

In our case, it's notable in coffee and peanut butter would be 2 of the notable ones where we're benefiting from that.

So I'm going to start and then let Mark provide some incremental comments. So as it relates to the fourth quarter, we are anticipating being down in earnings approximately $1 at the midpoint. This is reflecting ongoing business momentum that we see, which we approximate to be about $0.25. Then it's being offset by the net sales decline due to the lapping of the initial consumer stock up during the pandemic of the prior year of approximately $0.50. And then we've noted that there is a divestiture impact across Crisco and natural balance of approximately $0.20 in the fourth quarter that is being offset about $0.06 from shares repurchased in the third quarter. And then we have incremental cost headwinds in 2 areas. One is the incremental SG&A expenses of about $0.35 and that's being driven by the marketing reinvestments that Mark spoke to. And then lastly is, as you are seeing a year-over-year gross margin decline, and that is approximately $0.25. So that gets you to where we're down about $1 without some of the lapping -- and then the second question that I think you asked was last week at CAGNY, we offered that on a 2-year stacked basis, we see a path demonstrating underlying organic growth at the top line and adjusted earnings per share there were some questions around what level of earnings per share. We finished FY '20 at $8.76. And so we'd like to think that we could do $8.76 or better in our next fiscal year. But again, it's early innings as we work through the planning process.

As Mark talked about, as you think about commodities, along with any other ingredient or packaging or transportation increases, we would look to offset those first, through our physical buy.
The next would also then be our continuous improvement mindset as noted. And then lastly, pricing where and when justified across our respective businesses. And so we acknowledge that we continue to take all those elements, not only to deliver this fiscal year but also for next fiscal year and beyond. I would also say on the manufacturing side, we do have very tight supply chains. And so inventory levels, particularly within our network are a bit below where we might want them. And so we continue to work to get those levels up not only this fiscal year or next year -- fiscal year to meet retail and consumer demand. So I don't expect -- I do expect a hangover in manufacturing absorption. I think the question is how big is the hangover and there might be some benefit or upside there. So when you think about manufacturing absorption year-over-year. And then lastly is, as we continue to reshape the portfolio, either through divestiture activity or optimizing SKUs, that will also hopefully allure to a positive benefit as well to gross profit margin. And then underlying all of that, as you well know, we have a very strong consumer-centric strategy across a lot of our key growth brands. And as we continue to drive that growth, it will also support the gross profit margin as well. So hopefully, that gives you a sense at a big picture level as to how we're thinking about it."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we highlighted last week during our CAGNY presentation, our results for the third quarter exceeded our expectations, reflecting the continued elevated at-home consumption, improved execution of our strategy, and momentum for our brands. Net sales increased 5% versus the prior year, while comparable sales increased 7%. And we delivered net sales growth across all 3 of our U.S. retail segments, with coffee sales increasing 12%, comparable sales within consumer foods increasing 16% and our pet food and pet snacks sales increasing 6%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 4% driven by increased sales volume partially offset by higher cost and SD&A expenses, inclusive of incremental marketing investments supporting our brands. 
Due to stronger-than-anticipated results through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year and updated assumptions for the fourth quarter, we are pleased to increase our full year expectations to include net sales growth of 2% versus the prior year, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.70 to $8.90 and free cash flow of $1.1 billion. We are delivering exceptional financial performance while significantly increasing investments in our brands, strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders, all of which are important building blocks for supporting long-term growth and increasing shareholder value. 
At our Investor Day and last week's CAGNY conference, we provided details around our current priorities that will strengthen our executional capabilities and unlock the full potential of our strategy. These include driving commercial excellence, streamlining our cost infrastructure, reshaping our portfolio and unleashing our organization to win. We made significant progress against these priorities in the quarter, specifically in the areas of improving commercial execution and reshaping our portfolio. We continue to benefit from strong demand for our brands and achieved a fourth consecutive quarter of net sales and earnings growth. Our performance reflects the outstanding work our teams have done to increase production and ensure our products are getting on shelf while minimizing any potential disruptions.
We continued our trend of improving market share across our portfolio as we increased our dollar market share in core consumer and coffee segments as well as for our cat food business, highlighting the strength of our broad brand portfolio in these categories. In aggregate, we grew share for brands representing 53% of our sales up from 46% in the second quarter. We are confident the actions we are taking, along with the macro events that have occurred over the past year, will translate to sustained tailwinds for our business. We are well positioned to maintain a meaningful portion of increased consumption for the long term, supported by our marketing investments, enhanced commercial execution and improvement in share trends. 
Our confidence is further supported by external factors including retailers' desire to simplify assortment, providing more shelf space for our leading brands. Approximately half the U.S. workforce is expected to work remotely on a part- or full-time basis postpandemic compared to just 30% before the pandemic, driving increased at-home breakfast and lunch occasions, benefiting our coffee and consumer foods businesses and tailwinds for the pet category with consumption projected to grow approximately 5% over the next few years as nearly 10 million households adopted a cat or dog over the past 12 months. 
We have made great progress in reshaping our portfolio, having completed the sales of the Crisco and Natural Balance businesses in the quarter. These divestitures underscore our commitment to further our focus on brands and categories that have the greatest growth opportunities over the long term. As we move ahead, we will continue to evaluate all elements of the portfolio and make changes when necessary to ensure our portfolio is positioned for growth.
Turning to our segment results. In pet food, our market-leading dog snacks and our cat food businesses delivered another quarter of net sales growth. Sales for dog snacks increased 14% led by gains for the Milk-Bone, Pup-Peroni and Rachael Ray Nutrish Brands. Sales growth for the Meow Mix brand led cat food growth of 9%, representing the 14th consecutive quarter of cat food growth, with our share increasing in both the dry and wet cat categories. In dog food, sales for our largest brand, Nutrish, grew 4%. In consumption, share trends for Nutrish dog food have stabilized with repeat rates and dollars per buyer increasing versus the prior year. For the total brand, Nutrish net sales were up 8% in the quarter, reflecting the growth for dog food as well as increases for cat food, dog snacks and cat snacks. 
Turning to our coffee business. We delivered net sales growth for all brands and segments in our market-leading coffee portfolio as total segment net sales increased 12%, led by the Dunkin' and Folgers brands. The Dunkin' and Café Bustelo brands as well as K-Cups have become an increasingly important part of our portfolio, collectively growing over 20% and accounting for over 50% of segment net sales in this quarter. Café Bustelo and Dunkin' are the 2 fastest-growing brands in the coffee category with 52-week sales up 28% and 21%, respectively. 
The Dunkin' brand has eclipsed $1 billion in all channel retail sales dollars, inclusive of club and e-commerce over the past 12 months. The Folgers brand gained 3 million new households at the height of the pandemic and had the highest repeat rate by new consumers during the holiday season. Further, our portfolio of brands gained more incremental households in the last year than any other manufacturer and has gained share in all channel consumption, inclusive of club and e-commerce. 
In our consumer foods segment, growth across all categories drove a 16% increase in comparable sales. The actions we have taken on the Jif brand led to over 20% sales growth on core peanut butter offerings. In multi-outlet retail sales, Jif was the fastest-growing national brand in the quarter, increasing over 13%, more than twice the category average. This growth reflects benefits of improved distribution and in-stocks, strong marketing support, pricing actions in response to higher costs and competitive supply disruption. The Jif brand gained over 3 points of volume and dollar share sequentially from the second quarter, and our total peanut butter portfolio grew to over a 50% share of the peanut butter category. 
Our Smucker's Uncrustables business also continued to deliver exceptional growth with third quarter net sales increasing 21%. Household penetration is up 23% compared to a year ago. For our combined U.S. retail and Away from Home segments, the Uncrustables brand delivered $100 million of net sales this quarter, recording its 27th consecutive quarter of growth. The brand is on pace to deliver over $400 million of net sales this year and is on track to exceed our $500 million target in fiscal year 2023. 
Underpinning the improvement in net sales and market share across our businesses has been strong commercial execution, optimized marketing investments to align with consumer behavior and a continued commitment to financial discipline. We plan for a continued step-up in marketing investments in the fourth quarter inclusive of mass media, targeted digital consumer engagement, e-commerce and click-and-collect programs as we continue to reinvest to support our brands. Finally, we are sharpening our efforts to address issues that impact the quality of life for people and pets. This evolved agenda helps meet their needs for quality food, education, equitable and ethical treatment, community resources and a healthier planet. Additional details are available on our corporate website. 
In summary, I would like to reinforce a few key points. First, we continue to deliver strong financial results and the actions we are taking to deliver our priorities are leading to improvement in key metrics, including market share, that position us well for the remainder of the year and beyond. Second, we continue to make progress against our consumer-centric growth strategy. Third, through our executional priorities, we are becoming a more focused, efficient and agile organization. And fourth, we are strengthening our core capabilities, which position us as a stronger company set up for delivering sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. These actions will ensure we continue to deliver consistent sales and profit growth beyond the pandemic, leveraging a strong portfolio of brands and world-class commercial capabilities, all of which are powered by our unique culture and dedicated employees, who I would like to thank for their outstanding contributions. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tucker."

Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving an overview of third quarter results before providing an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Net sales increased 5%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, ne",1372,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving an overview of third quarter results before providing an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Net sales increased 5%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales increased 7% primarily driven by favorable volume/mix in each of the U.S. retail segments partially offset by an anticipated decline in the Away From Home business. Adjusted gross profit increased $23 million or 3% from the prior year, mostly driven by the positive contribution from volume/mix partially offset by higher costs and the noncomparable impact of the divested businesses.
Adjusted operating income grew $8 million or 2%, reflecting the increased gross profit partially offset by higher SD&A expenses. The increase in SD&A expenses was primarily driven by incentive compensation and increased marketing investment partially offset by reduced distribution costs. Below operating income, interest expense decreased $2 million, and the adjusted effective income tax rate was in line with the prior year at 23.1%. Factoring all this in, along with shares repurchased that resulted in a weighted average share count of 112.6 million, third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.45 compared to $2.35 in the prior year, an increase of 4%.
Let me now turn to segment results, beginning with pet foods. Net sales increased 6% versus the prior year primarily driven by favorable volume/mix for dog snacks and cat food partially offset by lower net price realization. The reduction in net pricing primarily reflects investment in e-commerce and new product launches. Growth was led by our 3 largest brands in the segment, including increases of 8% for Nutrish, 9% for Meow Mix and 11% for Milk-Bone. Pet foods segment profit declined 7%, reflecting the lapping of an $8 million legal settlement received in the prior year. Excluding the settlement in the prior year, segment profit declined 2% primarily reflecting lower net pricing and higher costs partially offset by the favorable volume/mix. The increased costs were mostly driven by higher transportation expense. 
Turning to the coffee segment. Net sales increased 12% driven by a 13-percentage-point increase from volume/mix partially offset by lower net pricing. Growth occurred across all brands and formats in the portfolio, led by the Dunkin' growth of 19%, Folgers growth of 7% and Café Bustelo growth of 26%. Our K-Cup portfolio, which is growing nearly twice the category rate, continues to be an increasingly important growth driver as sales increased 27% and accounted for over 30% of the segment's net sales. Coffee segment profit increased 11% driven by the favorable volume/mix partially offset by lower net pricing and higher marketing expense. 
In consumer foods, net sales increased 6%. Excluding the prior year noncomparable sales for the divested Crisco business, net sales increased 16% driven by volume/mix growth of 10% and a 5-percentage-point impact from higher net pricing primarily due to a list price increase taken on peanut butter in the second quarter. Growth was led by the Jif brand, which grew 14%, while Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches grew 21% and Smucker's fruit spreads grew 15%. The prior year discontinuation of Power Ups was a $6 million headwind in the quarter. Consumer foods segment profit increased 32% primarily reflecting the increase from volume/mix, a favorable net impact of higher price and costs and lapping of a $7.5 million equipment write-off for Jif Power Ups in the prior year. These tailwinds were partially offset by the noncomparable profit from the divested Crisco business and increased marketing expense. 
Lastly, in International and Away From Home, net sales declined 13%. The Away From Home business contracted 27% primarily driven by declines in coffee and portion-control products due to the continued impact of COVID-19. International growth of 9% was primarily driven by increases in Canada across most categories, including baking, pet food and snacks, peanut butter and fruit spreads. International and Away From Home segment profit decreased 50% primarily driven by the reduced volume/mix and increased costs partly attributable to the deleveraging of fixed costs in the Away From Home business. 
Third quarter free cash flow was $417 million, which represented a decrease from the prior year due to a less favorable benefit from net working capital requirements, increased capital expenditures and a decline in net income adjusted for noncash items. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, with the increase over the prior year primarily related to capacity expansion for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches. During the quarter, the company received total net proceeds from the divested businesses of $569 million, inclusive of transaction costs and initial working capital adjustments. We used $522 million to repurchase 4.5 million common shares, of which 4.3 million settled in the third quarter for $498 million and the remainder settled at the beginning of the fourth quarter. These repurchases decreased the number of shares outstanding by approximately 4%. 
We finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalent balances at $502 million. We paid down $314 million of debt during the quarter, resulting in a total debt balance of $4.8 billion. Based on a trailing 12-month EBITDA of approximately $1.9 billion, our leverage ratio stands at 2.5x. We anticipate maintaining a balanced capital deployment model that prioritizes the use of cash toward dividends and debt repayments while evaluating other strategic uses of cash for future growth and shareholder value creation, including the potential for future share repurchases. 
Let me now provide additional color on our revised outlook for fiscal 2021. The severity and length of the pandemic and related implications continue to create uncertainty in our financial outlook. Changes in consumer purchasing behavior, retailer inventory levels, macroeconomic conditions and any manufacturing or supply chain disruption could materially impact our actual results. Further, we have experienced some weather-related disruption and tightening in the supply chain this month. That said, we are sharing our expectations based on our current performance and understanding of the overall environment. 
Net sales are now anticipated to be up approximately 2% compared to the prior year, which reflects the sales performance for the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year and an expected 10% decline in the fourth quarter. Elements taken into consideration for the fourth quarter net sales include the lapping of $185 million benefit in the prior year related to the initial consumer stock-up purchasing during the beginning of the pandemic, lapping sales related to the divested businesses of approximately $124 million and continued elevated at-home consumption benefiting the U.S. Retail Coffee and Consumer Foods segments. We anticipate full year gross profit margin to approximate 38%. The projected gross margin includes fourth quarter incremental trade spend investments primarily for the pet business, timing of fixed cost expenses related to manufacturing absorption and increased freight and transportation costs. 
SD&A expenses for the full year are projected to increase 3% to 4% primarily reflecting increased marketing spend and incentive compensation. Total marketing spend is expected to approximate 6.5% or greater of net sales with incremental fourth quarter brand reinvestments across all U.S. retail businesses, most notably for pet food. We continue to anticipate net interest expense of $180 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of 24%. We anticipate a full year weighted average share count of 112.6 million, which includes a fourth quarter share count of 109.6 million, reflecting the impact of shares repurchased in the third quarter. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we anticipate full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.70 to $8.90. At the midpoint of our range, fourth quarter adjusted EPS is anticipated to decline around $1 versus the prior year due to decreases in net sales, gross profit margin decline, incremental marketing investments and the net impact of divestitures and shares repurchased. Full year free cash flow is anticipated to be approximately $1.1 billion with capital expenditures of $300 million versus prior guidance of $315 million. 
In closing, let me reiterate Mark's opening comments. We are pleased with our third quarter results, which show the strength of our brand portfolio and the health of our categories. With continued financial discipline, we are committed to delivering sustainable and consistent long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your time.

And as a result of the lost top line, we are seeing a pretty significant impact to lost manufacturing absorption and other fixed cost absorption as well. And you have to recall that it's not only in the manufacturing sides, we also have a very big installed equipment base for coffee brewing.

You have scale brands with better profitability. 
So I'm just trying to gauge what you were implying when you said that the retailers are looking to simplify and still work with bigger brands. Is that bigger brands relative to smaller brands?

And because they're getting more efficient on shelf, there is fewer -- there will be fewer or are fewer SKUs in particular categories. In our case, it's notable in coffee and peanut butter would be 2 of the notable ones where we're benefiting from that.

So I'm going to start and then let Mark provide some incremental comments. So as it relates to the fourth quarter, we are anticipating being down in earnings approximately $1 at the midpoint. This is reflecting ongoing business momentum that we see, which we approximate to be about $0.25. That is being offset by the net sales decline due to the lapping of the initial consumer stock-up during the pandemic of the prior year of approximately $0.50. And then we've noted that there is a divestiture impact across Crisco and Natural Balance of approximately $0.20 in the fourth quarter that is being offset about $0.06 from shares repurchased in the third quarter. 
And then we have incremental cost headwinds in 2 areas. One is the incremental SG&A expenses of about $0.35 and that's being driven by the marketing reinvestments that Mark spoke to. And then lastly is, is you are seeing a year-over-year gross margin decline, and that is approximately $0.25. So that gets you to where we're down about $1. Without some of the lapping effect and some of the reinvestment effects, that would have had a positive impact to the bottom line. But we did -- we have made some decisions and we have divested some businesses.
And then the second question I think you asked was last week at CAGNY, we offered that, on a 2-year stacked basis, we see a path demonstrating underlying organic growth at the top line and adjusted earnings per share. There was some questions around what level of earnings per share. We finished FY '20 at $8.76. And so we'd like to think that we could do $8.76 or better in our next fiscal year. But again, it's early innings as we work through the planning process. I'll pause and offer Mark, if he has any other responses to your questions."

And big picture, we remain committed to ensuring that we have a healthy gross profit margin today, tomorrow and beyond, and that is really supported by our continuous improvement mindset, the cost management reduction programs and the margin management programs as well. 
As Mark talked about, as you think about commodities, along with any other ingredient or packaging or transportation increases, we would look to offset those, first through our physical buy. And secondly would also be through our hedging and risk management strategies. The next would also then be our continuous improvement mindset as noted. And then lastly, pricing where and when justified across our respective businesses. And so we acknowledge that we continue to take all those elements, not only to deliver this fiscal year but also for next fiscal year and beyond. 
I would also say on the manufacturing side, we do have very tight supply chains. And so inventory levels, particularly within our network, are a bit below where we might want them. And so we continue to work to get those levels up not only this fiscal year or next year -- fiscal year to meet retail and consumer demand. So I don't expect -- I do expect a hangover in manufacturing absorption. I think the question is how big is the hangover and there might be some benefit or upside there so when you think about manufacturing absorption year-over-year. And then lastly is, as we continue to reshape the portfolio either through divestiture activity or optimizing SKUs, that will also, hopefully, inure to a positive benefit as well to gross profit margin. And then underlying all of that, as you well know, we have a very strong consumer-centric strategy across a lot of our key growth brands. And as we continue to drive that growth, it will also support the gross profit margin as well. So hopefully, that gives you a sense at a big-picture level as to how we're thinking about it."

In the face of unprecedented challenges, we delivered outstanding results. Moreover, we believe the business is at an inflection point, and we are delivering against our strategic and executional plans. We are emerging from the pandemic, along with recent strategic actions, a much stronger company. From the outset of the pandemic, we prioritized the well-being of our employees, funded relief activities for our communities and produced a record amount of products for consumers and their pets. Our people are resilient and moved with speed and agility to adapt our business, all while executing our consumer-centric growth strategy and making progress toward our 4 execution priorities. These are driving commercial excellence, streamlining our cost infrastructure, reshaping our portfolio and unleashing our organization to win. These priorities are essential to position our company for sustainable long-term growth. I'll first share some examples of the progress we are making toward our priorities, before turning to a few highlights from the fourth quarter and our fiscal year 2022 outlook. 
Our first execution priority is driving commercial excellence. Throughout the past year, significant changes in our industry demanded a rethink of CPG commercial models. We adapted our approach to deliver what customers and consumers need and want more efficiently. These changes included standing up a new sales model with 2 distinct teams, 1 focused on pets and the other on our consumer foods and coffee businesses. The benefits from improved in-store execution and leveraging insights, combined with additional advertising and improved reach through new digital media models, have been a driving factor for our market share gains. 
Our new commercial delivery model also includes an increased focus on e-commerce, which, for the full year, accounted for 12% of our U.S. retail net sales. These investments in our commercial capabilities provide a competitive advantage as we partner with retailers. They also enable seamless and highly targeted consumer experiences from awareness to purchase and strong repeat purchasing. 
Consumers remained loyal to our brands as we maintained the 1 million net new households gained in the prior year, while dollars per buyer increased 10%. Over the past year, we increased our marketing investment by nearly $40 million or 8%. Most importantly, we've significantly improved our market share performance, where today, 55% of the brands in our portfolio are growing market share versus 26% 18 months ago. This is the sixth quarter of sequential share performance improvement for our portfolio. 
We also made significant progress on our second priority, to increase focus on profitability and cost discipline. We restructured our corporate support functions, leading to a more lean and agile organization while continuing to optimize our supply chain and maximize network production efficiencies. Full implementation of these initiatives will deliver $50 million of incremental cost savings in each of the next 3 fiscal years. 
One example where we are driving efficiency in our supply chain is with our high-growth Dunkin' Coffee. The pandemic-driven surge in demand required us to increase agility and decrease production downtime and changeover. This led to operational efficiencies and incremental capacity for our coffee production, which supported 21% sales growth for the brand this year. 
Our third execution priority, to reshape our portfolio, supports our strategy of leading in the best categories. We made excellent progress reshaping our portfolio this year having completed our exit of the U.S. baking category with the sale of the oils and shortening business following prior divestitures of the U.S. baking mix and condensed milk businesses. 
In the Pet business, we divested the specialty channel exclusive, Natural Balance brand. These decisions show our commitment to divesting brands and businesses that are no longer consistent with our long-term strategic focus. In turn, this allows us to optimize assortment to maximize productivity, reduce complexity and shift resources to our fastest-growing opportunities. We continue to evaluate opportunities to increase our portfolio's focus in the pet food, coffee and snacking categories. Further, acquisitions will remain a part of our strategic growth, and we will be prudent when considering them, ensuring we focus on appropriate multiples paid and financial returns in their evaluation. 
Our fourth execution priority, unleashing our organization to win, powers the first 3 priorities. The strength of the Smucker culture has always been a unique differentiator in achieving growth and is a critical component of our future. With the impact of my new leadership team, and through the additional organization changes implemented this past year, we are more lean, agile and focused on delivering with excellence and winning in the marketplace. We're also increasing our focus on becoming a more inclusive and diverse company at every level of the organization. 
These 4 priorities are critical to ensuring we maintain our momentum and were critical to our record fiscal 2021 results with full year net sales increasing 3%. Net sales grew 5% when excluding the prior year sales for divested businesses and foreign currency exchange. Fiscal '21 adjusted earnings per share was $9.12, an increase of 4%, exceeding our most recent guidance range of $8.70 to $8.90. Free cash flow was $1.26 billion, above our most recent expectations of $1.1 billion. 
Our strong financial performance accelerated elements of our capital deployment strategy to support increased shareholder value. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders this year in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 19th consecutive year and through share repurchases, reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 5% on a full year basis. And we repaid over $860 million of debt during the fiscal year, strengthening our balance sheet to provide flexibility for a balanced approach to reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. We delivered results ahead of our expectations while accelerating investments for future growth. Net sales declined 8% versus the prior year. Excluding the noncomparable net sales from divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 3% due to lapping the initial stock-up surge related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we are lapping the COVID-19-related demand in the prior year, we believe evaluating results over the prior 2-year period is more meaningful. Adjusting for divestitures, net sales grew at a 2-year CAGR of 4%, demonstrating growth across all 3 of our U.S. Retail segments. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share declined 26%, primarily driven by the decreased sales, $40 million of incremental marketing investments and higher costs, partially offset by higher pricing. 
Turning to our segment results. In pet food, we anticipated sales to be down due to lapping stock-up purchasing in the prior year. Net sales, excluding sales for the divested Natural Balance business, decreased 6% and demonstrated growth on a 2-year basis. While pet food consumption was not materially impacted by at-home versus away-from-home eating trends as in other categories, the pandemic did impact how consumers shop for their pets, such as accelerated growth in e-commerce channels. Also, the total U.S. pet population grew by an estimated high single-digit percentage this past year, with new pet parents showing a willingness to spend more for their pets compared to historical trends. We expect top line growth on a comparable basis for the pet business in fiscal '22, supported by higher pricing, category growth, continued marketing support and innovation for our leading treats portfolio and premium food offerings. 
Turning to our coffee business. Net sales were comparable to the prior year despite lapping the COVID-19 stock-up purchasing and demonstrated growth on a 2-year basis. Consumer adoption of K-Cups continues to grow, with 3 million incremental households purchasing a Keurig machine last year. In the last 52 weeks, retail sales of our brands grew 17%. This was over twice the category rate, and we gained over 1 point of share. Our share gains further accelerated in more recent periods as all our brands continue to grow, including Folgers, Café Bustelo and Dunkin' are the 2 fastest-growing brands in the coffee category. Over the last 52 weeks, Café Bustelo retail sales grew 21% and Dunkin' grew 16%. The Dunkin' brand, representing $1 billion in all-channel retail sales dollars, was a top share gainer in the coffee category, growing nearly triple the total at-home coffee category rate in measured channels over the last 52 weeks. 
The Folgers brand gained 3 million new households at the height of the pandemic and has the highest repeat rate of any brand for new households gained during the pandemic. We will continue to build up this momentum with initiatives to reinvigorate the iconic brand rolling out in the second half of fiscal year '22. As new coffee habits formed during the pandemic, we anticipate retaining a substantial portion of these new consumers for the long term. 
In our Consumer Foods business, net sales decreased due to the Crisco divestiture and increased 1% on a comparable basis and reflected strong growth on a 2-year basis. Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches continued to deliver exceptional growth, with net sales and household penetration each increasing 16% in the quarter. 
For our combined U.S. Retail and Away From Home segments, the Uncrustables brand delivered nearly $130 million of net sales this quarter, recording its 28th consecutive quarter of growth. The brand delivered over $400 million of net sales this year and is on track to exceed our $500 million target in fiscal year 2023. 
Across our retail businesses, we delivered strong financial results this year while significantly increasing investments in our brands, strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders, all of which are key building blocks for supporting long-term growth and increasing shareholder value. 
I'll briefly touch on the current supply chain and cost environments. Our operations have run efficiently, and we have had no material disruptions to date. We continue to monitor global supply chain challenges, specifically as it relates to the availability of transportation, labor and certain materials. Broad-based inflation is impacting many of the commodities, packaging materials and transportation channels that are important to our business. We are mitigating the impact through a combination of higher pricing inclusive of list price increases, reduced trade and net revenue optimization strategies as well as continued cost management. We have recently implemented net price increases across all business segments, with most becoming effective during the month of July. Let me now provide additional details on our outlook for fiscal 2022. 
As the U.S. emerges from the pandemic, we believe elevated at-home consumption for our brands will continue into fiscal 2022. Our confidence is supported by the increased pet population; elevated work from home, benefiting breakfast and lunch occasions; and consumers' investments in at-home brewing equipment. Lapping sales from divested businesses will have a material impact on year-over-year net sales growth in fiscal 2022. When excluding the noncomparable net sales, we anticipate top line growth supported by higher net pricing, the continued momentum of our brands and a significant recovery in our Away From Home business. Year-over-year earnings per share is expected to decline. 
The growth in comparable sales and benefits from cost savings programs are anticipated to be more than offset by the impact of higher costs and the timing of pricing actions as well as the loss of earnings from divestitures. On a 2-year basis, we expect growth for both comparable net sales as well as adjusted EPS as we continue to demonstrate underlying growth for the business. 
Finally, as we emerge from the pandemic with a heightened focus on health and wellness, we remain dedicated to having a positive impact on our employees, our communities and our planet. This includes supporting the quality of life for people and pets; strengthening the communities we serve, both locally and globally; and ensuring a positive impact on our planet with a focus on sustainable and ethical sourcing. We look forward to sharing more details, including the achievement of our 2020 environmental targets and information regarding our new ESG goals when we release our corporate impact report this summer. 
In summary, I would like to reinforce 3 key points. First, we continue to deliver strong financial results; and our actions to deliver our priorities are leading to improvement in key metrics, including market share that position us well for the future. Second, we are reshaping our portfolio to increase our focus on faster growth opportunities within pet food, coffee and snacking. And finally, we are sharpening our focus on cost management and becoming a more efficient and agile organization. 
We are exiting this pandemic a stronger company and our actions taken over the previous year support consistent delivery of long-term growth and shareholder value. This will be achieved by leveraging our strong portfolio of brands and world-class commercial capabilities, all of which are powered by our unique culture and dedicated employees, who I would like to thank again for their outstanding contributions. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tucker."

Net sales decreased 8%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 3%. This was primarily driven by unfavorable volume mix due to lapping the prior year stock up during the beginning of the pandemic, most notably for pet food and our Canadian baking business. Higher net price realization was a 1 percentage point benefit, primarily driven by peanut butter and our pet business. 
Adjusted gross profit decreased $79 million or 10% from the prior year. This was mostly driven by unfavorable volume mix, the noncomparable impact of the divested businesses and higher costs, partially offset by the higher net pricing. Adjusted operating income decreased $120 million or 28%, reflecting a decreased gross profit and higher SD&A expenses. The increase in SD&A expense was primarily driven by increased marketing investments and incentive compensation, partially offset by reduced selling and distribution costs. 
Below operating income, interest expense decreased $3 million, and the adjusted effective income tax rate was 23.3% compared to 23.4% in the prior year. Factoring all this in, along with share repurchases that resulted in a weighted average shares outstanding of 108.9 million, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.89. 
I'll now turn to fourth quarter segment results. Beginning with U.S. Retail Pet Foods, net sales decreased 12% versus the prior year. Excluding the non-comparable net sales for the divested Natural Balance business, net sales decreased 6% versus the prior year. Net sales grew at a 2% CAGR on a 2-year basis, excluding the divestiture. 
Dog snacks continued to perform well, decreasing just 1% in the fourth quarter after growth of 12% in the prior year; cat food decreased 4% following 18% growth in the prior year; dog food net sales decreased 15%, reflecting anticipated declines versus the prior year. Pet Foods segment profit declined 32%, primarily reflecting lower volume mix, increased marketing investments and increased freight and transportation costs, partially offset by higher net pricing. 
Turning to the coffee segment. Net sales were comparable to the prior year and increased 5% on a 2-year CAGR basis. The Dunkin' and Café Bustelo brands grew 10% and 18%, respectively, offset by a 7% decline for the Folgers brand, which benefited the most from consumer stocking up on coffee in the prior year. 
For our K-Cup portfolio, net sales increased 14% and accounted for over 30% of the segment's net sales with growth across each brand in the portfolio. Coffee segment profit decreased 9%, primarily driven by increased marketing expense. 
In Consumer Foods, net sales decreased 13%. Excluding the prior year noncomparable net sales for the divested Crisco business, net sales increased 1%. On a 2-year CAGR basis, net sales, excluding the divestiture, grew at a 9% rate. The fourth quarter comparable net sales increase relative to the prior year was driven by higher net pricing of 4%, primarily due to a list price increase for peanut butter in the second quarter, partially offset by unfavorable volume mix of 3%. Growth was led by the Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches, which grew 16%. 
Consumer Foods segment profit decreased 29%, primarily reflecting the noncomparable profit from the divested Crisco business, higher cost and increased marketing expense, partially offset by the higher net pricing. 
Lastly, in International & Away From Home, net sales declined 7%. Excluding the prior year noncomparable net sales for the divested Crisco business, net sales declined 5%. The Away From Home business increased 7% on a comparable net sales basis, primarily driven by increases in portion control products. International declines of 15% on a comparable net sales basis were primarily driven by declines in baking, partially offset by pet food and snacks. On a comparable 2-year CAGR basis, net sales for the combined businesses declined at a rate of 2%. Overall, International & Away From Home segment profit decreased 30%, primarily driven by lower volume mix, partially offset by a net benefit of price and costs and favorable foreign currency exchange. 
Fourth quarter free cash flow was $183 million. An increase in cash provided by operating activities was more than offset by a $31.6 million increase in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $108 million, with the increase over the prior year primarily related to the capacity expansion for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches. On a full year basis, free cash flow was $1.26 billion, with capital expenditures of $307 million representing 3.8% of net sales. In the fourth quarter, repurchases of 1.5 million common shares settled for $174 million. Over the course of the fiscal year, we repurchased 5.8 million shares for $678 million, reducing our outstanding share count by approximately 5%. We finished the year with cash and cash equivalent balances of $334 million compared to the prior year-end of $391 million. We paid down $84 million of debt during the quarter and $866 million for the full year, ending the year with a gross debt balance of $4.8 billion. Based on a trailing 12-month EBITDA of approximately $1.8 [ billion ], our leverage ratio stands at 2.6x. 
We anticipate maintaining a strong balance sheet and leverage ratio enabling a balanced capital deployment model, which includes strategic reinvestment in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions while returning cash to shareholders through increasing dividends and evaluating share repurchases over time. Let me now provide additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2022. 
The pandemic and related implications, along with cost inflation and volatility in supply chains, continues to cause uncertainty for the fiscal year 2022 outlook. Any manufacturing or supply chain disruption as well as changes in consumer mobility and purchasing behavior, retailer inventory levels and macroeconomic conditions could materially impact actual results. We continue to focus on managing the elements we can control, including taking the necessary steps to minimize the impact of cost inflation and any business disruption. As always, we will continue to plan for unforeseen volatility while ensuring we have contingency plans in place. This guidance reflects performance expectations based on the company's current understanding of the overall environment. 
Net sales are expected to decrease 2% to 3% compared to the prior year, including lapping of sales from the divested Crisco and Natural Balance businesses. On a comparable basis, net sales are expected to increase approximately 2% at the midpoint of the sales guidance range. This reflects benefits from higher pricing actions across multiple categories, primarily to recover increased commodity and input costs, along with continued double-digit sales growth for the Smucker's Uncrustables brand and a recovery in Away From Home channels, partially offset by a deceleration in at-home consumption trends. 
We anticipate full year gross profit margin of 37% to 37.5%, which reflects an 85 basis point decline at the midpoint versus the prior year. This factors in higher net pricing effective in the month of July, along with cost and productivity savings and a mix benefit associated with the divestitures. This will be more than offset by higher costs experienced throughout the full year. These cost increases are driven by a high single-digit increase from commodities, ingredients and packaging. 
SD&A expenses are projected to be favorable by approximately 4%, reflecting savings generated by cost management and organizational restructuring programs; a reset of incentive compensation and total marketing spend of 6% to 6.5% of net sales, which reflects a step down from fiscal year 2021, partially driven by programs that were pulled forward into the fourth quarter. We anticipate net interest expense of approximately $170 million and an adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 24%, along with a full year weighted average share count of 108.3 million. Taking all these factors into consideration, we anticipate full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.20. 
At the midpoint of our guidance range, year-over-year adjusted EPS is anticipated to decline 2%, mostly attributable to around a $0.20 net impact of divested earnings and the timing of benefits from shares repurchased. Approximately 1/3 of the share repurchase benefit was recognized in fiscal 2021. The adjusted earnings per share guidance further reflects benefits from the increase in comparable net sales, primarily due to pricing actions, along with the company's cost management and organizational restructuring programs, which are expected to fully offset higher commodity, ingredient and packaging costs and the timing of input cost recovery. Given the timing of cost increases and recovery through higher net pricing as well as a shift in timing of marketing expenses, earnings are anticipated to decline in the first half of the fiscal year, most notably in the first quarter with an anticipated decrease of over 20%. We project free cash flow of approximately $900 million with capital expenditures of $380 million for the year. The increase for capital expenditures primarily relates to capacity expansion for Smucker's Uncrustables. 
Other key assumptions affecting cash flow include depreciation expense of $230 million; amortization expense of $220 million; share-based compensation expense of $35 million; and restructuring costs of $25 million, which includes $15 million of noncash charges. On a 2-year basis, our full year guidance reflects net sales, excluding divestitures, to grow at a 3% to 4% CAGR and modest adjusted earnings per share growth at the midpoint of the guidance range. The 2-year growth reflects the recovery of earnings related to the divested businesses through both organic growth and shares repurchased and accounts for the lapping of the unprecedented stock-up purchasing during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In closing, I am incredibly proud of our employees who continue to deliver exceptional financial results. Because of their dedication, our business has strong momentum, and we've positioned ourselves better than ever to serve the needs of consumers and their pets. With continued financial discipline, we are committed to delivering sustainable and consistent long-term value for our shareholders.

We're intending on being up about 2% at the midpoint of our guidance range. That growth is predominantly driven by the benefits of higher net price realization that we will see in the second quarter and beyond for the balance of the fiscal year. But underlying that, we do see some organic growth through our portfolio as you think about the continued momentum of the Uncrustables brand within the consumer business, as you think about the advancement of both Café Bustelo and Dunkin' and coffee and then you also think about the performance of our pet snacks business within the pet portfolio. And then we are anticipating on seeing a return of growth within the Away From Home business, which we experienced in the fourth quarter. 
And then I would also share that despite the continued at-home consumption that we intend to experience, we are also factoring in a deceleration there as well that is factored into our top line, along with some price elasticities due to the increase that we are taking throughout the portfolio on the price front. So that's how we're seeing the composition of the top line at this point. 
I'll pause and see if Mark has anything else on the strategic front."

That adds, again, very rough math, 1.5% or so to your volume. And that, I guess, would imply that the rest of your business will be down maybe closer to mid-single digit, which doesn't really seem that aggressive to me. So I just wanted to make sure that I'm thinking about that math in the right way that really for coffee and pet and everything, excluding Uncrustables, you are kind of considering something in that low, maybe closer to the mid-single-digit volume mix decline for this year."

I think in consumer, what we are seeing is continued growth across the Uncrustables brand, as you've noted. I think what you're seeing is continued momentum in the Spreads business, but that should be down year-over-year just due to the lapping of the unprecedented year. And then you come into the coffee portfolio. We should continue to see growth and strength in the Café Bustelo and Dunkin' Brands, but you will see a deceleration in the Folgers brand because of just the intense stock up in consumption throughout the year, but we still believe in the strength of that brand and its underlying performance. 
As you come into the pet category, we should continue to demonstrate growth in pet snacks across that portfolio and then continue to work through the performance not only on Meow Mix and its delivery, but also in the stabilization of just the overall dog food portfolio. And so what we have thought about in crafting the volume mix side of this is, is just, one, the year-over-year impact of just deceleration in at-home consumption. What we've also considered is how we can continue to advance the momentum in the business due to what we've captured through the pandemic. And then lastly is that we just acknowledge that we've had to take into effect some price elasticities as we've taken pricing across basically the entire portfolio. 
And then lastly, as I don't want to leave out the Away From Home or Canadian businesses, but we intend, particularly for Away From home to come back to growth. We're kind of anticipating that growth return to get to kind of 80% to 90% of pre-pandemic levels."

Candidly, we've gotten it from some others. So hopefully, it helps clarify for the whole group. 
What likely you read in the press release and our supplemental pages in the back is our reconciliation table. And when we have the line item that says Derivative Gains and Losses, that is not a new line item in our guidance table. It has been a consistent approach over the years. And what we attempted to do this year was improve the financial reporting disclosure on that line item. So I would encourage you and others to read the footnote there that fully describes what that line item is. And again, it's consistency over time. 
But more specific to your question, you're likely referring to the $0.43 benefit. What that is, is it's unallocated derivative activity, both hedging gains and losses that are held at corporate that will ultimately be released during the upcoming financial period in order to match a future cost.

And we have taken pricing action that will be reflected in the month of July, but really is having a 3 quarters impact. And so as a result of that, 60% of the pricing benefit that we're seeing is really coming in the back half of the fiscal year. And so as a result of that, matching of the cost and the price recovery, we are seeing the impact on the gross profit margin, not only for the first quarter, to your point, but also for the front half of the fiscal year with improvement in the back half of the fiscal year. And so to your point, you will see the gross profit diminution in Q1 and to some extent, in Q2, and then you'll see the recovery in Q3 and 4."

We're also seeing the continued benefit of the momentum across the various elements of our business that I've spoken to, whether it be Uncrustables or advancing Dunkin' and Café Bustelo or the advancement of cat food. 
And then as Mark spoke on the inventory front, we will continue to work to get to the right inventory levels, both within our infrastructure and also within our customers. And we will continue to do that over time. But I think the first half of the fiscal year, inventory levels will still be pretty lean just as we work through supply chains that continue to remain a bit tight, but yet are still working supply chain. So that's kind of how we're thinking about that growth on a 2-year stack basis. 
I might just share that we are seeing performance coming through on that 2-year stack basis across the predominance of our U.S. retail businesses, all 3, along with a return to growth in the Away From Home business.

So I won't go into specifics on specific wins, but we're already seeing a higher degree of focus, a stronger degree of strategic engagement with our customers because, as you know, they think about pet as a separate category as well. And so our engagement with our retail customers is really critical, and we're already starting to see the benefit of that. 
Our pet strategy, you will recall, is focused, first and foremost, on pet snacks, the premiumization of Milk Bone, the launch of other new products in snacks under the Meow Mix and Nutrish brands. So continuing to push out our leadership position in snacks. We have a #2 position in cats, and we will continue. We've had good performance over the course of the year in Meow Mix. And we will continue to support the brands in cats through traditional means as well as innovation. And then in our dog portfolio, we continue to focus on the stabilization of the Nutrish brand, which is going reasonably well, expecting some modest growth over time on that brand. But Nutrish for us is really a total master brand strategy. So it is not just dog food. It is snacks as well as cat and wet dog as well. And so making -- in which -- in those cases, those segments, we would expect to grow faster than our dry dog food on Nutrish.

The first thing I would say is we spent a tremendous amount of effort this past year, making sure that we come out of this pandemic a stronger company. And so that really means that focusing on the actions that we are taking and whether that's ensuring that we can retain as many of the new consumers as we gained ensuring that we can continue to invest in marketing and in those areas where we're going to see the most growth and ensuring that we can engage with the new consumers. And the proof points thus far have been that we have continued to see solid share gains as well as repeat purchase. The external factors and the tailwinds that are going to continue to help us is our expectation and what you're seeing across industries is that folks are not going back to work in the way they once did. So there is going to be some hybrid approach. Our own company is no exception on how often folks are physically in an office versus at home. And the people are going to be spending more time at home, which means they're going to be treating their pets more. And in particular, because we're in -- our coffee and consumer categories are focused primarily on breakfast and lunch. Those 2 eating occasions are going to continue to take place at home at a more elevated pace. So we think those tailwinds are going to continue to help more pet households and just more people brewing coffee at home or just a couple of examples of how we should continue to benefit from some of those external tailwinds."

The pet and consumer growth that we're talking about is -- again, it's low single digits. The coffee, as I've noted, is consistent year-over-year. And when you think about the International & Away From Home segment, that's probably in a mid-single-digit plus just due to that recovery in Away From Home.

And then Mark can talk a little bit more about the pricing component or dynamic. But we still, at big picture, remain committed to that greater-than-30% coffee margins at the segment level. We anticipate seeing a minor deceleration year-over-year but still staying at pretty strong margins in coffee on a full year basis. But as I noted in some of my prior comments, there's a bit of timing of the pricing actions that we're taking that will really be effective in the month of July and kind of realized in Q2, 3 and 4 against a cost structure that's coming right in front of us in Q1. And so you likely will see a pretty substantial margin decline in coffee in the first quarter with a nice rebound in the second, third and fourth quarters. But again, still supporting that low 30% on a year-over-year basis. So I'll pause there and hand it to Mark just on the pricing front."

And then, I guess, the only other comment I would make about coffee is we have been very successful in our strategy to ensure that our portfolio tracks with the category. In other words, the growth of Dunkin' and Bustelo has been phenomenal, and that was -- that's been intentional because we know that there's been continued premiumization. And then, of course, the shift to single-serve or K-Cups, our brands outperformed the category in this last quarter. And so we feel very good about where the total portfolio is positioned.

In the face of unprecedented challenges, we delivered outstanding results. Moreover, we believe the business is at an inflection point, and we are delivering against our strategic and executional plans. 
We are emerging from the pandemic, along with recent strategic actions, a much stronger company. From the outset of the pandemic, we prioritized the well-being of our employees, funded relief activities for our communities and produced a record amount of products for consumers and their pets. 
Our people are resilient and moved with speed and agility to adapt our business, all while executing our consumer-centric growth strategy and making progress towards our 4 execution priorities. These are: driving commercial excellence, streamlining our cost infrastructure, reshaping our portfolio and unleashing our organization to win. These priorities are essential to position our company for sustainable long-term growth. 
I'll first share some examples of the progress we are making toward our priorities, before turning to a few highlights from the fourth quarter and our fiscal year 2022 outlook. Our first execution priority is driving commercial excellence. Throughout the past year, significant changes in our industry demanded a rethink of CPG commercial models. We adapted our approach to deliver what customers and consumers need and want more efficiently. 
These changes included standing up a new sales model with 2 distinct teams, one focused on pets and the other on our consumer foods and coffee businesses. The benefits from improved in-store execution and leveraging insights, combined with additional advertising and improved reach through new digital media models, have been a driving factor for our market share gains.  
Our new commercial delivery model also includes an increased focus on e-commerce, which, for the full year, accounted for 12% of our U.S. Retail net sales. These investments in our commercial capabilities provide a competitive advantage as we partner with retailers. They also enable seamless and highly targeted consumer experiences, from awareness to purchase, and strong repeat purchasing.  
Consumers remained loyal to our brands as we maintained the 1 million net new households gained in the prior year, while dollars per buyer increased 10%. Over the past year, we increased our marketing investment by nearly $40 million or 8%. Most importantly, we've significantly improved our market share performance, where, today, 55% of the brands in our portfolio are growing market share versus 26% 18 months ago. This is the sixth quarter of sequential share performance improvement for our portfolio.  
We also made significant progress on our second priority, to increase focus on profitability and cost discipline. We restructured our corporate support functions, leading to a more lean and agile organization, while continuing to optimize our supply chain and maximize network production efficiencies. Full implementation of these initiatives will deliver $50 million of incremental cost savings in each of the next 3 fiscal years.  
One example where we are driving efficiency in our supply chain is with our high-growth Dunkin' Coffee. The pandemic-driven surge in demand required us to increase agility and decrease production downtime and changeover. This led to operational efficiencies and incremental capacity for our coffee production, which supported 21% sales growth for the brand this year.  
Our third execution priority, to reshape our portfolio, supports our strategy of leading in the best categories. We made excellent progress reshaping our portfolio this year, having completed our exit of the U.S. baking category with the sale of the oils and shortening business, following prior divestitures of the U.S. baking mix and condensed milk businesses.  
In the pet business, we divested the specialty channel exclusive, Natural Balance brand. These decisions show our commitment to divesting brands and businesses that are no longer consistent with our long-term strategic focus. In turn, this allows us to optimize assortment to maximize productivity, reduce complexity and shift resources to our fastest-growing opportunities. 
We continue to evaluate opportunities to increase our portfolio's focus in the Pet Food, Coffee and Snacking categories. Further, acquisitions will remain a part of our strategic growth, and we will be prudent when considering them, ensuring we focus on appropriate multiples paid and financial returns in their evaluation.  
Our fourth execution priority, unleashing our organization to win, powers the first 3 priorities. The strength of the Smucker culture has always been a unique differentiator in achieving growth and is a critical component of our future. 
With the impact of my new leadership team, and through the additional organization changes implemented this past year, we are more lean, agile and focused on delivering with excellence and winning in the marketplace. We're also increasing our focus on becoming a more inclusive and diverse company at every level of the organization.  
These 4 priorities are critical to ensuring we maintain our momentum and were critical to our record fiscal 2021 results, with full year net sales increasing 3%. Net sales grew 5% when excluding the prior year sales for divested businesses and foreign currency exchange. Fiscal '21 adjusted earnings per share was $9.12, an increase of 4%, exceeding our most recent guidance range of $8.70 to $8.90. Free cash flow was $1.26 billion, above our most recent expectations of $1.1 billion.  
Our strong financial performance accelerated elements of our capital deployment strategy to support increased shareholder value. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders this year in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 19th consecutive year and, through share repurchases, reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 5% on a full year basis. And we repaid over $860 million of debt during the fiscal year, strengthening our balance sheet to provide flexibility for a balanced approach to reinvesting in the business and returning cash to shareholders.  
Turning to the fourth quarter. We delivered results ahead of our expectations, while accelerating investments for future growth. Net sales declined 8% versus the prior year. Excluding the noncomparable net sales from divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 3% due to lapping the initial stock-up surge related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we are lapping the COVID-19-related demand in the prior year, we believe evaluating results over the prior 2-year period is more meaningful. 
Adjusting for divestitures, net sales grew at a 2-year CAGR of 4%, demonstrating growth across all 3 of our U.S. Retail segments. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share declined 26%, primarily driven by the decreased sales, $40 million of incremental marketing investments and higher costs, partially offset by higher pricing.  
Turning to our segment results. In Pet Food, we anticipated sales to be down due to lapping stock-up purchasing in the prior year. Net sales, excluding sales for the divested Natural Balance business, decreased 6% and demonstrated growth on a 2-year basis. While pet food consumption was not materially impacted by at-home versus away-from-home eating trends, as in other categories, the pandemic did impact how consumers shop for their pets, such as accelerated growth in e-commerce channels. 
Also, the total U.S. pet population grew by an estimated high single-digit percentage this past year, with new pet parents showing a willingness to spend more for their pets compared to historical trends. We expect top line growth on a comparable basis for the pet business in fiscal '22, supported by higher pricing, category growth, continued marketing support and innovation for our leading treats portfolio and premium food offerings.  
Turning to our Coffee business. Net sales were comparable to the prior year despite lapping the COVID-19 stock-up purchasing and demonstrated growth on a 2-year basis. Consumer adoption of K-Cups continues to grow, with 3 million incremental households purchasing a Keurig machine last year. In the last 52 weeks, retail sales of our brands grew 17%. This was over twice the category rate, and we gained over 1 point of share. 
Our share gains further accelerated in more recent periods as all our brands continue to grow, including Folgers. Café Bustelo and Dunkin' are the 2 fastest-growing brands in the coffee category. Over the last 52 weeks, Café Bustelo retail sales grew 21% and Dunkin' grew 16%. The Dunkin' brand, representing $1 billion in all channel retail sales dollars, was a top share gainer in the coffee category, growing nearly triple the total at-home coffee category rate in measured channels over the last 52 weeks.  
The Folgers brand gained 3 million new households at the height of the pandemic and has the highest repeat rate of any brand for new households gained during the pandemic. We will continue to build up this momentum with initiatives to reinvigorate the iconic brand rolling out in the second half of fiscal year '22. As new coffee habits formed during the pandemic, we anticipate retaining a substantial portion of these new consumers for the long term.  
In our Consumer Foods business, net sales decreased due to the Crisco divestiture and increased 1% on a comparable basis and reflected strong growth on a 2-year basis. Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches continued to deliver exceptional growth, with net sales and household penetration each increasing 16% in the quarter. For our combined U.S. Retail and Away From Home segments, the Uncrustables brand delivered nearly $130 million of net sales this quarter, recording its 28th consecutive quarter of growth. 
The brand delivered over $400 million of net sales this year and is on track to exceed our $500 million target in fiscal year 2023. Across our Retail businesses, we delivered strong financial results this year, while significantly increasing investments in our brands, strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders, all of which are key building blocks for supporting long-term growth and increasing shareholder value.  
I'll briefly touch on the current supply chain and cost environments. Our operations have run efficiently, and we have had no material disruptions to date. We continue to monitor global supply chain challenges, specifically as it relates to the availability of transportation, labor and certain materials. 
Broad-based inflation is impacting many of the commodities, packaging materials and transportation channels that are important to our business. We are mitigating the impact through a combination of higher pricing inclusive of list price increases, reduced trade and net revenue optimization strategies as well as continued cost management. We have recently implemented net price increases across all business segments, with most becoming effective during the month of July. 
Let me now provide additional details on our outlook for fiscal 2022. As the U.S. emerges from the pandemic, we believe elevated at-home consumption for our brands will continue into fiscal 2022. Our confidence is supported by the increased pet population; elevated work from home, benefiting breakfast and lunch occasions; and consumers' investments in at-home brewing equipment. 
Lapping sales from divested businesses will have a material impact on year-over-year net sales growth in fiscal 2022. When excluding the noncomparable net sales, we anticipate top line growth supported by higher net pricing, the continued momentum of our brands and a significant recovery in our Away From Home business. Year-over-year earnings per share is expected to decline.  
The growth in comparable sales and benefits from cost savings programs are anticipated to be more than offset by the impact of higher costs and the timing of pricing actions as well as the loss of earnings from divestitures. On a 2-year basis, we expect growth for both comparable net sales as well as adjusted EPS as we continue to demonstrate underlying growth for the business.  
Finally, as we emerge from the pandemic with a heightened focus on health and wellness, we remain dedicated to having a positive impact on our employees, our communities and our planet. This includes supporting the quality of life for people and pets, strengthening the communities we serve, both locally and globally, and ensuring a positive impact on our planet with a focus on sustainable and ethical sourcing. We look forward to sharing more details, including the achievement of our 2020 environmental targets and information regarding our new ESG goals when we release our corporate impact report this summer.  
In summary, I would like to reinforce 3 key points. First, we continue to deliver strong financial results, and our actions to deliver our priorities are leading to improvement in key metrics, including market share, that position us well for the future. Second, we are reshaping our portfolio to increase our focus on faster growth opportunities within Pet Food, Coffee and Snacking. And finally, we are sharpening our focus on cost management and becoming a more efficient and agile organization.  
We are exiting this pandemic a stronger company, and our actions taken over the previous year support consistent delivery of long-term growth and shareholder value. This will be achieved by leveraging our strong portfolio of brands and world-class commercial capabilities, all of which are powered by our unique culture and dedicated employees, who I would like to thank again for their outstanding contributions.  
I'll now turn the call over to Tucker."

I'll begin by giving an overview of fourth quarter results, which finished above our expectations, then I'll provide additional details on our financial outlook for fiscal 2022.  
Net sales decreased 8%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 3%. This was primarily driven by unfavorable volume/mix due to lapping the prior year stock-up during the beginning of the pandemic, most notably for Pet Food and our Canadian Baking business. Higher net price realization was a 1 percentage point benefit, primarily driven by peanut butter and our pet business. 
Adjusted gross profit decreased $79 million or 10% from the prior year. This was mostly driven by unfavorable volume/mix, the noncomparable impact of the divested businesses and higher costs, partially offset by the higher net pricing. Adjusted operating income decreased $120 million or 28%, reflecting a decreased gross profit and higher SD&A expenses. The increase in SD&A expense was primarily driven by increased marketing investments and incentive compensation, partially offset by reduced selling and distribution costs.  
Below operating income, interest expense decreased $3 million, and the adjusted effective income tax rate was 23.3% compared to 23.4% in the prior year. Factoring all this in, along with share repurchases that resulted in a weighted average shares outstanding of 108.9 million, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.89.  
I'll now turn to fourth quarter segment results. Beginning with U.S. Retail Pet Foods, net sales decreased 12% versus the prior year. Excluding the noncomparable net sales for the divested Natural Balance business, net sales decreased 6% versus the prior year. Net sales grew at a 2% CAGR on a 2-year basis, excluding the divestiture.  
Dog snacks continue to perform well, decreasing just 1% in the fourth quarter after growth of 12% in the prior year. Cat food decreased 4%, following 18% growth in the prior year. Dog food net sales decreased 15%, reflecting anticipated declines versus the prior year. Pet Foods segment profit declined 32%, primarily reflecting lower volume/mix, increased marketing investments and increased freight and transportation costs, partially offset by higher net pricing.  
Turning to the Coffee segment. Net sales were comparable to the prior year and increased 5% on a 2-year CAGR basis. The Dunkin' and Café Bustelo brands grew 10% and 18%, respectively, offset by a 7% decline for the Folgers brand, which benefited the most from consumer stocking up on coffee in the prior year. For our K-Cup portfolio, net sales increased 14% and accounted for over 30% of the segment's net sales, with growth across each brand in the portfolio. Coffee segment profit decreased 9%, primarily driven by increased marketing expense.  
In Consumer Foods, net sales decreased 13%. Excluding the prior year noncomparable net sales for the divested Crisco business, net sales increased 1%. On a 2-year CAGR basis, net sales, excluding the divestiture, grew at a 9% rate. The fourth quarter comparable net sales increase relative to the prior year was driven by higher net pricing of 4%, primarily due to a list price increase for peanut butter in the second quarter, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix of 3%. Growth was led by the Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches, which grew 16%. Consumer Foods segment profit decreased 29%, primarily reflecting the noncomparable profit from the divested Crisco business, higher costs and increased marketing expense, partially offset by the higher net pricing.  
Lastly, in International and Away From Home, net sales declined 7%. Excluding the prior year noncomparable net sales for the divested Crisco business, net sales declined 5%. The Away From Home business increased 7% on a comparable net sales basis, primarily driven by increases in portion control products. International declines of 15% on a comparable net sales basis were primarily driven by declines in baking, partially offset by pet food and snacks. 
On a comparable 2-year CAGR basis, net sales for the combined businesses declined at a rate of 2%. Overall, International and Away From Home segment profit decreased 30%, primarily driven by lower volume/mix, partially offset by a net benefit of price and costs and favorable foreign currency exchange.  
Fourth quarter free cash flow was $183 million. An increase in cash provided by operating activities was more than offset by a $31.6 million increase in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $108 million, with the increase over the prior year primarily related to the capacity expansion for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches. On a full year basis, free cash flow was $1.26 billion, with capital expenditures of $307 million representing 3.8% of net sales. 
In the fourth quarter, repurchases of 1.5 million common shares settled for $174 million. Over the course of the fiscal year, we repurchased 5.8 million shares for $678 million, reducing our outstanding share count by approximately 5%. We finished the year with cash and cash equivalent balances of $334 million compared to the prior year-end of $391 million. We paid down $84 million of debt during the quarter and $866 million for the full year, ending the year with a gross debt balance of $4.8 billion. 
Based on a trailing 12-month EBITDA of approximately $1.8 billion, our leverage ratio stands at 2.6x. We anticipate maintaining a strong balance sheet and leverage ratio, enabling a balanced capital deployment model, which includes strategic reinvestment in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions, while returning cash to shareholders through increasing dividends and evaluating share repurchases over time. 
Let me now provide additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2022. The pandemic and related implications, along with cost inflation and volatility in supply chains, continues to cause uncertainty for the fiscal year 2022 outlook. Any manufacturing or supply chain disruption, as well as changes in consumer mobility and purchasing behavior, retailer inventory levels and macroeconomic conditions, could materially impact actual results. 
We continue to focus on managing the elements we can control, including taking the necessary steps to minimize the impact of cost inflation and any business disruption. As always, we will continue to plan for unforeseen volatility, while ensuring we have contingency plans in place. This guidance reflects performance expectations based on the company's current understanding of the overall environment.  
Net sales are expected to decrease 2% to 3% compared to the prior year, including lapping of sales from the divested Crisco and Natural Balance businesses. On a comparable basis, net sales are expected to increase approximately 2% at the midpoint of the sales guidance range. This reflects benefits from higher pricing actions across multiple categories, primarily to recover increased commodity and input costs, along with continued double-digit sales growth for the Smucker's Uncrustables brand and a recovery in Away From Home channels, partially offset by a deceleration in at-home consumption trends.  
We anticipate full year gross profit margin of 37% to 37.5%, which reflects an 85 basis point decline at the midpoint versus the prior year. This factors in higher net pricing effective in the month of July, along with cost and productivity savings, and a mix benefit associated with the divestitures. This will be more than offset by higher costs experienced throughout the full year. These cost increases are driven by a high single-digit increase from commodities, ingredients and packaging.  
SD&A expenses are projected to be favorable by approximately 4%, reflecting savings generated by cost management and organizational restructuring programs, a reset of incentive compensation and total marketing spend of 6% to 6.5% of net sales, which reflects a step down from fiscal year 2021, partially driven by programs that were pulled forward into the fourth quarter. We anticipate net interest expense of approximately $170 million and an adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 24%, along with a full year weighted average share count of 108.3 million. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we anticipate full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.10. At the midpoint of our guidance range, year-over-year adjusted EPS is anticipated to decline 2%, mostly attributable to around a $0.20 net impact of divested earnings and the timing of benefits from shares repurchased. Approximately 1/3 of the share repurchase benefit was recognized in fiscal 2021. 
The adjusted earnings per share guidance further reflects benefits from the increase in comparable net sales, primarily due to pricing actions, along with the company's cost management and organizational restructuring programs, which are expected to fully offset higher commodity, ingredient and packaging costs and the timing of input cost recovery. Given the timing of cost increases and recovery through higher net pricing, as well as a shift in timing of marketing expenses, earnings are anticipated to decline in the first half of the fiscal year, most notably in the first quarter, with an anticipated decrease of over 20%. 
We project free cash flow of approximately $900 million, with capital expenditures of $380 million for the year. The increase for capital expenditures primarily relates to capacity expansion for Smucker's Uncrustables. Other key assumptions affecting cash flow include: depreciation expense of $230 million; amortization expense of $220 million; share-based compensation expense of $35 million; and restructuring costs of $25 million, which includes $15 million of noncash charges. 
On a 2-year basis, our full year guidance reflects net sales, excluding divestitures, to grow at a 3% to 4% CAGR and modest adjusted earnings per share growth at the midpoint of the guidance range. The 2-year growth reflects the recovery of earnings related to the divested businesses through both organic growth and shares repurchased and accounts for the lapping of the unprecedented stock-up purchasing during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
In closing, I am incredibly proud of our employees who continue to deliver exceptional financial results. Because of their dedication, our business has strong momentum, and we've positioned ourselves better than ever to serve the needs of consumers and their pets. With continued financial discipline, we are committed to delivering sustainable and consistent long-term value for our shareholders.

We're intending on being up about 2% at the midpoint of our guidance range. That growth is predominantly driven by the benefits of higher net price realization that we will see in the second quarter and beyond for the balance of the fiscal year. 
But underlying that, we do see some organic growth through our portfolio as you think about the continued momentum of the Uncrustables brand within the consumer business, as you think about the advancement of both Café Bustelo and Dunkin' and coffee, and then you also think about the performance of our pet snacks business within the pet portfolio. And then we are anticipating on seeing a return of growth within the Away From Home business, which we experienced in the fourth quarter.  
And then I would also share that, despite the continued at-home consumption that we intend to experience, we are also factoring in a deceleration there as well that is factored into our top line, along with some price elasticities due to the increase that we are taking throughout the portfolio on the price front. So that's how we're seeing the composition of the top line at this point.  
I'll pause and see if Mark has anything else on the strategic front."

I think you said to expect it to be down low single digits. But when I look at it, you're guiding to a pretty big increase in Uncrustables, maybe over $100 million. That adds, again, very rough math, 1.5% or so to your volume. 
And that, I guess, would imply that the rest of your business will be down maybe closer to mid-single digit, which doesn't really seem that aggressive to me. So I just wanted to make sure that I'm thinking about that math in the right way that, really, for coffee and pet and everything, excluding Uncrustables, you are kind of considering something in that low, maybe closer to the mid-single-digit volume/mix decline for this year?"

Ken, I would break it down this way and maybe just take it by each of the businesses to help you answer your question. I think in consumer, what we are seeing is continued growth across the Uncrustables brand, as you've noted. I think what you're seeing is continued momentum in the spreads business, but that should be down year-over-year just due to the lapping of the unprecedented year. 
And then you come into the coffee portfolio. We should continue to see growth and strength in the Café Bustelo and Dunkin' Brands, but you will see a deceleration in the Folgers brand because of just the intense stock-up in consumption throughout the year. But we still believe in the strength of that brand and its underlying performance.  
As you come into the pet category, we should continue to demonstrate growth in pet snacks across that portfolio and then continue to work through the performance, not only on Meow Mix and its delivery, but also in the stabilization of just the overall dog food portfolio. And so what we have thought about in crafting the volume/mix side of this is, is just, one, the year-over-year impact of just deceleration in at-home consumption. 
What we've also considered is how we can continue to advance the momentum in the business due to what we've captured through the pandemic. And then lastly is that we just acknowledge that we've had to take into effect some price elasticities as we've taken pricing across basically the entire portfolio. 
And then lastly, as I don't want to leave out the Away From Home or Canadian businesses, but we intend, particularly for Away From Home, to come back to growth. We're kind of anticipating that growth return to get to kind of 80% to 90% of pre-pandemic levels."

And what we attempted to do this year was improve the financial reporting disclosure on that line item. So I would encourage you and others to read the footnote there that fully describes what that line item is and, again, its consistency over time. 
But more specific to your question, you're likely referring to the $0.43 benefit. What that is, is it's unallocated derivative activity, both hedging gains and losses, that are held at corporate that will ultimately be released during the upcoming financial period in order to match a future cost.

And we have taken pricing action that will be reflected in the month of July, but really is having a 3 quarters impact. 
And so as a result of that, 60% of the pricing benefit that we're seeing is really coming in the back half of the fiscal year. And so as a result of that, matching of the cost and the price recovery, we are seeing the impact on the gross profit margin, not only for the first quarter, to your point, but also for the front half of the fiscal year, with improvement in the back half of the fiscal year.

We're also seeing the continued benefit of the momentum across the various elements of our business that I've spoken to, whether it be Uncrustables or advancing Dunkin' and Café Bustelo or the advancement of cat food. 
And then as Mark spoke on the inventory front, we will continue to work to get to the right inventory levels, both within our infrastructure, and also within our customers. And we will continue to do that over time. But I think the first half of the fiscal year, inventory levels will still be pretty lean, just as we work through supply chains that continue to remain a bit tight, but yet are still working supply chain. So that's kind of how we're thinking about that growth on a 2-year stack basis.  
I might just share that we are seeing performance coming through on that 2-year stack basis across the predominance of our U.S. Retail businesses, all 3, along with a return to growth in the Away From Home business.

And it allows our teams and businesses to really focus on the unique dynamics of the pet category and the pet consumer, which is we refer to as a pet parent, and the way they shop the category. 
So I won't go into specifics on specific wins, but we're already seeing a higher degree of focus, a stronger degree of strategic engagement with our customers because, as you know, they think about pet as a separate category as well. And so our engagement with our retail customers is really critical, and we're already starting to see the benefit of that.  
Our pet strategy, you will recall, is focused, first and foremost, on pet snacks, the premiumization of Milk-Bone, the launch of other new products in snacks under the Meow Mix and Nutrish brands, so continuing to push out our leadership position in snacks. We have a #2 position in cats, and we will continue. We've had good performance over the course of the year in Meow Mix. And we will continue to support the brands in cats through traditional means as well as innovation. 
And then in our dog portfolio, we continue to focus on the stabilization of the Nutrish brand, which is going reasonably well, expecting some modest growth over time on that brand. But Nutrish, for us, is really a total master brand strategy. So it is not just dog food, it is snacks as well as cat and wet dog as well. And so making -- in which -- in those cases, those segments, we would expect to grow faster than our dry dog food on Nutrish.

The external factors and tailwinds that are going to continue to help us is our expectation, and what you're seeing across industries, is that folks are not going back to work in the way they once did. So there is going to be some hybrid approach. Our own company is no exception on how often folks are physically in an office versus at home. And there are -- people are going to be spending more time at home, which means they're going to be treating their pets more. 
And in particular, because -- wherein our coffee and consumer categories are focused primarily on breakfast and lunch, those 2 eating occasions are going to continue to take place at home at a more elevated pace.

And an example that I would use is in coffee, right? We assumed that we would have continued at-home consumption trends through the first half of the year, and then it would slow down a little bit. And it's not only due to the government stimulus, but it's also due to the new lifestyle or habits or migration patterns of consumers, right? They'll balance not only working from home, in a remote environment, they would go back to an office environment. 
So that would be one example that we did factor in. So I guess, what I would say, from a planning perspective is, is that before we dove into all the mechanics of a financial plan, we stepped back and made some assumptions around macroeconomic impacts or just overall sort of social impacts, and those were considered."

And then in your International and Away From Home, you would also see some growth due to the return of the Away From Home segment. 
The Pet and Consumer growth that we're talking about is -- again, it's low single digits. The Coffee, as I've noted, is consistent year-over-year. And when you think about the International and Away From Home segment, that's probably in a mid-single-digit plus, just due to that recovery in Away From Home.

First of all, on the Coffee side of the business, the coffee input cost inflation seems to be -- or it's picked up, I guess, a bit since last quarter.

And then Mark can talk a little bit more about the pricing component or dynamic. But we still, at big picture, remain committed to that greater-than-30% coffee margins at the segment level. We anticipate seeing a minor deceleration year-over-year, but still staying at pretty strong margins in coffee on a full year basis. 
But as I noted in some of my prior comments, there's a bit of timing of the pricing actions that we're taking that will really be effective in the month of July and kind of realized in Q2, 3 and 4 against a cost structure that's coming right in front of us in Q1. And so you likely will see a pretty substantial margin decline in coffee in the first quarter, with a nice rebound in the second, third and fourth quarters. But again, still supporting that low 30% on a year-over-year basis. 
So I'll pause there and hand it to Mark just on the pricing front."

And then, I guess, the only other comment I would make about coffee is we have been very successful in our strategy to ensure that our portfolio tracks with the category. In other words, the growth in -- of Dunkin' and Bustelo has been phenomenal, and that was -- that's been intentional because we know that there's been continued premiumization. 
And then, of course, the shift to single-serve or K-Cups. Our brands outperformed the category in this last quarter. And so we feel very good about where the total portfolio is positioned. And then some of the reinvigorating efforts that are coming on Folgers in the back half of the year should continue to help our total Coffee business."

Let me just make a couple of very brief comments just about the business in general, and I will answer the Nutrish question. I just want to acknowledge, first of all, that we are very pleased with the results this quarter. It's our sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding expectations. If you look at -- in the prepared remarks, and you back out some of the noise in terms of divestitures and really look at an apples-to-apples, the total company grew 1%. All of our U.S. businesses grew and on a 2-year stack, we saw that 6% top line growth. 
So the point here is that, underlying business fundamentals remain strong, demand is still there. Our investments almost across every part of our business are working. Our brands are strong. I mean just looking at the share growth, 2/3 of our portfolio are growing. A couple of years ago, that was like 1/4 of our brands were growing. So we are very pleased with the progress and the way we've been able to execute throughout the last -- particularly the last 18 months in the pandemic. 
And so really one of the only spots where we have not been satisfied is on Nutrish dry dog. Even the Pet business itself grew in line with our algorithm. If you look on a 2-year stack, it's about a 3% growth. And we've said our algorithm is 3% to 4%. So we have been meeting that and seeing growth in dog snacks and cat food, et cetera. So really, we're isolated to Nutrish dry dog. We do remain committed to the brand. We have continued our portfolio and packaging optimizations. 
We are -- it's still at the early stages of the Big Life launch. So we clearly believe that there is still potential for the brand. Specifically, though, we have not been satisfied with some of our marketing investments and feel that they have not delivered the requisite return. And so we are actually pulling back on some of those marketing investments still supporting the master brand and Big Life, but making sure that the dollars we're spending there are truly going to make a difference, and we're going to pull back temporarily and reevaluate some of those investments. And so that's why we said the full recovery of the Nutrish brand will be delayed throughout the remainder of this fiscal year."

Now we're seeing high single-digit cost inflation as a percentage of our total cost of goods sold. The change from our initial expectation is really driven within our commodity ingredients area transportation and then packaging. 
And when you think of commodity ingredients, there have been a few factors that have been driving that. One is weather-related, so that would impact coffee, particularly with Brazil weather patterns. The second was also weather patterns in the West, specifically the Pacific Northwest that impacted fruit. So those are 2 areas of commodities or ingredients where we've seen inflation come through, particularly in the second half of our fiscal year. Transportation due to the volatility and tightness of supply chain continues to be real, not only from a labor standpoint, but also from a unit standpoint, and just an overall sort of backlog in the system that has persisted throughout the entire pandemic. And then on the packaging front, packaging continues to have the implications of just ongoing pricing pressures that continue candidly from the weather disruption that occurred in the winter time frame in Texas due to the freeze. 
And so as a result of this persistent inflation, we continue to manage through, very effectively, not only through our supply chain and relationships with our suppliers and the great work by our teams, but we've got to acknowledge this inflation in our P&L and we need to recover it. And we are going to recover it through additional pricing actions this fiscal year that we anticipate in the second and third quarters in order to recover that. So we do believe this is a timing impact. And as a result of the timing impact, it should have pressure on the margin that we noted as well. But I do want to acknowledge 2 things.

But as to the supply chain, specifically, we do believe that the reason that we have had success is because of our ability to execute and manage the supply chain. There is no question that it is tight and there are a variety of issues, tightness spanning from all the way upstream to all the way to the shelf at the retailer. But I would submit that our team and our people have done such a good job of managing every single step of the way, engaging with suppliers and customers all the way through to the retail shelf that has been key to our success. 
And so much so that it has allowed us to actually gain distribution at shelf because we generally have been able to deliver to our customers. We've gained some space in recent shelf set resets because of our ability to execute. And so if you think about that factor, coupled with our new commercial model which is truly focused on the retail shelf and delivering, I think that really has been critical to how we've been able to deliver results thus far, and we would anticipate continuing those trends."

So you're now seem to be a lot more reliant on promotions to drive volume than you used to be. You look to be the only companies who actually didn't benefit from lower trade rates very COVID. And in the context of that sort of promotional dependence, shouldn't we expect elasticity to be higher than it historically has? What gives you confidence in underwriting sort of a lower elasticity function than history?"

And it's going to be offset by sort of low single-digit growth of volume/mix/other. And what you have to be careful about in the volume/mix/other is, one, it's underlying business momentum for the Smucker's Uncrustables brand, continued advancement of Cafe Bustelo and Dunkin' and advancement of our Pet snacks portfolio, along with a return in the Away From Home business. 
But then it is offset by a decrease in at-home consumption. It is also offset by supply chain disruption, which we are experiencing through our pet food portfolio, particularly in wet pet. And it's also offset by any additional trade or promotion like you've talked about. But that trader promotion isn't the biggest bucket of what's causing sort of that change. And then lastly is I would just acknowledge that in our volume mix bucket, we also have factored in price elasticities for our pricing actions across the portfolio."

I think you have to acknowledge the cost inflationary and pressures in that business driven by the underlying commodities such as animal fats and proteins, along with the impact of transportation. And again, that was ahead of any pricing benefit due to pricing actions that were taken in July.

Let me just make a couple of very brief comments just about the business in general, and I will answer the Nutrish question. I just want to acknowledge, first of all, that we are very pleased with the results this quarter. It's our sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding expectations. If you look at in the prepared remarks and you back out some of the noise in terms of divestitures and really look at an apples-to-apples, the total company grew 1%. All of our U.S. businesses grew and on a 2-year stack, we saw that 6% top line growth.  
So the point here is that underlying business fundamentals remain strong, demand is still there. Our investments almost across every part of our business are working. Our brands are strong. I mean just looking at the share growth, 2/3 of our portfolio are growing. A couple of years ago, that was like 1/4 of our brands were growing. So we are very pleased with the progress and the way we've been able to execute throughout the last -- particularly the last 18 months in the pandemic.  
And so really one of the only spots where we have not been satisfied is on Nutrish dry dog. Even the pet business itself grew in line with our algorithm. If you look on a 2-year stack, it's about a 3% growth. And we've said our algorithm is 3% to 4%. So we have been meeting that and seeing growth in dog snacks and cat food, et cetera. So really, we're isolated to Nutrish dry dog. We do remain committed to the brand. We have continued our portfolio and packaging optimizations.  
We are -- it's still at the early stages of the Big Life launch. So we clearly believe that there is still potential for the brand. Specifically, though, we have not been satisfied with some of our marketing investments and feel that they have not delivered the requisite return. And so we are actually pulling back on some of those marketing investments, still supporting the master brand and Big Life, but making sure that the dollars we're spending there are truly going to make a difference, and we're going to pull back temporarily and reevaluate some of those investments. And so that's why we said the full recovery of the Nutrish brand will be delayed throughout the remainder of this fiscal year."

Now we're seeing high single-digit cost inflation as a percentage of our total cost of goods sold. The change from our initial expectation is really driven within our commodity ingredients area, transportation and then packaging.  
And when you think of commodity ingredients, there have been a few factors that have been driving that. One is weather-related, so that would impact coffee, particularly with Brazil weather patterns. The second was also weather patterns in the West, specifically the Pacific Northwest that impacted fruit. So those are 2 areas of commodities or ingredients where we've seen inflation come through, particularly in the second half of our fiscal year. Transportation, due to the volatility and tightness of supply chain, continues to be real not only from a labor standpoint but also from a unit standpoint, and just an overall sort of backlog in the system that has persisted throughout the entire pandemic. And then on the packaging front, packaging continues to have the implications of just ongoing pricing pressures that continue candidly from the weather disruption that occurred in the winter time frame in Texas due to the freeze.  
And so as a result of this persistent inflation, we continue to manage through very effectively not only through our supply chain and relationships with our suppliers and the great work by our teams, but we've got to acknowledge this inflation in our P&L and we need to recover it. And we are going to recover it through additional pricing actions this fiscal year that we anticipate in the second and third quarters in order to recover that. So we do believe this is a timing impact. And as a result of the timing impact, it should have pressure on the margin that we noted as well. But I do want to acknowledge 2 things. We remain confident in the way we've executed throughout the entire pandemic, and we will going forward. And I also want to acknowledge that this is not a symptom specific to Smucker. Candidly, this is a symptom specific to the entire economy."

As you think about what's happened since our initial guidance, we began to have weather impacts in Brazil that began to affect the underlying commodity. And as a result of that, we've been managing through how we think about delivering the balance of the year. While we'd like to give you the specifics on our hedging position, we don't disclose that.

I mean if we really want to simplify, it's primarily those 2 factors. There's a lot of unknowns, of course, about the pandemic and what course that may take, so we're watching that extremely carefully. 
But as to the supply chain, specifically, we do believe that the reason that we have had success is because of our ability to execute and manage the supply chain. There is no question that it is tight and there are a variety of issues, tightness spanning from all the way upstream to all the way to the shelf at the retailer. But I would submit that our team and our people have done such a good job of managing every single step of the way, engaging with suppliers and customers all the way through to the retail shelf that has been key to our success. 
And so much so that it has allowed us to actually gain distribution at shelf because we generally have been able to deliver to our customers. We've gained some space in recent shelf set resets because of our ability to execute. And so if you think about that factor coupled with our new commercial model, which is truly focused on the retail shelf and delivering, I think that really has been critical to how we've been able to deliver results thus far, and we would anticipate continuing those trends."

I think you have to acknowledge the cost inflationary pressures in that business driven by the underlying commodities such as animal fats and proteins, along with the impact of transportation. And again, that was ahead of any pricing benefit due to pricing actions that were taken in July. 
So we would anticipate that the profitability in pet food come back in the back half of the year as pricing begins to reflect a half a year benefit against sort of a partial year first half, and then it will be down year-over-year due to the timing of price recovery against cost inflation."

Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Our business continued to perform in the new fiscal year as our operational excellence drove continued strong demand for our products, resulting in overall market share gains for our portfolio of brands. Our",1474,"Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Our business continued to perform in the new fiscal year as our operational excellence drove continued strong demand for our products, resulting in overall market share gains for our portfolio of brands. 
Our first quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, as we continued to benefit from strong at-home consumption and recovering sales for our Away From Home business. It is clear consumer behavior has shifted even as the economy has continued to reopen and consumer mobility increased through the spring and early summer. 
We will continue to benefit from strong at-home consumption trends as consumers remain loyal to our iconic brands. While the environment is evolving, we are confident we will maintain momentum for our brands as people return to schools and workplaces. 
In the first quarter, net sales declined 6% versus the prior year. Excluding noncomparable net sales from divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales increased 1%, building upon double-digit growth last year. 
Net sales adjusted for divestitures grew 6% on a 2-year CAGR basis, demonstrating growth across all 3 of our U.S. Retail segments. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.90, reflecting the anticipated cost increases and the timing of offsetting pricing actions, which mostly became effective at the end of the quarter. 
In the quarter, we successfully implemented net pricing actions to fully recover the cost increases heading into the fiscal year on a go-forward basis. However, macroeconomic factors have continued to evolve creating incremental supply chain uncertainty around the availability of labor and transportation and multiple extreme weather events have impacted key commodities important to our business. 
As a result, we now anticipate ongoing cost inflation and supply disruption to persist beyond our previous expectations and through the remainder of the fiscal year. In response, our teams are implementing additional net pricing actions and cost savings initiatives. 
However, due to the timing of the cost increases and recovery through higher net pricing as well as some supply chain disruption, we have revised our expectations and are lowering our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook by approximately 5%. 
We remain optimistic about our ability to overcome these transitory challenges and are confident in our strategy and the continued strength of our brands and the ability to invest and sustain market share improvements. Our talented people and their ability to operate with excellence, while actively managing our supply chain and customer engagements over the last 18 months, has been instrumental to our success and will continue to support the delivery of our business through these dynamic times. 
Turning to our segment results. In Pet Foods, net sales, excluding the Natural Balance divestiture, increased 2% versus the prior year. Growth was driven by our Cat Food and Dog Snacks businesses, which grew net sales by 4% and 3%, respectively. 
Comparable net sales grew at 3% CAGR on a 2-year basis. Within Dog Food, our efforts to evolve the Nutrish brand and accelerate growth are lagging our expectations. As a result, the return to growth for this brand will be delayed beyond the current fiscal year. 
We are currently evaluating additional actions to ensure that we position the business appropriately for sustained long-term growth. 
Turning to our Coffee business. Net sales were slightly behind expectations, decreasing 5% versus the prior year, primarily due to lapping retailer inventory restocking. Our portfolio of brand outperformed the category, gaining 1.1 points of dollar share in the quarter. 
On a 2-year CAGR basis, net sales grew 8% as consumers have sustained at-home coffee habits formed during the pandemic. At-home coffee currently represents around 75% of all coffee-drinking occasions compared to 2/3 prepandemic. 
Café Bustelo and Dunkin' were the 2 fastest-growing brands in the category, with retail sales growing 12% and 9%, respectively, in the quarter versus the prior year. 
Our branded K-Cup portfolio continues to outperform the one cup coffee segment. In the quarter, retail sales of our brands grew 10%, and we gained over 1 point of share, versus 2 years ago, our K-Cup portfolio grew at a CAGR of 15%, which is approximately 2x the category average. 
The Folgers brand gained share in both the canister and one cup format. Across all formats, the Folgers brand gained 24,000 incremental point of distribution in retailer shelf resets that began in May. We will continue to fuel this momentum with a bold new Folgers marketing campaign launching in calendar year 2022 with additional plans to reinvigorate and transform the brand toward the end of the fiscal year. 
In our Consumer Foods business, we continue to deliver exceptional results across all categories. Excluding noncomparable net sales for the divested Crisco business, net sales increased 4% versus the prior year and grew at an 11% CAGR on a 2-year basis. 
We grew share across all of our key brands, Jif, Smucker's and Smucker's Uncrustables. Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches continued to deliver powerful growth with net sales increasing 28% in the quarter, the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 
Total company sales of Uncrustables, including the Away From Home business, exceeded $120 million this quarter, the 29th consecutive quarter of growth for the brand. 
The expansion of our facility in Longmont, Colorado, is advancing and will provide capacity to exceed our $500 million annual sales target in fiscal 2023. 
In peanut butter, we continue to maximize production to meet elevated demand. The Jif brand net sales grew 9% and gained over 5 share points in the quarter. Points of distribution for Jif have increased 6% compared to a year ago, reflecting the lapping of out-of-stocks in the prior year and incremental distribution in recent shelf resets. 
In addition to core offerings, Jif Squeeze and Jif No-Added Sugar innovation, that has been in market for the past year, are both contributing to growth and we're the #1 and #2 innovation items launched in the category. We delivered this strong top line performance across our retail businesses, along with a robust recovery for our Away From Home business, which grew 27%, excluding divestitures and foreign exchange. 
Growth for Smucker's Uncrustables and market share gains have been significant contributors to the recovery, as we have achieved all-time high shares in the liquid coffee, portion control, fruit spreads and breakfast syrup categories. 
Across all our businesses, our first quarter results underscore our increased focus and significant progress we've made against our executional priorities, which include driving commercial excellence, streamlining our cost infrastructure, reshaping our portfolio and unleashing our organization to win. 
Advancing our priority to drive commercial excellence, we continued our trend of improving market share across our portfolio, as we grew dollar share in core consumer and coffee segments and our dry cat food business. In aggregate, we grew share for brands representing 66% of our sales, up from 55% in the prior quarter and 26% just under 2 years ago. 
This marks 7 consecutive quarters of improvement in this key metric, serving as a testament to the success of our improved commercial model and operational excellence. Progress on reshaping our portfolio continues as we are actively evaluating opportunities to further optimize our on-shelf assortment and increase our focus and resources towards sustainable growth opportunities. 
We will continue sharing news about our efforts as we proceed through this fiscal year. We continue to make progress on our priority of streamlining our cost infrastructure, which has been a component of our efforts to manage the current cost inflationary environment. We continue to work to optimize our supply chain, maximize network production efficiencies and minimize discretionary expenses across the organization. 
Full implementation of these initiatives will deliver $50 million of incremental cost savings this year and in each of the next 2 fiscal years. Our strategic priority to unleash and empower our employees and organization to win includes prioritization of activities focused on delivering with excellence and winning in the marketplace. 
We are also continuing progress on our journey to advance inclusion, diversity and equity at every level of the organization. We updated our executive compensation awards for fiscal year 2022 to include a metric tied to achievement of inclusion, diversity and equity objectives. 
We are looking to the future with strong conviction in our strategy with this quarter demonstrating our continued momentum and execution on our priorities in a dynamic operating and demand environment. 
Many consumers were introduced to or rediscovered our brands throughout the pandemic. The investments in our brands and successful product innovations, along with our operational excellence, are supporting continued strength in our top line performance, giving us confidence in our ability to sustain our momentum. 
While the current supply chain and cost environment is volatile, we remain confident in successfully managing these near-term challenges while taking actions to strengthen our company and support long-term sales and profit growth, leading to increased shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the discussion over to Tucker."

Let me begin by giving an overview of first quarter results, which finished in line with our expectations, then I'll provide details on our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2022. 
Net sales decreased 6%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales increased 1%. The increase in comparable net sales was primarily due to favorable volume mix for Away From Home and the Pet Food segment, partially offset by reduced volume mix for International and the Coffee segment. 
Net pricing was a slight benefit, primarily reflecting higher net pricing in Consumer Foods, mostly offset by lower net pricing in the Coffee segment. Adjusted gross profit decreased $113 million or 15% from the prior year. This was driven by higher cost for commodities and transportation most notably in the Pet Food segment, the noncomparable impact of the divested businesses and unfavorable volume mix. 
Adjusted operating income decreased $81 million or 20%, reflecting the decreased gross profit, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense, mostly driven by reduced marketing. As a reminder, some marketing investments were pulled into the prior year fourth quarter contributing to part of the reduction. 
Below operating income, interest expense decreased $3 million, primarily as a result of reduced debt outstanding. Net other expense increased $10 million, primarily reflecting a $7 million net loss related to the prepayment of debt and a $4 million pension settlement. 
The adjusted effective income tax rate was 23.6% compared to 24.4% in the prior year. Factoring all this in, first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.90 compared to $2.37 in the prior year, a decrease of 20%. 
I'll now turn to first quarter segment results, beginning with Pet Foods. Net sales decreased 6% versus the prior year. Excluding the noncomparable divestiture impact, net sales increased 2% versus the prior year, primarily driven by favorable volume mix for dog snacks, cat food and private label offerings, partially offset by declines for dog food. 
Comparable net sales grew at a 3% CAGR on a 2-year basis. Cat Food and Dog Snacks continued to perform well, growing 4% and 3%, respectively, led by the Meow Mix, Pup-Peroni and Milk-Bone brands. Dog Food net sales decreased 4%, reflecting decreases for Nutrish, Dry Dog Food and the Kibbles 'n Bits brand. 
Pet Food segment profit declined 36%, primarily reflecting higher commodity and transportation costs. 
Turning to the Coffee segment. Net sales decreased 5% versus the prior year and increased 8% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Suspended promotions in the prior year and the lapping of retailer inventory restocking contributed to the year-over-year decline. 
The Folgers and Dunkin' Brands declined in the quarter, while Café Bustelo was flat. Coffee segment profit decreased 17%, reflecting lower pricing, higher green coffee costs and the reduced contribution from volume mix, partially offset by decreased marketing expense. 
In Consumer Foods, net sales decreased 11%. Excluding the noncomparables, net sales for the divested Crisco business net sales increased 4% versus the prior year and grew 11% on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
The first quarter comparable net sales increase relative to the prior year was driven by higher net pricing of 4%, primarily driven by peanut butter and Smucker's Uncrustables. Growth was led by Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches and Jif peanut butter, which grew 28% and 9%, respectively, partially offset by a 16% decline for fruit spreads. 
Consumer Foods segment profit decreased 10%, primarily due to the lapping of noncomparable profit from the divested Crisco business, partially offset by decreased marketing expense. 
Lastly, in International Away From Home, net sales increased 6%. Excluding the prior year noncomparable net sales for the divested Crisco business and foreign exchange, net sales increased 4%. The Away From Home business increased 27% on a comparable basis, driven by double-digit growth for most categories in the portfolio. 
The International business declined 12% on a comparable basis, primarily driven by the lapping of significant at-home consumption for the Canadian baking business. 
Overall, International Away From Home segment profit increased 6%, primarily reflecting favorable foreign currency exchange, decreased marketing expense and a net benefit of price and cost. 
This was partially offset by the noncomparable profit for the divested Crisco business and lower volume mix. First quarter free cash flow was $70 million compared to $332 million in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by a $9 million decrease in capital expenditures. 
The decrease in cash provided by the operating activities was mostly due to greater working capital requirements, driven by the increased trade receivables and inventory as compared to the prior year and the reduced earnings. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $68 million, representing 3.7% of net sales. We paid down $123 million of net debt in the quarter, including prepaying $400 million of senior notes due in March of this fiscal year using a combination of excess cash and commercial paper. 
Based on a total debt balance of $4.6 billion and a trailing 12-month EBITDA of approximately $1.7 billion, our leverage ratio stands at 2.7x. We continue to prioritize the use of cash towards dividends and debt repayments, while evaluating other strategic uses of cash to support future growth and shareholder value. 
Let me now provide additional color on our revised outlook for fiscal 2022. The pandemic and related implications along with cost inflation and volatility in supply chains continues to cause uncertainty for the fiscal year 2022 outlook. 
Any manufacturing or supply chain disruption as well as changes in consumer mobility and purchasing behavior, retailer inventory levels and macroeconomic conditions could materially impact actual results. We continue to focus on managing elements we can control, including taking the necessary steps to minimize the impact of cost inflation and any labor or business disruption. 
As always, we will continue to plan for unforeseen volatility, while ensuring we have contingency plans in place. This guidance reflects performance expectations based on the company's current understanding of the overall environment. 
Our updated expectations for full year net sales is to decline approximately 2% at the midpoint of our guidance range. On a comparable basis, net sales are anticipated to increase approximately 2.5%, demonstrating the continued underlying momentum for our business and brands. 
This reflects benefits from higher pricing actions across multiple categories, primarily to recover increased commodity, ingredient packaging and transportation costs along with double-digit sales growth for the Smucker's Uncrustables brand and a recovery in the Away From Home channel, partially offset by a deceleration in at-home consumption trends. 
Further, we are now implementing additional pricing actions to recover incremental inflationary costs versus our previous expectation, which we anticipate will be partially offset by reduced volume mix, including price elasticity consideration and supply chain disruption, primarily impacting our wet pet food business. 
We now anticipate gross profit margin of approximately 36%. This reflects our expectations for higher net pricing along with cost and productivity savings and a mix benefit associated with the divestitures being more than offset by higher cost inflation. 
We have updated our assumptions to reflect this ongoing cost inflation most notably for commodities ingredients, transportation and packaging. Cost inflation is now anticipated to have a high single-digit impact on total cost of goods sold. 
SG&A expenses are now projected to decrease by approximately 6%, reflecting benefits of cost management and organizational restructuring programs, reduced incentive compensation and reductions in discretionary expenses. Total marketing spend is anticipated to be at the midpoint of our original guidance of 6% to 6.5% of net sales. 
We anticipate net interest expense of approximately $165 million, net other expense of $20 million and adjusted effective income tax rate of 24% and full year weighted average shares outstanding of 108.3 million. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we anticipate full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.25 to $8.65. Given the timing of cost increases and recovery through both initial higher net pricing actions effective at the end of the first quarter and additional net pricing actions later in the fiscal year, earnings are expected to decline in the second and third quarters. 
The decline in the second quarter is anticipated to be approximately 15%. The fourth quarter is now expected to grow more than 20%, reflecting higher net pricing catching up to higher costs and the lapping of around $40 million of incremental marketing spend in the prior year. 
Free cash flow is now anticipated to be $800 million, which reflects adjustments to earnings guidance, working capital considerations and capital expenditures of $380 million. 
In closing, we remain confident in our strategy and are encouraged by the continued momentum for our business and brands.

Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Our business continued to perform in the new fiscal year as our operational excellence drove continued strong demand for our products, resulting in overall market share gains for our portfolio of brands. Our",1471,"Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Our business continued to perform in the new fiscal year as our operational excellence drove continued strong demand for our products, resulting in overall market share gains for our portfolio of brands. 
Our first quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, as we continued to benefit from strong at-home consumption and recovering sales for our Away From Home business. It is clear consumer behavior has shifted even as the economy has continued to reopen and consumer mobility increased through the spring and early summer. 
We will continue to benefit from strong at-home consumption trends as consumers remain loyal to our iconic brands. While the environment is evolving, we are confident we will maintain momentum for our brands as people return to schools and workplaces. 
In the first quarter, net sales declined 6% versus the prior year. Excluding noncomparable net sales from divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales increased 1%, building upon double-digit growth last year. 
Net sales adjusted for divestitures grew 6% on a 2-year CAGR basis, demonstrating growth across all 3 of our U.S. Retail segments. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.90, reflecting the anticipated cost increases and the timing of offsetting pricing actions, which mostly became effective at the end of the quarter. 
In the quarter, we successfully implemented net pricing actions to fully recover the cost increases heading into the fiscal year on a go-forward basis. However, macroeconomic factors have continued to evolve creating incremental supply chain uncertainty around the availability of labor and transportation and multiple extreme weather events have impacted key commodities important to our business. As a result, we now anticipate ongoing cost inflation and supply disruption to persist beyond our previous expectations and through the remainder of the fiscal year. 
In response, our teams are implementing additional net pricing actions and cost savings initiatives. However, due to the timing of the cost increases and recovery through higher net pricing as well as some supply chain disruption, we have revised our expectations and are lowering our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook by approximately 5%. 
We remain optimistic about our ability to overcome these transitory challenges and are confident in our strategy and the continued strength of our brands and the ability to invest and sustain market share improvements. Our talented people and their ability to operate with excellence, while actively managing our supply chain and customer engagements over the last 18 months, has been instrumental to our success and will continue to support the delivery of our business through these dynamic times. 
Turning to our segment results. In Pet Foods, net sales, excluding the Natural Balance divestiture, increased 2% versus the prior year. Growth was driven by our cat food and dog snacks businesses, which grew net sales by 4% and 3%, respectively. Comparable net sales grew at 3% CAGR on a 2-year basis. 
Within Dog Food, our efforts to evolve the Nutrish brand and accelerate growth are lagging our expectations. As a result, the return to growth for this brand will be delayed beyond the current fiscal year. We are currently evaluating additional actions to ensure that we position the business appropriately for sustained long-term growth. 
Turning to our Coffee business. Net sales were slightly behind expectations, decreasing 5% versus the prior year, primarily due to lapping retailer inventory restocking. Our portfolio of brands outperformed the category, gaining 1.1 points of dollar share in the quarter. 
On a 2-year CAGR basis, net sales grew 8% as consumers have sustained at-home coffee habits formed during the pandemic. At-home coffee currently represents around 75% of all coffee-drinking occasions compared to 2/3 prepandemic. 
Café Bustelo and Dunkin' were the 2 fastest-growing brands in the category, with retail sales growing 12% and 9%, respectively, in the quarter versus the prior year. 
Our branded K-Cup portfolio continues to outperform the one-cup coffee segment. In the quarter, retail sales of our brands grew 10%, and we gained over 1 point of share, versus 2 years ago, our K-Cup portfolio grew at a CAGR of 15%, which is approximately 2x the category average. 
The Folgers brand gained share in both the canister and one-cup format. Across all formats, the Folgers brand gained 24,000 incremental point of distribution in retailer shelf resets that began in May. We will continue to fuel this momentum with a bold new Folgers marketing campaign launching in calendar year 2022 with additional plans to reinvigorate and transform the brand toward the end of the fiscal year. 
In our Consumer Foods business, we continue to deliver exceptional results across all categories. Excluding noncomparable net sales for the divested Crisco business, net sales increased 4% versus the prior year and grew at an 11% CAGR on a 2-year basis. 
We grew share across all of our key brands, Jif, Smucker's and Smucker's Uncrustables. 
Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches continued to deliver powerful growth with net sales increasing 28% in the quarter, the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 
Total company sales of Uncrustables, including the Away From Home business, exceeded $120 million this quarter, the 29th consecutive quarter of growth for the brand. 
The expansion of our facility in Longmont, Colorado, is advancing and will provide capacity to exceed our $500 million annual sales target in fiscal 2023. 
In peanut butter, we continue to maximize production to meet elevated demand. The Jif brand net sales grew 9% and gained over 5 share points in the quarter. Points of distribution for Jif have increased 6% compared to a year ago, reflecting the lapping of out-of-stocks in the prior year and incremental distribution in recent shelf resets. 
In addition to core offerings, Jif Squeeze and Jif No-Added Sugar innovation, that has been in market for the past year, are both contributing to growth and were the #1 and #2 innovation items launched in the category. 
We delivered this strong top-line performance across our retail businesses, along with a robust recovery for our Away From Home business, which grew 27%, excluding divestitures and foreign exchange. 
Growth for Smucker's Uncrustables and market share gains have been significant contributors to the recovery, as we have achieved all-time high shares in the liquid coffee, portion control, fruit spreads and breakfast syrup categories. 
Across all our businesses, our first quarter results underscore our increased focus and significant progress we've made against our executional priorities, which include driving commercial excellence, streamlining our cost infrastructure, reshaping our portfolio and unleashing our organization to win. 
Advancing our priority to drive commercial excellence, we continued our trend of improving market share across our portfolio, as we grew dollar share in core consumer and coffee segments and our dry cat food business. In aggregate, we grew share for brands representing 66% of our sales, up from 55% in the prior quarter and 26% just under 2 years ago. This marks 7 consecutive quarters of improvement in this key metric, serving as a testament to the success of our improved commercial model and operational excellence. 
Progress on reshaping our portfolio continues as we are actively evaluating opportunities to further optimize our on-shelf assortment and increase our focus and resources towards sustainable growth opportunities. We will continue sharing news about our efforts as we proceed through this fiscal year. 
We continue to make progress on our priority of streamlining our cost infrastructure, which has been a component of our efforts to manage the current cost inflationary environment. We continue to work to optimize our supply chain, maximize network production efficiencies and minimize discretionary expenses across the organization. 
Full implementation of these initiatives will deliver $50 million of incremental cost savings this year and in each of the next 2 fiscal years. Our strategic priority to unleash and empower our employees and organization to win includes prioritization of activities focused on delivering with excellence and winning in the marketplace. 
We are also continuing progress on our journey to advance inclusion, diversity and equity at every level of the organization. We updated our executive compensation awards for fiscal year 2022 to include a metric tied to achievement of inclusion, diversity and equity objectives. 
We are looking to the future with strong conviction in our strategy with this quarter demonstrating our continued momentum and execution on our priorities in a dynamic operating and demand environment. 
Many consumers were introduced to or rediscovered our brands throughout the pandemic. The investments in our brands and successful product innovations, along with our operational excellence, are supporting continued strength in our top line performance, giving us confidence in our ability to sustain our momentum. 
While the current supply chain and cost environment is volatile, we remain confident in successfully managing these near-term challenges while taking actions to strengthen our company and support long-term sales and profit growth, leading to increased shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the discussion over to Tucker."

Let me begin by giving an overview of first quarter results, which finished in line with our expectations, then I'll provide details on our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2022. 
Net sales decreased 6%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales increased 1%. The increase in comparable net sales was primarily due to favorable volume/mix for Away From Home and the Pet Food segment, partially offset by reduced volume/mix for International and the Coffee segment. Net pricing was a slight benefit, primarily reflecting higher net pricing in Consumer Foods, mostly offset by lower net pricing in the Coffee segment. 
Adjusted gross profit decreased $113 million or 15% from the prior year. This was driven by higher cost for commodities and transportation most notably in the Pet Food segment, the noncomparable impact of the divested businesses and unfavorable volume/mix. 
Adjusted operating income decreased $81 million or 20%, reflecting the decreased gross profit, partially offset by a decrease in SD&A expense, mostly driven by reduced marketing. As a reminder, some marketing investments were pulled into the prior year fourth quarter contributing to part of the reduction. 
Below operating income, interest expense decreased $3 million, primarily as a result of reduced debt outstanding. Net other expense increased $10 million, primarily reflecting a $7 million net loss related to the prepayment of debt and a $4 million pension settlement. 
The adjusted effective income tax rate was 23.6% compared to 24.4% in the prior year. Factoring all this in, first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.90 compared to $2.37 in the prior year, a decrease of 20%. 
I'll now turn to first quarter segment results, beginning with Pet Foods. Net sales decreased 6% versus the prior year. Excluding the noncomparable divestiture impact, net sales increased 2% versus the prior year, primarily driven by favorable volume/mix for dog snacks, cat food and private label offerings, partially offset by declines for dog food. 
Comparable net sales grew at a 3% CAGR on a 2-year basis. Cat Food and Dog Snacks continued to perform well, growing 4% and 3%, respectively, led by the Meow Mix, Pup-Peroni and Milk-Bone brands. Dog Food net sales decreased 4%, reflecting decreases for Nutrish, dry dog food and the Kibbles 'n Bits brand. 
Pet Food segment profit declined 36%, primarily reflecting higher commodity and transportation costs. 
Turning to the Coffee segment. Net sales decreased 5% versus the prior year and increased 8% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Suspended promotions in the prior year and the lapping of retailer inventory restocking contributed to the year-over-year decline. 
The Folgers and Dunkin' Brands declined in the quarter, while Café Bustelo was flat. Coffee segment profit decreased 17%, reflecting lower pricing, higher green coffee costs and the reduced contribution from volume mix, partially offset by decreased marketing expense. 
In Consumer Foods, net sales decreased 11%. Excluding the noncomparables, net sales for the divested Crisco business, net sales increased 4% versus the prior year and grew 11% on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
The first quarter comparable net sales increase relative to the prior year was driven by higher net pricing of 4%, primarily driven by peanut butter and Smucker's Uncrustables. Growth was led by Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches and Jif peanut butter, which grew 28% and 9%, respectively, partially offset by a 16% decline for fruit spreads. 
Consumer Foods segment profit decreased 10%, primarily due to the lapping of noncomparable profit from the divested Crisco business, partially offset by decreased marketing expense. 
Lastly, in International and Away From Home, net sales increased 6%. Excluding the prior year noncomparable net sales for the divested Crisco business and foreign exchange, net sales increased 4%. The Away From Home business increased 27% on a comparable basis, driven by double-digit growth for most categories in the portfolio. 
The International business declined 12% on a comparable basis, primarily driven by the lapping of significant at-home consumption for the Canadian baking business. 
Overall, International Away From Home segment profit increased 6%, primarily reflecting favorable foreign currency exchange, decreased marketing expense and a net benefit of price and cost. This was partially offset by the noncomparable profit for the divested Crisco business and lower volume/mix. 
First quarter free cash flow was $70 million compared to $332 million in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by a $9 million decrease in capital expenditures. 
The decrease in cash provided by the operating activities was mostly due to greater working capital requirements, driven by the increased trade receivables and inventory as compared to the prior year and the reduced earnings. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $68 million, representing 3.7% of net sales. We paid down $123 million of net debt in the quarter, including prepaying $400 million of senior notes due in March of this fiscal year using a combination of excess cash and commercial paper. 
Based on a total debt balance of $4.6 billion and a trailing 12-month EBITDA of approximately $1.7 billion, our leverage ratio stands at 2.7x. We continue to prioritize the use of cash towards dividends and debt repayments, while evaluating other strategic uses of cash to support future growth and shareholder value. 
Let me now provide additional color on our revised outlook for fiscal 2022. The pandemic and related implications along with cost inflation and volatility in supply chains continues to cause uncertainty for the fiscal year 2022 outlook. 
Any manufacturing or supply chain disruption as well as changes in consumer mobility and purchasing behavior, retailer inventory levels and macroeconomic conditions could materially impact actual results. We continue to focus on managing elements we can control, including taking the necessary steps to minimize the impact of cost inflation and any labor or business disruption. 
As always, we will continue to plan for unforeseen volatility, while ensuring we have contingency plans in place. This guidance reflects performance expectations based on the company's current understanding of the overall environment. 
Our updated expectations for full year net sales is to decline approximately 2% at the midpoint of our guidance range. On a comparable basis, net sales are anticipated to increase approximately 2.5%, demonstrating the continued underlying momentum for our business and brands. 
This reflects benefits from higher pricing actions across multiple categories, primarily to recover increased commodity, ingredient packaging and transportation costs along with double-digit sales growth for the Smucker's Uncrustables brand and a recovery in the Away From Home channel, partially offset by a deceleration in at-home consumption trends. 
Further, we are now implementing additional pricing actions to recover incremental inflationary costs versus our previous expectation, which we anticipate will be partially offset by reduced volume mix, including price elasticity consideration and supply chain disruption, primarily impacting our wet pet food business. 
We now anticipate gross profit margin of approximately 36%. This reflects our expectations for higher net pricing along with cost and productivity savings and a mix benefit associated with the divestitures being more than offset by higher cost inflation. 
We have updated our assumptions to reflect this ongoing cost inflation most notably for commodities ingredients, transportation and packaging. Cost inflation is now anticipated to have a high single-digit impact on total cost of goods sold. 
SD&A expenses are now projected to decrease by approximately 6%, reflecting benefits of cost management and organizational restructuring programs, reduced incentive compensation and reductions in discretionary expenses. Total marketing spend is anticipated to be at the midpoint of our original guidance of 6% to 6.5% of net sales. 
We anticipate net interest expense of approximately $165 million, net other expense of $20 million and adjusted effective income tax rate of 24% and full year weighted average shares outstanding of 108.3 million. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we anticipate full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.25 to $8.65. Given the timing of cost increases and recovery through both initial higher net pricing actions effective at the end of the first quarter and additional net pricing actions later in the fiscal year, earnings are expected to decline in the second and third quarters. 
The decline in the second quarter is anticipated to be approximately 15%. The fourth quarter is now expected to grow more than 20%, reflecting higher net pricing catching up to higher costs and the lapping of around $40 million of incremental marketing spend in the prior year. 
Free cash flow is now anticipated to be $800 million, which reflects adjustments to earnings guidance, working capital considerations and capital expenditures of $380 million. 
In closing, we remain confident in our strategy and are encouraged by the continued momentum for our business and brands. We are taking the appropriate actions to demonstrate operational excellence, while managing through this volatile environment, and we remain in a strong financial position to deliver sustainable and consistent long-term growth for our shareholders. 
Thank you for your time today. I'll now turn it back to Mark for a few closing comments."

Let me just make a couple of very brief comments just about the business in general, and I will answer the Nutrish question. I just want to acknowledge, first of all, that we are very pleased with the results this quarter. It's our sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding expectations. If you look at in the prepared remarks and you back out some of the noise in terms of divestitures and really look at an apples-to-apples, the total company grew 1%. All of our U.S. businesses grew and on a 2-year stack, we saw that 6% top line growth.  
So the point here is that underlying business fundamentals remain strong, demand is still there. Our investments almost across every part of our business are working. Our brands are strong. I mean just looking at the share growth, 2/3 of our portfolio are growing. A couple of years ago, that was like 1/4 of our brands were growing. So we are very pleased with the progress and the way we've been able to execute throughout the last -- particularly the last 18 months in the pandemic.  
And so really one of the only spots where we have not been satisfied is on Nutrish dry dog. Even the pet business itself grew in line with our algorithm. If you look on a 2-year stack, it's about a 3% growth. And we've said our algorithm is 3% to 4%. So we have been meeting that and seeing growth in dog snacks and cat food, et cetera. So really, we're isolated to Nutrish dry dog. We do remain committed to the brand. We have continued our portfolio and packaging optimizations.  
We are -- it's still at the early stages of the Big Life launch. So we clearly believe that there is still potential for the brand. Specifically, though, we have not been satisfied with some of our marketing investments and feel that they have not delivered the requisite return. And so we are actually pulling back on some of those marketing investments, still supporting the master brand and Big Life, but making sure that the dollars we're spending there are truly going to make a difference, and we're going to pull back temporarily and reevaluate some of those investments. And so that's why we said the full recovery of the Nutrish brand will be delayed throughout the remainder of this fiscal year."

The change from our",368,"Ken, as we came into the fiscal year, we were anticipating mid single-digit cost inflation as a percent of our total cost of goods sold. Now we're seeing high single-digit cost inflation as a percentage of our total cost of goods sold. The change from our initial expectation is really driven within our commodity ingredients area, transportation and then packaging.  
And when you think of commodity ingredients, there have been a few factors that have been driving that. One is weather-related, so that would impact coffee, particularly with Brazil weather patterns. The second was also weather patterns in the West, specifically the Pacific Northwest that impacted fruit. So those are 2 areas of commodities or ingredients where we've seen inflation come through, particularly in the second half of our fiscal year. Transportation, due to the volatility and tightness of supply chain, continues to be real not only from a labor standpoint but also from a unit standpoint, and just an overall sort of backlog in the system that has persisted throughout the entire pandemic. And then on the packaging front, packaging continues to have the implications of just ongoing pricing pressures that continue candidly from the weather disruption that occurred in the winter time frame in Texas due to the freeze.  
And so as a result of this persistent inflation, we continue to manage through very effectively not only through our supply chain and relationships with our suppliers and the great work by our teams, but we've got to acknowledge this inflation in our P&L and we need to recover it. And we are going to recover it through additional pricing actions this fiscal year that we anticipate in the second and third quarters in order to recover that. So we do believe this is a timing impact. And as a result of the timing impact, it should have pressure on the margin that we noted as well. But I do want to acknowledge 2 things. We remain confident in the way we've executed throughout the entire pandemic, and we will going forward. And I also want to acknowledge that this is not a symptom specific to Smucker. Candidly, this is a symptom specific to the entire economy."

And so the margin in coffee for the quarter, but yet the margin for the entire business for the quarter does reflect that inflation ahead of the pricing recovery.  
As you think about what's happened since our initial guidance, we began to have weather impacts in Brazil that began to affect the underlying commodity. And as a result of that, we've been managing through how we think about delivering the balance of the year. While we'd like to give you the specifics on our hedging position, we don't disclose that.

I mean if we really want to simplify, it's primarily those 2 factors. There's a lot of unknowns, of course, about the pandemic and what course that may take, so we're watching that extremely carefully. 
But as to the supply chain, specifically, we do believe that the reason that we have had success is because of our ability to execute and manage the supply chain. There is no question that it is tight and there are a variety of issues, tightness spanning from all the way upstream to all the way to the shelf at the retailer. But I would submit that our team and our people have done such a good job of managing every single step of the way, engaging with suppliers and customers all the way through to the retail shelf that has been key to our success. 
And so much so that it has allowed us to actually gain distribution at shelf because we generally have been able to deliver to our customers. We've gained some space in recent shelf set resets because of our ability to execute. And so if you think about that factor coupled with our new commercial model, which is truly focused on the retail shelf and delivering, I think that really has been critical to how we've been able to deliver results thus far, and we would anticipate continuing those trends."

I know the magnitude of inflation pressure that you're facing in the industry, largest facing, continues to escalate, and it's certainly a lot larger than any of us anticipated a couple of quarters ago. But we've been talking about resumed inflation for about 9 months now, yet you've got almost no price -- not almost -- you have no price rolling through your P&L yet, including areas like pet, where you're actually lapping deflation in the prior year.

Most of the pricing was effective in July broadly, and it's now on shelf. So you're going to see that initial wave coming through in the second quarter.

It sounds like, Tucker, just sort of unpacking some of the comments you've made already: pricing, somewhere plus/minus 4%; implying volumes, somewhere minus 1.5 points or so. That looks like a lower elasticity function than you've historically had, which -- I compare it to your trade spend, and last year in your 10-K you disclosed, it's now 39% of sales, which is up, what, 800 basis points from 5 years ago. So you're now seem to be a lot more reliant on promotions to drive volume than you used to be. You look to be the only companies who actually didn't benefit from lower trade rates during COVID. And in the context of that sort of promotional dependence, shouldn't we expect elasticity to be higher than it historically has?

But then it is offset by a decrease in at-home consumption. It is also offset by supply chain disruption, which we are experiencing through our pet food portfolio, particularly in wet pet, and it's also offset by any additional trader promotion like you've talked about. But that trader promotion isn't the biggest bucket of what's causing sort of that change.

I think you have to acknowledge the cost inflationary pressures in that business driven by the underlying commodities such as animal fats and proteins, along with the impact of transportation. And again, that was ahead of any pricing benefit due to pricing actions that were taken in July.

Let me just make a couple of very brief comments just about the business in general, and I will answer the Nutrish question. I just want to acknowledge, first of all, that we are very pleased with the results this quarter. It's our sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding expectations. If you look at in the prepared remarks and you back out some of the noise in terms of divestitures and really look at an apples-to-apples, the total company grew 1%. All of our U.S. businesses grew and on a 2-year stack, we saw that 6% top line growth.  
So the point here is that underlying business fundamentals remain strong, demand is still there. Our investments almost across every part of our business are working. Our brands are strong. I mean just looking at the share growth, 2/3 of our portfolio are growing. A couple of years ago, that was like 1/4 of our brands were growing. So we are very pleased with the progress and the way we've been able to execute throughout the last -- particularly the last 18 months in the pandemic.  
And so really one of the only spots where we have not been satisfied is on Nutrish dry dog. Even the pet business itself grew in line with our algorithm. If you look on a 2-year stack, it's about a 3% growth. And we've said our algorithm is 3% to 4%. So we have been meeting that and seeing growth in dog snacks and cat food, et cetera. So really, we're isolated to Nutrish dry dog. We do remain committed to the brand. We have continued our portfolio and packaging optimizations.  
We are -- it's still at the early stages of the Big Life launch. So we clearly believe that there is still potential for the brand. Specifically, though, we have not been satisfied with some of our marketing investments and feel that they have not delivered the requisite return. And so we are actually pulling back on some of those marketing investments, still supporting the master brand and Big Life, but making sure that the dollars we're spending there are truly going to make a difference, and we're going to pull back temporarily and reevaluate some of those investments. And so that's why we said the full recovery of the Nutrish brand will be delayed throughout the remainder of this fiscal year."

The change from our",368,"Ken, as we came into the fiscal year, we were anticipating mid single-digit cost inflation as a percent of our total cost of goods sold. Now we're seeing high single-digit cost inflation as a percentage of our total cost of goods sold. The change from our initial expectation is really driven within our commodity ingredients area, transportation and then packaging.  
And when you think of commodity ingredients, there have been a few factors that have been driving that. One is weather-related, so that would impact coffee, particularly with Brazil weather patterns. The second was also weather patterns in the West, specifically the Pacific Northwest that impacted fruit. So those are 2 areas of commodities or ingredients where we've seen inflation come through, particularly in the second half of our fiscal year. Transportation, due to the volatility and tightness of supply chain, continues to be real not only from a labor standpoint but also from a unit standpoint, and just an overall sort of backlog in the system that has persisted throughout the entire pandemic. And then on the packaging front, packaging continues to have the implications of just ongoing pricing pressures that continue candidly from the weather disruption that occurred in the winter time frame in Texas due to the freeze.  
And so as a result of this persistent inflation, we continue to manage through very effectively not only through our supply chain and relationships with our suppliers and the great work by our teams, but we've got to acknowledge this inflation in our P&L and we need to recover it. And we are going to recover it through additional pricing actions this fiscal year that we anticipate in the second and third quarters in order to recover that. So we do believe this is a timing impact. And as a result of the timing impact, it should have pressure on the margin that we noted as well. But I do want to acknowledge 2 things. We remain confident in the way we've executed throughout the entire pandemic, and we will going forward. And I also want to acknowledge that this is not a symptom specific to Smucker.

As you think about what's happened since our initial guidance, we began to have weather impacts in Brazil that began to affect the underlying commodity. And as a result of that, we've been managing through how we think about delivering the balance of the year. While we'd like to give you the specifics on our hedging position, we don't disclose that.

There's a lot of unknowns, of course, about the pandemic and what course that may take, so we're watching that extremely carefully. 
But as to the supply chain, specifically, we do believe that the reason that we have had success is because of our ability to execute and manage the supply chain. There is no question that it is tight and there are a variety of issues, tightness spanning from all the way upstream to all the way to the shelf at the retailer. But I would submit that our team and our people have done such a good job of managing every single step of the way, engaging with suppliers and customers all the way through to the retail shelf that has been key to our success. 
And so much so that it has allowed us to actually gain distribution at shelf because we generally have been able to deliver to our customers. We've gained some space in recent shelf set resets because of our ability to execute. And so if you think about that factor coupled with our new commercial model, which is truly focused on the retail shelf and delivering, I think that really has been critical to how we've been able to deliver results thus far, and we would anticipate continuing those trends."

That looks like a lower elasticity function than you've historically had, which -- I compare it to your trade spend, and last year in your 10-K you disclosed, it's now 39% of sales, which is up, what, 800 basis points from 5 years ago. So you're now seem to be a lot more reliant on promotions to drive volume than you used to be. You look to be the only companies who actually didn't benefit from lower trade rates during COVID. And in the context of that sort of promotional dependence, shouldn't we expect elasticity to be higher than it historically has? What gives you confidence in underwriting sort of a lower elasticity function than history?"

And it's going to be offset by sort of low single-digit growth of volume/mix/other. And what you have to be careful about in the volume/mix/other is, one, it's underlying business momentum for the Smucker's Uncrustables brand, continued advancement of Café Bustelo and Dunkin' and advancement of our pet snacks portfolio, along with a return in the Away From Home business. 
But then it is offset by a decrease in at-home consumption. It is also offset by supply chain disruption, which we are experiencing through our pet food portfolio, particularly in wet pet, and it's also offset by any additional trader promotion like you've talked about. But that trader promotion isn't the biggest bucket of what's causing sort of that change. And then lastly is I would just acknowledge that in our volume mix bucket, we also have factored in price elasticities for our pricing actions across the portfolio."

I think you have to acknowledge the cost inflationary pressures in that business driven by the underlying commodities such as animal fats and proteins, along with the impact of transportation. And again, that was ahead of any pricing benefit due to pricing actions that were taken in July.

Of that $80 million, what we really saw was underlying business momentum against our brand and growth imperatives along with better-than-anticipated elasticities from our initial round of pricing actions over the summer and early fall.
As we think about the back half of the fiscal year, we are anticipating incremental growth of $80 million higher expectations. The predominance of that is coming from continued momentum of volume mix and those better than elasticities. However, in our fourth quarter, we do have significant pricing actions, particularly in coffee and to a lesser extent, in pets associated west inflation as a result of a pricing that will take place in the fourth quarter.

The first headline in response is that this is fundamentally about our strategy of investing where the growth is. In other words, we've talked about reshaping our portfolio, which is not only about M&A, but it's also about making sure that we're putting resources against our largest opportunities, and Uncrustables is clearly one of those. If you think about 30 consecutive quarters of growth, mostly in almost every one of those quarters has been double digit. This last quarter was about 33%. We're going to hit our $0.5 billion target a year early, second facility in Longmont, Colorado, which we continue to invest in to add lines there to support getting to, of course, over $0.5 billion.
And yes, you're correct. The investment in the Alabama facility, which we will break ground on in the next couple of months will support, obviously, further growth to what we believe could be north of $1 billion. And so the reason why, the reason to believe is there's just a ton of runway on this brand. I mean household penetration, #1, is still low. It's only about 11%. There's significant room for growth in household penetration. #2, we have not invested significantly in marketing. And so we have not turned on any significant consumer spend. And then there is runway even just on our core peanut butter and jelly [indiscernible] whether that's in particular places in U.S. retail, certain locations and Away From Home. We have not turned on Canada yet. And then there's obviously in the convenience channel.
So if you think about all of those plus the fact that we haven't done any really meaningful innovation, we just think there's a ton of growth opportunities and momentum for that brand."

We did raise both the low end and the high end of our guidance range by $0.10. That really is broken down as follows: we overdelivered our second quarter by $0.40, which was primarily driven by favorable business momentum and better-than-anticipated elasticities along with some cost savings; we anticipate an additional $0.30 in the back half from that ongoing momentum, being offset by $0.60 of additional cost partially offset by fourth quarter pricing actions. And so therefore, that $0.70 over delivery or increase to our expectation is being offset by $0.60 of cost price impact, therefore, supporting the dime that we increased both the low and the high end of the range. We do feel that we have a balanced guide at the midpoint at this point from both the top line standpoint and the bottom line that gives us a balance in delivering the fiscal year."

Our people have been extremely agile and been able to pivot and react or, in many cases, anticipate challenges before they happen. And so it's a combination fundamentally of detailed supply chain management and then the combination of both consumer and customer execution. So marketing and sales execution working together in concert along with our supply chain management, I think, has truly allowed us to continue to deliver consistently over the last few quarters."

And then lastly is we have seen increased costs since our last call, primarily in green coffee and in transportation, which is having us to take an additional round of pricing in our coffee portfolio and pet portfolio as well, and we believe that benefit will come through in Q4.

Do you take a more conservative view of elasticity as a result just all the pricing to the consumer and their -- what has been to this point, very strong growth in the brands?"

First and foremost, it's what I just said in Laurent's question about the -- on all cylinders of managing the supply chain through all of its dynamic changes as well as continuing to invest in our brands during this time, not cut marketing in a material way, but continuing to invest. We've had class marketing campaigns, notably Jif most recently as well as just store level execution to make sure that we do our best to work, trying to keep our brands in stock.
So I think it's those things plus what we believe is an ongoing tailwind of elevated at-home consumption given by the fact that folks are not going to go back to work the way that they once did. There is going to be, we believe, a hybrid work model that is going to keep people in their homes more than they used to. And so since we clearly are breakfast and lunch-oriented. That is definitely going to continue to support our business as well as, as you know, focusing on pet snacks, Milk-Bone alone was up 17% in the quarter.

Nutrish, specifically, albeit a relatively small portion did do well in the quarter with 1% total over the entire brand and actually dry dog saw about 1% growth, sorry, in the quarter.

And then and Bustelo, in coffee, both are -- have maintained their households. In fact, what we're seeing is that they are the 2 brands in the whole coffee category that have maintained both of double-digit. And so continuing to invest in those brands as well. And then finally, just on Folgers, as we know, the category continues to shift to K-Cups has done a great job just in terms of selling more brewers, and we think there's going to be probably a couple of million more brewers coming online. And our Folgers brand has been doing fantastic in the K-Cup space.
So just shifting our portfolio again to where the growth is, where the growth is going, has really benefited us."

So you already have consumers and you're trying to make sure you keep them in your brand franchises. That's an oversimplification, but sort of how we think about it. So you have to have both. The question more specifically about marketing was -- and I'll try to do this in the broadest terms, we needed to fundamentally think about we partnered with our external partners. We had many, many agencies, we essentially consolidated down to one. We partnered primarily with Publicis on consumer marketing. In doing so, it will afforded us the opportunity to [indiscernible] we are organized and line up with them and maybe most importantly, we really ensure that we were giving our partners the license to be -- to create very bold and consumer relevant creative. So the example I would use again is Jif. The most recent campaign where we have partnerships with Ludacris and [indiscernible] both rappers from 2 different eras. There was a TikTok rap challenge as part of that, which we actually earned 7 billion views, which is unbelievable. And certainly for us, as a company, in terms of the number of impressions that we made, but also probably a record in a number. I think [indiscernible], we're in the top 12 most influential campaigns this past year.
So clearly, this has been a journey over the last 3 years, the consumer marketing piece is definitely working. And now with the combination of a more focused and refined sales execution model. The combination of those 2 things is very powerful and again, a key to our success."

It really relates to half associated with overdelivery in our second quarter or $80 million. Of that $80 million, what we really saw was underlying business momentum against our brand and growth imperatives along with better-than-anticipated elasticities from our initial round of pricing actions over the summer and early fall. As we think about the back half of the fiscal year, we are anticipating incremental growth of $80 million against our prior expectations. The predominance of that is coming from continued momentum of volume mix and those better than -- elasticities.
However, in our fourth quarter, we do have significant pricing actions, particularly in coffee and to a lesser extent, in pets associated with cost inflation as a result of that additional round of pricing that will take place in the fourth quarter. We have factored in elasticities against that pricing wave or action. And so therefore, that is all factored into our guidance."

And it looks like that could essentially drive about sort of 1 point of sales growth for the overall company per year, I guess, or about half of Smucker's 2% annual organic growth target kind of on its own. So clearly, the brand is now big enough to sort of matter and move the needle.
And I guess my question is, with the brand now about -- at about 70% ACV, I guess, how are you thinking about driving the growth in this brand in terms of incremental distribution opportunities at current customers versus -- and expanding ACV by entering new customers?"

The first headline in response is that this is fundamentally about our strategy of investing where the growth is. In other words, we've talked about reshaping our portfolio, which is not only about M&A, but it's also about making sure that we're putting resources against our largest opportunities, and Uncrustables is clearly one of those. If you think about 30 consecutive quarters of growth, mostly -- and almost every one of those quarters has been double digit. This last quarter was about 33%. We're going to hit our $0.5 billion target a year early, which is fantastic. And that has been supported by the investment in our second facility in Longmont, Colorado, which we continue to invest in and add lines there to support getting to, of course, over $0.5 billion.
And yes, you're correct. The investment in the Alabama facility, which we will break ground on in the next couple of months, will support, obviously, further growth to what we believe could be north of $1 billion. And so the reasons why -- the reason to believe is there's just a ton of runway on this brand. I mean household penetration, number one, is still low. It's only about 11%. There's significant room for growth in household penetration. Number two, we have not invested significantly in marketing. And so we have not turned on any significant consumer spend.
And then there is runway even just on our core peanut butter and jelly offerings, whether that's in particular places in U.S. retail, certain locations and Away From Home. We have not turned on Canada yet. And then there's opportunities in the convenience channel. So if you think about all of those plus the fact that we haven't done any really meaningful innovation, we just think there's a ton of growth opportunities and momentum for that brand."

With regard to the inventory levels, what we are trying to do is make sure that we have the right both raw materials and finished goods within our network in order to ensure that we are in stock and on shelf and that we're also managing through supply chain challenges, shortages along with business continuity. And so in the near term, we should expect elevated levels of inventory.

Our people have been extremely agile and been able to pivot and react or, in many cases, anticipate challenges before they happen.

And the first one was just to understand in the quarter -- to understand how pricing is keeping pace with inflation. If we were to look at PNOC, pricing net of cost, would that -- that was up -- it was negative in the quarter. Are you seeing that catch up then in the second half of the year or -- so pricing should continue to accelerate? Or is it more so in the fourth quarter when more of that pricing kicks in?"

And so that is coming in to help support sort of the initial look that we had of cost inflation coming into the fiscal year. When we came through our first quarter, we had additional cost increases that we were seeing that we have taken subsequent rounds of pricing that we will start to see benefiting primarily the fourth quarter, to your point.
And then lastly is we have seen increased costs since our last call, primarily in green coffee and in transportation, which is having us to take an additional round of pricing in our coffee portfolio and pet portfolio as well, and we believe that benefit will come through in Q4. So to your point, yes, we are seeing a predominant of the benefit coming through our Q4, and then we will pick up sort of the lapping effect into the balance of FY '23."

And it's -- I guess, I'm just curious how you see the health of your core consumer today. I know it's a broad question and a broad view. But when we see the brands in general doing so well, your brands gaining share, private label losing share, we had some IRI data to confirm that again today. And this is all occurring amidst high level of pricing. So elasticities have been low and almost nonexistent for most companies. Does that change as we continue to move maybe into 2022? Do you take a more conservative view of elasticity as a result of just all the pricing to the consumer and their -- what has been to this point, very strong growth in the brands?"

But the success that we've experienced is a couple of things. First and foremost, it's what I just said in Laurent's question about the -- firing on all cylinders of managing the supply chain through all of its dynamic changes as well as continuing to invest in our brands during this time, not cut marketing in a material way, but continuing to invest. We've had some world-class marketing campaigns, notably Jif most recently, as well as just the store level execution to make sure that we do our best work, trying to keep our brands in stock.
So I think it's those things plus what we believe is an ongoing tailwind of elevated at-home consumption driven by the fact that folks are not going to go back to work the way that they once did. There is going to be, we believe, a hybrid work model that is going to keep people in their homes more than they used to. And so since we clearly are breakfast and lunch oriented, that is definitely going to continue to support our business as well as, as you know, focusing on pet snacks, Milk-Bone alone was up 17% in the quarter. So we've just had some very nice results supported by both our execution and then some of this, what we view as a persisting tailwind of at-home consumption."

Our pet strategy, you'll recall, is really contingent on 3 legs of the stool. The first and priority is pet snacks because we are the leader in pet snacks and continuing to direct resources to our pet snacks business. Our cat food business, where we are a solid #2, and Meow Mix has experienced significant growth, continues to see quarter-over-quarter growth even sequentially. And so those 2 clearly, where we have stronger leadership positions, are priorities.
And then, of course, the third leg is our dog food, where we are not as much in a leadership position and recognize that and acknowledged last quarter that we are not going to experience the same level of growth on our dog food business as we would on the other. But it still serves an important role. Nutrish, specifically, albeit a relatively small portion, did do well in the quarter with about 5% growth total over the entire brand. And actually, dry dog saw about 4 -- 1% growth, sorry, in the quarter. So we did experience some growth, and we remain committed, if you recall, to the entire Nutrish brand, which includes both snacks as well as some wet products as well.
And let me correct myself. I thought I was right, 4% was our growth on dry dog. So we did have a solid quarter on dry dog on Nutrish this quarter."

Part of that, too, is also just the discontinuity and the disruption of the overall supply chains that are factoring into that.
But as we see the balance of our fiscal year, we think it's -- it still continues to increase, but it's sort of increasing at a decreasing rate, and we're able to sort of get our arms around the balance of this fiscal year based on what we see to date.

But I think looking much and beyond our current fiscal year is probably not prudent at this time just as we continue to continue to understand the signals beyond the current fiscal year.

I think if you think about those components, those are probably going to persist for the foreseeable future. I think that's been a pretty consistent theme.
The way I would describe it is it's -- when I say dynamic, what we mean is the challenges that exist can change week to week, month to month. It could be an ingredient or a packaging component. At one point, it could be some isolated labor challenges in a particular geography. So it really is somewhat of a moving target. And the fact that we, about 6 months ago, did actually change some of our organization structure. We became a flatter organization, which truly has allowed us to be very agile and pivot to those -- to where we do see challenges very quickly.

I would -- what I would tell you in general is that less skilled labor, which sometimes would be -- some in distribution centers, is the labor that probably moves around the most and we see probably the most turnover. But again, I think we've been very agile at adapting to the challenges and been able to stay on top of things for the most part. But it is -- again, it varies and it can shift over time.
Pet snacks, I think in terms of a little bit more specifics, obviously, we have been supporting our pet snacks business with advertising, which has been very effective. And again, some of the other capabilities around sales at the store level have allowed us to remain in stock. And Milk-Bone, specifically, has been supported by some new innovation, which has actually done reasonably well also.

Our 1850 brand notably is still in the market and is sort of steady. And so our 1850 brand, which was a relatively big launch in coffee as an extension of Folgers, has done decent and remains in market. What we learned through that process is that you have to have a combination of smaller and larger bets and if you get the mix right, it works.
I would highlight that even when we have had stumbles, we -- our growth from new products has been consistent with our algorithm over time. And so even in the years where we feel like some of our larger bets may not have been as successful as we hoped, we still delivered against our growth algorithm on new products. And we really feel like right now, we've got the mix right. I've already mentioned several times about some of the Milk-Bone and some of the other innovation that we've been seeing and just getting that mix right. Jif Squeeze is another really good example of just taking peanut butter and putting in a different, more convenient packaging has been very successful as well. So it's just -- at the end of the day, it comes down to knowing your consumer and getting the balance right."

And what that means is mass media is important because it's all about reach. It's about reaching as many consumers as you can. Digital is more about targeted. So you already have consumers and you're trying to make sure you keep them in your brand franchises. That's an oversimplification, but that's sort of how we think about it. So you have to have both.
The question more specifically about marketing was, and I'll try to do this in the broadest terms. We needed to fundamentally think about how we partnered with our external partners. We had many, many agencies. We essentially consolidated down to one. We partnered primarily with Publicis on consumer marketing. In doing so, it afforded us the opportunity to restructure how we are organized and line up with them and maybe most importantly, really making sure that we were giving our partners the license to be -- to create very bold and consumer relevant creative.
So the example I would use again is Jif. The most recent campaign where we have partnerships with Ludacris and Gunna, both rappers from 2 different eras, there was a TikTok rap challenge as part of that, which we actually earned 7 billion views, which is unbelievable and certainly a record for us, as a company, in terms of the number of impressions that we made, but also probably a record in a number -- I think TikTok gave us -- we were in the top 12 most influential campaigns this past year.
So clearly, this has been a journey over the last 3 years. The consumer marketing piece is definitely working. And now with the combination of a more focused and refined sales execution model, the combination of those 2 things is very powerful and again, a key to our success."

Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. After a solid start to the fiscal year, our momentum continues across our businesses. Enabled by the extraordinary contributions of our people, we delivered second quarter results that exceeded our expectation",1428,"Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. After a solid start to the fiscal year, our momentum continues across our businesses. Enabled by the extraordinary contributions of our people, we delivered second quarter results that exceeded our expectations. Our performance through the first half of the fiscal year reflects the strength of our brands, our focus on execution, and our targeted response to a dynamic operating environment. Macroeconomic conditions remain volatile as supply chain disruptions and cost inflation persist. Our teams continue to navigate the challenging environment, execute our strategy and deliver exceptional results. We continue to see elevated at-home consumption trends that developed during the pandemic as consumers increasingly seek out brands they trust most. 
In the second quarter, net sales increased 1% versus the prior year. Excluding noncomparable net sales from divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales grew 8%, with every business outperforming our expectations. Organic net sales grew 6% on a 2-year CAGR basis, demonstrating growth across all 3 of our U.S. retail segments. 
We continue to successfully implement net pricing actions across our businesses and benefited from lower-than-anticipated elasticity. Strong demand for our brands was supported by our improved commercial execution and innovative marketing. As a result, adjusted earnings per share increased 2% benefiting from the top line growth and favorable spending, partially offset by increased costs. 
While top line growth is healthy, we continue to experience supply chain and transportation constraints along with isolated labor shortages. In addition, the extreme weather events earlier in the year and the rising cost environment are delaying incremental bottom line growth due to the disruption and timing of cost recovery through higher net pricing. We will continue to mitigate these pressures with additional inflation-justified pricing actions, including list price increases, trade spend optimization and revenue growth management strategies as well as productivity initiatives. 
The combination of strong underlying demand and effective pricing actions is allowing us to raise our net sales outlook for fiscal 2022 to be flat at the midpoint of our range, which reflects 4.5% comparable growth. We also increased our full year adjusted earnings per share expectation to be in the range of $8.35 to $8.75 as increased sales and productivity savings will help offset the continued inflationary dynamics. 
We are confident in our strategy and the strength of our brands, while our improved execution reinforces our ability to sustain our market share improvements. Brands that are growing or maintaining share accounted for 76% of of our U.S. retail sales in the second quarter, up from 48% during the same period a year ago.
Turning to our segment results. In Pet Foods, comparable net sales grew 7% versus the prior year. Growth was mostly driven by our cat food and market-leading dog snacks businesses, with net sales increases of 9% and 7% respectively while dog food grew 1%. Our dry cat food portfolio continues to outperform the category, as retail sales growth for the Meow Mix brand was nearly double the category rate leading to a 1.2 point market share gain in the quarter. Sales growth for dog snacks was led by the Milk-Bone brand, which grew 17% and outpaced the category in retail sales, reflecting benefits of net pricing and revenue growth management actions as well as volume growth supported by premium positioned innovation. 
In coffee, net sales growth of 8% was driven by all brands in our market-leading at-home coffee portfolio. Our portfolio gained over 0.5 point of dollar share in the quarter, more than any other manufacturer as we outpaced the category in all segments, including mainstream, premium, one cup and instant. Growth was led by Dunkin' and Café Bustelo, which grew 10% and 15% respectively in retail sales. 
In the K-Cup segment, we continue to grow at over 2.5x the category rate and gained over 1 point of share in the quarter. Our K-Cup growth was led by the Folgers brand, which delivered the largest share increase of any K-Cup brand in the category. We are confident in continued K-Cup growth as household penetration for new brewers is expected to increase by 2 million households annually. 
We remain optimistic in the momentum for our total coffee portfolio. At-home coffee habits formed during the pandemic continue to persist, as at-home consumption now represents 72% of all coffee drinking occasions compared to 2/3 pre-pandemic. 
In our Consumer Foods business, we delivered strong results across all categories. Comparable net sales grew 9%. Growth was driven by another quarter of net sales growth across all our key brands, including Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches, Jif peanut butter, and Smucker's fruit spreads and toppings. Total company net sales for Uncrustables, including Away From Home, were approximately $140 million this quarter, the 30th consecutive quarter of growth for the brand. The brand generated sales of nearly $490 million over the past 4 quarters and is on track to exceed $500 million this fiscal year, a full year ahead of our stated target. 
Given the momentum we are seeing in the business and investments we are making to more than double production capacity, over the next 5 years, we expect to grow Smucker's Uncrustables to $1 billion in annual net sales. This is still a powerful growth opportunity for our company, both for the near term and long term. To support this growth, Phase 2 of construction at our Longmont, Colorado facility remains on track for completion by the end of next fiscal year, which will support double-digit top line growth for the next several years. Last week, we announced that we will begin construction on a third production location in Alabama that is expected to begin operations in calendar year 2025, further supporting our long-term growth opportunity. 
In peanut butter, the Jif brand grew net sales by 5% in the quarter, building upon double-digit growth last year. Our total peanut butter market share increased nearly 2 points versus the prior year and grew to 49%. Consumption remains strong, and we anticipate lasting benefits from distribution gained in recent shelf resets, although we do expect year-over-year market share growth to moderate as competitive supply begins to normalize in the third quarter. 
We delivered strong top line performance across our U.S. retail businesses along with a robust recovery for our away from home business, which delivered 25% comparable net sales growth. Our Away From Home business sales have reached approximately 95% of pre-pandemic levels, as growth for Smucker's Uncrustables and market share gains in liquid coffee and portion control spreads have been significant contributors to the recovery. Notably, the introduction of Jif branded portion control spreads has supported recent growth and share gains. 
Across all our businesses, our second quarter results demonstrate the significant progress we've made against our execution priorities, which include driving commercial excellence, streamlining our cost infrastructure, reshaping our portfolio for faster growth and unleashing our organization to win. Some of our key accomplishments against these priorities include demonstrating our ability to navigate complex supply chain challenges and leverage our improved commercial model and investments in data capabilities to deliver improved in-store fundamentals and in-stock performance for our brands. Also successfully implementing significant inflation-justified pricing actions across all businesses with lower-than-anticipated elasticity impacts. Our marketing transformation continued delivering results as our new breakthrough social media campaign, the Jif Rap challenge, which features rap icons Ludacris and Gunna, was viewed more than 7 billion times on TikTok. Also growing or maintaining share for over 75% of our U.S. retail revenues in the quarter. 
And we announced a significant multiyear investment to enable sustained long-term growth for our Smucker's Uncrustables brand. This is just one example of where we continue increasing our focus and resources to reshape our portfolio towards sustainable growth in the excellent categories of pet food and pet snacks, coffee and snacking. 
As we look ahead, we are committed to the delivery of our business as we continue to support our Thriving Together agenda, which helps improve the quality of life for people and pets by supporting access to quality food and education, connections with community resources, the equitable and ethical treatment for all people and animals, and a healthier planet.
In closing, we continue to have strong conviction in our strategy, with this quarter demonstrating our momentum and improved execution in a dynamic environment, while taking actions to strengthen our company to support long-term sales and profit growth and shareholder value creation. Our success continues to be powered by our unique culture and our dedicated employees, who I would like to thank for their outstanding contributions.
I'll now turn the discussion over to Tucker."

Then I'll provide details on our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2022. 
Net sales increased 1%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales increased 8%. The increase in comparable net sales was primarily due to favorable volume mix and higher net price realization across each of the U.S. retail segments. In addition, the Away From Home business continues to recover from pandemic-related headwinds and contributed favorable volume mix. 
Adjusted gross profit decreased $56 million or 7% from the prior year. This was primarily driven by higher costs for commodities, manufacturing, transportation and packaging as well as lapping the noncomparable divested profit in the prior year. These headwinds were partially offset by increased pricing and favorable volume/mix. 
Adjusted operating income decreased $21 million or 5%, reflecting the gross profit decline, partially offset by favorable SD&A expenses. Within SD&A, general and administrative expenses decreased $27 million or 21%. This primarily reflects benefits of our organization redesign in the fourth quarter of the prior year and lapping higher incentive compensation and reinstatement of salary increases in the prior year. 
Below operating income, interest expense decreased $5 million, primarily due to reduced debt outstanding as compared to the prior year. Further, the adjusted effective income tax rate was 23.5% compared to 24%. Weighted average shares outstanding were 108.4 million versus 114.2 million, reflecting shares repurchased in the third and fourth quarters of the prior year. Factoring all this in, second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.43 compared to $2.39, an increase of 2% from the prior year.
Turning to our segment results. U.S. Retail Pet Foods net sales decreased 1% versus the prior year. Net sales increased 7% excluding the noncomparable divestiture impact. This was driven by increased net pricing across the portfolio and favorable volume/mix for dog snacks, private label offerings, and cat food, partially offset by declines for dog food. higher commodity, manufacturing and transportation costs, partially offset by initial higher net pricing actions, led Pet Foods segment profit to decline 20%.
Turning to the U.S. Retail Coffee segment, net sales increased 8% versus the prior year, driven by a 5 percentage point increase from volume/mix and a 3 percentage point increase from higher net pricing. Growth occurred across all brands and formats in the portfolio, led by the Dunkin' growth of 14%, Folgers growth of 4%, and Café Bustelo growth of 18%. Our K-Cup portfolio continues to be a key growth driver for our portfolio, as sales increased 20% and accounted for over 30% of the segment's net sales. Coffee segment profit increased 3%, reflecting higher net pricing and favorable volume mix, partially offset by higher green coffee costs. 
In U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, net sales decreased 8%. Excluding the non-comparable net sales for the divested Crisco business, net sales increased 9% versus the prior year. This was driven by volume/mix growth of 6% and 3 percentage points from higher net pricing. Growth was led by Uncrustables frozen sandwiches, which grew 33%. The Jif brand grew 5%, and Smucker's fruit spreads grew 3%. 
Consumer Foods segment profit decreased 18% due to lapping the prior year noncomparable profit from the divested business. Comparable segment profit growth from volume/mix and higher net pricing was partially offset by higher costs related to manufacturing, transportation, ingredients and packaging. 
Lastly, in International and Away From Home, net sales increased 4%. Excluding noncomparable net sales in the prior year for the divested business and foreign exchange, net sales increased 6%. The Away From Home business increased 25% on a comparable basis, driven by double-digit growth for coffee, Uncrustables frozen sandwiches and portion control spreads. The international business declined 10% on a comparable basis, primarily due to lapping significant pandemic-related at-home consumption for the Canadian baking business. 
Overall, International Away-From-Home segment profit increased 2% primarily reflecting increased contribution from volume/mix, higher net pricing and favorable foreign exchange. This was partially offset by higher commodity costs and the noncomparable profit from the divested Crisco business. 
Second quarter free cash flow was $106 million compared to $326 million in the prior year. This reflects a decrease in cash provided by operating activities due to greater working capital requirements driven by the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities as well as a reduction in net income adjusted for noncash items. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $59 million compared to $52 million in the prior year and represents 2.9% of net sales. 
During the quarter, we issued $800 million of senior notes. The net proceeds were primarily used to repay $750 million of senior notes that were due in October. Based on a total debt balance of $4.6 billion and a trailing 12-month EBITDA of approximately $1.7 billion, our leverage ratio stands at 2.8x. We anticipate maintaining a strong balance sheet and leverage ratio, enabling a balanced capital deployment model, which includes strategic reinvestment in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions, while returning cash to shareholders through increasing dividends and evaluating share repurchases over time.
Let me now provide additional color on our revised outlook for fiscal 2022. The pandemic and related implications, along with cost inflation and volatility in supply chains, continue to impact financial results and cause uncertainty and risk for the fiscal year 2022 outlook. Any manufacturing or supply chain disruption, inclusive of any labor shortages whether related to illness, vaccine requirements or other factors; as well as changes in consumer mobility and purchasing behavior, retailer inventory levels and macroeconomic conditions could materially impact actual results. We continue to focus on managing the elements we can control, including taking the necessary steps to minimize the impact of cost inflation and any business or labor disruption. We continue to plan for unforeseen volatility while ensuring we have contingency plans in place. This guidance reflects performance expectations based on the company's current understanding of the overall environment. 
We increased our full year net sales expectation to be flat compared to the prior year at the midpoint of our guidance range. On a comparable basis, net sales are anticipated to increase approximately 4.5%, demonstrating the continued momentum for our business and brands. This reflects benefits from higher pricing actions across most of our portfolio, primarily to recover increased commodity, ingredient, transportation and packaging costs, along with double-digit volume growth for the Smucker's Uncrustables brand and a recovery in away-from-home channels. These tailwinds are being partially offset by reduced volume/mix, inclusive of a deceleration in at-home consumption trends and anticipated pricing elasticities mostly impacting the back half of the year as well as supply chain disruption primarily impacting our wet pet food business. The increase in our net sales guidance versus our previous expectation reflects stronger-than-anticipated demand in the second quarter and for the remainder of the fiscal year, inclusive of lower price elasticity and incremental pricing actions, notably due to sustained inflation for green coffee.
We now anticipate adjusted gross profit margin of approximately 35% to 35.5% This reflects our expectations for higher net pricing, cost and productivity savings, and a mix benefit associated with the divestitures being more than offset by higher cost inflation. We have updated our assumptions to reflect ongoing cost inflation and the timing of additional pricing actions. We will experience higher costs for the remainder of the fiscal year, most notably due to green coffee and transportation. We also anticipate additional manufacturing expenses primarily for labor and business continuity plans. 
Gross margin is expected to decline sequentially over 150 basis points in the third quarter before improving in the fourth quarter as incremental pricing is reflected. Cost inflation is now anticipated to have a low double-digit impact on the total cost of products sold for the fiscal year. 
SD&A expenses are now projected to decrease by approximately 7%. This reflects the benefits of our cost management and organizational restructuring programs, lower marketing expense primarily due to lapping elevated investments in the fourth quarter of the prior year, reduced incentive compensation, and reductions in discretionary expenses. Total marketing spend is anticipated to be approximately 6% of net sales, reflecting the impact of higher sales and a slight reduction in planned spend as we continue to maximize productivity for our high-growth priorities and optimize spend in areas with tighter capacity. 
We continue to anticipate net interest expense of approximately $165 million, net other expense of $20 million, and adjusted effective income tax rate of 24%, and a full year weighted average shares outstanding of 108.3 million. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we anticipate full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.35 to $8.75, a $0.10 increase to our previous guidance range. 
Given the timing of cost increases and recovery through both initial higher net pricing actions, and additional net pricing actions later in the fiscal year, earnings are expected to decline in the third quarter approximately 15% to 20%. The fourth quarter is expected to grow approximately 15% to 20%, reflecting higher net pricing catching up to higher costs as well as the lapping of around $40 million of incremental marketing spend in the prior year. 
Free cash flow is now anticipated to be $700 million, which reflects the adjustment to earnings expectations, increased working capital considerations primarily for inventory, and capital expenditures of $400 million. The increase in capital expenditures versus our previous guidance reflects the new investment to support the growth for our Smucker's Uncrustables brand.
In closing, we remain confident in our strategy and are pleased with the continued momentum for our business and brands. We are taking the appropriate actions to ensure continued operational excellence, while managing through this volatile environment. And we remain in a strong financial position to deliver sustainable and consistent long-term growth for our shareholders.
Finally, I want to express my appreciation for our employees. They have demonstrated their commitment to executing with excellence through unprecedented circumstances. Their outstanding work and passion for our company positions us for continued success. Thank you."

Turning to our segment results. In Pet Foods, comparable net sales grew 7% versus the prior year. Growth was mostly driven by our cat food and market-leading dog snacks businesses, with net sales increases of 9% and 7%, respectively, while dog food grew 1%. Our dry cat food portfolio continues to outperform the category as retail sales growth for the Meow Mix brand was nearly double the category rate leading to a 1.2 point market share gain in the quarter.

In Coffee, net sales growth of 8% was driven by all brands in our market-leading at-home coffee portfolio. Our portfolio gained over 0.5 point of dollar share in the quarter, more than any other manufacturer as we outpaced the category in all segments, including mainstream, premium, one cup and instant.

In the K-Cup segment, we continue to grow at over 2.5x the category rate and gained over 1 point of share in the quarter. Our K-Cup growth was led by the Folgers brand, which delivered the largest share increase of any K-Cup brand in the category. We are confident in continued K-Cup growth as household penetration for new brewers is expected to increase by 2 million households annually. We remain optimistic in the momentum for our total coffee portfolio. At-home coffee habits formed during the pandemic continue to persist, as at-home consumption now represents 72% of all coffee drinking occasions compared to 2/3 pre-pandemic.  
In our Consumer Foods business, we delivered strong results across all categories. Comparable net sales grew 9%. Growth was driven by another quarter of net sales growth across all our key brands, including Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches, Jif peanut butter, and Smucker's fruit spreads and toppings. Total company net sales for Uncrustables, including Away From Home, were approximately $140 million this quarter, the 30th consecutive quarter of growth for the brand. The brand generated sales of nearly $490 million over the past 4 quarters and is on track to exceed $500 million this fiscal year, a full year ahead of our stated target.  
Given the momentum we are seeing in the business and investments we are making to more than double production capacity, over the next 5 years, we expect to grow Smucker's Uncrustables to $1 billion in annual net sales. This is still a powerful growth opportunity for our company, both for the near term and long term. To support this growth, Phase 2 of construction at our Longmont, Colorado facility remains on track for completion by the end of next fiscal year, which will support double-digit top line growth for the next several years. Last week, we announced that we will begin construction on a third production location in Alabama that is expected to begin operations in calendar year 2025, further supporting our long-term growth opportunity.  
In peanut butter, the Jif brand grew net sales by 5% in the quarter, building upon double-digit growth last year. Our total peanut butter market share increased nearly 2 points versus the prior year and grew to 49%. Consumption remains strong, and we anticipate lasting benefits from distribution gained in recent shelf resets, although we do expect year-over-year market share growth to moderate as competitive supply begins to normalize in the third quarter.  
We delivered strong top line performance across our U.S. retail businesses along with a robust recovery for our Away From Home business, which delivered 25% comparable net sales growth. Our Away From Home business sales have reached approximately 95% of pre-pandemic levels, as growth for Smucker's Uncrustables and market share gains in liquid coffee and portion control spreads have been significant contributors to the recovery. Notably, the introduction of Jif branded portion control spreads has supported recent growth and share gains.  
Across all our businesses, our second quarter results demonstrate the significant progress we've made against our execution priorities, which include driving commercial excellence, streamlining our cost infrastructure, reshaping our portfolio for faster growth and unleashing our organization to win. Some of our key accomplishments against these priorities include demonstrating our ability to navigate complex supply chain challenges and leverage our improved commercial model and investments in data capabilities to deliver improved in-store fundamentals and in-stock performance for our brands. Also successfully implementing significant inflation-justified pricing actions across all businesses with lower-than-anticipated elasticity impacts. Our marketing transformation continued delivering results as our new breakthrough social media campaign, the Jif rap challenge, which features rap icons Ludacris and Gunna, was viewed more than 7 billion times on TikTok. Also growing or maintaining share for over 75% of our U.S. retail revenues in the quarter. And we announced a significant multiyear investment to enable sustained long-term growth for our Smucker's Uncrustables brand. This is just one example of where we continue increasing our focus and resources to reshape our portfolio towards sustainable growth in the excellent categories of pet food and pet snacks, coffee and snacking.  
As we look ahead, we are committed to the delivery of our business as we continue to support our Thriving Together agenda, which helps improve the quality of life for people and pets by supporting access to quality food and education, connections with community resources, the equitable and ethical treatment for all people and animals, and a healthier planet. 
In closing, we continue to have strong conviction in our strategy, with this quarter demonstrating our momentum and improved execution in a dynamic environment, while taking actions to strengthen our company to support long-term sales and profit growth and shareholder value creation. Our success continues to be powered by our unique culture and our dedicated employees, who I would like to thank for their outstanding contributions. 
I'll now turn the discussion over to Tucker."

Excluding the impact of divestitures and for",1670,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. First, I'll begin by giving an overview of second quarter results. Then I'll provide details on our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2022.  
Net sales increased 1%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales increased 8%. The increase in comparable net sales was primarily due to favorable volume/mix and higher net price realization across each of the U.S. retail segments. In addition, the Away From Home business continues to recover from pandemic-related headwinds and contributed favorable volume/mix.  
Adjusted gross profit decreased $56 million or 7% from the prior year. This was primarily driven by higher costs for commodities, manufacturing, transportation and packaging as well as lapping the noncomparable divested profit in the prior year. These headwinds were partially offset by increased pricing and favorable volume/mix.  
Adjusted operating income decreased $21 million or 5%, reflecting the gross profit decline, partially offset by favorable SD&A expenses. Within SD&A, general and administrative expenses decreased $27 million or 21%. This primarily reflects benefits of our organization redesign in the fourth quarter of the prior year and lapping higher incentive compensation and reinstatement of salary increases in the prior year.  
Below operating income, interest expense decreased $5 million, primarily due to reduced debt outstanding as compared to the prior year. Further, the adjusted effective income tax rate was 23.5% compared to 24%. Weighted average shares outstanding were 108.4 million versus 114.2 million, reflecting shares repurchased in the third and fourth quarters of the prior year. Factoring all this in, second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.43 compared to $2.39, an increase of 2% from the prior year. 
Turning to our segment results. U.S. Retail Pet Foods net sales decreased 1% versus the prior year. Net sales increased 7% excluding the noncomparable divestiture impact. This was driven by increased net pricing across the portfolio and favorable volume/mix for dog snacks, private label offerings, and cat food, partially offset by declines for dog food. Higher commodity, manufacturing and transportation costs, partially offset by initial higher net pricing actions, led Pet Foods segment profit to decline 20%. 
Turning to the U.S. Retail Coffee segment, net sales increased 8% versus the prior year, driven by a 5 percentage point increase from volume/mix and a 3 percentage point increase from higher net pricing. Growth occurred across all brands and formats in the portfolio, led by the Dunkin' growth of 14%, Folgers growth of 4%, and Café Bustelo growth of 18%. Our K-Cup portfolio continues to be a key growth driver for our portfolio, as sales increased 20% and accounted for over 30% of the segment's net sales. Coffee segment profit increased 3%, reflecting higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, partially offset by higher green coffee costs.  
In U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, net sales decreased 8%. Excluding the non-comparable net sales for the divested Crisco business, net sales increased 9% versus the prior year. This was driven by volume/mix growth of 6% and 3 percentage points from higher net pricing. Growth was led by Uncrustables frozen sandwiches, which grew 33%. The Jif brand grew 5%, and Smucker's Fruit Spreads grew 3%.  
Consumer Foods segment profit decreased 18% due to lapping the prior year noncomparable profit from the divested business. Comparable segment profit growth from volume/mix and higher net pricing was partially offset by higher costs related to manufacturing, transportation, ingredients and packaging.  
Lastly, in International and Away From Home, net sales increased 4%. Excluding noncomparable net sales in the prior year for the divested business and foreign exchange, net sales increased 6%. The Away From Home business increased 25% on a comparable basis, driven by double-digit growth for coffee, Uncrustables frozen sandwiches and portion control spreads. The international business declined 10% on a comparable basis, primarily due to lapping significant pandemic-related at-home consumption for the Canadian baking business.  
Overall, International Away-From-Home segment profit increased 2% primarily reflecting increased contribution from volume/mix, higher net pricing and favorable foreign exchange. This was partially offset by higher commodity costs and the noncomparable profit from the divested Crisco business.  
Second quarter free cash flow was $106 million compared to $326 million in the prior year. This reflects a decrease in cash provided by operating activities due to greater working capital requirements driven by the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities as well as a reduction in net income adjusted for noncash items. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $59 million compared to $52 million in the prior year and represents 2.9% of net sales.  
During the quarter, we issued $800 million of senior notes. The net proceeds were primarily used to repay $750 million of senior notes that were due in October. Based on a total debt balance of $4.6 billion and a trailing 12-month EBITDA of approximately $1.7 billion, our leverage ratio stands at 2.8x. We anticipate maintaining a strong balance sheet and leverage ratio, enabling a balanced capital deployment model, which includes strategic reinvestment in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions, while returning cash to shareholders through increasing dividends and evaluating share repurchases over time. 
Let me now provide additional color on our revised outlook for fiscal 2022. The pandemic and related implications, along with cost inflation and volatility in supply chains, continue to impact financial results and cause uncertainty and risk for the fiscal year 2022 outlook. Any manufacturing or supply chain disruption, inclusive of any labor shortages whether related to illness, vaccine requirements or other factors; as well as changes in consumer mobility and purchasing behavior, retailer inventory levels and macroeconomic conditions could materially impact actual results. We continue to focus on managing the elements we can control, including taking the necessary steps to minimize the impact of cost inflation and any business or labor disruption. We continue to plan for unforeseen volatility while ensuring we have contingency plans in place. This guidance reflects performance expectations based on the company's current understanding of the overall environment.  
We increased our full year net sales expectation to be flat compared to the prior year at the midpoint of our guidance range. On a comparable basis, net sales are anticipated to increase approximately 4.5%, demonstrating the continued momentum for our business and brands. This reflects benefits from higher pricing actions across most of our portfolio, primarily to recover increased commodity, ingredient, transportation and packaging costs, along with double-digit volume growth for the Smucker's Uncrustables brand and a recovery in away-from-home channels. These tailwinds are being partially offset by reduced volume/mix, inclusive of a deceleration in at-home consumption trends and anticipated pricing elasticities mostly impacting the back half of the year as well as supply chain disruption primarily impacting our wet pet food business. The increase in our net sales guidance versus our previous expectation reflects stronger-than-anticipated demand in the second quarter and for the remainder of the fiscal year, inclusive of lower price elasticity and incremental pricing actions, notably due to sustained inflation for green coffee. 
We now anticipate adjusted gross profit margin of approximately 35% to 35.5% This reflects our expectations for higher net pricing, cost and productivity savings, and a mix benefit associated with the divestitures being more than offset by higher cost inflation. We have updated our assumptions to reflect ongoing cost inflation and the timing of additional pricing actions. We will experience higher costs for the remainder of the fiscal year, most notably due to green coffee and transportation. We also anticipate additional manufacturing expenses primarily for labor and business continuity plans.  
Gross margin is expected to decline sequentially over 150 basis points in the third quarter before improving in the fourth quarter as incremental pricing is reflected. Cost inflation is now anticipated to have a low double-digit impact on the total cost of products sold for the fiscal year.  
SD&A expenses are now projected to decrease by approximately 7%. This reflects the benefits of our cost management and organizational restructuring programs, lower marketing expense primarily due to lapping elevated investments in the fourth quarter of the prior year, reduced incentive compensation, and reductions in discretionary expenses. Total marketing spend is anticipated to be approximately 6% of net sales, reflecting the impact of higher sales and a slight reduction in planned spend as we continue to maximize productivity for our high-growth priorities and optimize spend in areas with tighter capacity.  
We continue to anticipate net interest expense of approximately $165 million, net other expense of $20 million, and adjusted effective income tax rate of 24%, and a full year weighted average shares outstanding of 108.3 million.  
Taking all these factors into consideration, we anticipate full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.35 to $8.75, a $0.10 increase to our previous guidance range.  
Given the timing of cost increases and recovery through both initial higher net pricing actions, and additional net pricing actions later in the fiscal year, earnings are expected to decline in the third quarter approximately 15% to 20%. The fourth quarter is expected to grow approximately 15% to 20%, reflecting higher net pricing catching up to higher costs as well as the lapping of around $40 million of incremental marketing spend in the prior year.  
Free cash flow is now anticipated to be $700 million, which reflects the adjustment to earnings expectations, increased working capital considerations primarily for inventory, and capital expenditures of $400 million. The increase in capital expenditures versus our previous guidance reflects the new investment to support the growth for our Smucker's Uncrustables brand. 
In closing, we remain confident in our strategy and are pleased with the continued momentum for our business and brands. We are taking the appropriate actions to ensure continued operational excellence, while managing through this volatile environment. And we remain in a strong financial position to deliver sustainable and consistent long-term growth for our shareholders. 
Finally, I want to express my appreciation for our employees. They have demonstrated their commitment to executing with excellence through unprecedented circumstances. Their outstanding work and passion for our company positions us for continued success. Thank you."
