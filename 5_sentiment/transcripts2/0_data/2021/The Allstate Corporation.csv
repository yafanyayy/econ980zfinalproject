Amidst the pandemic, Allstate delivered really attractive returns while building higher growth business models in 2020. Exceptional progress is made building higher growth business models to execute our strategy of",1124,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us. Amidst the pandemic, Allstate delivered really attractive returns while building higher growth business models in 2020. Exceptional progress is made building higher growth business models to execute our strategy of increasing market share in personal property-liability and expanding protection offered to customers. And as you know, one of our key focuses this year was transitioning the personal property-liability business to higher growth. We took decisive action. And despite the operational complexity of these actions, maintained Allstate brand property-liability policies in force. We'll take you through a reconciliation of the various components of this, and you'll see the path to growth. We made excellent progress in expanding protection offered to customers with total policies in force increasing by 20.5% to nearly $176 million. 
We took advantage of the decline in auto where you can see auto accident frequency and our cost reductions to improve our competitive price position in auto insurance while maintaining attractive returns. The acquisition of National General is expected to increase auto insurance market share by 1 percentage point in 2021 and provides another platform for growth as we expand its product breadth. These changes position Allstate for sustainable long-term growth. At the same time, Allstate generated strong profitability and returns in 2020. 
Net income was $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, and adjusted net income was $1.8 billion or $5.87 per diluted share. This was driven by lower frequency of auto accident, continued strong profitability of homeowners insurance and higher performance-based investment income. Net income was $5.5 billion and adjusted net income was $4.6 billion for the year. This represents a 19.8% return on equity, far in excess of most insurance companies. Our strategy to increase market share in personal Property-Liability while expanding protection services to customers will increase shareholder value. Higher Property-Liability growth with attractive returns, rapidly growing protection services expand our total addressable market. And this growth, combined with our proactive capital deployment strategy, supports returns on equity above the insurance industry and are comparable to the S&P 500. 
Slide 3 is there to touch base on the strategy on. So we're not going to spend time on that. So let's move to Slide 4 and discuss this strategy as it relates to the Property-Liability business. A transformative growth has become more than a plane. It's about creating a business model, capabilities and culture that continually transform to deliver market share growth. This is done by focusing on the customer, expanding access and improving value. Expanding access includes all the ways customers choose to interact, exclusive agents directly through call centers of the web and independent agents. The largest part of this change was transitioning our exclusive agent and direct businesses that operate under the Allstate brand. This gave us the ability to lower costs, leverage scale and increase advertising. This transaction is successfully being implemented, and we achieved key milestones in 2020. We were pleased with new business growth from existing Allstate agents who remain key to serving our customers and growing. Property-Liability business from existing agents met our goals, except for the pandemic slowdown in March and April where, of course, nobody was buying anything, as we shifted commission to new sales from retention. 
We're testing new agent models with less real estate and more efficient service enabled by technology with the goal of having strong local personal relationships with customers. These models will also create learnings to enable existing agents to achieve higher growth. As a result of that, we did stop appointing new Allstate agents in early 2020 while a higher growth in lower cost models being developed. This had a negative impact on points of presence and new business sales. At the same time, we increased direct sales. The net was that overall policies in force remained the same through the transition despite a drop in retention, which was concurrent with the ending of the special payment plans related to the pandemic. Glenn will take you through that reconciliation in a couple of minutes. 
The acquisition of National General in January also improves growth prospects. And as you know, this is essentially a reverse merger. The National General team is joining Allstate and they're consolidating our independent agent businesses, encompassing AIA into their operational and technology platform. Then we're going to be able to broaden National General's product portfolio using Allstate standard auto and homeowners insurance capabilities, which will create growth through independent agents. We also made great progress at improving customer value last year. From a customer value standpoint, we've maintained attractive margins through cost reductions while investing in growth. This includes improving the competitive price position of auto insurance through targeted rate reductions and a direct pricing discount. And while most of these changes are due to the lower frequency of auto actions, we are also reducing cost to ensure we continue to generate attractive margins. We're also expanding our industry-leading telematics offerings, Drivewise and Milewise, to further improve our value proposition and improving pricing sophistication. We're the only company that major companies selling Milewise, which is very attractive to customers today because they're not driving as much. 
Our goal is not just to execute this plan but to continually generate transformational growth. We have the brand, market position, resources, capabilities and strategy to deliver this for shareholders. An extensive Allstate agent platform delivers more value per dollar to customers and competitors; a direct business utilizing the Allstate brand, competitive prices, broad product offerings and our insurance expertise; an independent agent business with national distribution and a strong position in both auto and homeowners insurance; and protection services with innovative business models and expanding total addressable markets. We're well on our way to achieving this goal after putting the foundational elements into place last year. 
Let's move to Slide 4 to discuss Allstate's excellent financial performance in 2020. Revenues of $12 billion in the fourth quarter increased 4.8% to the prior year quarter, with total revenues for the year reaching $44.8 billion, which is primarily driven by higher premiums earned, which is partially offset then by lower net investment income. Net income was $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter and $5.5 billion for the full year 2020. Adjusted net income was $1.8 billion or $5.87 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted net income increased to $4.6 billion or $14.73 per diluted share. We had strong profitability in both auto and homeowners insurance. 
Adjusted net income return on equity is 19.8% over the last 12 months, exceeding our range of 14% to 17%, which is near the top of the insurance industry. 
Now I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss the transition of the Property-Liability businesses to higher growth."
18711,642897835,2191726,"The Allstate Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Slide 6. We'll discuss how Allstate is increasing Property-Liability market share while maintaining attractive returns. With the foundational work completed in 2020, Allstate is positioned to grow market share in '21 while develop",1180,"Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Slide 6. We'll discuss how Allstate is increasing Property-Liability market share while maintaining attractive returns. With the foundational work completed in 2020, Allstate is positioned to grow market share in '21 while developing a leading position in all 3 primary distribution channels in Property-Liability. Some of the actions taken in '20 have impacted growth in the near term, but they were critical to advancing transformative growth in the longer term. 
Starting with Allstate exclusive agents who serve customers that value local advice and relationships, we're focused on accelerating growth and improving efficiency. Allstate agents continue to be a core strength of our organization. We're further strengthening that model by focusing on new business growth and lowering costs by improving marketing effectiveness, centralizing customer services and enhancing customer connectivity. Leveraging Esurance's direct capabilities under the Allstate brand, we've created an omnichannel experience that meets the customer where, how and when they want to interact with us. We completed the integration of direct processes and systems in 2020 and expect direct sold business to continue to accelerate. As Tom mentioned, National General is another exciting growth platform for us. I mean National General's independent agent facing technology, it's among the best in the industry, and then our combined agency footprint covers the vast majority of the U.S. market. So as we expand products on the National General platform, we're going to be in a position to grow share in the IA channel. The totality of this go-to-market model with strong capabilities in each distribution channel is designed to generate higher growth. Allstate's leading pricing and claims capabilities, including our strength in telematics, puts us in a strong competitive position. We're also enhancing our price competitiveness while maintaining attractive returns. The impact of the pandemic on miles driven and lower costs for auto losses gave us an opportunity to improve auto affordability through targeted rate reductions. We've also lowered underwriting expenses, as Tom mentioned. They're down 1.9 points over the last 2 years when excluding restructuring and coronavirus-related expenses. These efficiencies, and continued cost structure reductions, allow us to improve pricing relative to competitors while generating excellent returns. 
Allstate has a strong record of profitability across lines of business and in different market conditions. The average combined ratio in auto insurance over the last 5 years was 94.4, and that excludes, obviously, 2020 results, which were influenced by the pandemic. We're equally strong at homeowners, where we averaged a combined ratio of 89.5 over the last 5 years. And that reflects the higher cost of capital or the higher capital requirements, I should say, in homeowners product versus auto. The point is we expect to grow and we expect to earn really attractive returns. 
So let's go to Slide 7, and we're going to discuss National General, the acquisition in a little more detail. On January 4, Allstate closed the $4 billion acquisition of National General. We are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead with National General and how this advances our strategy to grow personal lines. And it gives us an estimated increase of over 1 percentage point of total personal Property-Liability market share. Allstate is now a top 5 personal lines carrier in the IA channel with significantly better competitive position. We utilize National General as our independent agent platform by consolidating our encompass and Allstate independent agency operations into the new entity, which will be branded National General and Allstate company. We expect to grow by rolling out new standard auto and homeowners insurance offerings starting later this year and completing countrywide deployment in less than 2 years. Consistent with past acquisitions, we've developed measures of success, and we're showing those in the bottom of this slide. First, we expect the acquisition to be accretive with growing earnings, adding to returns and total profit. Second, we expect to achieve synergies by consolidating the 3 IA channel businesses into 1, improving our competitive position. Third, we'll grow IA channel policies in force by broadening the product offering to fully meet customer needs for auto, home, other personal lines and from nonstandard to middle market to mass affluent. We'll continue to provide updates on our success in this channel as we report our National General brand results in the first quarter. 
Moving to Slide 8, let's go deeper into how we've strengthened Allstate branded Property-Liability distribution. As we said before, some of the actions we took in 2020 negatively impacted near-term growth while accelerating it in other areas. We supported Allstate agents to increase new business growth in 2020, with the exception of March and April, the beginning of the pandemic when things slowed down. At the same time, we stopped appointing new Allstate agents while higher growth and lower cost models are being developed, and that had a negative impact on new business. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we expect the new models are going to create learnings that enable our existing agents to achieve higher growth, too. The chart on the lower left breaks down Allstate's personal auto new business applications compared to the prior year. If you exclude the declines in March and April due to the pandemic, Allstate brand-new business increased with an improving trajectory throughout the year. The red bar on the far left of the chart shows the estimated unfavorable impact of the pandemic on new business in March and April. Moving to the right, you can see the negative impact of stopping new agent appointments during 2020, but that was partially offset by an increase in existing EA production. And that shows the viability of growth with those existing agents when we just made a slight compensation change towards new business from renewal. They just have a great opportunity to grow. 
Moving to the center of the chart. The total direct channel increased compared to prior year, and this is the combined Allstate and Esurance view. And it's because Allstate brand direct applications more than offset the decline in Esurance brand. That reflects the redirection of branding investments and resources from Esurance to Allstate brand. We expect continued growth in the direct channel as we optimize web and call center sales capabilities. A relatively small number of independent agents operate under the Allstate brand and had a small positive impact on overall growth but a really nice percentage increase among that group. And it highlights the growth opportunity we have going forward in the IA channel as we transition those appointments to National General over time, expand National General's product offerings upmarket and endorse the brand as an Allstate company. The overall Allstate and Esurance policies in force maintained prior year levels in 2020.as we manage through significant change in our operating model and had a small decrease in retention levels, which you can see all of that in the lower right. Total Property-Liability policies in force declined slightly, driven by the Encompass brand, which will be integrated in the National General's platform in 2021. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mario to discuss the rest of our quarterly results."
18711,642897835,2191726,"The Allstate Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Glenn. Let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the performance of our Property-Liability business. Property-Liability results remained strong with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Net written premium declined in the fourth quarter by 1.5%",1038,"Thanks, Glenn. Let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the performance of our Property-Liability business. Property-Liability results remained strong with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Net written premium declined in the fourth quarter by 1.5%. While homeowners premium grew 3.2% from the prior year quarter due to average premium and policy growth, this was more than offset by a modest decline in auto insurance premiums, driven by premium refunds. Underwriting income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.4 billion for the full year increased relative to the prior year by $420 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. As shown in the chart on the lower left, the recorded combined ratio of 84 in the fourth quarter improved 4.7 points compared to the prior year. This improvement was primarily attributable to a lower underlying loss ratio in auto insurance, driven by fewer auto accidents, partially offset by higher auto insurance claim severity and a slightly adverse underlying loss ratio in homeowners insurance compared to prior year. Homeowners continues to generate attractive returns with a recorded combined ratio of 78.5 in the fourth quarter and 90.0 for the full year 2020. Additionally, the underlying combined ratio performance has consistently achieved our low 60s target, which speaks to our expertise in managing this business. Favorable underlying loss ratios were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses along with restructuring charges related to transformative growth. The underwriting expense ratio improved 0.2 points compared to the prior year quarter, which reflects a 0.6 point improvement in the expense ratio, excluding restructuring costs, partially offset by 0.4 points of restructuring. As you can see from the chart on the bottom right, when excluding restructuring charges and impacts from actions taken as a result of coronavirus, the expense ratio improved 1 point in 2020 and 1.9 points over the past 2 years, demonstrating continued progress toward the goal of reducing our cost structure to maintain returns while improving the competitive price position of auto insurance. 
Shifting to Slide 10. Let's discuss protection services, which were formerly known as our Service businesses. Protection Services revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 17.5% to $497 million in the fourth quarter, reaching $1.9 billion for the full year. Allstate Protection plans continued to deliver significant growth, ending the year with nearly $1 billion in revenue. Policies in force increased 28.6% to $136 million, driven by Allstate Protection Plans. As shown in the table on the bottom right, adjusted net income was $38 million in the fourth quarter and $153 million for the full year, representing increases compared to the prior year of $35 million and $115 million, respectively. The increase in both periods was driven by growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services. 
Now let's turn to Slide 11, which highlights investment performance for the fourth quarter. The chart on the left shows net investment income totaled nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter, which was $502 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income. Performance-based income totaled $557 million in the fourth quarter, as shown in gray, primarily from higher private equity valuations and gains from sales of underlying investments. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $63 million below the prior year quarter. With lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield, reducing income. GAAP total returns are shown in the table on the right. Our 2020 portfolio return totaled 7.1%, reflecting income generation and higher fixed income and public equity valuations. Our performance-based investment return was 7% for the quarter and 4.9% for the full year. Our performance-based strategy has a longer-term investment horizon and higher but more volatile return expectations compared to the market-based portfolio. The compound annual rate of return on the performance-based portfolio is 8.8% over the past 5 years, as shown in the bottom right of the table, exceeding the market-based portfolio return by 330 basis points. 
Let's move now to Slide 12 and review results for Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate Life, shown on the left, recorded adjusted net income of $56 million in the fourth quarter, $20 million below the prior year, primarily driven by higher contract benefits as coronavirus death claims totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income of $34 million in the fourth quarter was $18 million higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting lower benefit utilization, likely due to the coronavirus and the nonrenewal of a large underperforming account in 2019. Allstate Annuities had adjusted net income of $160 million in the fourth quarter, attributable to strong investment income generated from the performance-based portfolio. 
Starting in the first quarter of this year, the majority of the Allstate Life and Annuities business will be classified as held for sale on our balance sheet and results will be presented as discontinued operations following our recently announced agreement to sell Allstate Life Insurance company. 
Now let's move to Slide 13, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate returns that are among the highest in the insurance industry with an adjusted net income return on equity of 19.8%. Excellent capital management and strong cash flows have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth, a capital deployment strategy, which leads to increased shareholder value. Investing in growth opportunities remains a priority, as evidenced by our investments in building higher growth models and completing the $4 billion acquisition of National General. We also continue to provide cash returns to shareholders. In September, Allstate executed a $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. And upon completion on January 12, $1.45 billion remains on the $3 billion common share repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by the end of 2021. We returned $2.4 billion to common shareholders in 2020 through a combination of $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $668 million in common stock dividends. 
Last week, we announced the pending sale of Allstate Life Insurance company which will enable us to redeploy up to $2.2 billion of capital out of lower growth and return businesses with minimal impact to our 2-part strategy. 
With that context, let's open up the line for questions."

That doesn't mean that it's not happening, and we just don't see it, but we're seeing our bundling actually go up, as it relates to the buying down and sort of getting lower average premium. I think what you're seeing is through telematics is more accurate prices, the way I would describe it. And so if you look at our -- the total revenues we take in and then what we pay out, we -- as Glenn showed consistently made money in auto insurance for a long period of time. That will change by customer. So if somebody gets Milewise and they only drive 2,000 miles a year and pay less, then there'll be somebody else who will have to charge more. So we maintain that overall profitability. So we see it as a good thing, that people get the most accurate price, particularly since we're more sophisticated than most of the industry, and we have some of the tools like telematics.

So part of the story and the homeowners growth, it's only part because we got a lot of good parts of the story and homeowners there is bundling. In terms of Milewise and Drivewise, I'll talk about both of them, we definitely see the increased demand. So right now, we have Milewise available to 45% of the market, and we're continuing this year to roll out to more states. And we have Drivewise just about everybody is 1 state that doesn't allow it. But the demand for telematics has gone significantly up Milewise, for example, admittedly a relatively small base, but was up 35% in terms of sales. So people are looking at the pandemic. They're not driving as much. It's -- we're advertising it a little bit, and we're getting a lot of people interested in the notion of pay by mile. From a Drivewise standpoint, most people really want to now include the telematics as part of their offering from us. So we're seeing a nice upswing on the demand post pandemic."

The -- our exclusive agents are a huge strategic advantage for us and a core capability for Allstate. As much as we talk about, and I'm excited about the direct growth and what we can do in the independent agent channel, it's still the -- a large, large channel out there and a lot of customers really like to go to a local agent and a branded agent like an Allstate agent to go there. So it's a great model for us, and we want those agents to keep winning. So what we've done with existing agents is, as you know, we've shifted compensation a little bit, we've motivated more on the new business side than just on the renewal side. But we're also working with them on the way we market. We're putting more money into marketing. We really want them to be successful. From a new agent standpoint, we've got a few models in market right now. And without going too detailed into it, the general theme would be, if you think about the virtual world we're operating in, can you have a local agent that doesn't really require brick-and-mortar? And we think the answer is yes to that. That there's an opportunity for agents to be a local point of sale, people who are active in the community, people who have relationships locally and sell through those relationships in their communities, but don't necessarily have a staff and have a brick-and-mortar office where we perform the back-end service in a more centralized way. It's a significantly lower cost model to get started, as Tom mentioned, and one that we're pretty bullish on our ability to scale."

The answer is yes. That we think we can be even more competitive. It's a complicated question, of course, because with billions of price points, you -- and some segments, you're not competitive at all because you don't want to be competitive because you think that somebody else is under charging and other places you want to be competitive. And the trick is where you want to be competitive, to be competitive enough to win the business but not so competitive that you're giving away margin. And so we have a very sophisticated approach of doing that. We do think that we can shift -- we can change our pricing so we can be more competitive overall. But yes, we look at our close rates, and we're right in the market. And that depends how we carry ourself too, right? So if you look at us versus other people who have exclusive agents and in general, we're very competitive. If you look at us versus direct, I'd say we're less so, which is why we made the change to put in a direct discount on that business. So we are more competitive with -- because people are not getting an agent, they don't want to pay for one. So I would say we're highly competitive. That said, I think we can always be better. And when you look at what drives customers purchase price, it's the price -- now you got to make sure you make enough money. And that's the trick. Glenn, anything you would add to that?"

I mean you look at -- you're talking auto, but I'll say, auto and home, we were up 2% and 8%, respectively, between on new business. So folks are buying the product, and you really can't sell the product if you're out of the market from a competitive standpoint. So those are good signs that we are, but we're working to get more competitive. And the last point I'll make with it is, I always go back to this, we manage state by state. We have a talented group of state managers that like they've got their hands on the lever in each state and they're looking at the competitive position, specifically in that market. And as Tom said, on which types of business are we more or less competitive on younger drivers, older drivers, homeowners, not homeowners, married, not married all, all the different components in there, and they're pulling those levers and getting us as competitive as we can be while earning attractive returns."

When you look at the expense ratio for the year and the improvements we made, we came into the year really focused on taking cost out of 2 principal areas. One was acquisition-related costs and the other one was operating costs, which your T&E component is a part of that, but those are people-related costs and operations and those types of items. And that's really what's driven the improvement, once you take the noise of restructuring and pandemic-related costs out of the equation. The improvement we've seen this year has really come from those 2 principal areas. We've actually spent a little more on marketing, like we said we would as well. So -- but our reductions in those 2 areas have really created the space for us to increase our growth-related investments. As we go forward, as we've said on past calls, our focus is on continuing to drive our cost structure down because it is a core part of our growth strategy. It's how we're going to be able to continue to improve our competitive positioning in terms of auto insurance pricing and continuing to deliver really attractive returns.

I think I would go up all the way up to the top and say that what we said is we can grow the market share on Personal Property-Liability and as a company we'll deliver 14% to 17% return on equity. And we believe that will drive lots of shareholder value, both in terms of economic value creation and valuation multiples. When you look specifically at the components of that, we have a headwind in investment income with low interest rates. We do have and have had, for a long time, great profitability in auto insurance. We would have put a longer period of time in there, but the pension accounting kind of changed the way we did it. But we've been earning great returns in the auto insurance business for a long time and expect to continue. At a 94, you still earn a really attractive return on equity because of the -- you don't have to put up as much capital on that line and some other lines. And so 94 would be -- we don't -- we like to make as much money as we can and grow as fast as we can, and it's really about how do you drive net present value to the whole company. So we don't have -- we don't publish and have a target of safety there. But 94 would be a return I would be highly comfortable with. I'd be comfortable with 93, I'd be comfortable with 95. They're all really great returns. The other part to focus on is homeowners insurance, where that's a higher capital return business, and so we have a lower combined ratio there. And we're 10 to 15 points better than another large public competitor, which is somewhere between $700 million and $1 billion a year of profit. So we think all of those then add up to a 14% to 17% return. So we're comfortable we can grow the business and earn good returns. And it will bounce around, as you saw -- as you mentioned this year, frequency went way down. So we made a bunch more money. When if frequency goes back up, we'll just have to raise our prices up. And the question is, are you good at it. And the point of putting those 2 statistics on the bottom of that page was just to give our shareholders comfort that we have a history of managing returns and profitability, and we expect to continue to do it. Not going to be the same every year because the world changes, but we know how to make money."

We've built the foundation in that year and actually manage to grow more on the Allstate side than we lost on the Esurance side. And so that's sort of an ideal scenario that while you're in the midst of the muck and the mire of making a change like that, that you actually are able to grow it. We absolutely are making that type of change within the EA system, as we've said. We've got a lot of agents out there that are phenomenal at what they do and they grow and we're going to invest with them and have them be successful, then we have a new model upcoming. I think the way to look at this is to across all 3 channels. With EAs, we will ramp up some time later this year some new models and through next year. And so there's that coming as well as work with the existing EAs that really know how to grow. With direct, we've really done a lot of the heavy lifting of making the transition, and we should be able to continue to grow, and we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow it. With IA, which is really, for all intents and purposes, a bit of a new channel for us. I know we've had Encompass in the small Allstate independent agents in there. But really jumping into the top 5 will start like the first state will roll out in the third quarter of this year with new products going upmarket on the National General Platform, National General and Allstate company platform, and then multiple states per month and like we'll be finished with the rollout across all 50 states through 2022.

We still got 9 out of 10 to go. I'd be happy if all of them got a lot bigger. And that's what we're setting up to do. So we don't have a percentage. When you look at percentages from what customers want, you have about -- it's probably today, 25% of the customers really prefer self-serve, and it's a range. If you look at those who want an agent, it's over 50% and usually around 65% -- or about 60% and then in between, you have people who are sort of -- they go with whatever is in front of them and they're indifferent. So we think there's plenty of opportunity to grow. Some of the shift you see in channels is really due to customers wanting it differently, like not feeling like they need help to buy the product. Some of the shift is just because direct companies have been advertising more. So you all loud enough and people come to you. So we think what we should do is give people exactly what they want, give them choice. And what they want in the -- with the person is really to help buy it. They need and want less help on service, and so the existing insurance agent businesses have been built on both. What we're trying to focus on is really helping them buy and then give them self-serve or have computers do it or whatever to lower the cost on the service side because it's cheaper, better and faster. So we don't need to do as much local service as we do. So we'll take as many people as we can get through any channel."

So obviously, the sale of Allstate Life Insurance company substantially reduces our investment portfolio as we exit a spread-based business. And the black some entity is taking almost all the assets that are used to asset liability match that business. They are not taking all of the performance-based assets. So that increases the percentage relative to the overall portfolio, which also gets smaller. And we looked at it, obviously, prior to the sale. We're comfortable with the risk and return of it. You will remember that we reduced our equity holdings in February this year by $4 billion, not because of the Allstate Life sale, but because we just didn't like the risk and return profile there. So we do make changes up and down. And this will still have the ability to go up and down even though this portion of the portfolio is less liquid than the public equity as a whole because we still have public equities we get high yields. We have a bunch of ways we can manage the overall risk of the portfolio, and we're very comfortable with where we'll be. John, do you want to talk specifically about performance basis?"

When you look at performance space, too, it's part of a broader overall portfolio context. So while that percentage will go up, we look across risk and return factors across every security and every investment we hold and take it in its entirety. So we have -- as Tom mentioned, we have a lot of ways to compensate for additional risk we may take in one area. When you look at the performance space, if you -- this is a long-term holding for us, we've looked at gradually growing that over multiple years. And in some ways, this just accelerates that gradual path that we're on. As we built this portfolio, we've always looked for the best partners and the best direct investments we can across private equity, real estate and other areas. And the assets that we'd be bringing on board are ones that we're already very familiar with. We already own them, obviously, and very familiar. So it accelerates our path forward in a way that we're quite comfortable with. 
And, I guess, I just finished by saying that the return on this has stood up quite well over -- even in what's been a volatile year. We've been looking back at what our returns have been over the last 5 years and 10 years in our performance-based assets have fared quite well relative to public markets, and we think that it continues to be an integral part of the portfolio."

So the more accurate the price they are, the -- if someone takes them away from us, and we're really accurate buy -- through a lower price, then they'll -- we think, lose money. And we won't lose people because we're overpriced for the risk. So it's really -- it will drive more sustainability to growth as opposed to people calling us and saying, ""Hey, I want to. That doesn't mean people don't see our ads and say, geez, I'm tired of paying this much for insurance, and I hardly drive sort cost. But I'm not seeing a big well spring of people saying, cost, it tends to be more in the sale itself. In terms of a long-term basis, I think this is the way that pricing will be done. I mean insurers for a long time have been trying to get more and more accurate on the individual risk, particularly in auto insurance and home insurance for that matter, of course, going to telematics here. But as credit was a big move, I don't know, 15 or 20 years ago when we first got into that using stuff out of the credit file. And is very powerful. This is very powerful, as powerful, not so much in the fat part of the curve, they're being moderate risk people. But in really low-risk or really high-risk people, it's very effective. So I think it will lead to more sustainable growth through better retention because we'll have a really accurate and competitive price."

Amidst the pandemic, Allstate delivered really attractive returns while building higher growth business models in 2020. Exceptional progress is made building higher growth business models to execute our strategy of increasing market share in personal property-liability and expanding protection offered to customers. And as you know, one of our key focuses this year was transitioning the personal property-liability business to higher growth, we took decisive action. And despite the operational complexity of these actions, maintained Allstate brand property-liability policies in force. We'll take you through a reconciliation of the various components of this, and you'll see the path to growth. We made excellent progress in expanding protection offered to customers, with total policies in force increasing by 20.5% to nearly $176 million.
We took advantage of the decline in auto frequency, auto accident frequency, and our cost reductions to improve our competitive price position in auto insurance while maintaining attractive returns. The acquisition of National General is expected to increase auto insurance market share by 1 percentage point in 2021 and provides another platform for growth as we expand its product breadth. These changes position Allstate for sustainable long-term growth. At the same time, Allstate generated strong profitability and returns in 2020.
Net income was $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, and adjusted net income was $1.8 billion or $5.87 per diluted share. This was driven by lower frequency of auto accident, continued strong profitability of homeowners insurance and higher performance-based investment income. Net income was $5.5 billion, and adjusted net income was $4.6 billion for the year. This represents a 19.8% return on equity, far in excess of most insurance companies.
Our strategy to increase market share in personal Property-Liability while expanding protection services to customers will increase shareholder value. Higher Property-Liability growth with attractive returns, rapidly growing protection services expand our total addressable market. And this growth, combined with our proactive capital deployment strategy, supports returns on equity above the insurance industry and are comparable to the S&P 500.
Slide 3 is there to touch base on the strategy [indiscernible]. So we're not going to spend time on that. So let's move to Slide 4 and discuss this strategy as it relates to the Property-Liability business. A transformative growth has become more than a plan. It's about creating a business model, capabilities and culture that continually transform to deliver market share growth. This is done by focusing on the customer, expanding access and improving value.
Expanding access includes all the ways customers choose to interact, exclusive agents directly through call centers and the web and independent agents. The largest part of this change was transitioning our exclusive agent and direct businesses that operate under the Allstate brand. This gave us the ability to lower costs, leverage scale and increase advertising. This transaction is successfully being implemented, and we achieved key milestones in 2020.
We were pleased with new business growth from existing Allstate agents who remain key to serving our customers and growing. Property-Liability business from existing agents met our goals, except for the pandemic slowdown in March and April where, of course, nobody was buying anything and as we shifted commission to new sales from retention.
We're testing new agent models with less real estate and more efficient service enabled by technology with the goal of having strong local personal relationships with customers. These models will also create learnings to enable existing agents to achieve higher growth. As a result of that, we did stop appointing new Allstate agents in early 2020 while a higher growth in lower cost models being developed. This had a negative impact on points of presence and new business sales. At the same time, we increased direct sales. The net was that overall policies in force remained the same through the transition despite a drop in retention, which was concurrent with the ending of the special payment plans related to the pandemic. Glenn will take you through that reconciliation in a couple of minutes. 
The acquisition of National General in January also improves growth prospects. And as you know, this is essentially a reverse merger. The National General team is joining Allstate, and they're consolidating our independent agent businesses, encompassing AIA into their operational and technology platform. Then we're going to be able to broaden National General's product portfolio using Allstate standard auto and homeowners insurance capabilities, which will create growth through independent agents.
We also made great progress at improving customer value last year. From a customer value standpoint, we've maintained attractive margins through cost reductions while investing in growth. This includes improving the competitive price position of auto insurance through targeted rate reductions and a direct pricing discount. And while most of these changes are due to the lower frequency of auto accidents, we are also reducing cost to ensure we continue to generate attractive margins.
We're also expanding our industry-leading telematics offerings, Drivewise and Milewise, to further improve our value proposition and improving pricing position. We're the only company that major companies selling Milewise, which is very attractive to customers today because they're not driving as much.
Our goal is not just to execute this plan but to continually generate transformational growth. We have the brand, market position, resources, capabilities and strategy to deliver this for shareholders. An extensive Allstate agent platform delivers more value per dollar to customers than competitors: A direct business utilizing the Allstate brand, competitive prices, broad product offerings and our insurance expertise; an independent agent business with national distribution and strong position in both auto and homeowners insurance; and protection services with innovative business models and expanding total addressable markets. We're well on our way to achieving this goal after putting the foundational elements into place last year.
Let's move to Slide 4 to discuss Allstate's excellent financial performance in 2020. Revenues of $12 billion in the fourth quarter increased 4.8% to the prior year quarter, with total revenues for the year reaching $44.8 billion, which is primarily driven by higher premiums earned, which is partially offset then by lower net investment income. Net income was $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter and $5.5 billion for the full year 2020. Adjusted net income was $1.8 billion or $5.87 per diluted share in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, adjusted net income increased to $4.6 billion or $14.73 per diluted share. We had strong profitability in both auto and homeowners insurance. Adjusted net income return on equity is 19.8% over the last 12 months, exceeding our range of 14% to 17%, which is near the top of the insurance industry.
Now I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss the transition of the Property-Liability businesses to higher growth."

We'll discuss how Allstate is increasing Property-Liability market share while maintaining attractive returns. With the foundational work completed in 2020, Allstate is positioned to grow market share in '21 while develop",1181,"Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Slide 6. We'll discuss how Allstate is increasing Property-Liability market share while maintaining attractive returns. With the foundational work completed in 2020, Allstate is positioned to grow market share in '21 while developing a leading position in all 3 primary distribution channels in Property-Liability. Some of the actions taken in '20 have impacted growth in the near term, but they were critical to advancing transformative growth in the longer term.
Starting with Allstate exclusive agents who serve customers that value local advice and relationships. We're focused on accelerating growth and improving efficiency. Allstate agents continue to be a core strength of our organization. We're further strengthening that model by focusing on new business growth and lowering costs by improving marketing effectiveness, centralizing customer services and enhancing customer connectivity.
Leveraging Esurance's direct capabilities under the Allstate brand, we've created an omnichannel experience that meets the customer where, how and when they want to interact with us. We completed the integration of direct processes and systems in 2020 and expect direct sold business to continue to accelerate.
As Tom mentioned, National General is another exciting growth platform for us. I mean National General's independent agent-facing technology is among the best in the industry, and then our combined agency footprint covers the vast majority of the U.S. market. So as we expand products on the National General platform, we're going to be in a position to grow share in the IA channel. The totality of this go-to-market model with strong capabilities in each distribution channel is designed to generate higher growth.
Allstate's leading pricing and claims capabilities, including our strength in telematics, puts us in a strong competitive position. We're also enhancing our price competitiveness while maintaining attractive returns. The impact of the pandemic on miles driven and lower costs for auto losses gave us an opportunity to improve auto affordability through targeted rate reductions. We've also lowered underwriting expenses, as Tom mentioned. They're down 1.9 points over the last 2 years when excluding restructuring and coronavirus-related expenses. These efficiencies and continued cost structure reductions allow us to improve pricing relative to competitors while generating excellent returns.
Allstate has a strong record of profitability across lines of business and in different market conditions. The average combined ratio in auto insurance over the last 5 years was 94.4, and that excludes, obviously, 2020 results, which were influenced by the pandemic. We're equally strong in homeowners, where we averaged a combined ratio of 89.5 over the last 5 years. And that reflects the higher cost of capital or the higher capital requirements, I should say, in homeowners product versus auto. The point is we expect to grow, and we expect to earn really attractive returns. 
So let's go to Slide 7, and we're going to discuss National General, the acquisition in a little more detail. On January 4, Allstate closed the $4 billion acquisition of National General. We are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead with National General and how this advances our strategy to grow personal lines. And it gives us an estimated increase of over 1 percentage point of total personal Property-Liability market share. Allstate is now a top 5 personal lines carrier in the IA channel with significantly better competitive position.
We utilize National General as our independent agent platform by consolidating our Encompass and Allstate independent agency operations into the new entity, which will be branded National General and Allstate company. We expect to grow by rolling out new standard auto and homeowners insurance offerings starting later this year and completing countrywide deployment in less than 2 years.
Consistent with past acquisitions, we've developed measures of success, and we're showing those in the bottom of this slide. First, we expect the acquisition to be accretive with growing earnings, adding to returns and total profit. Second, we expect to achieve synergies by consolidating the 3 IA channel businesses into one, improving our competitive position. Third, we'll grow IA channel policies in force by broadening the product offering to fully meet customer needs for auto, home, other personal lines and from nonstandard to middle market to mass affluent. We'll continue to provide updates on our success in this channel as we report our National General brand results in the first quarter.
Moving to Slide 8, let's delve deeper into how we've strengthened Allstate branded Property-Liability distribution. As we said before, some of the actions we took in 2020 negatively impacted near-term growth while accelerating it in other areas. We supported Allstate agents to increase new business growth in 2020, with the exception of March and April, the beginning of the pandemic when things slowed down. At the same time, we stopped appointing new Allstate agents while higher growth and lower cost models are being developed, and that had a negative impact on new business. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we expect the new models are going to create learnings that enable our existing agents to achieve higher growth, too.
The chart on the lower left breaks down Allstate's personal auto new business applications compared to the prior year. If you exclude the declines in March and April due to the pandemic, Allstate brand new business increased with an improving trajectory throughout the year. The red bar on the far left of the chart shows the estimated unfavorable impact of the pandemic on new business in March and April.
Moving to the right, you can see the negative impact of stopping new agent appointments during 2020, but that was partially offset by an increase in existing EA production. And that shows the viability of growth with those existing agents when we just made a slight compensation change towards new business from renewal. They just have a great opportunity to grow. 
Moving to the center of the chart. The total direct channel increased compared to prior year, and this is the combined Allstate and Esurance view. And it's because Allstate brand direct applications more than offset the decline in Esurance brand. That reflects the redirection of branding investments and resources from Esurance to Allstate brand. We expect continued growth in the direct channel as we optimize web and call center sales capabilities.
A relatively small number of independent agents operate under the Allstate brand and had a small positive impact on overall growth but a really nice percentage increase among that group. And it highlights the growth opportunity we have going forward in the IA channel as we transition those appointments to National General over time, expand National General's product offerings upmarket and endorse the brand as an Allstate company.
The overall Allstate and Esurance policies in force maintained prior year levels in 2020 as we managed through significant change in our operating model and had a small decrease in retention levels, which you can see all of that in the lower right. Total Property-Liability policies in force declined slightly, driven by the Encompass brand, which will be integrated in the National General's platform in 2021.
Now I'll turn it over to Mario to discuss the rest of our quarterly results."

Let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the performance of our Property-Liability business. Property-Liability results remained strong with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Net written premium declined in the fourth quarter by 1.5%",1037,"Thanks, Glenn. Let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the performance of our Property-Liability business. Property-Liability results remained strong with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Net written premium declined in the fourth quarter by 1.5%. While homeowners premium grew 3.2% from the prior year quarter due to average premium and policy growth, this was more than offset by a modest decline in auto insurance premiums, driven by premium refunds.
Underwriting income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.4 billion for the full year, increased relative to the prior year by $420 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. As shown in the chart on the lower left, the recorded combined ratio of 84 in the fourth quarter improved 4.7 points compared to the prior year. This improvement was primarily attributable to a lower underlying loss ratio in auto insurance, driven by fewer auto accidents, partially offset by higher auto insurance claim severity and a slightly adverse underlying loss ratio in homeowners insurance compared to prior year.
Homeowners continues to generate attractive returns, with a recorded combined ratio of 78.5 in the fourth quarter and 90.0 for the full year 2020. Additionally, the underlying combined ratio performance has consistently achieved our low 60s target, which speaks to our expertise in managing this business. Favorable underlying loss ratios were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses along with restructuring charges related to transformative growth.
The underwriting expense ratio improved 0.2 points compared to the prior year quarter, which reflects a 0.6 point improvement in the expense ratio, excluding restructuring costs, partially offset by 0.4 points of restructuring. As you can see from the chart on the bottom right, when excluding restructuring charges and impacts from actions taken as a result of coronavirus, the expense ratio improved 1 point in 2020 and 1.9 points over the past 2 years, demonstrating continued progress toward the goal of reducing our cost structure to maintain returns while improving the competitive price position of auto insurance.
Shifting to Slide 10. Let's discuss protection services, which were formerly known as our Service Businesses. Protection services revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 17.5% to $497 million in the fourth quarter, reaching $1.9 billion for the full year. Allstate Protection plans continued to deliver significant growth, ending the year with nearly $1 billion in revenue. Policies in force increased 28.6% to $136 million, driven by Allstate Protection Plans.
As shown in the table on the bottom right, adjusted net income was $38 million in the fourth quarter and $153 million for the full year, representing increases compared to the prior year of $35 million and $115 million, respectively. The increase in both periods was driven by growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services. 
Now let's turn to Slide 11, which highlights investment performance for the fourth quarter. The chart on the left shows net investment income totaled nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter, which was $502 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income. Performance-based income totaled $557 million in the fourth quarter, as shown in gray, primarily from higher private equity valuations and gains from sales of underlying investments. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $63 million below the prior year quarter. With lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remained below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield, reducing income.
GAAP total returns are shown in the table on the right. Our 2020 portfolio return totaled 7.1%, reflecting income generation and higher fixed income and public equity valuations. Our performance-based investment return was 7% for the quarter and 4.9% for the full year. Our performance-based strategy has a longer-term investment horizon and higher but more volatile return expectations compared to the market-based portfolio. The compound annual rate of return on the performance-based portfolio is 8.8% over the past 5 years, as shown in the bottom right of the table, exceeding the market-based portfolio return by 330 basis points.
Let's move now to Slide 12 and review results for Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate Life, shown on the left, recorded adjusted net income of $56 million in the fourth quarter, $20 million below the prior year, primarily driven by higher contract benefits as coronavirus death claims totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter.
Allstate Benefits adjusted net income of $34 million in the fourth quarter was $18 million higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting lower benefit utilization, likely due to the coronavirus and the nonrenewal of a large underperforming account in 2019. Allstate Annuities had adjusted net income of $160 million in the fourth quarter, attributable to strong investment income generated from the performance-based portfolio.
Starting in the first quarter of this year, the majority of the Allstate Life and Annuities business will be classified as held for sale on our balance sheet and results will be presented as discontinued operations following our recently announced agreement to sell Allstate Life Insurance Company.
Now let's move to Slide 13, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate returns that are among the highest in the insurance industry with an adjusted net income return on equity of 19.8%. Excellent capital management and strong cash flows have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth, a capital deployment strategy, which leads to increased shareholder value.
Investing in growth opportunities remains a priority, as evidenced by our investments in building higher-growth models and completing the $4 billion acquisition of National General. We also continue to provide cash returns to shareholders.
In September, Allstate executed a $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. And upon completion on January 12, $1.45 billion remains on the $3 billion common share repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by the end of 2021. We returned $2.4 billion to common shareholders in 2020 through a combination of $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $668 million in common stock dividends.
Last week, we announced the pending sale of Allstate Life Insurance Company which will enable us to redeploy up to $2.2 billion of capital out of lower growth and return businesses with minimal impact to our 2-part strategy.
With that context, let's open up the line for questions."

That doesn't mean that it's not happening, and we just don't see it, but we're seeing our bundling actually go up.
As it relates to the buying down and sort of getting lower average premium, I think what you're seeing is through telematics is more accurate prices, the way I would describe it. And so if you look at our -- the total revenues we take in and then what we pay out, we -- as Glenn showed consistently made money in auto insurance for a long period of time. That will change by customer.
So if somebody gets Milewise and they only drive 2,000 miles a year and pay less, then there'll be somebody else who will have to charge more. So we maintain that overall profitability. So we see it as a good thing that people get the most accurate price, particularly since we're more sophisticated than most of the industry, and we have some of the tools like telematics.

So part of the story in the homeowners growth, it's only part because we got a lot of good parts of the story and homeowners there is bundling.
In terms of Milewise and Drivewise, I'll talk about both of them, we definitely see the increased demand. So right now, we have Milewise available to 45% of the market, and we're continuing this year to roll out to more states. And we have Drivewise just about everybody is 1 state that doesn't allow it. But the demand for telematics has gone significantly up. Milewise, for example, admittedly a relatively small base, but was up 35% in terms of sales.
So people are looking at the pandemic. They're not driving as much. It's -- we're advertising it a little bit, and we're getting a lot of people interested in the notion of pay by mile. From a Drivewise standpoint, most people really want to now include the telematics as part of their offering from us. So we're seeing a nice upswing on the demand post pandemic."

There's -- we did keep selling some under the Esurance brand, those companies, because they're open, they're -- people call -- get on our website, they track their way down to it. So it's really low cost business. So we didn't completely shut off, Josh, the Esurance. So you can still buy. Over time, it will go away as we quit advertising it and quit doing and people quit coming to that website.

And the idea being if you open an office and you got nobody coming in, you sell the first policy, you need to make some money, and the commissions were quite high there.
What Glenn is working on is coming up with a model where an agent can build the business and be successful without us having to incur the additional cost upfront to build it, which kind of rolled out over 3 to 5 years, it was expensive. And so we made the -- what we thought -- what we made was the economic choice which was save shareholder money, don't keep investing in a model that you think you get a better one for and then get the -- make sure the existing agents continue to grow.

The -- our exclusive agents are a huge strategic advantage for us and a core capability for Allstate. As much as we talk about, and I'm excited about the direct growth and what we can do in the independent agent channel, it's still the -- a large, large channel out there and a lot of customers really like to go to a local agent and a branded agent like an Allstate agent to go there. So it's a great model for us, and we want those agents to keep winning.
So what we've done with existing agents is, as you know, we've shifted compensation a little bit. We've motivated more on the new business side than just on the renewal side. But we're also working with them on the way we market. We're putting more money into marketing. We really want them to be successful. From a new agent standpoint, we've got a few models in market right now. And without going too detailed into it, the general theme would be, if you think about the virtual world we're operating in, can you have a local agent that doesn't really require brick-and-mortar?
And we think the answer is yes to that, that there's an opportunity for agents to be a local point of sale, people who are active in the community, people who have relationships locally and sell through those relationships in their communities, but don't necessarily have a staff and have a brick-and-mortar office where we perform the back-end service in a more centralized way. It's a significantly lower cost model to get started, as Tom mentioned, and one that we're pretty bullish on our ability to scale."

The answer is yes that we think we can be even more competitive. It's a complicated question, of course, because with billions of price points, you -- in some segments, you're not competitive at all because you don't want to be competitive because you think that somebody else is undercharging and other places you want to be competitive. And the trick is where you want to be competitive, to be competitive enough to win the business but not so competitive that you're giving away margin. And so we have a very sophisticated approach of doing that.
We do think that we can shift -- we can change our pricing so we can be more competitive overall. But yes, we look at our close rates, and we're right in the market. And that depends how we carry ourself too, right? So if you look at us versus other people who have exclusive agents [indiscernible] and in general we're very competitive. If you look at us versus direct, I'd say we're less so, which is why we made the change to put in a direct discount on that business. So we are more competitive with -- because people are not getting an agent, they don't want to pay for one. So I would say we're highly competitive. That said, I think we can always be better. And when you look at what drives customers purchase price, a lot of it's the price. Now you got to make sure you make enough money. And that's the trick. Glenn, anything you would add to that?"

So folks are buying the product, and you really can't sell the product if you're out of the market from a competitive standpoint. So those are good signs that we are, but we're working to get more competitive.
And the last point I'll make with it is, I always go back to this, we manage state by state. We have a talented group of state managers that like they've got their hands on the lever in each state, and they're looking at the competitive position, specifically in that market. And as Tom said, on which types of business are we more or less competitive on younger drivers, older drivers, homeowners, not homeowners, married, not married, all the different components in there, and they're pulling those levers and getting us as competitive as we can be while earning attractive returns."

And that's really what's driven the improvement once you take the noise of restructuring and pandemic-related costs out of the equation. The improvement we've seen this year has really come from those 2 principal areas.
We've actually spent a little more on marketing, like we said we would as well. So -- but our reductions in those 2 areas have really created the space for us to increase our growth-related investments.

I think I would go up all the way up to the top and say that what we said is we can grow the market share on personal Property-Liability and as a company will deliver 14% to 17% return on equity. And we believe that will drive lots of shareholder value, both in terms of economic value creation and valuation multiples.
When you look specifically at the components of that, we have a headwind in investment income with low interest rates. We do have and have had, for a long time, great profitability in auto insurance. We would have put a longer period of time in there, but the pension accounting kind of change the way we did it. But we've been earning great returns in the auto insurance business for a long time and expect to continue.
At a 94, you still earn a really attractive return on equity because of the -- you don't have to put up as much capital on that line and some other lines. And so 94 would be -- we don't -- we like to make as much money as we can and grow as fast as we can, and it's really about how do you drive net present value for the whole company. So we don't have -- we don't publish and have a target of safety there. But 94 would be a return I would be highly comfortable with. I'd be comfortable with 93. I'd be comfortable with 95. They're all really great returns.
The other part to focus on is homeowners insurance, where that's a higher capital return business, and so we have a lower combined ratio there. And we're 10 to 15 points better than another large public competitor, which is somewhere between $700 million and $1 billion a year of profit. So we think all of those then add up to a 14% to 17% return. So we're comfortable we can grow the business and earn good returns. And it will bounce around, as you saw -- as you mentioned this year, frequency went way down.
So we made a bunch more money. When if frequency goes back up, we'll just have to raise our prices up. And the question is, are you good at it. And the point of putting those 2 statistics on the bottom of that page was just to give our shareholders comfort that we have a history of managing returns and profitability, and we expect to continue to do it. Not going to be the same every year because the world changes, but we know how to make money."

I think the way to look at this is to across all 3 channels. With EAs, we will ramp up some time later this year some new models and through next year. And so there's that coming as well as work with the existing EAs that really know how to grow. With direct, we've really done a lot of the heavy lifting of making the transition, and we should be able to continue to grow, and we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow it.
With IA, which is really, for all intents and purposes, a bit of a new channel for us. I know we've had Encompass in the small Allstate independent agents in there. But really jumping into the top 5 will start like the first state will roll out in the third quarter of this year with new products going upmarket on the National General platform, National General and Allstate company platform, and then multiple states per month and like we'll be finished with the rollout across all 50 states through 2022. So you can kind of see all of these things coming together, and we're building a long-term and sustainable growth platform across all of the channels."

We know that there were some competitors out there that took some rate down. We also know that people facing financial hardship either shop, some people even give up a car. So all of those things have some play in it. And as you said, Tom, the attribution is next to impossible on that. But we're within a decent range of our long-term retention, and we're focused on it.

In terms of the long term, I'm like, we'll take anybody we can get, like. So we have 1 out of 10. We still got 9 out of 10 to go, I'd be happy if all of them got a lot bigger. And that's what we're setting up to do. So we don't have a percentage. When you look at percentages from what customers want, you have about -- it's probably today, 25% of the customers really prefer self-serve, and it's a range.
If you look at those who want an agent, it's over 50% and usually around 65% -- or about 60%. And then in between, you have people who are sort of -- they go with whatever is in front of them, and they're indifferent. So we think there's plenty of opportunity to grow. Some of the shift you see in channels is really due to customers wanting it differently, like not feeling like they need help to buy the product.
Some of the shift is just because direct companies have been advertising more. So you yell loud enough and people come to you. So we think what we should do is give people exactly what they want, give them choice. And what they want in the -- with the person is really to help buy it. They need and want less help on service, and so the existing insurance agent businesses have been built on both. What we're trying to focus on is really helping them buy and then give them self-serve or have computers do it or whatever to lower the cost on the service side because it's cheaper, better and faster. So we don't need to do as much local service as we do. So we'll take as many people as we can get through any channel."

Paul, let me give you a slight overview from a corporate standpoint, and John can talk about the specifics. So obviously, the sale of Allstate Life Insurance Company substantially reduces our investment portfolio as we exit a spread-based business. And the Blackstone entity is taking almost all the assets that are used to asset liability match that business. They are not taking all of the performance-based assets. So that increases the percentage some relative to the overall portfolio, which also gets smaller. And we looked at it, obviously, prior to the sale. We're comfortable with the risk and return of it.
You will remember that we reduced our equity holdings in February this year by $4 billion, not because of the Allstate Life sale, but because we just didn't like the risk and return profile there. So we do make changes up and down. And this will still have the ability to go up and down even though this portion of the portfolio is less liquid than the public equity as a whole because we still have public equities to get high yields. We have a bunch of ways we can manage the overall risk of the portfolio, and we're very comfortable with where we'll be. John, do you want to talk specifically about performance space?"

When you look at performance space, too, it's part of a broader overall portfolio context. So while that percentage will go up, we look across risk and return factors across every security and every investment we hold and take it in its entirety. So we have -- as Tom mentioned, we have a lot of ways to compensate for additional risk we may take in one area.
When you look at the performance space, if you -- this is a long-term holding for us. We've looked at gradually growing that over multiple years. And in some ways, this just accelerates that gradual path that we're on. As we built this portfolio, we've always looked for the best partners and the best direct investments we can across private equity, real estate and other areas. And the assets that we'd be bringing on board are ones that we're already very familiar with. We already own them, obviously, and very familiar. So it accelerates our path forward in a way that we're quite comfortable with.
And I guess, I just finish by saying that the return on this has stood up quite well over -- even in what's been a volatile year, we've been looking back at what our returns have been over the last 5 years and 10 years, and our performance-based assets have fared quite well relative to public markets, and we think that it continues to be an integral part of the portfolio."

So the more accurate the price they are, the -- if someone takes them away from us, and we're really accurate buy through a lower price, then they'll, we think, lose money. And we won't lose people because we're overpriced for the risk. So it's really -- it will drive more sustainability to growth as opposed to people calling us and saying, ""Hey, I want to do it."" That doesn't mean people don't see our ads and say, geez, I'm tired of paying this much for insurance, and I hardly drive sort of cost. But I'm not seeing a big well spring of people saying because it tends to be more in the sale itself.
In terms of a long-term basis, I think this is the way that pricing will be done. I mean insurers for a long time have been trying to get more and more accurate on the individual risk, particularly in auto insurance and home insurance for that matter, of course, going to telematics here. But as credit was a big move, I don't know, 15 or 20 years ago when we first got into that using stuff out of the credit file, and it's very powerful. This is very powerful, as powerful, not so much in the fat part of the curve. They're being moderate risk people. But in really low-risk or really high-risk people, it's very effective. So I think it will lead to more sustainable growth through better retention because we'll have a really accurate and competitive price."

Good morning, everybody, as we appreciate you making the time to follow up, and I'll say, how we're doing. Let's start on Slide 2. On the left, our strategy has 2 components, which is to increase personal property-liability market share, and then secondly, to expand protection services, which are shown in those 2 ovals, and we made substantial progress in executing that this quarter. Many of those things that we'll talk about on the right-hand side really a year or plus in the making, but you see it all coming together this quarter. 
So we closed on the acquisition, National General in January, enhancing our competitive position in the independent agent distribution. We executed agreements to sell off a company to Allstate Life insurance company and Allstate life insurance company in New York, 2 separate deals there. And that will redeploy capital out of the lower growth in return businesses and reduces our exposure to interest rate risk. We also made continued progress on getting higher growth in our personal property-liability business moving into Phase 3 of transformer growth. 
Total revenues increased by 26.2% in the quarter, which is a stunning number. Policies in force increased by 20.6%, and of course, that's driven in large part by the National General acquisition. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in the call. A long-term approach to creating shareholder value in both investing and using reinsurance also benefited results this quarter. We had substantial increase in performance-based income and reinsurance recoveries. Allstate protection plans continues its rapid growth. 
We launched Home Depot earlier this quarter. We had strong operating results with adjusted net income of $1.9 billion or $6.11 a share. And that generated a return on equity over the last 12 months of 23.2%. And then shareholders also benefited with $765 million of dividends and share repurchases. 
Let's turn to Slide 3 and go through the first quarter financial results. Our revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 26.2% to the prior year quarter, and it reflects both the National General acquisition, higher investment income and realized capital gains. Property-liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 11.4% and 12.1%, respectively. Our performance-based income was $378 million versus a loss in the first quarter of 2020. We did have a net loss of $1.4 billion that we recorded in the quarter, which there was a $4 billion loss on the disposition from those announced sales to life insurance companies, and that was not fully offset by the strong operating performance. The strong operating performance charger did create that adjusted net income of $1.9 billion, as you can see from the table on the bottom. And that's 55.7% higher than the prior year quarter, as reduced auto claim frequency and higher net investment income more than offset increased catastrophe losses. 
Let's go to Slide 4, dig in a little on National General, which is an excellent growth platform for us. Now we acquired the business for $4 billion in January, and that's to grow market share within the independent agent channel. And National General has appointments with over 42,000 independent agents. That expand our product portfolio as well. It includes nonstandard auto insurance, where we had a very small presence; lender-placed homeowners insurance, accident and health insurance and 2 digital marketing platforms.  
National General, agency facing technology is effective, efficient and scalable. So we're a better owner for National General since it improves the independent agent business. It lowers cost, and it will generate incremental growth from here. We've become a top 5 independent agent carrier. And then the combination of Allstate Standard Auto and homeowners insurance expertise with National General's expertise in nonstandard auto insurance will give us a really broad portfolio of products to provide through independent agents. Significant expense reductions are expected by consolidating Allstate to independent agent businesses onto National General's technology and operating platform. In the cost to acquire these in-force policies, which is about 1 point of overall market share at the net acquisition price is comparable to doing this organically. 
Now we have 3 measures in success for this acquisition. As you can see on the bottom of the table, accretion to earnings, achieve expense synergies and grow IA channel policies in force we're only a quarter into it, but we had a really strong start on these goals because we've Glenn and the team, Peter have been working on this, really, since the 6 months, we started the deal, in July, 6 months before we bought it. So we came into this first quarter with the Head of Steam and the Allstate Protection segment added $1.3 billion in net written premiums, $138 million in underwriting income this quarter. Allstate health and benefits and increased adjusted net income by $35 million. We are integrating Encompass onto the National general platform and are on pace to achieve our expense synergies we also expect to grow policies enforced by broadening that product portfolio in the IA channel. And of course, that represents about 1/3 of the total personalized market. 
The IA channel policies in force are approximately 6x larger after this transaction. As we add standard auto and homeowner experience products in National General's offering later this year, that will drive even more growth. 
Let me now turn it over to Mario to go through the first quarter results in more detail."
18711,710027102,2272491,"The Allstate Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let's go to Slide 5 and delve a little deeper into property-liability growth. Property-liability policies in force grew by 12.1% compared to the prior year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, cont",1502,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let's go to Slide 5 and delve a little deeper into property-liability growth. Property-liability policies in force grew by 12.1% compared to the prior year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 3.9 million policies. The Allstate brand grew policies by 0.5% due to growth in homeowners and other personal lines, as you can see by the table on the left. Allstate brand auto insurance was flat to the prior year as increased new business was offset by lower retention. The chart on the lower right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to the prior year, which increased 64% in total, primarily due to the incremental 526,000 applications generated by National General. 
The middle section of the chart shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total, generated a 5.4% increase in new business growth compared to the prior year. Modest increases from existing agents and a large increase in direct channel sales more than offset the volume that would normally have been generated by newly appointed agents as we pilot new agent models with higher growth and lower costs. As a result, property-liability net written premium grew 13.7% in the first quarter compared to prior year, driven by a 12.9% increase in auto insurance and a 20.3% increase in homeowners' insurance. The auto insurance net written premium increase was driven by a 14.1% increase in policies in force due to National General and increased new -- new issued applications across all brands. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average auto insurance premiums from approved rate decreases and lower retention, partially driven by the impact of special payment plans that were implemented during the pandemic. 
If you flip to Slide 6, you see property-liability margins remain strong. The recorded combined ratio of 83.3% improved 1.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily from a lower underlying loss ratio, driven by reduced auto frequency and continued cost savings. The auto insurance recorded combined ratio of 80.5, with 8.8 points below the prior year, primarily due to lower accident frequency in the quarter. Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency remained below prior year levels in 47 of 51 geographies, which includes the district of Columbia. 
The chart on the lower left shows the impact of the pandemic on Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency. As you can see, the onset of the pandemic and efforts to slow the spread of the virus had a large impact on frequency beginning at the end of the first quarter of last year and then extending into the second quarter when auto frequency was at its lows. This time frame coincided with Allstate shelter-in-place payback. 
Following the second quarter of 2020, property damage frequency has trended below pre-pandemic levels by approximately 28%, as you can see by the third and fourth quarter variances to 2019. And first quarter 2021 frequency showed a comparable decline relative to 2019. As you can see from the chart on the bottom right, we continue to make progress in reducing our cost structure, enabling us to improve the competitive position of auto insurance while maintaining strong returns. The property-liability expense ratio improved 2.5 points in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year, due to the absence of coronavirus-related expenses incurred in 2020, such as the shelter-in-place payback, as well as continued cost reductions. This was partially offset by a significant increase in advertising investment. 
The expense ratio, excluding coronavirus-related expenses, restructuring charges and the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisition of National General was $22.8 million an improvement of 0.5 points compared to the prior year quarter. In connection with the anticipated benefits associated with the future work environment, we expect to incur approximately $110 million in restructuring costs during 2021, with $33 million recognized in the first quarter, primarily related to real estate exit costs. These restructuring costs and their future benefits are incremental to the $290 million of aggregate restructuring costs related to transformative growth, which we announced in the third quarter of 2020, and of which we've recognized $256 million to date, including $17 million this quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 7 to discuss our progress on building transformative growth business models. So transformative growth is a multiyear initiative to build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by expanding customer access, improving customer value increasing marketing sophistication and investment, and building new technology ecosystems. A longitudinal plan segments transformative growth into 5 phases, starting with the conceptual design and ending with the retirement of the old business model. We've completed Phase 1 and much of Phase 2. In Phase 2, the auto insurance competitive position has been improved, leading to higher close rates. This was supported by cost reductions. Direct capabilities have been expanded and sales volumes are increasing. New branding has been launched and marketing investment has been increased. This combined with industry-leading telematics capabilities will increase growth. We believe Allstate is among the leaders in telematics and is the largest pay-per-mile provider through Milewise, which offers lower cost for customers who drive less. 
We've also expanded independent agent distribution through the National General acquisition. Looking forward, we are now into Phase 3 in building the new operating model. We will support the transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost models. New agent models are also being tested to serve customers who want a local agent. Improving customer acquisition costs, relative to lifetime value, will lower costs. Expense reductions will support increased investment in growth and technology. The new customer experience and product management technology ecosystems also get deployed in this phase. 
Now let's go to Slide 8, which highlights investment performance for the first quarter. Net investment income totaled $708 million in the quarter, which was $462 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income, as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $378 million in the first quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting broad-based valuation increases in private equity investments and sales of underlying real estate investments. 
Market-based income, shown in blue, was $6 million below the prior year quarter. With lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield, reducing income. Our first quarter GAAP total portfolio return was minus 0.2%, as you can see on the bottom of the left chart, reflecting lower fixed income valuations. Over the last 12 months, the total return was 8.8%. As discussed previously, our performance-based strategy has a longer-term investment horizon with higher but more volatile return expectations. This volatility can be seen by the chart on the lower right. It highlights the 1-, 5- and 10-year performance-based internal rates of return. The 1 year trend has been volatile throughout the pandemic. With the 2 most recent quarters, significantly higher than the returns experienced during the middle of 2020. Conversely, the 5 and 10-year trends are stable and closer to our expected returns. 
Moving to Slide 9. Allstate Protection plans continues to grow revenue and profit. As you recall, we purchased Allstate protection plans for $1.4 billion in 2017 to broaden the protection solutions offered to customers. It provides low-cost protection with excellent service, products that are primarily sold through U.S. retailers and leverage the Allstate brand. Since acquisition, Allstate Protection plans has experienced rapid top line growth and improved profitability. Revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of 48% over the last 3 years, as you can see on the bottom left, and were more than $1 billion over the latest 12 months. 
Adjusted net income went from a loss of $22 million in 2017 to income of $148 million over the last 12 months. Additional growth will be achieved by further expanding appliance, furniture and mobile phone protection, expanding the geographic footprint outside the U.S. and creating new innovative services, such as 2-day appliance repair. This acquisition has been an incredible success for us. 
Now let's move to Slide 10, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate attractive returns with adjusted net income return on equity of 23.2% for the last 12 months, which was 5.7 points higher than the prior year. Excellent capital management and strong cash flows have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth. We provided significant cash returns to shareholders in the first quarter through a combination of $601 million in share repurchases and $164 million in common stock dividends. The current $3 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Given our growth strategy and sustainable earnings potential, we announced a 50% increase in the quarterly common shareholder dividend to $0.81 paid to shareholders on April 1. 
The total cash return provided to shareholders was 7.8% of average market capitalization over the last 12 months. With that context, let's open up the line for questions."

So we're still selling some there, but the growth is absolutely being driven by the Allstate brand. As you saw in the supplement that -- or the Q, we had 33% increase in direct sold business.

So first, from a branding standpoint, we've decided that the Allstate brand and personal property-liability will be on business that we control both the sales and the service on it. So that's both the Allstate agents and then direct, whether that's web or call center. 
For the independent agent business, we've rebranded National General, so it's National General and Allstate company. And we launched it, I think, the beginning of January, so that you get the relationship with Allstate, but that everybody understands that it's separate than that which you would hit from an all agent. We do not do that with the Allstate brand in the circular protection. 
So for example, we sell under the Allstate name at Walmart, we sell under the Allstate name and Home Depot. Target, which gives us both increased exposure to customers, enables us to further leverage that capability, and quite honestly, has helped us dramatically expand Allstate Protection Products because the power of their brand. So slightly different strategy from a branding standpoint inside the personal profit liability markets and outside, but we try to leverage it everywhere we can, but provide make sure that, that brand stands for certain things in different areas.

But as Tom just pointed out, National General and Allstate Company, that's going to be a different story. We're launching middle market products. So think about basically the Allstate product capability in the middle market, auto and home and other personal lines. On the National General platform and branded as National General and Allstate Company, starting in the second half of this year and then really fast expansion. So it'll be to all 50 states within 18 months of the start of that, so before the end of next year. 
So really, National General and Allstate Company is going to be a company that is serving from nonstandard up through mass affluent and everything in between. It really is another national player in the independent agent space, and we've gotten a phenomenal reaction from independent agents and they are genuinely excited to have another significant player. And with the capabilities of Allstate, National General combined in that market. And so we're positioned really well to grow with a lot of greenfield ahead of us in the independent agent space."

First, it's about how do we think about increasing market share and will use 2 words together, profitable growth. We put them together because that's what we want. We do not believe that growth with no profit is good for shareholders. So the objective, of course, is maximize shareholder value. Our expected outcomes for our team are that they will balance between growth and profitability. 
Our strategy, of course, is Mario talked about the first phase -- second phase of transforming growth is get a more competitive auto insurance product. And we supported that, of course, and we're being successful by reducing our costs. So the first thing would be we can control our cost, and we can make sure that if we reduce prices to get more competitive, we still maintain our margins. 
Obviously, we want to be smarter, whether that be how we price or how we acquire business and our marketing. We're also using telematics. And then as we go forward with transformative growth, it will be by being faster with better technology and having new products affordable, simple and connected that are sold through that broad range of distribution that Glenn was just talking about from direct to Allstate agents.

So first, I'll talk about frequency a little bit and then -- and go to competitive position. So from a frequency standpoint, we're -- everybody gets benefited from some lower frequency but we've also looked at a deeper level at it than just sort of miles driven and the number of accidents coming out because there are differences by books, and you see differences in competitors as to how much tailwind that's providing. So we look at the fact that commuter driven or take it from rush hour losses are down about 3 points more than overall losses. 
And we look at rural driving is down about 4 or 5 points less than urban driving. And so we look at these at a pretty deep level, and we're fortunate to work with Arity and have a lot of data on this with 10 years plus of telematics. We get pretty granular into how we're looking at it and understanding the frequency picture. So we've got a tailwind with that. So which takes me in a competitive position because we've been moving our competitive position pretty aggressively. Like you see a minus 1.5 on average premium, and that might feel or seems slight, but there's a lot underneath that. We've moved new business pricing. We've moved telematic pricing. We've reduced the cost of our Milewise program that's grown really nicely. And all of that is inside of there. 
So our competitive position on the price changes we've made and that are still going into market have really improved, and our close rates are up. We're starting to see those really positive signs of momentum across multiple states. And then you put on top of that, the fact that some of our competitors have already taken price increases, you know some of those out there. We've heard others say that they're going to start taking bites at the apple in terms of price increases. And you look at our position, and obviously, we're in a position right now. We continue to invest in growth. We can still put money into marketing. We could still put money into competitive price position because of where we're positioned, which really puts us in a great spot to grow going forward."

Let me talk about growth a little bit because it is really an important question that many analysts have and of course, it drives huge value in the market today. And so we would start and say, first actuals matter, and we had a great quarter. I mean over 25% revenue growth or PIF growth was in the low teens. And we're headed towards increasing our market share pretty significantly in personal lines this year, which is consistent with our strategy, I guess, what we set out to do. You have some naysayers and say, ""Well, you bought it with the acquisition of National Journal."" And that's, of course, true, but you always have to invest to get market share. 
In this case, it is real growth. And we look at it and said, if we had taken the net price that we paid for National General and throw it into marketing or higher commissions or some kind of stiff, it likely would have given us less growth than we got and certainly not the kind of profitability we're getting coming. The same thing -- but we did buy, but we did the same thing with Allstate Protection Plans, right? We bought Squaretrade. We repositioned it with our brand, and that acquired growth then turned into an organic growth platform. We expect the same thing to happen with National General. 
The difference is we paid a slightly higher premium for square trade than we did for National General. As it relates to the Allstate brand, we have multiple ways to grow, right? We've got the Allstate agents, and we're making them -- helping them transition to a new model. We have the direct business, which we've launched. And it's sold, by the way, at a different price than through an agent because we believe customers should pay for what they get. And if you get an agent and get that help, you should be willing to pay for that. 
And so overall, we feel like the Allstate brand is positioned for long-term growth as well. And so we feel like we've got an overall plan to move forward  it's got transformative growth in it. It's got real growth this quarter, and it's got -- we're building platforms that will continue that growth going forward."

So I -- I'm going to go back a long way. But in 2004 and 2005, we had huge catastrophe losses. We weren't earning any money on homeowners business. We've made some money 1 year and we would lose money the next year when you looked at it over time. Like it's not a really good business. So we looked at getting out. And we said, you know what, if we were out, we'd want to be in because it does -- our customers do want it. So maybe it's just this catastrophe risk I don't want. 
So we created a very comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance program to basically divest certain portions of the risk we took on. And that's evolved over time. We have a very sophisticated multiyear program. It's got -- it's by state. It's got different by event. It's got the aggregate in it. And we bear that cost each and every quarter, obviously, that comes through. And then sometimes, it pays off. And what you saw this quarter was the aggregate kicked in. And so from losses -- some of the losses, which were last year, showed up as reducing our catastrophe losses this quarter, which were up pretty significantly. And that helps smooth it out. And we've looked at that from what kind of return on capital do we give up to the reinsurers, and we're quite comfortable giving up the return that they get to avoid the volatility that comes from it. 
And so it's helped us reposition the homeowners business so that now it's a very consistent source of profitability for us. As I was saying to the prior question, we don't believe in growth with, like, running homeowners above 100 is not a good plan. And you're destroying value at that point with growth. And we don't believe in that. So we've used reinsurance to help reposition the business. We did a whole bunch of other stuff, including change in the product and changing the way we price and how we underwrite it where -- how we do our segmentation by -- down to specific risk codes so how we pay for roof. So there's a whole bunch of stuff we've changed underneath that over the last decade, but it's a really good business. 
In reinsurance, using that reinsurers helped us get there. So what you saw this quarter was a benefit, which is more than -- it was earned in this quarter, but it was paid for in the prior quarter. So if you -- some people want to exclude it from this year's quarter, totally get that. I'm like, that's fine. But then you should not be counting all the costs from the other time. Mario or Glenn, do you want to talk about the cost of reinsurance in the program going forward?"

We recovered about $955 million in the quarter on a net basis. Part of that was from our per occurrence nationwide program where we retain the first $500 million of an event, and then we have coverage in our current program up to $5 billion. And then as Tom mentioned, we also have an aggregate cover which is about $1 billion, which spans a 12-month period. We also had recoveries under that. So combined, it was about $955 million. That's net of reinstatement premiums in the quarter. And it was principally on the freeze event in Texas. So the freeze event on a net basis cost us $586 million in the quarter. Once you start peeling back the prior year component of that reinsurance recovery, which is about $150 million, you get to a gross loss in Texas north of $1.3 billion. So we benefited pretty significantly in the quarter from our reinsurance program. 
As you mentioned, we posted on our website -- we placed most of the nationwide program this quarter. And we still have a component of the nationwide program to do. And then remember, we have a separate Florida program. The cost year-over-year because we've included National General in this year's program is going to be slightly higher than it was a year ago when you add up what we were spending on reinsurance and what National General was spending on reinsurance. But in terms of what you saw in the first quarter, you got to remember that's still last year's program that was placed May 1. And what we saw last year was the increase we experienced was mainly in the Florida program, and you're seeing that kind of cycle through in the first quarter. We will start incurring the cost of this year's program when it incepts, which is on June 1."

And as you know, we did a large reduction in force last year. There's about 3,800 people, you're starting to see that come through this year. At the same time, our advertising was way up. And so we tried to balance between those 2. I don't think you could expect it to come down 0.5 point every quarter from now until infinite item. You should know that our strategy is to both keep reducing costs every place we can so that we can have a more affordable product for our customers and therefore, a better price so we get more of them. 
And then -- but not invest in growth because if the kind of a return on capital we're getting in these businesses, we should definitely be seeking more growth. Mario, do you want to talk more about what you -- this current quarter and what the ins and outs were?"

So I guess, as Tom mentioned, we're going to continue to focus on reducing our cost structure. And like we've said really all along, our focus on reducing our cost structure is not a margin expansion focus. It's one -- it's a growth focus, and it's a growth focus because reducing our costs enables us to invest more in growth. And you saw it this quarter where we invested more in marketing and the component of our underwriting expense ratio related to marketing, actually increased by 9/10 point yet it was more than offset by the operating cost reductions that Tom referenced from last year. 
So the real ins and outs were more investment in advertising more than offset by cost reductions and net-net, a 0.5 point improvement in kind of the underlying expense ratio in the quarter. And we're going to continue to focus on moving that number down. The other thing I'd mention on expenses, and it's not obvious in our numbers is part of our focus on cost reduction has been on getting more efficient in claim handling. And we've improved the efficiency and our loss adjustment expense which comes through the loss ratio. 
But again, we consider it as a core part of our cost reduction efforts to improve the cost structure, create capacity to invest and be able to grow more and continue to deliver excellent returns. So I think what you saw in the quarter was really a kind of proof of how that strategy is playing out. In terms of the homeowner expense ratio specifically, Greg, I'd have to go back and take a look at what components of it, whether that -- whether it came through distribution costs or underwriting costs, whether it was like inspections and so on. So let me take that one offline, and I'll get back to you on that one."

But Paul, the first thing I would say is, no, we're not going to do the nationwide deal, internal or independent agents. We don't think that makes sense from a customer standpoint. Customers come to us because they love the Allstate brand. We have a really strong brand, long relationships. So we're not planning on turning them into something else. 
And obviously, the fast pace of change has all of us on edge, whether you're a retailer or anybody what's going on in the world. And good news for our agents is that still a majority of consumers want an insurance professional help them buy insurance, and our agents are really good at it. That said, people are more comfortable with self-service, simple items, and technology enables a computer to do some of the work that used to be handled in -- by people and it still, in some cases, handles an offices. So we have to transition their model and go where the customer is going. 
And so that includes -- maybe we don't have to use as much real estate as we use today. We certainly do not need to do as much service work in agents offices. So we have a little over 10,000 Allstate agents. There's probably 26,000, 27,000 people working in those agents. Some of those people are doing service work. And we think we can do that either centrally at a lower cost and be more effective for our customers or just get the computer to do it, nobody does it at all. So we have to figure out how do we transition those people in those offices to doing service work to doing sales work or if they can't transition those licensed sales professionals, have the agents build up staff they can move into that. 
So last year, one of the things that Glen and team did was, they raised a new business commissions to incentive, give people the opportunity to invest more and sell more things to more people and get more people selling for them to offset that and continue to make sure we're meeting our customers' cost needs as we slightly reduced renewal commissions. To reflect that. So if you're an agent and you're focused on new sales, that's a good thing. You're excited about it. You're often ready to go. If you've been focused more on service and not on growth, then you're not going to be as excited about that change because it changes your business model. 
So we have to help them transition from where they are to the place where the customers want us to go, which is they want help, but they want to do it in a technologically efficient, low cost way. And we think that there's a good way to do it. Glenn can give you some examples of what we're doing with our existing agents. We've already talked about what we're doing direct to serve our customers. And then we're also trying some new models that Glenn can talk about that do the same thing, which is use people, to help people, buy insurance in a local space today at lower cost. Glenn, do you want to give some more specifics on that?"

So I know I'm being repetitive, but it's really important. So it's a hard know on the IA piece. So I'll just reiterate, as Tom said, this is -- we are dedicated to our exclusive agent model, completely. And we believe that there is a -- not only a meaningful place, but a huge place for our exclusive agents to grow in the market because, as Tom said, most consumers still want to work with an agent. 
So in the presentation materials, it talked about higher growth, lower cost models. So I'll just hit a couple of things, lower cost we've been really reticent in the past to allow agents to consolidate locations or to even go in some cases, without real estate or reduce their real estate footprint. We've been very focused on a model that is, ""How many signs do you have up across the country side?"" And we're going to really lean in to allowing agents to reduce costs in the way they run their business. And Tom talked a bit about the service. We started that in 2019, and we built it up a bit and everything, but we really have to get to a centralized and more efficient and effective way of serving customers than separately across 10,000 different locations. 
So -- and we can take a lot of cost out of the system and reduce the cost for the agents so that they can focus on growth. From a higher growth standpoint, it's about leaning in on the marketing that they do, that we can help them do more effectively and efficiently as a large enterprise. The lead management that they do, compensating them more for new business, as Tom mentioned also. That's the existing agents and how we want to transition that to higher growth, lower cost. 
The new models, for example -- and we have several hundred of these already in place, actually, are -- we're learning from our Canadian operation, actually. In Canada, we have Allstate agents who operate sort of independently from one another. It's not an agent with multiple staff. They're independent workers and producers. And they work on sort of a balance between being in communities and driving leads themselves and getting leads from the company. And it's been very successful. We're growing very fast in Canada. So we leveraging that model and looking at models with no real estate, in local markets that are part of the community and are able to take leads and also generate their own leads in that community and grow. 
So it's early in the process, but in the second half of the year, we're looking to ramp those up significantly."

But the heavier emphasis on our recruiting is on those new models where with our existing agents, we're really focused on investing to get more of those agents growing and wanting to grow.

Secondly, though, look, it is a highly competitive market right now. Shopping is up, advertising is up, and there's some impact from that. It's interesting when you look at National General, as an example, if you saw in some of our disclosures like National General's new business. It's really eye-popping because National General writes a lot more new business to grow because they have a shorter cycle time.

It's an interesting thing to look at, as Tom said, when you look at it inside a company like Allstate, Milewise will look relatively small. It's up this year. Something close to -- in autos, policies, I think, are 4 and change times what they were. Autos are 6 and change times what they were a year prior. So significant growth. 
If this was a stand-alone start-up sitting outside of a large insurance company like Allstate, it is the largest in the industry, pay-by-mile program, and it would look really big and really fast-growing and really attractive. Inside of Allstate, it is helping our growth, but it is not driving our growth is the way I'd say that. We're looking to expand over time on the -- on Milewise. Right now, it's available to about 50% of consumers across the country, and we have more states lined up for that. It does require the OBD port, which I think everybody knows there are chip shortages out there. We have not run into a problem where we have to slow down our Milewise at this point. But we are actively managing our supply chain on it because it is a popular product, and we're managing our state expansion and looking at that so that we don't run into supply chain issues."

Good morning, everybody, as we appreciate you making the time to follow up on Allstate and see how we're doing.
Let's start on Slide 2. On the left, our strategy has 2 components, which is to increase personal property-liability market share; and then secondly, to expand protection services, which are shown in those 2 ovals. And we made substantial progress in executing that this quarter. Many of those things that we'll talk about on the right-hand side really a year or plus in the making, but you see it all coming together this quarter.
So we closed on the acquisition of National General in January, enhancing our competitive position in the independent agent distribution. We executed agreements to sell Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York, 2 separate deals there. And that will redeploy capital out of the lower growth in return businesses and reduces our exposure to interest rate risk. We also made continued progress on getting higher growth in our personal property-liability business moving into Phase 3 of Transformative Growth.
Total revenues increased by 26.2% in the quarter, which is a stunning number. Policies in force increased by 20.6%. And of course, that's driven in large part by the National General acquisition. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in the call. Our long-term approach to creating shareholder value in both investing and using reinsurance also benefited results this quarter. We had substantial increase in performance-based income and reinsurance recoveries.
Allstate Protection Plans continues its rapid growth. We launched Home Depot earlier this quarter. We had strong operating results with adjusted net income of $1.9 billion or $6.11 a share. And that generated a return on equity over the last 12 months of 23.2%. And then shareholders also benefited with $765 million of dividends and share repurchases.
Let's turn to Slide 3 and go through the first quarter financial results. Our revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 26.2% from the prior year quarter, and it reflects both the National General acquisition, higher investment income and realized capital gains. Property-liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 11.4% and 12.1%, respectively. Our performance-based income was $378 million versus a loss in the first quarter of 2020. We did have a net loss of $1.4 billion that we recorded in the quarter, which there was a $4 billion loss on the disposition from those announced sales to life insurance companies, and that was not fully offset by the strong operating performance. The strong operating performance target did create that adjusted net income of $1.9 billion, as you can see from the table on the bottom. And that's 55.7% higher than the prior year quarter as reduced auto claim frequency and higher net investment income more than offset increased catastrophe losses.
Let's go to Slide 4, dig in a little on National General, which is an excellent growth platform for us. We acquired the business for $4 billion in January, and that's to grow market share within the independent agent channel. And National General has appointments with over 42,000 independent agents. That expands our product portfolio as well. It includes nonstandard auto insurance where we had a very small presence, lender-placed homeowners insurance, accident and health insurance and 2 digital marketing platforms.
National General's agency-facing technology is effective, efficient and scalable. So we're a better owner for National General since it improves the independent agent business. It lowers cost, and it will generate incremental growth from here. We've become a top 5 independent agent carrier. And then the combination of Allstate's standard auto and homeowners insurance expertise with National General's expertise in nonstandard auto insurance will give us a really broad portfolio of products to provide through independent agents. Significant expense reductions are expected by consolidating Allstate's 2 independent agent businesses onto National General's technology and operating platform. And the cost to acquire these in-force policies, which is about 1 point of overall market share, at the net acquisition price is comparable to doing this organically.
Now we have 3 measures of success for this acquisition, you can see on the bottom of the table: accretion to earnings, achieve expense synergies and grow IA channel policies in force. We're only a quarter into it, but we had a really strong start on these goals. Glenn and the team, Peter, have been working on this really since 6 months -- we started the deal in July, 6 months before we bought it. So we came into this first quarter with a head of steam and the Allstate Protection segment added $1.3 billion in net written premiums, $138 million in underwriting income this quarter. Allstate Health and Benefits increased adjusted net income by $35 million.
We are integrating Encompass onto the National General platform and are on pace to achieve our expense synergies. We also expect to grow policies in force by broadening that product portfolio in the IA channel. And of course, that represents about 1/3 of the total personalized market. The IA channel policies in force are approximately 6x larger after this transaction. As we add standard auto and homeowner experience products in National General's offering later this year, that will drive even more growth.
Let me now turn it over to Mario to go through the first quarter results in more detail."
18711,710027102,2273416,"The Allstate Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let's go to Slide 5 and delve a little deeper into property-liability growth. Property-liability policies in force grew by 12.1% compared to the prior year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, cont",1497,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let's go to Slide 5 and delve a little deeper into property-liability growth. Property-liability policies in force grew by 12.1% compared to the prior year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 3.9 million policies. The Allstate brand grew policies by 0.5% due to growth in homeowners and other personal lines, as you can see by the table on the left. Allstate brand auto insurance was flat to the prior year as increased new business was offset by lower retention.
The chart on the lower right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to the prior year, which increased 64% in total, primarily due to the incremental 526,000 applications generated by National General. The middle section of the chart shows Allstate brand impacts by channel which, in total, generated a 5.4% increase in new business growth compared to the prior year. Modest increases from existing agents and a large increase in direct channel sales more than offset the volume that would normally have been generated by newly appointed agents as we pilot new agent models with higher growth and lower costs.
As a result, property-liability net written premium grew 13.7% in the first quarter compared to prior year driven by a 12.9% increase in auto insurance and a 20.3% increase in homeowners insurance. The auto insurance net written premium increase was driven by a 14.1% increase in policies in force due to National General and increased new issued applications across all brands. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average auto insurance premiums from approved rate decreases and lower retention, partially driven by the impact of special payment plans that were implemented during the pandemic.
If you flip to Slide 6, you see property-liability margins remain strong. The recorded combined ratio of 83.3 improved 1.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily from a lower underlying loss ratio driven by reduced auto frequency and continued cost savings. The auto insurance recorded combined ratio of 80.5 with 8.8 points below the prior year, primarily due to lower accident frequency in the quarter. Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency remained below prior year levels in 47 of 51 geographies, which includes the District of Columbia.
The chart on the lower left shows the impact of the pandemic on Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency. As you can see, the onset of the pandemic and efforts to slow the spread of the virus had a large impact on frequency beginning at the end of the first quarter of last year and then extending into the second quarter when auto frequency was at its lows. This time frame coincided with AllstateÂ shelter-in-place payback. Following the second quarter of 2020, property damage frequency has trended below pre-pandemic levels by approximately 28%, as you can see by the third and fourth quarter variances to 2019, and first quarter 2021 frequency showed a comparable decline relative to 2019.
As you can see from the chart on the bottom right, we continue to make progress in reducing our cost structure, enabling us to improve the competitive position of auto insurance while maintaining strong returns. The property-liability expense ratio improved 2.5 points in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year due to the absence of coronavirus-related expenses incurred in 2020, such as the shelter-in-place payback, as well as continued cost reductions. This was partially offset by a significant increase in advertising investment. The expense ratio, excluding coronavirus-related expenses, restructuring charges and the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisition of National General was 22.8, an improvement of 0.5 points compared to the prior year quarter.
In connection with the anticipated benefits associated with the future work environment, we expect to incur approximately $110 million in restructuring costs during 2021 with $33 million recognized in the first quarter, primarily related to real estate exit costs. These restructuring costs and their future benefits are incremental to the $290 million of aggregate restructuring costs related to Transformative Growth, which we announced in the third quarter of 2020 and of which we've recognized $256 million to date, including $17 million this quarter.
Let's move to Slide 7 to discuss our progress on building Transformative Growth's business models. So Transformative Growth is a multiyear initiative to build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing marketing sophistication and investment and building new technology ecosystems. A longitudinal plan segments Transformative Growth into 5 phases, starting with the conceptual design and ending with the retirement of the old business model. We've completed Phase 1 and much of Phase 2.
In Phase 2, the auto insurance competitive position has been improved, leading to higher close rates. This was supported by cost reductions. Direct capabilities have been expanded and sales volumes are increasing. New branding has been launched and marketing investment has been increased. This, combined with industry-leading telematics capabilities, will increase growth. We believe Allstate is among the leaders in telematics and is the largest pay-per-mile provider through Milewise, which offers lower cost for customers who drive less. We've also expanded independent agent distribution through the National General acquisition.
Looking forward, we are now into Phase 3 and building the new operating model. We will support the transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost models. New agent models are also being tested to serve customers who want a local agent. Improving customer acquisition costs relative to lifetime value will lower costs. Expense reductions will support increased investment in growth and technology. The new customer experience and product management technology ecosystems also get deployed in this phase.
Now let's go to Slide 8, which highlights investment performance for the first quarter. Net investment income totaled $708 million in the quarter, which was $462 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $378 million in the first quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting broad-based valuation increases in private equity investments and sales of underlying real estate investments. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $6 million below the prior year quarter. With lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield, reducing income.
Our first quarter GAAP total portfolio return was minus 0.2%, as you can see on the bottom of the left chart, reflecting lower fixed income valuations. Over the last 12 months, the total return was 8.8%. As discussed previously, our performance-based strategy has a longer-term investment horizon with higher but more volatile return expectations. This volatility can be seen by the chart on the lower right. It highlights the 1-, 5- and 10-year performance-based internal rates of return. The 1-year trend has been volatile throughout the pandemic with the 2 most recent quarters significantly higher than the returns experienced during the middle of 2020. Conversely, the 5- and 10-year trends are stable and closer to our expected returns.
Moving to Slide 9. Allstate Protection Plans continues to grow revenue and profit. As you recall, we purchased Allstate Protection Plans for $1.4 billion in 2017 to broaden the protection solutions offered to customers. It provides low-cost protection with excellent service. Products are primarily sold through U.S. retailers and leverage the Allstate brand. Since acquisition, Allstate Protection Plans has experienced rapid top line growth and improved profitability. Revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of 48% over the last 3 years, as you can see on the bottom left, and were more than $1 billion over the latest 12 months.
Adjusted net income went from a loss of $22 million in 2017 to income of $148 million over the last 12 months. Additional growth will be achieved by further expanding appliance, furniture and mobile phone protection, expanding the geographic footprint outside the U.S. and creating new innovative services, such as 2-day appliance repair. This acquisition has been an incredible success for us.
Now let's move to Slide 10, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate attractive returns with adjusted net income return on equity of 23.2% for the last 12 months, which was 5.7 points higher than the prior year. Excellent capital management and strong cash flows have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth. We provided significant cash returns to shareholders in the first quarter through a combination of $601 million in share repurchases and $164 million in common stock dividends. The current $3 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.
Given our growth strategy and sustainable earnings potential, we announced a 50% increase in the quarterly common shareholder dividend to $0.81 paid to shareholders on April 1. The total cash return provided to shareholders was 7.8% of average market capitalization over the last 12 months.
With that context, let's open up the line for questions."

What we've done is we've redirected our marketing dollars from the Esurance brand to the Allstate brand. And in addition to that, we've invested more in the Allstate brand as well. Part of that was being able to move that marketing. So while Esurance has trailed down, we're still taking advantage of the goodwill that we've paid for over years of that brand and the fact that people recognize it and still find the Esurance out there, and they have good products for a portion of our market. So we're still selling some there. But the growth is absolutely being driven by the Allstate brand. As you saw in the supplement or the Q, we had 33% increase in direct sold business. So it's really taking off. And we've got more capacity going into that system because a direct system is -- I won't say only limited, but a main limiter would be your capacity, your sales capacity in there.

So first, from a branding standpoint, we've decided that the Allstate brand and personal property-liability will be on business that we control both the sales and the service on it. So that's both the Allstate agents and then direct, whether that's web or call center. For the independent agent business, we've rebranded National General, so it's National General and Allstate Company. And we launched it, I think, the beginning of January. So that you get the relationship with Allstate but that -- everybody understands that it's separate than that which you would see from an Allstate agent. We do not do that with the Allstate brand in the circle of protection.
So for example, we sell under the Allstate name at Walmart, we sell under the Allstate name in Home Depot, at Target, which gives us both increased exposure to customers, enables us to further leverage that capability and, quite honestly, has helped us dramatically expand Allstate Protection products because of the power of their brand. So slightly different strategy from a branding standpoint inside the personal property-liability markets and outside, but we try to leverage it everywhere we can but provide -- make sure that, that brand stands for certain things in different areas.
Glenn, do you want to talk about your plans to both integrate Encompass and Allstate independent agents into National General? And then answer Josh's question on branding at the same time."

So thanks, Josh, because I think -- it's an interesting question because I think if you take, from a legacy standpoint, National General and what it was best at and known for and Encompass and what it's best at and known for, it would be different as you suggested. But as Tom just pointed out, National General and Allstate Company, that's going to be a different story. We're launching middle-market products. So think about basically the Allstate product capability in the middle market, auto and home and other personal lines on the National General platform and branded as National General and Allstate Company, starting in the second half of this year and then really fast expansion. So it'll be to all 50 states within 18 months of the start of that, so before the end of next year.
So really, National General and Allstate Company is going to be a company that is serving from nonstandard up through mass affluent and everything in between. It really is another national player in the independent agent space. And we've gotten a phenomenal reaction from independent agents, and they are genuinely excited to have another significant player and with the capabilities of Allstate and National General combined in that market. And so we're positioned really well to grow with a lot of greenfield ahead of us in the independent agent space."

First, it's about how do we think about increasing market share. And we use 2 words together: profitable growth. We put them together because that's what we want. We do not believe that growth with no profit is good for shareholders. So the objective, of course, is maximize shareholder value. Our expected outcomes for our team are that they will balance between growth and profitability. Our strategy, of course, as Mario talked about, in the second phase of Transformative Growth is get a more competitive auto insurance product. And we supported that, of course, and we're being successful by reducing our costs. So the first thing would be we control our cost. And we can make sure that if we reduce prices to get more competitive, we still maintain our margins.
Obviously, we want to be smarter, whether that be how we price or how we acquire business and our marketing. We're also using telematics. And then as we go forward with Transformative Growth, it will be by being faster with better technology and having new products affordable, simple and connected that are sold through that broad range of distribution that Glenn was just talking about from direct to Allstate agents.
So Glenn, do you want to jump in on the specifics?"

So from a frequency standpoint, everybody gets benefited from some lower frequency. But we've also looked at a deeper level at it than just sort of miles driven and the number of accidents coming out because there are differences by books and you see differences in competitors as to how much tailwind that's providing. So we look at the fact that commuter driven or take it from rush hour, losses are down about 3 points more than overall losses. And we look at rural driving, it's down about 4 or 5 points less than urban driving. And so we look at these at a pretty deep level, and we're fortunate to work with Arity and have a lot of data on this with 10 years plus of telematics. We get pretty granular into how we're looking at it and understanding the frequency picture. So we've got a tailwind with that.
So which takes me in a competitive position because we've been moving our competitive position pretty aggressively. Like you see a minus 1.5 on average premium, and that might feel or seem slight, but there's a lot underneath that. We've moved new business pricing. We've moved telematic pricing. We've reduced the cost of our Milewise program that's grown really nicely. And all of that is inside of there. So our competitive position on the price changes we've made and that are still going into market have really improved. And our close rates are up. We're starting to see those really positive signs of momentum across multiple states.
And then you put on top of that the fact that some of our competitors have already taken price increases. You know some of those out there. We've heard others say that they're going to start taking bites at the apple in terms of price increases. And you look at our position, and obviously, we're in a position right now we continue to invest in growth. We can still put money into marketing. We could still put money into competitive price position because of where we're positioned, which really puts us in a great spot to grow going forward."

Let me talk about growth a little bit because it is really an important question that many analysts have. And of course, it drives huge value in the market today. And so we would start and say, first, actuals matter. And we had a great quarter. I mean over 25% revenue growth. Our PIF growth was in the low teens. And we're headed towards increasing our market share pretty significantly in personal lines this year, which is consistent with our strategy, I guess, what we set out to do. You have some naysayers who say, ""Well, you bought it with the acquisition of National General."" And that's, of course, true, but you always have to invest to get market share.
In this case, it is real growth. And we look at it and said, ""If we had taken the net price that we paid for National General and thrown it into marketing or higher commissions or some kind of spiff, it likely would have given us less growth than we got and certainly not the kind of profitability we're getting from it."" But we did buy it. But we did the same thing with Allstate Protection Plans, right? We bought SquareTrade. We repositioned it with our brand. And that acquired growth then turned into an organic growth platform. We expect the same thing to happen with National General. The difference is we paid a slightly higher premium for SquareTrade than we did for National General.
As it relates to the Allstate brand, we have multiple ways to grow, right? We've got the Allstate agents, and we're helping them transition to a new model. We have the direct business, which we've launched. And it's sold, by the way, at a different price than through an agent because we believe customers should pay for what they get. And if you get an agent and get that help, you should be willing to pay for that. And so overall, we feel like the Allstate brand is positioned for long-term growth as well. And so we feel like we've got an overall plan to move forward. It's got Transformative Growth in it. It's got real growth this quarter. And we're building platforms that will continue that growth going forward."

So I'm going to go back a long way. But in 2004 and '05, we had huge catastrophe losses. We weren't earning any money on homeowners business. We've made some money one year and we would lose money the next year. When you looked at it over time, like it's not a really good business. So we looked at getting out. And we said, ""You know what, if we were out, we'd want to be in because our customers do want it. So maybe it's just this catastrophe risk we really don't want."" So we created a very comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance program to basically divest certain portions of the risk we took on. And that's evolved over time.
We have a very sophisticated multiyear program. It's by state. It's different by event. It's got the aggregate in it. And we bear that cost each and every quarter, obviously, that comes through. Sometimes, it pays off. And what you saw this quarter was the aggregate kicked in. And so from losses -- some of the losses, which were last year, showed up as reducing our catastrophe losses this quarter, which were up pretty significantly. And that helped smooth it out. And we've looked at that from what kind of return on capital do we give up to the reinsurers, and we're quite comfortable giving up the return that they get to avoid the volatility that comes from it. And so it's helped us reposition the homeowners business so that now it's a very consistent source of profitability for us.
As I was saying to the prior question, we don't believe in growth with -- like running homeowners above 100 is not a good plan. And you're destroying value at that point with growth. And we don't believe in that. So we've used reinsurance to help reposition the business. We did a whole bunch of other stuff, including changing the product and changing the way we price and how we underwrite it, how we do our segmentation down to specific risk codes, how we pay for roof. So there's a whole bunch of stuff we've changed underneath that over the last decade, but it's a really good business. In reinsurance, using the reinsurers helped us get there. So what you saw this quarter was a benefit, which is more than -- it was earned in this quarter, but it was paid for in the prior quarter. So some people want to exclude it from this year's quarter, I totally get that. I'm like, ""That's fine."" But then you should not be counting all the costs from the other time.
Mario or Glenn, do you want to talk about the cost of reinsurance in the program going forward?"

And just to give you a little color, Greg, on the benefits in the quarter, we recovered about $955 million in the quarter on a net basis. Part of that was from our per occurrence nationwide program where we retain the first $500 million of an event, and then we have coverage in our current program up to $5 billion. And then as Tom mentioned, we also have an aggregate cover which is about $1 billion, which spans a 12-month period. We also had recoveries under that. So combined, it was about $955 million. That's net of reinstatement premiums in the quarter. And it was principally on the freeze event in Texas. So the freeze event on a net basis cost us $586 million in the quarter. Once you start peeling back the prior year component of that reinsurance recovery, which is about $150 million, you get to a gross loss in Texas north of $1.3 billion. So we benefited pretty significantly in the quarter from our reinsurance program.
As you mentioned, we posted on our website the -- we placed most of the nationwide program this quarter. And we still have a component of the nationwide program to do. And then remember, we have a separate Florida program. The cost year-over-year, because we've included National General in this year's program, is going to be slightly higher than it was a year ago when you add up what we were spending on reinsurance and what National General was spending on reinsurance. But in terms of what you saw in the first quarter, you got to remember that's still last year's program that was placed May 1. And what we saw last year was -- the increase we experienced was mainly in the Florida program, and you're seeing that kind of cycle through in the first quarter. We will start incurring the cost of this year's program when it incepts, which is on June 1."

You should know that our strategy is to both keep reducing costs every place we can so that we can have a more affordable product for our customers and, therefore, a better price, we get more of them but not invest in growth because with the kind of return on capital we're getting in these businesses, we should definitely be seeking more growth.

So I guess, as Tom mentioned, we're going to continue to focus on reducing our cost structure. And like we've said really all along, our focus on reducing our cost structure is not a margin expansion focus. It's a growth focus. And it's a growth focus because reducing our costs enables us to invest more in growth. And you saw it this quarter where we invested more in marketing. And the component of our underwriting expense ratio related to marketing actually increased by 0.9 point, yet it was more than offset by the operating cost reductions that Tom referenced from last year. So the real ins and outs were more investment in advertising, more than offset by cost reductions and net-net, a 0.5 point improvement in kind of the underlying expense ratio in the quarter. And we're going to continue to focus on moving that number down.
The other thing I'd mention on expenses, and it's not obvious in our numbers, is part of our focus on cost reduction has been on getting more efficient in claim handling. And we've improved the efficiency and our loss adjustment expense, which comes through the loss ratio. But again, we consider it as a core part of our cost reduction efforts to improve the cost structure, create capacity to invest and be able to grow more and continue to deliver excellent returns. So I think what you saw in the quarter was really a kind of proof of how that strategy is playing out. In terms of the homeowner expense ratio specifically, Greg, I'd have to go back and take a look at what components of it, whether it came through distribution costs or underwriting costs, whether it was like inspections and so on. So let me take that one off-line, and I'll get back to you on that one."

But Paul, the first thing I would say is, no, we're not going to do the nationwide deal and turn them all into independent agents. We don't think that makes sense from a customer standpoint. Our customers come to us because they love the Allstate brand. We have a really strong brand, long relationships. So we're not planning on turning them into something else. And obviously, the fast pace of change has all of us on edge, whether you're a retailer or anybody, with what's going on in the world. And the good news for our agents is that still a majority of consumers want an insurance professional help them buy insurance. And our agents are really good at it.
That said, people are more comfortable with self-service, simple items, and technology enables a computer to do some of the work that used to be handled by people and still, in some cases, handled on local offices. So we have to transition their model and go where the customer is going.
And so that includes -- maybe we don't have to use as much real estate as we use today. We certainly do not need to do as much service work in agent offices. So we have a little over 10,000 Allstate agents. There's probably 26,000, 27,000 people working in those agents. Some of those people are doing service work. And we think we can do that either centrally at a lower cost and be more effective for our customers or just get the computer to do it and nobody does it at all. So we have to figure out how do we transition those people in those offices to doing service work, to doing sales work or, if they can't transition those licensed sales professionals, have the agents build up staff they can move into.
So last year, one of the things that Glenn and team did was they raised a new business commissions to incent and give people the opportunity to invest more and sell more things to more people and get more people selling for them. And to offset that and continue to make sure we're meeting our customers' cost needs, we slightly reduced renewal commissions to reflect that. So if you're an agent and you're focused on new sales, that's a good thing. You're excited about it. You're often ready to go. If you've been focused more on service and not on growth, then you're not going to be as excited about that change because it changes your business model.
So we have to help them transition from where they are to the place where the customers want us to go, which is they want help, but they want to do it in a technologically efficient, low cost way. And we think that there's a good way to do it. Glenn can give you some examples of what we're doing with our existing agents. We've already talked about what we're doing direct to serve our customers. And then we're also trying some new models that Glenn can talk about that do the same thing, which is use people to help people buy insurance in a local space today at lower cost.

So I know I'm being repetitive, but it's really important. So it's a hard no on the IA piece. So I'll just reiterate, as Tom said. We are dedicated to our exclusive agent model completely, and we believe that there is not only a meaningful place but a huge place for our exclusive agents to grow in the market because, as Tom said, most consumers still want to work with an agent.
So in the presentation materials, it talked about higher growth, lower cost models. So I'll just hit a couple of things. Lower cost, we've been really reticent in the past to allow agents to consolidate locations or to even go, in some cases, without real estate or reduce their real estate footprint. We've been very focused on a model that is, ""How many signs do you have up across the countryside?"" And we're going to really lean in to allowing agents to reduce costs in the way they run their business. And Tom talked a bit about the service. We started that in 2019, and we built it up a bit and everything, but we really have to get to a centralized and more efficient and effective way of serving customers than separately across 10,000 different locations. And we can take a lot of cost out of the system and reduce the cost for the agents so that they can focus on growth.
From a higher growth standpoint, it's about leaning in on the marketing that they do, that we can help them do more effectively and efficiently as a large enterprise, the lead management that they do, compensating them more for new business, as Tom mentioned also. That's the existing agents and how we want to transition that to higher growth, lower cost. The new models, for example, and we have several hundred of these already in place actually, are -- we're learning from our Canadian operation actually. In Canada, we have AllstateÂ agents who operate sort of independently from one another. It's not an agent with multiple staff. They're independent workers and producers. And they work on sort of a balance between being in communities and driving leads themselves and getting leads from the company. And it's been very successful. We're growing very fast in Canada.
So we leveraging that model and looking at models with no real estate, in local markets that are part of the community and are able to take leads and also generate their own leads in that community and grow. So it's early in the process, but in the second half of the year, we're looking to ramp those up significantly."

And the system would look like, it would have been generating more growth than it is today.
But we say, you know what, economically, that's just not the smart thing to do, like we're not using shareholders' money right. And that's where we get into, which is the conversation we were talking about before, profitable growth. You got to have profitable long-term growth. And so you have some bumps, but that's not about a flaw on the system, that's about an intentional choice."

People leave for all different reasons. And sometimes, it's for price. Sometimes it's because they move. Sometimes it's they bought a new car. And so it's difficult to get it down to precision to in a point. What you do know is if your Net Promoter Score is good and you're doing a better job for customers, they should stay around longer. And if you're competitive in price and you're changing your price not only for new business, which we've done, but also for your existing customers, which we've done, so they have a better price, and that should also keep them. But there's lots of different variations. So it's really hard to predict it.

So retention is a lagging metric, first of all, I'll start there. That wherever -- whenever a customer decides to cancel, move, shift, we record it and report it at the point of what would have been the renewal. So there's a bit of a lag to that. So while we stopped the special payment plans during last year, there's still some of that trickling in. So as Tom said, attribution is difficult on this. But there's a portion of it that's related to that, no question.
Secondly, though, look, it is a highly competitive market right now. Shopping is up. Advertising is up. And there's some impact from that. It's interesting when you look at National General, as an example, if you saw in some of our disclosures, like National General's new business, it's really eye-popping because National General writes a lot more new business to grow because they have a shorter cycle time. As our business shifts and we look at overall protection business, and we're writing in more markets and we're writing direct and not just through exclusive agents, that number will move around a little bit on retention, but our focus is to create a lot of new business. That's what Transformative Growth is about. We're going to create a lot of new business so that the undulations of retention don't mute our overall growth."

It's up this year something close to -- in autos, policies, I think, are 4 and change times what they were, autos are 6 and change times what they were a year prior. So significant growth. If this was a stand-alone start-up sitting outside of a large insurance company like Allstate, it is the largest in the industry, pay-by-mile program, and it would look really big and really fast-growing and really attractive.
Inside of Allstate, it is helping our growth, but it is not driving our growth, is the way I'd say that. We're looking to expand over time on Milewise. Right now, it's available to about 50% of consumers across the country, and we have more states lined up for that. It does require the OBD port, which I think everybody knows there are chip shortages out there. We have not run into a problem where we have to slow down our Milewise at this point. But we are actively managing our supply chain on it because it is a popular product, and we're managing our state expansion and looking at that so that we don't run into supply chain issues."

Today, we're going to link operating results and strategy in order to show how we expect to continue to generate shareholder value. So Allstate strategy has 2 components: increase personal profit liability market share; and expand protection solutions, which are shown in the 2 ovals on the left. 
The transformative growth plan to increase market share and personal profit liability hits 4 components. This strategy will drive market valuation by executing, innovating and focusing on long-term value creation. So in the first half of the year, we executed well for customers, executed well financially and for shareholders, as you can see on the right-hand panel. 
Property liability market share increased by approximately 1 percentage point due to the acquisition of National General. Allstate Protection Plans continue to grow rapidly by broadening the product offering to include appliance and furniture and expanding availability through Home Depot stores. 
Strong execution generated excellent financial results, with revenues increasing 23.8% compared to the prior year, adjusted net income of $3 billion and a return on equity of 23.8% for the last 12 months. 
Shareholders benefited from a 50% increase in the quarterly common dividend and a reduction in outstanding shares by 2.4% just this year under the current $3 billion share repurchase program. Yesterday, the Board approved a new $5 billion common share repurchase program, which represents approximately 13% of current market capitalization, and we expect to complete that by the end of March of 2023. 
Let's continue on Slide 3. In addition to operating execution, we're innovating to create long-term value. The transformative growth plan to create a digital insurance company is making good progress. Today, we're going to spend time talking about the distribution component of that plan. 
Allstate is amongst the leaders in telematics capabilities with DriveWise in the industry's largest pay-per-mile product Milewise, which offers customers unique value. Arity, our telematics service platform company, recently launched Arity IQ, which, when combined with lead cloud and transparency platforms, will integrate telematics information into pricing at the time of ""rather than at the time -- after the sale.""
We enhanced our competitive position in independent agent channel by using National General to consolidate and improve our IA business model. We executed agreements to sell Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company in New York to redeploy capital out of lower growth and return businesses and reduce exposure to interest rates. 
Increasing market share, while maintaining attractive returns and expanding protection solutions through transformation, targeted acquisitions and divestitures, will create shareholder value. 
Slide 4 lays out the Allstate's strong second quarter performance. Revenues of $12.6 billion in the quarter increased 21.6% compared to the prior year, largely reflects the National General acquisition and higher net investment income. 
Property liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 12.9% and 12.1%, respectively. Net investment income of $974 million increased by over $0.75 billion compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting $649 million of income from the performance-based portfolio. 
Net income of $1.6 billion was reported in the second quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. Adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $3.79 per diluted share, as you can see from the table on the bottom. That's a 40% increase from the prior year quarter. 
Allstate's excellent execution and strong operating results in the quarter contributed to that return on equity, which I just mentioned of 23.8% over the last 12 months. 
Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our progress on building transformative growth business models. So transformative growth is a multiyear initiative, and what we're working to do is build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution, and that's going to be accomplished through 4 areas: expanding customer access; improving customer value; increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition; and deploying new technology ecosystem. 
In transformative growth, you wouldn't do it all in 1 day, of course, so it's got 5 phases, and substantial progress has been made in Phases 2 and 3. Phase 2 successes include improving the competitive price position of auto insurance, protecting margins by reducing costs. New advertising was launched with increased investment. We also are off to an excellent start with National General. And of course, the phases overlap, so progress is also being made in Phase 3. So we're transforming the distribution platform, including supporting transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost models, which we'll discuss on the next slide. 
Improving customer acquisition sophistication will lower cost relative to lifetime value. We continue to focus on lowering underwriting claims expenses to deliver lower cost protection to customers, and we've designed a new technology architecture. We've coded much of the new applications. The next step for us is to launch an integrated system with 1 product in 1 state. 
Turning to Slide 6. Let's review how we're transforming the Allstate agent, Allstate direct sales and independent agent distribution platforms to grow market share. The illustrative slides on the right side of the slide should provide a view into our growth expectations by channel over time. Starting with Allstate exclusive agents, we're making progress transitioning to a higher growth and lower cross mile. This year, we changed agent compensation by increasing new business compensation opportunity and reducing of bonus paid on policy renewals. We expect to continue this shift from renewal compensation to new sales because it aligns with what consumers want. 
Consumers want assistance with purchasing insurance more than they want routine policy service. To lower cost for agents, we're digitizing processes, redesigning products to increase self-service and expanding centralized service support. 
We're also working to reduce agent operating expenses and real estate costs. These changes will improve the customer value proposition with lower cost and easier service. 
Now of course, you're not going to do this in 1 day either, so a multiyear transformation transition program is in place to support existing agents. We've initiated it, and it has different levels of support based on agent performance. 
Given this transition, we reduced new agent employment last year, which has had a negative impact on new business levels. But as Mario will discuss next, this has been offset by higher productivity from existing agents. At the same time, we have 2 new agent models in market, which have personal touch but a lower cost structure. 
All of these changes are supported by more competitive auto insurance pricing and increased marketing spending, which is designed to continue to grow. But as you can see on the right, the net impact of these changes for the Allstate agent channel is to be flat to a slight decline in sales in the short term, but increased growth thereafter.
The Allstate direct sales effort leverages the capabilities that we built for the Esurance brand, and we've shifted our advertising focus away from Esurance to be totally focused on the Allstate brand and utilizing the direct channel for Allstate [Indiscernible] sales as well. 
Pricing is lower than the late agent model since it doesn't come with the help of an agent. And as this business grows, we're improving our operational and marketing effectiveness. Direct sales now represent 29% of new auto business sales, and we expect that to continue to grow rapidly as you can see on the right. 
Independent agent distribution also represents an attractive growth opportunity. The acquisition of National General enhanced our capabilities in this channel, and they added 4 million policies in force. Additional growth is expected by broadening the product portfolio from high-risk drivers to middle-market auto and home insurance through the existing agent relationships. 
We also expect to increase the number of agents actively engaged in selling National General products. 
So when you combine this effective and efficient distribution, with more competitive auto insurance pricing, enhanced marketing, advanced pricing in telematics and a digital experience, that's the transformative growth plan that will drive property liability market share growth. 
So Mario will now discuss the second quarter results in more detail."
18711,711316608,2364593,"The Allstate Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 7. Let's dive deeper into near-term results on our multifaceted approach to grow property liability market share. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, property liability policies in force grew by 12.1%",1828,"Thanks, Tom. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let's dive deeper into near-term results on our multifaceted approach to grow property liability market share. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, property liability policies in force grew by 12.1% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by National General and growth in Allstate brand new business. 
National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4 million policies, and Allstate brand property liability policies increased in the quarter, driven by growth in homeowners and other personal lines. 
Allstate brand auto policies in force declined slightly compared to the prior year quarter, but increased sequentially for the second consecutive quarter, including growth of 111,000 policies compared to prior year, and as you can see by the table on the lower left. 
The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to prior year. We continue to make progress in building higher growth business models as we look to achieve leading positions in all 3 primary distribution channels. 
The middle section of the chart on the right shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 6.7% increase in new business growth compared to the prior year. Modest increases from existing agents, excluding new appointments, and a 31% increase in the direct channel more than offset the volume that would normally have been generated by newly appointed agents, as we pilot new agent models with higher growth and lower costs. The addition of National General also added 481,000 new auto applications in the quarter. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review property liability margin results in the second quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 95.7% increased 5.9 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased losses relative to the historically low auto accident frequency experienced in the prior year quarter due to the pandemic. 
Increased losses were partially offset by lower pandemic-related expenses, primarily shelter-in-place paybacks in 2020 as well as lower catastrophe losses. These are represented by the green bars in the combined ratio reconciliation chart on the lower left of the slide. 
Shifting to the chart on the bottom right, we continue to make progress in reducing our cost structure. This enables improvement in the competitive price position of auto insurance and investments in marketing and technology, while maintaining strong returns. The total property liability expense ratio of 24.7% in the second quarter decreased by 7.1 points compared to the prior year, again, driven by lower coronavirus-related expenses. 
This was partially offset by the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisition of National General, restructuring charges and a 0.7 point increase from higher investment in advertising. Excluding these items, as shown by the dark blue bars, the expense ratio decreased by 0.4 points in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, decreased 1.7 points below year-end 2019 and 2.5 points below year-end 2018, reflecting continued progress in improving cost efficiencies. 
Claims expenses have also been reduced through innovations such as QuickFoto Claim, Virtual Assist and aerial imagery, which also improves the customer experience. These claim improvements are not reflected in the expense ratio, but are in the loss ratio and also helped maintain margins. 
Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss how our auto insurance profitability, which remains very strong and is still favorable to prepandemic levels, despite pandemic-driven volatility. Allstate Protection auto underlying combined ratio finished at 91.8%. As you can see from the chart, the level remains favorable to 2017 through 2019 historical second quarter and year-end levels, despite increasing by 9.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. 
The increase to the prior year quarter reflects a comparison to a period with historically low auto accident frequencies. The improvement relative to historical levels is driven by auto accident frequency remaining below pre-pandemic levels, partly offset by auto severity increases and competitive pricing enhancements. 
To illustrate the pandemic-driven volatility, Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency increased 47.3% from the prior year quarter, but is 21% lower than the same period in 2019. Auto severity increases persisted relative to the prior year quarter and pre-pandemic periods across coverages, largely driven by the shift in mix to more severe, higher-speed auto accidents and rising inflationary impacts in both used car values and replacement part costs. 
The incurred severity increases are running higher than general inflation, which are reflected in the recorded combined ratio. To counteract rising severity, we are leveraging advanced claim capabilities, predictive modeling, advanced photo and video utilization and deep expertise in repair process management to enable a scaled response to inflation and supply constraints. Targeted price increases will also be implemented as necessary to maintain attractive auto insurance returns. 
Now let's shift to Slide 10, which highlights investment performance for the second quarter. Net investment income totaled $974 million in the quarter, which was $754 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $649 million in the second quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting both idiosyncratic and broad-based valuation increases in private equity investments and, to a lesser extent, gains from the sales of real estate equity. 
Market-based income, shown in blue, was $3 million above the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield was mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. 
Our total portfolio return in the second quarter totaled 2.6%. Targeted price increases will also be implemented as necessary to maintain attractive auto insurance returns. 
Now let's shift to Slide 10, which highlights investment performance for the second quarter. Net investment income totaled $974 million in the quarter, which was $754 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $649 million in the second quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting both idiosyncratic and broad-based valuation increases in private equity investments and, to a lesser extent, gains from the sales of real estate equity.  Market-based income, shown in blue, was $3 million above the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield was mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income.  Our total portfolio return in the second quarter totaled 2.6%, reflecting income as well as higher fixed income and equity valuations. We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit risk over appropriate investment horizons. Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk-and-return process and play an important role in generating shareholder value. We draw upon a deep and experienced team of roughly 350 professionals to leverage expertise in asset allocation, portfolio construction, fundamental research, deal leadership, quantitative methods, manager selection and risk management. While the results for this quarter were exceptionally strong, particularly for the performance-based investments, we managed the portfolio with a longer-term view on returns. At the right, we have provided our annualized portfolio returns over a 3-, 5-, and 10-year horizon. As disclosed in our investor supplement, our performance-based portfolio has delivered an attractive 12% IRR over the last 10 years, which compares favorably to relevant public and private market comparisons. Our performance-based strategy takes a longer-term view, where we seek to deliver attractive absolute and risk-adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk. 
Moving to Slide 11. Protection Services continues to grow revenue and profit. Revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 27.1% to $581 million in the second quarter. The increase was driven by continued rapid growth in Allstate Protection Plans and expanding marketing services at Arity due to the integration of LeadCloud and Transparent.ly, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition. Policies in force increased 15.5% to $147 million, also driven by Allstate Protection Plans and supported by the successful launch with the Home Depot in the first quarter. Adjusted net income was $56 million in the second quarter, representing an increase of $18 million compared to the prior year quarter driven by profitable growth at Allstate Protection Plans and profits at Arity and Allstate Identity Protection. Allstate Protection Plans generated adjusted net income of $42 million in the second quarter and $155 million over the past 12 months. 
Now let's move to Slide 12, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate attractive returns in the second quarter with adjusted net income return on equity of 23.8% for the last 12 months, which was 5.8 points higher than the prior year. 
Excellent capital management and strong financial results have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders, while simultaneously investing in growth. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders in the second quarter through a combination of $562 million in share repurchases and $245 million in common stock dividends. 
We announced the acquisition of SafeAuto in June, leveraging National General's success in integrating companies to accelerate growth. 
The current $3 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed in the third quarter. And yesterday, the Board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by March 31, 2023. This represents approximately 13% of our current market capitalization. This new authorization continues Allstate's strong track record of providing cash returns to shareholders and reflects, in part, the deployable capital generated by the sale of our life and annuity businesses. 
Moving to Slide 13. It should be clear that Allstate is an attractive investment opportunity. When you invest in Allstate, you get ownership of a company with advanced capabilities and a clear strategy, delivering superior financial results relative to peers and the broader market. 
The table below shows Allstate across key financial metrics over the past 5 years compared to the S&P 500 and property casualty insurance peers with a market cap of $4 billion or more. As you can see by the 4 measures on the top, operating EPS, operating return on average equity, cash yield and total shareholder return, Allstate is consistently ranked in the top 2 or 3 amongst its peers. 
In the case of operating EPS and cash yield to common shareholders, Allstate is in the top 10 and top 15%, respectively, compared to the S&P 500. 
Moving down 1 row, Allstate's top line revenue growth relative to peers and the S&P 500 is in the middle of the pack. We are committed to accelerating top line performance through transformative growth and innovating protection, while continuing to deliver excellent financial results. 
Moving down to the price to earnings ratio. Allstate is well below average, 8 out of 10 P&C peers and in the 10th percentile amongst the S&P 500. This is an attractive valuation given our market-leading capabilities, excellent returns, future growth prospects and commitment to accelerate growth.

This is a whole report card. This is what you get by investing in Allstate.
Empowering customers with protection is a core part of our shared purpose. We provide a broad set of protection solutions with over 180 million protection policies in force. You see our name whether you're watching TV, you're in Walmart, you're in Target, you're in Costco, you're in Home Depot. Allstate is ubiquitous out there protecting customers. 
We constantly achieve industry-leading margins on auto and home insurance and have attractive risk-adjusted investment returns. As a result, the adjusted net income return on equity has averaged 15.6% from 2016 to 2020, ranking #2 in our peer group. This has led to a 14.9% annualized total shareholder return over the last 5 years. 
We have a history of innovation. Transformative growth is a multiyear personal property liability strategy to build a digital platform that offers low cost, affordable, simple and connected protection solutions. We're simultaneously innovating protection by expanding through telematics, product warranties and identity protection. 
In telematics, we've taken a broad and aggressive approach, the insurance offerings and the creation of Arity, a leading telematics business. 
Allstate is also innovating in corporate citizenship, focusing on climate change, privacy and equity. For example, we used an underwriting syndicate for a $1.2 billion bond offering last year that was exclusively minority women and veteran-owned banking enterprises. 
Long-term value is also being created through proactive capital management and strong governance. Over the past 5 and 10 years, we've repurchased 25% and 50%, respectively, of outstanding shares. Among the S&P 500, Allstate is in the top 15% of cash provided to shareholders. 
At the same time, we've successfully invested over $6 billion in acquisitions, including Allstate Protection Plans, Allstate Identity Protection and National General. That had, of course, strong governance is key to delivering those results. Allstate has an experience in first management team and Board with relevant expertise. This is acknowledged by the leading proxy advisory firm that awarded Allstate a top score for governance. Execution, innovation and long-term value creation will continue to drive increased shareholder value. 
With that context, let's open the line for your questions."

And in the Phase 2 area, you report on substantial progress being made in terms of improved competitive price position in auto insurance. 
When I went to your supplement, I observed that the average gross premium in the auto brand continued to be lower relative to prior quarters. And I'm just curious how you think about pricing today given the increase in frequency and certainly the increase in severity in the context of your strategy to have an improved competitive price position."

Let me start, and then I'll get Glenn to jump in. First, in terms of transformative growth, we made a conscious strategic decision to improve the competitive position of auto insurance. When we looked at our cost structure, we looked at where other",691,"Okay. Let me start, and then I'll get Glenn to jump in. First, in terms of transformative growth, we made a conscious strategic decision to improve the competitive position of auto insurance. When we looked at our cost structure, we looked at where other people work, we decided we needed to be more competitive on price. And so we've been working on that. 
We've reduced our costs. We reduced price. We know we're more competitive in the market, not because you can't really look at the average prices, Greg, because they -- everybody starts in a different place. So if you were at 100 and I'm at 95, and you go down 2%, it doesn't make you -- really, it makes it more competitive, but not competitive. 
So we look at close rates, and we know our -- we look at the -- when people come to us, they quote what percentage do we close. And when the close rate goes up, you assume you're more price competitive, and you have a better value proposition. And in fact, that's been true this year, which is one of the reasons why our new business on. 
Now we do that, of course, with great surgical precision. So let me maybe provide an overview of auto insurance profitability because there was a focus on so many of the reports issued last night, and then Glenn can jump into what we've got going forward. But -- and I'll start with the analytical structure that I use to evaluate our performance in ways that hopefully will be helpful from an investment perspective. 
The headline would be to evaluate starting with the current absolute number, don't use one analytical method to assess the future and build on our margin for error. So the current combined ratio for auto insurance this quarter generated an attractive return on capital. When you look at the number, it's a good return on capital. 
Looking forward, of course, is what I need to do and investors need to do. And the forecasting challenge is that the volatility of the components is so high that it's hard to do a quarterly forecast that's accurate enough to make an important decision. 
So for example, let's take the percentage is up and down. They're really hard to evaluate. The outcome of 50% decrease and a 30% increase is a 65%. A 45% decrease and a 35% increase, it sounds pretty similar, right, but it's a 74%. That small 5-point difference on each side creates a 9-point difference on margins. They are typically less than that. 
So given the volatility of the percentage changes, we build in margins for error. So as it relates to our projections, the forecast so far this year has been pretty good. Severity was higher than expected. But given the volatility of those percentages in the environment, we made sure there was enough margin in pricing and reduced expenses. 
So as a result, our absolute level of profitability was good and better than many of our competitors report ourselves. So the overall goal, of course, is profitable growth. And the best way to manage that total is then you focus on the components, whether that's state by state, line by line or inside the actual cost structure. 
So Glenn has established goals for the rest of the year on price increases, severity control and expense reductions. And we have the processes, the math, the state managers that are -- enable us to achieve and adapt, which we have a consistent track record of doing. 
So I think when I see people making percentage changes over each quarter, looking at the percentage change of us versus the percentage change of competitors, I'm like, when you got the numbers moving around this fast, you really have to go back to the absolute and say, ""Did you make money? How did you make money? And how do you make sure you keep making money going forward?""
With that, let me turn it over to Glen, who can talk a little bit about what he's going to get planned for the rest of the year."

And Greg, if I go to the first part of your question on price position, the best measure of price competitiveness is our close rates, and our close rates are up. So we've seen good result on the fact that for a few years, as Mario cove",433,"Great. Thanks, Tom. And Greg, if I go to the first part of your question on price position, the best measure of price competitiveness is our close rates, and our close rates are up. So we've seen good result on the fact that for a few years, as Mario covered earlier, we've taken expenses out of the system. We've taken those expenses and essentially allowed customers to get better value from us, and that's improving our close rates, which has helped. 
The second part, when you talked about going forward with frequency and severity, as Tom said, we had a pretty good forecast on frequency, and it's continued to be lower when you go on a 2-year basis. The 1-year comparisons right now are interesting on just about everything. But on a 2-year basis, to prepandemic, they continue to be meaningfully lower. 
Some of that will be just the new different world that we're in, with fewer people working in office buildings and traveling in rush hour. Some of that will revert back over time. But we've had really good forecast on that. 
The frequency has been higher -- I'm sorry, the severity has been higher with inflationary factors. And so we're looking at that and where we have to take pricing, we will. 
And I guess, when you put them together, the key is in how we've been forecasting and when we look at when the line will cross, and what I mean by that is we knew that -- what severity is compounds over time. So once you're a couple of years in, which we are now when you're comparing to 2019, you've got a couple of years of severity increases. At some point, it's going to be greater than the benefit that is persisting on frequency, and you cross that line. 
And so we're pretty good at forecasting about the time we're crossing that line. We moved prices slightly down. In some places, we're still good with those down. We still have opportunity to even be more competitive. In other places, we're going to have to take them up. But we don't have wild swings happening in terms of our pricing. We've been pretty careful and cautious do things that we thought were sustainable, and we're going to continue to do things that we think are sustainable. 
So as we take expenses out, continuing to do for the remainder of the year, the loss cost management that the claims team is doing and our pricing actions, we think there's more ground we can make up from a competitive position standpoint."

I was going to ask a question on expenses, but I got to just follow up on your point on severity and crossing the line. As you know, there's so much oxygen going on around inflationary pressures in the marketplace.

But I think when you look at -- and interesting, though, when you look at the supplement, you'll see the paid on property damage is down. That's not related to the way we're booking. They just happen to be paid, and there's some timing. 
So when you look at severity, you have to be clear difference between what you paid and what you think you're going to pay eventually. And so we think severity -- we know severity is up this year. We booked it up both first quarter and second quarter, even a little more. And -- but so Glenn's got a factor in just pricing.
Glenn, anything you want to say about the clients? Maybe talk about a little bit about severity control."

And just to the point about what's transitory and what's in there, I think you have to look at both frequency and severity in that way, like their components of frequency. Like we get really detailed into looking at the miles driven. It isn't just what are the total miles driven out there. It's by state. It's urban versus rural. It's commuting time versus not. It's weekend versus week day and night-day. 
So when we look at all of this, we have a view on what we believe is transitory and what is more sustainable on frequency as well as on severity. But the controls that we have from a claims standpoint, we have a really strong claims team. And they use, first of all, proprietary models that we have that escalate claims, that either need to be expedited, moved faster or need to be prepared for defense in terms of injury claims, that tell us the likelihood of litigation, the likelihood of representation, things like that. 
We leverage our scale really well in that we have long-term pricing deals on a lot of the parts and labor that are out there for whether it's auto or home. So some of that acts as a hedge towards inflation, and it's not perfect because we're in the same inflationary environment that others are in. But we do, with our buying power, have good long-term deals that we've negotiated that helped to hedge that to some degree and then really strong quality processes that we manage across the system. 
So we feel good about our ability to manage within the environment, but also we have to price for it as it moves. And I guess, I'll close by saying if anything our history has been proven, I would say, we do a really good job managing to our returns. And Mario and Tom talked about those in the opening quite a bit. We will manage to produce the right returns. And when we need to take price to do that, we do it."

Paul, I think the first place I would start is the regulatory reaction tends to start with what the consumers think, and consumers are in a pretty good place. Our customers are in a pretty good place. We gave them $1 billion back last year. There's plenty of -- if you look at savings rates and cash and bank accounts and all kind of stuff, consumers are not -- have some pricing ability. There's not a lot of pricing pressure coming from consumers each day. 
So we -- and the kind of percentage increases that we need are not so large. You're not talking about double-digit price increases that caught everybody to call their insurance regulator and say, ""Hey, I don't like this world."" 
So we don't see a lot of consumer pushback. When you look at the regulators, we have a good relationship with our regulators. I mean, we were 10 days in last year. I mean, I think it was like 10 days into March, we were like, ""Oh my gosh. We got to do something about this."" So we went out proactively to regulators and said, ""Hey, we don't have a requirement to do. We have no contractual requirement to do it, but we know you want us to do it. So we're going to do it in advanced upfront,"" and we led the industry in doing that. 
So we feel like we have good relationships with them. We've been balanced as to how we approach it. And we've been able to earn the economic rents in the marketplace by -- and compete successfully.

They appreciated the fact that we were thinking about the way people were having to live their lives and not having to have to go buy an endorsement to do it, and we just gave it away for free and filed that across 50 states in a matter of days, and special payment plans allowing people more time to pay. So I think we did build a lot of credibility with that. 
But I think the core of this is the regulators have actuaries, and we have actuaries, and they are math-based. So this is -- sometimes you get into some emotion with it, but it's really a fact-based and math-based situation. So when severities go up or loss ratios move, their actuaries see what our actuaries see, and we have great relationship working through that one."

So we're good at this.

So it's a pretty deep skill that's been honed over a long period of time that we're able to leverage. And so when you look at -- there's no question that inflation is hitting the homeowner side hard, and you got weather events. And you look at what it's doing to the industry more broadly than us, and there's going to be folks taking a lot of rate out there, and I think you've heard that from them. 
And our product is such that, like, year-over-year, we're at 6% up on average premium, even though we took only 3.5 points of rate because built into it, there's some inflationary factor. So we're really well positioned to continue to make money at it, protect a lot of people. 
And last point is, it goes to what Tom talked about earlier about transformative growth. You look at the independent agent system. We bought National General in -- primarily to really have a ticket into that system where they have great systems, a lot of appointments, great relationships, and they're good at some products.

While we don't publish any forecasting on frequency, I think, broadly, people in the industry have talked about the fact that safer cars have tended to have a little bit of a tailwind for frequency. Even take away the pandemic for a moment that, year-over-year, we've had a long-term steady decline in frequency. And so you've got a couple of years of that as you compare to 2019. 
On top of that, we see -- and I alluded to this a little bit before, we see a really material change in the way people are driving. So even when you see the aggregate number of miles driven coming back, still lower, but closer to 2019 levels. Who is driving, when they're driving and how they're driving is changing materially. 
So you see about a 4- or 5-point difference between the net change of urban driving being down more than rural driving. So you look at an Allstate book of business where we sell predominantly through exclusive agents, our exclusive agents are in more populated markets. That tends to favor the way the frequency comes through. 
You look at the type of driving that's done. I mentioned before, commuting is down significantly more than noncommuting. So a quick stat for you, as we look at a lot of these details, weekend driving is actually higher right now than 2019 was. People just want to get out. 
With day driving, it's materially lower. And so -- and particularly in rush hour. So when you see less congested roads in the time period when the predominance of accidents happen in those morning and afternoon commutes, that is helpful to -- particularly in our book of business, the way frequency comes through. 
So there are elements that will come back. It will come back differently. The only thing I'm confident in saying is that the world will look exactly the same after the pandemic than before, and that will mean that people drive and move differently. But we see some non-transitory or temporary impacts to frequency as well as severity."

So I would just say that we think we will -- you should rely on the fact, David, that we know how to make money, and we're focused on making money. 
As to the competitive advantages, I think it depends what other people do. So you heard yesterday, if you listened to the Progressive call, they're all in on raising prices, cutting advertising, changing underwriting and stuff. So we think that gives us room to adapt and continue to grow and make money and make sure that we can recover costs as they go up. 
Other competitors are in different places, but we feel good about where we're at. Like transformative growth like, if you start off and said, ""Would you want to have a pandemic and a huge drop in frequency for a year to do transformative growth,"" you probably would say, ""I don't know. Like it's a lot of volatility to manage."" So -- on the other hand, I think in our particular case, it's worked well for us."

But we think our relative advantage given our sophistication and pricing, given our reduction in expenses, given what we're doing on a long-term basis to get expenses down even further puts us in good place.

So when you buy Allstate Direct, it's, I think, on average about 7% lower than if you buy a termination because it doesn't come with help. Like -- and so that's -- you get what you pay for. 
And there are people -- there are some demographic shift to that. But some of it's not -- there are some young people who want help and some older people who don't want to help. And so we're there focused not as much on demographics of those channels, but as the customer value. 
As it relates to our competitive position in each channel, we believe you should have a competitive price position in each channel like-for-like. So if you're buying from GEICO or Progressive and you're buying direct and you're buying from Allstate and you're buying direct, you should be the same kind of value. 
Now it gets a little nicer when you figure out what price is because of what the limits are. And at times, it's complicated fast. But the conceptual approach would be, be competitive in channel based on the value you deliver to shareholders -- to customers. 
Glenn, how would you -- is there other thing that you want to add to that?"

It's why transformative growth, why we wanted to be in all channels and where customers want to buy. So I think there's some benefit to that. 
But the bigger benefit is 2 other things. One would be being competitively priced. That's why we're going after expense and supply. We did the pricing differential that Tom talked about. And then the third one, which, frankly, maybe even the most important is just your execution, and it's the fact that we have used the capabilities of the Esurance, but we're still newer at being a large national player with the brand we've got at Allstate doing this. 
It's building the capabilities, whether it's web, sales processes, marketing sophistication, integration of marketing into it, so that we are winning our fair share there because you-ly got to get the price to be competitive, but you also have to be great at the process itself."

We expect it to continue to go up, as Glenn said, as we get better. 
There are some shifts to that channel if you just look globally. Some of that's because more people feel comfortable buying over the web and not going through some of that. Some of it is just direct as a whole bunch of advertising, and it drives people to it. But we're, as Glenn pointed out, in that boat and increasing our capabilities. 
But that doesn't mean we're waving the flag on people to people exchange. And so the key part of transformative growth is there are people who want help. We just need to give it to them at a lower cost, and that's what we're working on. So people were more than happy to pay a lot of money to -- not a lot, but to be paid to help to buy the insurance. They just don't want to pay 10% for ongoing service when they can do self-service, if there's not much to be done or you can do it at a lower cost centrally. 
So that's our shift in transfer. We're not waving the flag on person-to-person sales. In fact, we're leaning in and saying we have a great position there. We have a great brand. People know us. We just need to do it more effectively and create higher growth models. 
So that will take us some time to transition, as we talked about. Like I don't expect the Allstate agent business to jump up the way you'll see the direct business increase over the next 12 months. But I do think it's got great long-term potential, and we're investing heavily in making sure those agents can deliver what people want is they want help buying products."

It really is about claims capabilities and paying what you owe and being fair to folks, but making sure you don't pay more than owe as things move. 
So we have inflationary factors, for example, say, on materials for homeowners. Having purchasing power and having really good deals in place over the long term on flooring, on roofing and other products used in home repair helps hedge that inflation. And with our size, with our buying power and with the capabilities of our claims team, we've been able to do that, and it helps hedge it. 
Again, I'm not suggesting it eliminates the problem of inflation, but it does help mitigate it, so that not all of that cost is passed through to your customers because when I do the job to our customers, obviously, wily got to put them back to where they were. We've got to charge people an appropriate price and give them the best value possible, and part of that is mitigating the cost of claims. So that was in the purchasing power. 
The proprietary models I mentioned before is we've just invested a lot in our analytics and data capabilities over the years in order to flag claims that were at risk for accelerating costs, so that we could get it into the right experts' hands at the right time and it allows us to do a better quality job on those and also manage the costs."

Thank you for taking time. Let me just close on a few things. First, on investment results, I totally understand the view that one would not fully count the huge increase in performance-based income. But when I read some of the reports, Mike, I think it's fair to say it was an outsized quarter, but that doesn't mean that our long-term results should be good. 
We're good in investments. We've had good results. Our acquisitions are performing well, whether that be Allstate Protection Plans, which we didn't really get questions on today. I just want to remind you, we bought that company 4 years ago, $1.4 billion. It's now over $1 billion in revenue. It's growing at 27% a year. It made $155 million, which means we paid 9x earnings for a business that has grown 27%. So we think it's worth a lot more than that. 
National General, we also think we'll be highly successful, we're off to a really good start there. You can see that in the current numbers. And it's not just the 4 million policies we have. 
By the way, when you look at the net cash we had to lay out after statutory capital, I do not believe we could have acquired 1% market share by putting a couple of billion dollars into advertising. So we think it was also just an economic growth opportunity straight up, forget the strategic potential of further growth. 
And then share repurchases, we continue to really do well. This is the biggest share repurchase program we've ever announced, both in dollars and percentage of market capitalization, not to be overlooked. 
So thank you for participating today. We had great results this quarter. We look forward to talking to next quarter."

Let's start on Slide 2. Today, we're going to link operating results and strategy in order to show how we expect to continue to generate shareholder value. So Allstate's strategy has 2 components: increase",1339,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let's start on Slide 2. Today, we're going to link operating results and strategy in order to show how we expect to continue to generate shareholder value. So Allstate's strategy has 2 components: increase personal profit liability market share; and expand protection solutions, which are shown in the 2 ovals on the left. The Transformative Growth plan to increase market share and personal profit liability has 4 components. This strategy will drive market valuation by executing, innovating and focusing on long-term value creation. So in the first half of the year, we executed well for customers, we executed well financially and for shareholders, as you can see on the right-hand panel. 
Property-Liability market share increased by approximately 1 percentage point due to the acquisition of National General. Allstate Protection Plans continue to grow rapidly by broadening the product offering to include appliance and furniture and expanding availability through Home Depot stores. Strong execution generated excellent financial results, with revenues increasing 23.8% compared to the prior year, adjusted net income of $3 billion and a return on equity of 23.8% for the last 12 months. Shareholders benefited from a 50% increase in the quarterly common dividend and a reduction in outstanding shares by 2.4% just this year under the current $3 billion share repurchase program. Yesterday, the Board approved a new $5 billion common share repurchase program, which represents approximately 13% of current market capitalization, and we expect to complete that by the end of March of 2023. 
Let's continue on Slide 3. In addition to operating execution, we're innovating to create long-term value. The Transformative Growth plan to create a digital insurance company is making good progress. Today, we're going to spend time talking about the distribution component of that plan. Allstate is amongst the leaders in telematics capabilities with Drivewise in the industry's largest pay-per-mile product Milewise, which offers customers unique value. Arity, our telematics service platform company, recently launched Arity IQ, which, when combined with LeadCloud and Transparent.ly platforms, will integrate telematics information into pricing at the time of quote rather than at the times after the sale.
We enhanced our competitive position in independent agent channel by using National General to consolidate and improve our IA business model. We executed agreements to sell Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York to redeploy capital out of lower growth and return businesses and reduce exposure to interest rates. Increasing market share, while maintaining attractive returns and expanding protection solutions through transformation, targeted acquisitions and divestitures will create shareholder value. 
Slide 4 lays out the Allstate's strong second quarter performance. Revenues of $12.6 billion in the quarter increased 21.6% compared to the prior year, largely reflects the National General acquisition and higher net investment income. Property-Liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 12.9% and 12.1%, respectively. Net investment income of $974 million increased by over $0.75 billion compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting $649 million of income from the performance-based portfolio. Net income of $1.6 billion was reported in the second quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. Adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $3.79 per diluted share, as you can see from the table on the bottom. That's a 40% increase from the prior year quarter. Allstate's excellent execution and strong operating results in the quarter contributed to that return on equity, which I just mentioned, of 23.8% over the last 12 months. 
Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our progress on building Transformative Growth business models. So Transformative Growth, it's a multiyear initiative, and what we're working to do is build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution, and that's going to be accomplished through 4 areas: expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, and deploying new technology ecosystem. 
In Transformative Growth, you wouldn't do it all in 1 day, of course, so it's got 5 phases, and substantial progress has been made in Phases 2 and 3. Phase 2 successes include improving the competitive price position of auto insurance, protecting margins by reducing costs. New advertising was launched with increased investment. We also are off to an excellent start with National General. And of course, the phases overlap, so progress is also being made in Phase 3. So we're transforming the distribution platform, including supporting transition of Allstate agents to higher-growth and lower-cost models, which we'll discuss on the next slide. Improving customer acquisition sophistication will lower cost relative to lifetime value. We continue to focus on lowering underwriting claims expenses to deliver lower-cost protection to customers, and we've designed a new technology architecture. We've coded much of the new applications. The next step for us is to launch an integrated system with one product in one state. 
Turning to Slide 6. Let's review how we're transforming the Allstate agent, Allstate direct sales and independent agent distribution platforms to grow market share. The illustrative slides on the right side of the slide show -- provide a view into our growth expectations by channel over time. Starting with Allstate exclusive agents, we're making progress transitioning to a higher-growth and lower-cost model. This year, we changed agent compensation by increasing new business compensation opportunity and reducing of bonus paid on policy renewals. We expect to continue this shift from renewal compensation to new sales because it aligns with what consumers want. Consumers want assistance with purchasing insurance more than they want routine policy service. To lower cost for agents, we're digitizing processes, redesigning products to increase self-service and expanding centralized service support. We're also working to reduce agent operating expenses and real estate costs. These changes will improve the customer value proposition with lower cost and easier service. 
Now of course, you're not going to do this in 1 day either, so a multiyear transformation -- transition program is in place to support existing agents. We've initiated it, and it has different levels of support based on agent performance. Given this transition, we reduced new agent employment last year, which has had a negative impact on new business levels. But as Mario will discuss next, this has been offset by higher productivity from existing agents. At the same time, we have 2 new agent models in market, which have personal touch but a lower cost structure. All of these changes are supported by more competitive auto insurance pricing and increased marketing spending, which is designed to continue to grow. But as you can see on the right, the net impact of these changes for the Allstate agent channel is to be flat to a slight decline in sales in the short term but increased growth thereafter. 
The Allstate direct sales effort leverages the capabilities that we built for the Esurance brand, and we've shifted our advertising focus away from Esurance to be totally focused on the Allstate brand and utilizing the direct channel for Allstate-branded sales as well. And pricing is lower than the Allstate agent model since it doesn't come with the help of an agent. And as this business grows, we're improving our operational and marketing effectiveness. Direct sales now represent 29% of new auto business sales, and we expect that to continue to grow rapidly, as you can see on the right. 
Independent agent distribution also represents an attractive growth opportunity. The acquisition of National General enhanced our capabilities in this channel, and it added 4 million policies in force. Additional growth is expected by broadening the product portfolio from high-risk drivers to middle-market auto and home insurance through the existing agent relationships. We also expect to increase the number of agents actively engaged in selling National General products. So when you combine this effective and efficient distribution with more competitive auto insurance pricing, enhanced marketing, advanced pricing and telematics and a digital experience, that's the Transformative Growth plan that will drive Property-Liability market share growth. 
So Mario will now discuss the second quarter results in more detail."

Let's dive deeper into the near-term results on our multifaceted approach to grow Property-Liability market share. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, Property-Liability policies in force grew by 12.1% compared to the prior year quarter primarily driven by National General and growth in Allstate brand new business. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4 million policies, and Allstate brand Property-Liability policies increased in the quarter driven by growth in homeowners and other personal lines. 
Allstate brand auto policies in force declined slightly compared to the prior year quarter but increased sequentially for the second consecutive quarter, including growth of 111,000 policies compared to prior year, and as you can see by the table on the lower left. The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to prior year. We continue to make progress in building higher-growth business models as we look to achieve leading positions in all 3 primary distribution channels. 
The middle section of the chart on the right shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 6.7% increase in new business growth compared to the prior year. Modest increases from existing agents, excluding new appointments, and a 31% increase in the direct channel more than offset the volume that would normally have been generated by newly appointed agents, as we pilot new agent models with higher growth and lower costs. The addition of National General also added 481,000 new auto applications in the quarter. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review Property-Liability margin results in the second quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 95.7% increased 5.9 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased losses relative to the historically low auto accident frequency experienced in the prior year quarter due to the pandemic. Increased losses were partially offset by lower pandemic-related expenses primarily shelter-in-place paybacks in 2020 as well as lower catastrophe losses. These are represented by the green bars in the combined ratio reconciliation chart on the lower left of the slide. 
Shifting to the chart on the bottom right, we continue to make progress in reducing our cost structure. This enables improvement in the competitive price position of auto insurance and investments in marketing and technology, while maintaining strong returns. The total Property-Liability expense ratio of 24.7% in the second quarter decreased by 7.1 points compared to the prior year, again, driven by lower coronavirus-related expenses. This was partially offset by the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisition of National General, restructuring charges and a 0.7-point increase from higher investment in advertising. 
Excluding these items, as shown by the dark blue bars, the expense ratio decreased by 0.4 points in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, decreased 1.7 points below year-end 2019 and 2.5 points below year-end 2018, reflecting continued progress in improving cost efficiencies. Claims expenses have also been reduced through innovations such as QuickFoto Claim, Virtual Assist and aerial imagery, which also improves the customer experience. These claim improvements are not reflected in the expense ratio but are in the loss ratio and also helped maintain margins. 
Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss how our auto insurance profitability, which remains very strong and is still favorable to prepandemic levels despite pandemic-driven volatility. Allstate Protection auto underlying combined ratio finished at 91.8%. As you can see from the chart, the level remains favorable to 2017 through 2019 historical second quarter and year-end levels despite increasing by 9.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The increase to the prior year quarter reflects a comparison to a period with historically low auto accident frequencies. The improvement relative to historical levels is driven by auto accident frequency remaining below prepandemic levels, partly offset by auto severity increases and competitive pricing enhancements. 
To illustrate the pandemic-driven volatility, Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency increased 47.3% from the prior year quarter but is 21% lower than the same period in 2019. Auto severity increases persisted relative to the prior year quarter and prepandemic periods across coverages, largely driven by the shift in mix to more severe, higher-speed auto accidents and rising inflationary impacts in both used car values and replacement part costs. The incurred severity increases are running higher than general inflation, which are reflected in the recorded combined ratio. To counteract rising severity, we are leveraging advanced claim capabilities, predictive modeling, advanced photo and video utilization and deep expertise in repair process management to enable a scaled response to inflation and supply constraints. Targeted price increases will also be implemented, as necessary, to maintain attractive auto insurance returns. 
Now let's shift to Slide 10, which highlights investment performance for the second quarter. Net investment income totaled $974 million in the quarter, which was $754 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $649 million in the second quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting both idiosyncratic and broad-based valuation increases in private equity investments and, to a lesser extent, gains from the sales of real estate equity. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $3 million above the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield was mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. 
Our total portfolio return in the second quarter totaled 2.6%, reflecting income as well as higher fixed income and equity valuations. We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit risk over appropriate investment horizons. Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk-and-return process and play an important role in generating shareholder value. We draw upon a deep and experienced team of roughly 350 professionals to leverage expertise in asset allocation, portfolio construction, fundamental research, deal leadership, quantitative methods, manager selection and risk management. 
While the results for this quarter were exceptionally strong, particularly for the performance-based investments, we managed the portfolio with a longer-term view on returns. At the right, we have provided our annualized portfolio returns over a 3-, 5-, and 10-year horizon. As disclosed in our investor supplement, our performance-based portfolio has delivered an attractive 12% IRR over the last 10 years, which compares favorably to relevant public and private market comparisons. Our performance-based strategy takes a longer-term view, where we seek to deliver attractive absolute and risk-adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk. 
Moving to Slide 11. Protection Services continues to grow revenue and profit. Revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 27.1% to $581 million in the second quarter. The increase was driven by continued rapid growth in Allstate Protection Plans and expanding marketing services at Arity due to the integration of LeadCloud and Transparent.ly, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition. Policies in force increased 15.5% to $147 million, also driven by Allstate Protection Plans and supported by the successful launch with the Home Depot in the first quarter. Adjusted net income was $56 million in the second quarter, representing an increase of $18 million compared to the prior year quarter driven by profitable growth at Allstate Protection Plans and profits at Arity and Allstate Identity Protection. Allstate Protection Plans generated adjusted net income of $42 million in the second quarter and $155 million over the past 12 months. 
Now let's move to Slide 12, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate attractive returns in the second quarter with adjusted net income return on equity of 23.8% for the last 12 months, which was 5.8 points higher than the prior year. Excellent capital management and strong financial results have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders, while simultaneously investing in growth. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders in the second quarter through a combination of $562 million in share repurchases and $245 million in common stock dividends. We announced the acquisition of SafeAuto in June, leveraging National General's success in integrating companies to accelerate growth. 
The current $3 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed in the third quarter. And yesterday, the Board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by March 31, 2023. This represents approximately 13% of our current market capitalization. This new authorization continues Allstate's strong track record of providing cash returns to shareholders and reflects, in part, the deployable capital generated by the sale of our life and annuity businesses. 
Moving to Slide 13. It should be clear that Allstate is an attractive investment opportunity. When you invest in Allstate, you get ownership of a company with advanced capabilities and a clear strategy, delivering superior financial results relative to peers and the broader market. The table below shows Allstate across key financial metrics over the past 5 years compared to the S&P 500 and property-casualty insurance peers with a market cap of $4 billion or more. As you can see by the 4 measures on the top, operating EPS, operating return on average equity, cash yield and total shareholder return, Allstate is consistently ranked in the top 2 or 3 amongst its peers. 
In the case of operating EPS and cash yield to common shareholders, Allstate is in the top 10 and top 15%, respectively, compared to the S&P 500. Moving down one row, Allstate's top line revenue growth relative to peers and the S&P 500 is in the middle of the pack. We are committed to accelerating top line performance through Transformative Growth and innovating protection, while continuing to deliver excellent financial results. Moving down to the price-to-earnings ratio. Allstate is well below average, 8 out of 10 P&C peers, and in the 10th percentile amongst the S&P 500. This is an attractive valuation given our market-leading capabilities, excellent returns, future growth prospects and commitment to accelerate growth. 
Now let me turn it back over to Tom."

Let's finish where we started with a more macro and longer-term view of Allstate's execution, innovation and long-term value creation. And this is the whole report card. This is what you get by investing in Allstate. Empowering customers with protection is a core part of our shared purpose. We provide a broad set of protection solutions with over 180 million protection policies in force. You see our name whether you're watching TV, you're in Walmart, you're in Target, you're in Costco, you're in Home Depot. Allstate is ubiquitous out there protecting customers. We constantly achieve industry-leading margins on auto and home insurance and have attractive risk-adjusted investment returns. As a result, the adjusted net income return on equity has averaged 15.6% from 2016 to 2020, ranking #2 in our peer group. This has led to a 14.9% annualized total shareholder return over the last 5 years. 
We have a history of innovation. Transformative Growth is a multiyear personal, Property-Liability strategy to build a digital platform that offers low-cost, affordable, simple and connected protection solutions. We're simultaneously innovating protection by expanding through telematics, product warranties and identity protection. In telematics, we've taken a broad and aggressive approach with the insurance offerings and the creation of Arity, a leading telematics business. Allstate is also innovating in corporate citizenship, focusing on climate change, privacy and equity. For example, we used an underwriting syndicate for our $1.2 billion bond offering last year that was exclusively minority women and veteran-owned banking enterprises. Long-term value is also being created through proactive capital management and strong governance. Over the past 5 and 10 years, we've repurchased 25% and 50%, respectively, of outstanding shares. Among the S&P 500, Allstate is in the top 15% of cash provided to shareholders. 
At the same time, we've successfully invested over $6 billion in acquisitions, including Allstate Protection Plans, Allstate Identity Protection and National General. And of course, strong governance is key to delivering those results. Allstate has an experienced and diverse management team and Board with relevant expertise. This is acknowledged by the leading proxy advisory firm that awarded Allstate the top score for governance. Execution, innovation and long-term value creation will continue to drive increased shareholder value. 
With that context, let's open the line for your questions."

Let me start, and then I'll get Glenn to jump in. First, in terms of Transformative Growth, we made a conscious strategic decision to improve the competitive position of auto insurance. When we looked at our cost structure, we looked at where other",694,"Okay. Let me start, and then I'll get Glenn to jump in. First, in terms of Transformative Growth, we made a conscious strategic decision to improve the competitive position of auto insurance. When we looked at our cost structure, we looked at where other people were, we decided we needed to be more competitive on price. And so we've been working on that. We've reduced our costs. We reduced price. We know we're more competitive in the market, not because -- you can't really look at the average prices, Greg, because they -- everybody starts in a different place. So if you were at 100 and I'm at 95, and you go down 2%, it doesn't make you -- really, it makes you more competitive but not competitive. 
So we look at close rates, and we know our -- we look at the -- when people come to us, they quote what percentage do we close. And when the close rate goes up, you assume you're more price competitive, and you have a better value proposition. And in fact, that's been true this year, which is one of the reasons why our new business is up. Now we do that, of course, with great surgical precision. So let me maybe provide an overview of auto insurance profitability because it was the focus of so many of the reports issued last night, and then Glenn can jump into what we've got going forward. But -- and I'll start with the analytical structure that I use to evaluate our performance in ways that hopefully will be helpful from an investment perspective. 
The headline would be to evaluate starting with the current absolute number, don't use one analytical method to assess the future and build on your margin for error. So the current combined ratio for auto insurance this quarter generated an attractive return on capital. When you look at the number, it's a good return on capital. Looking forward, of course, is what I need to do and investors need to do. And the forecasting challenge is that the volatility of the components is so high that it's hard to do a quarterly forecast that's accurate enough to make an important decision. So for example, let's say the percentage is up and down. They're really hard to evaluate. The outcome of 50% decrease and a 30% increase is a 65%. A 45% decrease and a 35% increase, it sounds pretty similar, right, but it's a 74%. That small 5-point difference on each side creates a 9-point difference on margins. There are typically less than that. 
So given the volatility of the percentage changes, we build in margins for error. So as it relates to our projections, the forecast so far this year has been pretty good. Severity was higher than expected. But given the volatility of those percentages in the environment, we made sure there was enough margin in pricing and reduced expenses. So as a result, our absolute level of profitability was good and better than many of our competitors' reported sales. So the overall goal, of course, is profitable growth. And the best way to manage that total is then you focus on the components, whether that's state by state, line by line or inside the actual cost structure. 
So Glenn has established goals for the rest of the year on price increases, severity control and expense reductions. And we have the processes, the math, the state managers that are -- enable us to achieve and adapt, which we have a consistent track record of doing. So I think when I see people making percentage changes over each quarter, looking at the percentage change of us versus the percentage change of competitors, I'm like, when you got the numbers moving around this fast, you really have to go back to the absolute and say, ""Did you make money? How did you make money? And how do you make sure you keep making money going forward?"" 
With that, let me turn it over to Glenn, who can talk a little bit about what he's going to -- got planned for the rest of the year."
18711,711316608,2364923,"The Allstate Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Great. Thanks, Tom. And Greg, if I go to the first part of your question on price position, the best measure of price competitiveness is our close rate, and our close rates are up. So we've seen good result on the fact that, for a few years, as Mario cove",436,"Great. Thanks, Tom. And Greg, if I go to the first part of your question on price position, the best measure of price competitiveness is our close rate, and our close rates are up. So we've seen good result on the fact that, for a few years, as Mario covered earlier, we've taken expenses out of the system. We've taken those expenses and essentially allowed customers to get better value from us, and that's improving our close rates, which has helped. The second part, when you talked about going forward with frequency and severity, as Tom said, we had a pretty good forecast on frequency, and it's continued to be lower when you go on a 2-year basis. The 1-year comparisons right now are interesting on just about everything. But on a 2-year basis, they're prepandemic, they're -- continue to be meaningfully lower. Some of that will be just the new different world that we're in, with fewer people working in office buildings and traveling in rush hour. 
Some of that will revert back over time. But we've had really good forecast on that. The frequency has been higher -- I'm sorry, the severity has been higher with inflationary factors. And so we're looking at that and where we have to take pricing, we will. And I guess, when you put them together, the key is in how we've been forecasting and when we look at when the line will cross, and what I mean by that is we knew that -- what severity is -- compounds over time. So once you're a couple of years in, which we are now when you're comparing to 2019, you've got a couple of years of severity increases. At some point, it's going to be greater than the benefit that is persisting on frequency, and you cross that line. 
And so we're pretty good at forecasting about the time we're crossing that line. We moved prices slightly down. In some places, we're still good with those down. We still have opportunity to even be more competitive. In other places, we're going to have to take them up. But we don't have wild swings happening in terms of our pricing. We've been pretty careful and cautious to do things that we thought were sustainable, and we're going to continue to do things that we think are sustainable. So as we take expenses out, continuing to do for the remainder of the year, the loss cost management that the claims team is doing and our pricing actions, we think there's more ground we can make up from a competitive position standpoint."

They just happen to be paid, and there was some timing. So when you look at severity, you have to be clear on the difference between what you paid and what you think you're going to pay eventually.

And just to the point about what's transitory and what's in there, I think you have to look at both frequency and severity in that way, like they're -- components of frequency. Like we get really detailed into looking at the miles driven. It isn't just what are the total miles driven out there. It's by state. It's urban versus rural. It's commuting time versus not. It's weekend versus weekday and night/day. So when we look at all of this, we have a view on what we believe is transitory and what is more sustainable on frequency as well as on severity. But the controls that we have from a claims standpoint, we have a really strong claims team. And they use, first of all, proprietary models that we have that escalate claims that either need to be expedited, moved faster or need to be prepared for defense in terms of injury claims, that tell us the likelihood of litigation, the likelihood of representation, things like that. 
We leverage our scale really well in that we have long-term pricing deals on a lot of the parts and labor that are out there for whether it's auto or home. So some of that acts as a hedge towards inflation, and it's not perfect because we're in the same inflationary environment that others are in. But we do, with our buying power, have good long-term deals that we've negotiated that help to hedge that to some degree and then really strong quality processes that we manage across the system. So we feel good about our ability to manage within the environment, but also we have to price for it as it moves. And I guess I'll close by saying if anything our history has been proven, I would say, we do a really good job managing to our returns. And Mario and Tom talked about those in the opening quite a bit. We will manage to produce the right returns. And when we need to take price to do that, we do it."

Paul, I think the first place I would start is the regulatory reaction tends to start with what the consumers think, and consumers are in a pretty good place.

So we can -- the kind of percentages increase that we need are not so large. You're not talking about double-digit price increases that caused everybody to call their insurance regulator and say, ""Hey, I don't like this world."" So we don't see a lot of consumer pushback. 
When you look at the regulators, we have a good relationship with our regulators. I mean we were 10 days in last year, I mean, I think it was like 10 days into March, we were like, ""Oh my gosh. We got to do something about this."" So we went out proactively to regulators and said, ""Hey, we don't have a requirement to do this. We have no contractual requirement to do it, but we know you want us to do it. So we're going to do it in advance, upfront,"" and we led the industry in doing that.

So I think we did build a lot of credibility with that. But I think the core of this is the regulators have actuaries, and we have actuaries, and they are math-based.

So I'll give you a quick number on the last 5 years. 89 combined ratio, that's recorded combined ratio, not underlying. And we've made just over $4 billion in the past 5 years of underwriting profit. So we're good at this. I don't mind being bold enough to say that we -- I think we have a sustained and systemic advantage in homeowners that we've proven over a long period of time, and it goes to the claims capabilities, the cat management capabilities, our reinsurance system that we have, our risk selection, our product capability and pricing. So it's a pretty deep skill that's been honed over a long period of time that we're able to leverage. And so when you look at -- there's no question that inflation is hitting the homeowner side hard, and you got weather events. And you look at what it's doing to the industry more broadly than us, and there's going to be folks taking a lot of rate out there, and I think you've heard that from them. 
And our product is such that, like, year-over-year, we're at 6% up on average premium, even though we took only 3.5 points of rate because built into it, there's some inflationary factor. So we're really well positioned to continue to make money at it, protect a lot of people. And last point is, it goes to what Tom talked about earlier about Transformative Growth. You look at the independent agent system. And we bought National General in -- primarily to really have a ticket into that system where they have great systems, a lot of appointments, great relationships, and they're good at some products. Well, we're really good at home. You get that home product into the IA channel, and I think it's going to sell well. We're going to protect a lot of people. We're going to help IA's growth."

No, I would not -- the short answer would be, I would not say you should just expect a 0 frequency trend relative to 2019. While we don't publish any forecasting on frequency, I think, broadly, people in the industry have talked about the fact that safer cars have tended to have a little bit of a tailwind for frequency. Even take away the pandemic for a moment that, year-over-year, we've had a long-term steady decline in frequency. And so you've got a couple of years of that as you compare to 2019. 
On top of that, we see -- and I alluded to this a little bit before, we see a really material change in the way people are driving. So even when you see the aggregate number of miles driven coming back, still lower, but closer to 2019 levels, who is driving, when they're driving and how they're driving is changing materially. So you see about a 4- or 5-point difference between the net change of urban driving being down more than rural driving. So you look at an Allstate book of business where we sell predominantly through exclusive agents, our exclusive agents are in more populated markets, that tends to favor the way the frequency comes through. 
You look at the type of driving that's done. I mentioned before, commuting is down significantly more than noncommuting. So a quick stat for you, as we look at a lot of these details, weekend driving is actually higher right now than 2019 was. People just want to get out. With day driving, it's materially lower. And so -- and particularly in rush hour. So when you see less congested roads in the time period when the predominance of accidents happen in those morning and afternoon commutes, that is helpful to, particularly in our book of business, the way frequency comes through. So there are elements that will come back. It will come back differently. The only thing I'm confident in saying is that the world will look exactly the same after the pandemic than before, and that will mean that people drive and move differently. But we see some nontransitory or temporary impacts to frequency as well as severity."

So we think that gives us room to adapt and continue to grow and make money and make sure that we can recover costs as they go up. Other competitors are in different places, but we feel good about where we're at.

So when you buy Allstate direct, it's, I think, going on average about 7% lower than if you buy from an agent because it doesn't come with help. Like -- and so that's -- you get what you pay for. And there are people -- there are some demographic shift to that. But some of it's not -- there are some young people who want help and some older people who don't want to help. And so we're there focused not as much on demographics of those channels but -- as the customer value. 
As it relates to our competitive position in each channel, we believe you should have a competitive price position in each channel like-for-like. So if you're buying from GEICO or Progressive and you're buying direct and you're buying from Allstate and you're buying direct, you should -- it should be the same kind of value. Now it gets a little dicier when you figure out what price is because of what the limits are all kinds of -- it gets complicated fast. But the conceptual approach would be, be competitive in channel based on the value you deliver to shareholders -- or to customers.

That's why Transformative Growth, why we want to be in all channels and where customers want to buy. So I think there's some benefit to that. 
But the bigger benefit is 2 other things. One would be being competitively priced. That's why we're going after expenses, why we did the pricing differential that Tom talked about. And then the third one, which, frankly, maybe even the most important, is just your execution, and it's a fact that we have used the capabilities of the Esurance, but we're still newer at being a large national player with the brand we've got at Allstate doing this. It's building the capabilities, whether it's web, sales processes, marketing sophistication, integration of marketing into it so that we are winning our fair share there because you got to get the price to be competitive, but you also have to be great at the process itself."

S",325,"So if you go back to that slide where we show the 3 different channels, direct is up. As we said, it's now 29% of sales. We expect it to continue to go up, as Glenn said, as we get better. There are some shifts to that channel if you just look globally. Some of that's because more people feel comfortable buying over the web and not going through some of that. Some of it is just because direct does a whole bunch of advertising, and it drives people to it. But we're, as Glenn pointed out, in that boat and increasing our capabilities. 
But that doesn't mean we're waving the flag on people-to-people exchange. And so the key part of Transformative Growth is there are people who want help. We just need to give it to them at a lower cost, and that's what we're working on. So people were more than happy to pay a lot of money to -- it sure is not a lot, but to be -- pay for the help to buy the insurance. They just don't want to pay 10% for ongoing service when they can do self-service, if there's not much to be done or you can do it at a lower cost centrally. 
So that's our shift in transformative. We're not waving the flag on person-to-person sales. In fact, we're leaning in and saying we have a great position there. We have a great brand. People know us. We just need to do it more effectively and create higher-growth models. So that will take us some time to transition, as we talked about. Like I don't expect the Allstate agent business to jump up the way you'll see the direct business increase over the next 12 months. But I do think it's got great long-term potential, and we're investing heavily in making sure those agents can deliver what people want if they want help buying products."

It really is about claims capabilities and paying what you owe and being fair to folks, but making sure you don't pay more than owe as things move. So we have inflationary factors, for example, say, on materials for homeowners. Having purchasing power and having really good deals in place over the long term on flooring, on roofing and other products used in home repair helps hedge that inflation. And with our size, with our buying power and with the capabilities of our claims team, we've been able to do that, and it helps hedge it. 
Again, I'm not suggesting it eliminates the problem of inflation, but it does help mitigate it, so that not all of that cost is passed through to your customers because when I do the job to our customers, obviously, we got to put them back to where they were. We've got to charge people an appropriate price and give them the best value possible, and part of that is mitigating the cost of claims. So that was in the purchasing power. The proprietary models I mentioned before is we've just invested a lot in our analytics and data capabilities over the years in order to flag claims that were at risk for accelerating costs, so that we could get it into the right experts' hands at the right time and it allows us to do a better quality job on those and also manage the costs."

Thank you for taking time. Let me just close on a few things. First, on investment results, I totally understand the view that one would not fully count the huge increase in performance-based income. But when I read some of the reports, I'm like, I think it's fair to say it was an outsized quarter, but that doesn't mean that our long-term results should be dark. We're good at investments. We've had good results. Our acquisitions are performing well, whether that be Allstate Protection Plans, which we didn't really get questions on today. I just want to remind you, we bought that company 4 years ago, $1.4 billion. It's now over $1 billion in revenue. It's growing at 27% a year. It made $155 million, which means we paid 9x earnings for a business that has grown 27%. And so we think it's worth a lot more than that. 
National General, we also think we'll be highly successful. We're off to a really good start there. You can see that in the current numbers. And it's not just the 4 million policies we have. By the way, when you look at the net cash we had to lay out after statutory capital, I do not believe we could have acquired 1% market share by putting a couple of billion dollars into advertising. So we think it was also just an economic growth opportunity straight up, forget the strategic potential of further growth. And then share repurchases, we continue to really do well. This is the biggest share repurchase program we've ever announced, both in dollars and percentage of market capitalization, not to be overlooked. 
So thank you for participating today. We had great results this quarter. We look forward to talking next quarter."

Let's start on Slide 2. So this is Allstate's strategy on the left-hand side, which we've talked about before. We have 2 components: increase personal property-liability market share and expand the protection solution. Those are the 2 ovals you see on the left with the intersection between them. The key third quarter results are highlighted on the right-hand panel. Property-Liability policies in force increased by 12.5%. Allstate Protection Plans continue to grow rapidly by both broadening its product offering and expanding the network of retail providers. As a result, we now have almost 192 million policies in force across the enterprise. 
Financially, the results were more mixed. Revenues were up substantially, but net income and adjusted net income declined from the prior year quarter. Underwriting income declined primarily due to higher loss costs in settling auto insurance claims. We've implemented price increases to proactively respond to the sharp rise in loss cost, and Transformative Growth continues to position us for long-term success, both of which we'll talk about in a couple of minutes. This was partially offset by the benefits from our long-term risk and return programs that include significant reinsurance recoverables. They were primarily related to Hurricane Ida, and a substantial increase in performance-based investment income. 
Capital deployment results were excellent, with $1.5 billion of cash returned to shareholders in the quarter. We also completed the divestitures of our 2 largest life and annuity businesses, one in October and then one just earlier this week. 
So let's go to Slide 3. Revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 16.9% compared to the prior year quarter, and that reflects both the higher earned [indiscernible] general acquisition, Allstate brand, homeowners premium growth and higher net investment income. Property-Liability premiums and policies in force increased 13.5% and 12.5%, respectively. 
Net investment income was $764 million, and that's up almost about $300 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting strong results from the performance-based portfolio. Net income was $508 million in the quarter, and that's compared to $1.1 billion in the prior quarter as lower underwriting income was partially offset by the higher investment income. Adjusted net income was $217 million or $0.73 per diluted share, and it's decreased [ $683 ] million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the lower underwriting due to the higher auto and homeowners insurance loss costs. Net income for the first 9 months of 2021 was below the prior year, and that's largely due to the loss on the sale of the life annuity business, which we reported earlier in the year. Adjusted net income was $10.70 per share for the first 9 months, and that was above the prior year as higher investment income and lower expenses more than offset higher loss costs. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. What I would do is put the pandemic in a longitudinal perspective because this created volatility for our results, and it obviously requires us to adapt quickly, which we do. But before we go through the impact on the third quarter results of the supply chain disruption, let's talk about the initial and subsequent impact of the pandemic. So in 2020, the economic lockdown resulted in fewer miles being driven and promoted -- and prompted an aggressive economic support response from, really, governments around the world. The impact on auto insurance was a dramatic drop in the number of accidents. And of course, due to this unprecedented driver in frequency, we proactively provided our customers with some money back, which increased customer retention. 
Since then, since there was less road congestion and fewer accidents that occurred during commuting hours, the average speed and severity of auto claims increased, offsetting some of the frequency benefit. Nevertheless, underwriting margins improved dramatically, so we introduced a temporary Shelter-in-Place payback rather than take a permanent rate reduction and took some modest overall reductions in rate levels. 
This year, as you can see from the right-hand column, the story has been just the opposite as it relates to frequency with large percentage increases. And while the overall level of accident frequency for the Allstate brand is still below prepandemic levels, the national and general nonstandard business is back to the levels before the pandemic. Auto severity this year, however, has been dramatically impacted by the supply chain disruption, and price increases on used cars and original equipment parts, and Mario will take you through that in a couple of slides. 
From a pricing perspective, this results in moving from modest rate reductions to significant increases in auto insurance prices. From a growth standpoint, at the onset of the pandemic, we began to see a material increase in the consumer acceptance telematics, and we've really leaned into that with our Milewise product, which is really the only national product out there to pay for the mile, and that's led to substantial increase in our telematics product. 
Now the pandemic has also had a significant impact on the investment portfolio, and this is the tale of the beginning and the end as well. So early in the crisis, equity valuations were down, and this had a negative impact on investment results. Then, of course, on -- and we have a broad-based long-term spread out over a decade really investing in these kinds of funds. And so we do it on a long-term basis, whether that's 3, 5 or 10 years. But -- so what's happened this year, of course, is we've had the opposite happen, which is with the economic stimulus, we've had equity valuations going up, and our returns have come back strongly. 
In the market-based portfolio, lower interest rates at the onset of this pandemic did lead to an increase in the unrealized gains in the portfolio. But of course, what that does is reduce future interest rate income, which you see slight decline in this quarter. And many of our other businesses have been impacted some positively, some negatively, but it's our ability to adapt and seize the opportunities that are presented that create shareholder value. 
So Mario will now go through the third quarter results in more detail and how Transformative Growth positions Allstate for continued success."

Let's move to Slide 5 to review Property-Liability margin results in the third quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 105.3 increased 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased underlying losses as",1607,"Thanks, Tom. Let's move to Slide 5 to review Property-Liability margin results in the third quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 105.3 increased 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased underlying losses as well as higher catastrophe losses and noncatastrophe prior year reserve reestimates. The chart at the bottom of the slide quantifies the impact of each component in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. 
As you can see, the personal auto underlying loss ratio drove most of the increase due to higher auto accident frequency and the inflationary impacts on auto severity. Higher catastrophe losses shown in the middle of the chart had a negative 1.4 point impact on the combined ratio as favorable reserve reestimates recorded in 2020 from wildfire subrogation settlements positively impacted the prior year quarter. 
Gross catastrophe losses were higher but were reduced by nearly $1 billion of net reinsurance recoveries following Hurricane Ida, demonstrating the benefits of our long-term approach to risk and return management of the homeowners insurance business and our comprehensive reinsurance program. 
Noncatastrophe prior year reserve strengthening of $162 million in the quarter drove an adverse impact of 0.8 points primarily from increases in auto and commercial lines. This also included $111 million of strengthening in the quarter related to asbestos, environmental and other reserves in the runoff Property-Liability segment following our annual comprehensive reserve review. This was partially offset by a lower expense ratio when excluding the impact of amortization of purchased intangibles primarily due to lower restructuring and related charges compared to the prior year quarter. 
Moving to Slide 6. Let's go a bit deeper on auto insurance profitability. Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio finished at 97.5 for the quarter and 89.7 over the first 9 months of 2021. The increase to the prior year quarter reflects higher loss cost due to higher accident frequency, increased severity and competitive pricing enhancements implemented in late 2020 and earlier this year. While claim frequency increased relative to prior year, we continue to experience favorable trends relative to prepandemic levels. Allstate brand auto property damage frequency increased 16.6% compared to 2020 but decreased 16.8% relative to 2019. 
The chart on the lower left compares the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter of 2019 to this quarter to remove some of the short-term pandemic volatility. The underlying combined ratio was 93.1 in 2019, which generates an attractive return on capital. Favorable auto frequency in the third quarter of 2021 lowered the combined ratio by 6.4 points compared to 2019. 
Increased auto claim severity, however, increased the combined ratio by 12 points versus 2 years ago, as you can see from the red bar. The cost reductions implemented as part of Transformative Growth reduced expenses by 1.3 points, which favorably impacted 2021 results. As Tom mentioned, early in the pandemic, the severity increases were driven by higher average losses due to a reduction in low severity claims. This year, the increase reflects the impact of supply chain disruptions in the auto markets, which has increased used car prices and enabled original equipment manufacturers to significantly increase part prices. 
The chart on the lower right shows used car values began increasing above the CPI in late 2020, which accelerated in 2021, resulting in an increase of 44% since the beginning of 2019. Similarly, OEM parts have also increased in 2021, roughly twice as much as core CPI. This has resulted in higher severities for both total loss vehicles and repairable vehicles. 
Since these increases were accelerating throughout the second and third quarters of the year, we increased expected loss costs for the first 2 quarters of 2021, and this prior quarter strengthening shows up in the combined ratio for the third quarter. Increases in report year severities for auto insurance claims during the first 2 quarters of 2021 increased the third quarter combined ratio by 2.6 points, as you can see by the green bar on the lower left. 
So let's flip to Slide 7, which lays out the steps we're taking to improve auto profitability. As you can see from the chart on the top, Allstate has maintained industry-leading auto insurance margins over a long period of time, with a combined ratio operating range in the mid-90s, exhibiting strong execution and operational expertise. 
To maintain industry-leading results, we are increasing rates, improving claims effectiveness and continuing to lower costs. After lowering prices in early 2021 to reflect in part Allstate's lower expense ratio, we have proactively been responding with increases in the third quarter, with actions continuing into the fourth quarter and into 2022. 
The chart on the right provides selected rate increases already implemented in the third and fourth quarter as well as publicly filed rates that have yet to be implemented in the fourth quarter. Those states denoted with the carrot are top 10 states in terms of written premium as of year-end 2020. In the third quarter, we received rate approvals for increases in 12 states, primarily in September. We adapted quickly to higher severities in the fourth quarter, with plans to file rates in an additional 20 states. We have already implemented rate increases in 8 states during the fourth quarter, with an average increase of 6.7% as of November 1. Looking ahead, we expect to pursue price increases in an additional 12 locations by year-end. 
We are working closely with state regulators to provide detailed support and decrease the lag time between filing, implementation and premium generation. As we move into next year, it is likely auto insurance prices will continue to be increased to reflect higher severities. We also continue to leverage advanced claims capabilities and process efficiencies. Cost reductions as part of Transformative Growth will also continue to be implemented. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss our expectations and commitment to further improve our cost structure through Transformative Growth. As you can see by the chart on the bottom of the slide, we've defined a new non-GAAP measure this quarter referred to as the adjusted expense ratio. This starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and investments in advertising. It then also adds in our claim expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims, which tend to be more variable. We believe this measure provides the best insight into the underlying expense trends within our Property-Liability business. 
Through innovation and strong execution, we achieved 2.6 points of improvement when comparing 2020 to 2018, with further improvement occurring through the first 9 months of 2021. Over time, we expect to drive an additional 3 points of improvement from current levels, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024. This represents about a 6-point reduction relative to 2018 or an average of 1 point per year over 6 years, enabling an improved price position relative to our competitors while maintaining attractive returns. 
Future cost reductions center around continued digital enhancements to automate processes, enabling the retirement of legacy technology, operating efficiency gains from combining organization -- combining organizations and transforming the distribution model to higher growth and lower costs. 
Transitioning to Slide 9, let's go up a level to show how Transformative Growth positions us for long-term success and how the components of Transformative Growth work together to create a flywheel of profitable growth. As you know, Transformative Growth is a multiyear initiative to increase personal Property-Liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition and deploying a new technology ecosystem. We've made significant progress to date across each component. 
Starting at the top of the flywheel visual, our commitment to further lower our costs, improves customer value and enables a more competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. Enhancing and expanding distribution puts us in a position to take advantage of more affordable pricing. Increasing the analytical sophistication of new customer acquisitions lets consumers know about this better value proposition. New technology platforms, lower costs and enable us to further broaden the solutions offered to property liability customers. This flywheel will enable us to increase market share and create additional shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 10. Let's look at the changes to the distribution system, which are also underway. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, Property-Liability policies in force grew by 12.5% compared to the prior year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4 million policies, and Allstate brand Property-Liability policies increased by 231,000 driven by growth across personal lines. Allstate brand auto policies in force increased slightly compared to the prior year quarter and sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, including growth of 142,000 policies compared to prior year-end, as you can see by the table on the lower left. 
The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to the prior year. [ 38% ] increase in the direct channel more than offset a slight decline from existing agents and volume that would have normally been generated by newly appointed agents. As you know, we significantly reduced the number of new Allstate agents being appointed beginning in early 2020 since we are developing a new agent model to drive higher growth at lower cost. The addition of National General also added 502,000 new auto applications in the quarter. 
Let me now turn it over to Mark to cover the remainder of the slides before we move to Q&A."
18711,711316754,2424952,"The Allstate Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mario. Moving to Slide 11.

Revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 23.3% to $597 million in the third quarter. Protection Plans and net written premium increased by $139 million due to the launch of the Home Depot relationship focusing on appliances. Our quarterly net written premium is now 5.5x the level of when the company was acquired in 2017. 
Arity expanded revenues due to the integration of LeadCloud and Transparent.ly, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition as well as increased device sales driven by growth in the Milewise products. Policies in force increased 12.5% to 150 million driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Identity Protection. Adjusted net income was $45 million in the third quarter, representing an increase of $5 million compared to the prior year quarter driven by higher profitability at Allstate Identity Protection and Arity. This was partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses related to investments in growth. 
Now let's shift to Slide 12, which highlights our investment performance. Net investment income totaled $764 million in the quarter, which was $300 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income, as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $437 million in the quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting increases in private equity investments. 
As in prior quarters, several large idiosyncratic contributors had a meaningful impact on our results. These results represent a long-term and broad approach to growth investing, with nearly 90% of year-to-date performance-based income coming from assets with inception years of 2018 and prior. 
Market-based income, shown in blue, was $6 million below the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield was somewhat mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. 
Our total portfolio return was 1% in the third quarter and 3.3% year-to-date, reflecting income and changes in equity valuations, partially offset by higher interest rates. We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit risk for appropriate investment horizons. Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return process and play an important role in generating shareholder value. 
While the performance-based investment results continue to be strong in the third quarter, we manage the portfolio with a longer-term view on returns. On the right, we have provided our annualized portfolio return in total and by strategy over various time horizons. 
Consistent with broader public and private equity markets, our portfolio has experienced returns above our historical trend over the last several quarters. While prospective returns will depend on future economic and market conditions, we do expect our performance-based returns to moderate in line with our longer-term results. 
Now let's move to Slide 13, which highlights Allstate's strong capital position. Allstate's balance sheet strength and excellent cash flow generation provides strong cash returns to shareholders while investing in growth. Significant cash returns to shareholders, including $1.5 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends, occurred during the third quarter. Common shares outstanding have been reduced by 5% over the last 12 months. 
Already in the fourth quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of SafeAuto on October 1 for $262 million to leverage National General's integration capabilities and further increased personal lines market share. We also recently closed on the divestitures of Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company in New York. These divestitures free up approximately $1.7 billion of deployable capital, which was factored into the $5 billion share repurchase program currently being executed. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let's finish with a longer-term view of Allstate's focus on execution, innovation and sustainable value creation. Allstate has an excellent track record of serving customers, earning attractive returns on risks and delivering for shareholders, as you can see by the industry-leading statistics on the upper right. 
Innovation is also critical to the execution, and our proactive implementation of Transformative Growth has positioned us well to address the macroeconomic challenges facing our business today and in the future. Sustainable value creation also requires excellent capital management and governance. 
As an example, Allstate is in the top 15% of S&P 500 companies and cash returns to shareholders by providing an attractive dividend and repurchasing 25% and 50% of outstanding shares over the last 5 and 10 years, respectively. Execution, innovation and long-term value creation will continue to drive increased shareholder value. 
With that context, let's open the line for your questions."

I'll start and then Glenn can jump in. First, as you know, we've long been focused on bundling auto and homeowners because those are good, stable, long-term customers.

First, as you know, we've long been focused on bundling auto and homeowners because those are good, stable, long-term customers. You do get a discount for putting those 2 together. So there's an advantage to the customer from buying it and putting it all in one place besides just having one point of contact. And we've been good at that. 
If you look at our growth in homeowners this year, it's higher than our growth in auto insurance, and that appears to be because we are doing more bundling of individual customers. It's a little hard to get the exact attribution, but we feel good about what our agents are doing to drive that. 
As it relates to the growth of it, we've been -- we repositioned this business over multiple years back in the middle -- late 2000 -- the first decade of 2000. We've made, of course, a bunch of money since over the last 8 or 9 years, I think almost $9 billion of underwriting income on homeowners, which you need to do because we don't believe that a 4-point margin is attractive on homeowners for a couple of reasons. One is you don't get much investment income. Secondly, you got to put in more capital because the results are more volatile, and you have the big tail losses. So as we seek to grow it, we bring all of that math to bear on individual states is where we grow. And so if there's a state where -- even if there's a fair amount of catastrophe exposure, but we think we can get a good return that's got a margin on it that compensates us for the capital we have to put up and the reinsurance we have to buy, then we'll do that. And we're highly sophisticated in the way we run it. So the geographic focus is really we have a much a highly sophisticated model and do it. 
On the direct business, you don't sell as much direct homeowners right now. We still need to crack the code on that. Before I -- Glenn will have some view on how we can continue to run the table in homeowners as we have so far, but the -- an upcoming thing that Glenn might want to touch on is what we're doing in the independent agent channel because of -- the National General platform gives us with our products, our expertise, our pricing, our claims management and our reinsurance programs gives us the ability to really serve a lot of customers.

And so we want to grow it, and we want to bundle it, as Tom said. So over the course of the past year, we've deepened bundling discounts. So we've made it more attractive for customers across 30 states. We've shifted our agency competition over the last couple of years to where it's more attractive for them to bundle, and the same is true in direct. As Tom said, we're looking to crack the code and write more there. We're writing some want to write more. And so some of the incentives for our direct team are around cross quoting and bundling. 
To the point around cat footprint, we're in good shape. Like if you look at our ability to write business, we can write it pretty broadly. We can write in some cat-prone areas, but we tend to offset it and create the diversity of our book by writing in other areas. I mean, right now, we're on a 12-month view right now. We're at 93.8 combined ratio, made about $400 million underwriting profit in the last 12 months in spite of having some really big cat quarters. So it's a good business that we're able to consistently make money in. And so we're looking to grow it. But as Tom said, we have pretty stringent guidelines of where we write, how we write so that we don't overgrow in cat-prone areas, but we're able to grow without that. 
And Tom mentioned something that I want to come back to in terms of the breadth of our distribution and growing, and that would be into our IA channel. The IA channel is a huge opportunity. Independent agents were in a lot of homeowners, and our National General and Allstate company as it will be branded is adding our middle market products, both auto and home, and we have sort of a whole new greenfield there to run in, and that would be a broad geographic spread, not just in cat-prone areas."

First, we don't have a catastrophe exposure problem. We don't have a profitability problem, we believe, in homeowners. I mean we only made about -- we lost about [ $16 ] million on $7.3 billion so far this year. So we'd like to make more money. But as Glenn pointed out, when you look over a longer period of time -- we've had a fair amount of ups and downs, but we still made underwriting profit on a sort of 12-month basis. So we don't have a catastrophe problem. So we don't have to restrict stuff and end up with what you're poking at is retention issues. 
We have been there and done that, though. So -- and it was called the repositioning we did in the latter part of the decade I mentioned. And when you call a customer and say, I used to have -- used to be insured with us, and now I'm not going to share you with us -- and we're one of the biggest brokers of homeowners product, I think, in the country, maybe [indiscernible] through our advantage. And even when you say to people, here's another company, it has some impact on your auto business so -- because people are like, well, I'll take my business someplace else or competitors decide they want to bundle and they'll go get those customers as well. So we had some issues with auto growth when we were downsizing. 
We went down by 2 million policies in the homeowners business over a 4- or 5-year period. So it does hurt. It's manageable. I can't speak for what our competitors are going to do. What I do know is what Glenn said, which is we've got a good business. We know how to run it.

So I'm really glad we are where we are, and we're positioned to take share in the future, which is, of course, our strategy, but we want to do that profitably.

So -- thanks, Greg, and you get a couple of important points that you're right about that everyone or close to everyone is going to have to take rate when you talk about competitive position. So we think about that as part of the process.",359,"Yes. Absolutely. So -- thanks, Greg, and you get a couple of important points that you're right about that everyone or close to everyone is going to have to take rate when you talk about competitive position. So we think about that as part of the process. But this is broad and this is going to be around for a while. Like everything you look at in terms of what the root cause is of severity, which is in its simplest terms, is the price of used cars. I'd like to talk about collision coverage as if the coverage that doesn't really have a policy limit that's stated other than the value of the vehicle itself. So in real terms, our policy limit on that coverage went up by 40-plus percent with no change in premium. And that experience happened to everybody across the industry. So it's a rarity where you have something is clear and clean as that, that is a root cause to your severity changes. So we think it'll be around for a bit, and we're going after rate to address that as one of the levers, and we've talked about our claims capabilities and certainly our expense reductions as other ones. 
So in the third quarter, we took 12 price increases that went effective in the third quarter, another 8 in the fourth quarter so far, with more to come. So this is broad, and we'll be doing it just about everywhere. And I think the key from a competitive position is that we made a lot of progress. So our starting point, we made significant progress over the last year with the expenses we've taken out. And therefore, the competitive position we were in improved significantly. Our close rates improved significantly, leading to some of the greater new business that you saw. 
And so as we take rates, and others do, it's our goal is certainly to keep that competitive position gain that we've made, but the primary goal is to get our margins back to where they need to be, and that's why we're going after rate, and we're doing it pretty proactively."

I feel like when we get to 2024, if you've achieved that objective, that will put you clearly among the leaders in terms of lowest adjusted expense ratio in the marketplace. So I'm sure a lot of thought went into this. Can you give us some more color on where the improvement -- where you're going to get the most leverage in terms of the expense ratio improvements, where it's going to come from?

So Greg, thanks for the question and the acknowledgment of the progress we've made. I guess where I'd start is maybe to just kind of go up a level and reiterate again what our objective in reducing costs really is, which is to enhance customer value by improving our competitive price position. And we're going to do that by continuing to drive down the expense component of our combined ratio, which is inclusive of both underwriting and claim expenses. 
And to your point, we've made really good progress over the past several years. And in addition to the progress we've made, we've created plans and have line of sight to the additional 3-point objective that we've got by 2024 by focusing on things like digitizing processes to improve efficiency by continuing, as we do that, create opportunity to retire legacy technology to capture the synergies associated with the National General acquisition to continue to drive down distribution costs as we've talked about creating a -- kind of a more productive but lower cost distribution model. So we've got opportunity in both the -- from an operating cost perspective on both the underwriting and the claims side, and we've got a plan on how to get there. And that's why we established the goal. And we think once we can get the additional 3 points out of our cost structure, it's really going to position us well relative to our competitors to have a more competitive price point, to deliver higher customer value and really position ourselves to accelerate growth."

But boy, I'm sure glad we got started on Transformative Growth than we did because we were able to reposition the brand. We invested over $0.25 billion in repositioning the brand, new advertising, testing out new more sophisticated ways to do it. And we did it when frequency was low. So we were able to use some of that reduction in frequency, the margin it created to invest in long-term growth by repositioning the brand. 
When you look at Transformative Growth, it's very simple, right? You get a more competitive price. You have more places to buy it. You let people know about that's the increase in advertising that I was talking about. What we do in the future will be depending how much we want to grow. So as we move forward, I think our advertising will be flat or come down some because we want to make sure we've got the pricing right in the point that came up earlier about the longevity of the -- how long will severity keep coming up. You want to make sure you've got that pricing right before you go out and get that flywheel going by doing more advertising. 
That said, we're always going to do a lot of advertising because, as you know, it is a marketing war, really, out there between some of the large players. But the other part that's not as well known is it's getting every bit as sophisticated as auto insurance and home pricing. So you've really got to be good with your math on that. And whether it's upper front or lower funnel, getting the right price to the right customer at the right time in the right space is -- it's complicated. 
And so the other thing we've been working on is building out the sophistication so that every dollar of advertising investment we spend is well done. The reason we took it out of the expense ratio guidance was because it is more volatile and it'll depend on what kind of growth we're looking to achieve in that quarter. And this is a measure of really how effectively you running the business. Like how are you keeping your costs down for your customers so you can have that competitive price."

So the effectiveness of our sales, whether it be our call centers or on the web, it's better. Our marketing sophistication, our partnership with marketing, all of those things getting better, and that helps move it up. 
The other thing is, actually, in this price environment that's going to be disrupted, we're likely to see some tailwind in new business but some headwinds in retention because if we were in a situation where we're the only ones taking rate, you might expect the opposite. But with a whole bunch of people having to take rate, that'll create a lot of shoppers. It'll create shoppers of our own, too, because it disrupts our own customers. And when people shop, they often find a better price or situation even in a rising environment like this. So there will be a lot of customers shopping ours and other companies. And so it's an opportunity, as Tom said, to leverage what we did and say we're really happy with the Transformative Growth than we did because we have more ways for customers to buy when that disruptive market happens."

We've got lots of other priorities we're looking at. 
But when you look at inflation, I'm not in the camp that the inflationary that like used car prices are suddenly going to go back down. I think you buy a car for $14,000, it used to cost you $10,000, like you're not thinking it's worth $10,000 no matter what the Fed and everybody else thinks about it being transitory. I think the same thing is true with when you look at parts prices. Parts prices, it's not like the oil market where prices are -- the system is built to go up and down every day. It gets embedded in there. The dealers buy inventory. People, distributors buy inventory. They price it. So we don't really see that being transitory and coming down. 
How long it will take to work all the way through the system, what opportunities the OEs will take to push prices further up is really unknown at this part. So it's hard to determine when it will cross. What you do know is, Elyse, that top line is going to keep going up as long as we see movement in the bottom line, and it'll keep going up until the bottom line plans out that make the bottom line being loss cost. And that top line then we'll keep going past that point in time until we get back to the margins. But when we get back to the same underwriting margin on, let's call it, a dollar basis or a percentage basis on auto insurance, you can't really predict until you can have a better handle on where frequency and severity is going to shake out. 
Glenn, anything you would add to that?"

So we'll have to keep moving those and adjust. But the tactical answer on the rates, you're correct, Elyse, it's 6 months in almost all of our states and all of our policies. So it's about 6 months from the effective date to get all customers paying that and then another 6 months from the point they start paying it to where the full premium has been earned for 1 policy period. So you really start to see the effect of the rates starting at the beginning of the year but more impactfully in the second and third quarters of next year."

So the short answer to your question would be, yes, there will be increases in places where there were modest decreases. I do think we waited a little while to really see what was happening with the frequency and ensure that it was long-standing, and it has remained a long-standing benefit before taking them. And we were modest in it. We've done some pretty significant givebacks in the shelter-in-place givebacks, which were onetime in that sort of durable discount. Actually changing rates and moving them down, we were more subtle with and more modest with. So I don't think people will see sort of a wild swing down and back up, but they will see it in same states. 
And the simple fact is, as you saw on the chart, I believe, is on Page 7, that the used car prices spiked dramatically in the second quarter. And those sites and then people start having claims, and then those claims start to be paid and working their way into the loss cost, and you have this hyperinflationary environment on auto physical damage lines. So it's just the appropriate response at the appropriate time for it, and we'll do everything we can to maintain our retention. It's one of the wonderful things -- one of the many wonderful things about our agency force.

And I don't think that's been reviewed by any analysts as if it was a separate company. I mean we have 600 billion miles of data. We were a risk score in operation. We help people do marketing more effectively and efficiently. And so we're really building quite a platform that will do a number of things. One is it does exactly what you talked about, which is in the way we started, it was telematics as a service for us. We needed somebody to collect the data. We needed to get a mobile app up. We need to put it in files and be able to do something with it. And so rather than do that inside the insurance company, we decided to do it outside the insurance company because we said this is -- at the point we said, this is basically a service that other insurance companies will need, and we can provide it to them. And we do. So Arity provides that service to some other insurance companies, and we're working to try to expand that effort for them. But it moved beyond what I would just call telematics as a service, help me pull data and figure out what my customers are doing, too. 
We started collecting more data from ourselves and built a rating service organization so that we can help other insurance companies use telematics to price your insurance. We believe that they're going to get that capability anyway. So we think that we might as well do it through Arity and capture additional margin rather than just assuming we can take over 100% of the insurance industry by being a leader in telematics, which we are, but we don't think we can get the entire market share. So we created a rating services organization around that. It's then been expanded to include really lead generation because we started collecting more data. So we have data from the Allstate customers. We have data because we have our SDK embedded in other people's [indiscernible]. And we have hard data on -- I think it's over 25 million cars we're pulling every day, really high fidelity data that's in the same format. We also buy data that we're able to combine with that 25 million on an over another 75 million cars. So we're pulling data on 100 million cars per day right now. And so we're building this rating services organization for Allstate and other insurers so that we can not only do telematics as a service, we can do -- we think we can actually work to help people prequalify buyers, and it's called the Arity IQ. So significant value has been created. 
I don't think that shows up in shareholder value today because I don't really see any of the analysts really looking hard and saying, what's it worth, but we think it's a substantial value, and we expect to continue to grow that business and expand its total addressable market."

Let's start on Slide 2. So this is Allstate's strategy on the left-hand side, which we've talked about before. We have 2 components: increase personal property-liability market share and expand the protection solution. Those are the 2 ovals you see on the left with the intersection between them. The key third quarter results are highlighted on the right-hand panel. Property-Liability policies in force increased by 12.5%. Allstate Protection Plans continue to grow rapidly by both broadening its product offering and expanding the network of retail providers. As a result, we now have almost 192 million policies in force across the enterprise. 
Financially, the results were more mixed. Revenues were up substantially, but net income and adjusted net income declined from the prior year quarter. Underwriting income declined primarily due to higher loss costs in settling auto insurance claims. We've implemented price increases to proactively respond to the sharp rise in loss cost, and Transformative Growth continues to position us for long-term success, both of which we'll talk about in a couple of minutes. This was partially offset by the benefits from our long-term risk and return programs that include significant reinsurance recoverables. They were primarily related to Hurricane Ida, and a substantial increase in performance-based investment income. 
Capital deployment results were excellent, with $1.5 billion of cash returned to shareholders in the quarter. We also completed the divestitures of our 2 largest life and annuity businesses, one in October and then one just earlier this week. 
So let's go to Slide 3. Revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 16.9% compared to the prior year quarter, and that reflects both the higher earned [indiscernible] National General acquisition, Allstate brand, homeowners premium growth and higher net investment income. Property-Liability premiums and policies in force increased 13.5% and 12.5%, respectively. 
Net investment income was $764 million, and that's up almost about $300 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting strong results from the performance-based portfolio. Net income was $508 million in the quarter, and that's compared to $1 billion in the prior quarter as lower underwriting income was partially offset by the higher investment income. Adjusted net income was $217 million or $0.73 per diluted share, and it's decreased [ $683 ] million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the lower underwriting due to the higher auto and homeowners insurance loss costs. Net income for the first 9 months of 2021 was below the prior year, and that's largely due to the loss on the sale of the life annuity business, which we reported earlier in the year. Adjusted net income was $10.70 per share for the first 9 months, and that was above the prior year as higher investment income and lower expenses [audio gap] more than offset higher loss costs. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. What I would do is put the pandemic in a longitudinal perspective because this created volatility for our results, and it obviously requires us to adapt quickly, which we do. But before we go through the impact on the third quarter results of the supply chain disruption, let's talk about the initial and subsequent impact of the pandemic. So in 2020, the economic lockdown resulted in fewer miles being driven and promoted -- and prompted an aggressive economic support response from, really, governments around the world. The impact on auto insurance was a dramatic drop in the number of accidents. And of course, due to this unprecedented driver in frequency, we proactively provided our customers with some money back, which increased customer retention. 
Since then, since there was less road congestion and fewer accidents that occurred during commuting hours, the average speed and severity of auto claims increased, offsetting some of the frequency benefit. Nevertheless, underwriting margins improved dramatically, so we introduced a temporary Shelter-in-Place payback rather than take a permanent rate reduction and took some modest overall reductions in rate levels. 
This year, as you can see from the right-hand column, the story has been just the opposite as it relates to frequency with large percentage increases. And while the overall level of accident frequency for the Allstate brand is still below prepandemic levels, the national and general nonstandard business is back to the levels before the pandemic. Auto severity this year, however, has been dramatically impacted by the supply chain disruption, and price increases on used cars and original equipment parts, and Mario will take you through that in a couple of slides. 
From a pricing perspective, this results in moving from modest rate reductions to significant increases in auto insurance prices. From a growth standpoint, at the onset of the pandemic, we began to see a material increase in the consumer acceptance telematics, and we've really leaned into that with our Milewise product, which is really the only national product out there to pay for the mile, and that's led to substantial increase in our telematics product. 
Now the pandemic has also had a significant impact on the investment portfolio, and this is the tale of the beginning and the end as well. So early in the crisis, equity valuations were down, and this had a negative impact on investment results. Then, of course, on -- and we have a broad-based long-term spread out over a decade really investing in these kinds of funds. And so we do it on a long-term basis, whether that's 3, 5 or 10 years. But -- so what's happened this year, of course, is we've had the opposite happen, which is with the economic stimulus, we've had equity valuations going up, and our returns have come back strongly. 
In the market-based portfolio, lower interest rates at the onset of this pandemic did lead to an increase in the unrealized gains in the portfolio. But of course, what that does is reduce future interest rate income, which you see slight decline in this quarter. And many of our other businesses have been impacted some positively, some negatively, but it's our ability to adapt and seize the opportunities that are presented that create shareholder value. 
So Mario will now go through the third quarter results in more detail and how Transformative Growth positions of Allstate for continued success."

Let's move to Slide 5 to review Property-Liability margin results in the third quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 105.3 increased 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased underlying losses as",1610,"Thanks, Tom. Let's move to Slide 5 to review Property-Liability margin results in the third quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 105.3 increased 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased underlying losses as well as higher catastrophe losses and non catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates. The chart at the bottom of the slide quantifies the impact of each component in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. 
As you can see, the personal auto underlying loss ratio drove most of the increase due to higher auto accident frequency and the inflationary impacts on auto severity. Higher catastrophe losses shown in the middle of the chart had a negative 1.4 point impact on the combined ratio as favorable reserve reestimates recorded in 2020 from wildfire subrogation settlements positively impacted the prior year quarter. 
Gross catastrophe losses were higher but were reduced by nearly $1 billion of net reinsurance recoveries following Hurricane Ida, demonstrating the benefits of our long-term approach to risk and return management of the homeowners insurance business and our comprehensive reinsurance program. 
Noncatastrophe prior year reserve strengthening of $162 million in the quarter drove an adverse impact of 0.8 points primarily from increases in auto and commercial lines. This also included $111 million of strengthening in the quarter related to asbestos, environmental and other reserves in the runoff Property-Liability segment following our annual comprehensive reserve review. This was partially offset by a lower expense ratio when excluding the impact of amortization of purchased intangibles primarily due to lower restructuring and related charges compared to the prior year quarter. 
Moving to Slide 6. Let's go a bit deeper on auto insurance profitability. Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio finished at 97.5 for the quarter and 89.7 over the first 9 months of 2021. The increase to the prior year quarter reflects higher loss cost due to higher accident frequency, increased severity and competitive pricing enhancements implemented in late 2020 and earlier this year. While claim frequency increased relative to prior year, we continue to experience favorable trends relative to prepandemic levels. Allstate brand auto property damage frequency increased 16.6% compared to 2020 but decreased 16.8% relative to 2019. 
The chart on the lower left compares the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter of 2019 to this quarter to remove some of the short-term pandemic volatility. The underlying combined ratio was 93.1 in 2019, which generates an attractive return on capital. Favorable auto frequency in the third quarter of 2021 lowered the combined ratio by 6.4 points compared to 2019. 
Increased auto claim severity, however, increased the combined ratio by 12 points versus 2 years ago, as you can see from the red bar. The cost reductions implemented as part of Transformative Growth reduced expenses by 1.3 points, which favorably impacted 2021 results. As Tom mentioned, early in the pandemic, the severity increases were driven by higher average losses due to a reduction in low severity claims. This year, the increase reflects the impact of supply chain disruptions in the auto markets, which has increased used car prices and enabled original equipment manufacturers to significantly increase part prices. 
The chart on the lower right shows used car values began increasing above the CPI in late 2020, which accelerated in 2021, resulting in an increase of 44% since the beginning of 2019. Similarly, OEM parts have also increased in 2021, roughly twice as much as core CPI. This has resulted in higher severities for both total loss vehicles and repairable vehicles. 
Since these increases were accelerating throughout the second and third quarters of the year, we increased expected loss costs for the first 2 quarters of 2021, and this prior quarter strengthening shows up in the combined ratio for the third quarter. Increases in report year severities for auto insurance claims during the first 2 quarters of 2021 increased the third quarter combined ratio by 2.6 points, as you can see by the green bar on the lower left. 
So let's flip to Slide 7, which lays out the steps we're taking to improve auto profitability. As you can see from the chart on the top, Allstate has maintained industry-leading auto insurance margins over a long period of time, with a combined ratio operating range in the mid-90s, exhibiting strong execution and operational expertise. 
To maintain industry-leading results, we are increasing rates, improving claims effectiveness and continuing the lower costs. After lowering prices in early 2021 to reflect in part Allstate's lower expense ratio, we have proactively been responding with increases in the third quarter, with actions continuing into the fourth quarter and into 2022. 
The chart on the right provides selected rate increases already implemented in the third and fourth quarter as well as publicly filed rates that have yet to be implemented in the fourth quarter. Those states denoted with the caret are top 10 states in terms of written premium as of year-end 2020. In the third quarter, we've received rate approvals for increases in 12 states, primarily in September. We adapted quickly to higher severities in the fourth quarter, with plans to file rates in an additional 20 states. We have already implemented rate increases in 8 states during the fourth quarter, with an average increase of 6.7% as of November 1. Looking ahead, we expect to pursue price increases in an additional 12 locations by year-end. 
We are working closely with state regulators to provide detailed support and decrease the lag time between filing, implementation and premium generation. As we move into next year, it is likely auto insurance prices will continue to be increased to reflect higher severities. We also continue to leverage advanced claims capabilities and process efficiencies. Cost reductions as part of Transformative Growth will also continue to be implemented. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss our expectations and commitment to further improve our cost structure through Transformative Growth. As you can see by the chart on the bottom of the slide, we've defined a new non-GAAP measure this quarter referred to as the adjusted expense ratio. This starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and investments in advertising. It then also adds in our claim expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims, which tend to be more variable. We believe this measure provides the best insight into the underlying expense trends within our Property-Liability business. 
Through innovation and strong execution, we achieved 2.6 points of improvement when comparing 2020 to 2018, with further improvement occurring through the first 9 months of 2021. Over time, we expect to drive an additional 3 points of improvement from current levels, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024. This represents about a 6-point reduction relative to 2018 or an average of 1 point per year over 6 years, enabling an improved price position relative to our competitors while maintaining attractive returns. 
Future cost reductions center around continued digital enhancements to automate processes, enabling the retirement of legacy technology, operating efficiency gains from combining organization -- combining organizations and transforming the distribution model to higher growth and lower costs. 
Transitioning to Slide 9, let's go up a level to show how Transformative Growth positions us for long-term success and how the components of Transformative Growth work together to create a flywheel of profitable growth. As you know, Transformative Growth is a multiyear initiative to increase personal Property-Liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition and deploying a new technology ecosystem. We've made significant progress to date across each component. 
Starting at the top of the flywheel visual, our commitment to further lower our costs, improves customer value and enables a more competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. Enhancing and expanding distribution puts us in a position to take advantage of more affordable pricing. Increasing the analytical sophistication of new customer acquisitions lets consumers know about this better value proposition. New technology platforms, lower costs and enable us to further broaden the solutions offered to property liability customers. This flywheel will enable us to increase market share and create additional shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 10. Let's look at the changes to the distribution system, which are also underway. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, Property-Liability policies in force grew by 12.5% compared to the prior year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4 million policies, and Allstate brand Property-Liability policies increased by 231,000 driven by growth across personal lines. Allstate brand auto policies in force increased slightly compared to the prior year quarter and sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, including growth of 142,000 policies compared to prior year-end, as you can see by the table on the lower left. 
The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to the prior year. [Audio gap] [ 38% ] increase in the direct channel more than offset a slight decline from existing agents and volume that would have normally been generated by newly appointed agents. As you know, we've significantly reduced the number of new Allstate agents being appointed beginning in early 2020 since we are developing a new agent model to drive higher growth at lower cost. The addition of National General also added 502,000 new auto applications in the quarter. 
Let me now turn it over to Mark to cover the remainder of the slides before we move to Q&A."

Revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 23.3% to $597 million in the third quarter. Protection Plans and net written premium increased by $139 million due to the launch of the Home Depot relationship focusing on appliances. Our quarterly net written premium is now 5.5x the level of when the company was acquired in 2017. 
Arity expanded revenues due to the integration of LeadCloud and Transparent.ly, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition as well as increased device sales driven by growth in the Milewise products. Policies in force increased 12.5% to 150 million driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Identity Protection. Adjusted net income was $45 million in the third quarter, representing an increase of $5 million compared to the prior year quarter driven by higher profitability at Allstate Identity Protection and Arity. This was partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses related to investments in growth. 
Now let's shift to Slide 12, which highlights our investment performance. Net investment income totaled $764 million in the quarter, which was $300 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income, as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $437 million in the quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting increases in private equity investments. 
As in prior quarters, several large idiosyncratic contributors had a meaningful impact on our results. These results represent a long-term and broad approach to growth investing, with nearly 90% of year-to-date performance-based income coming from assets with inception years of 2018 and prior. 
Market-based income, shown in blue, was $6 million below the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield was somewhat mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. 
Our total portfolio return was 1% in the third quarter and 3.3% year-to-date, reflecting income and changes in equity valuations, partially offset by higher interest rates. We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit risk for appropriate investment horizons. Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return process and play an important role in generating shareholder value. 
While the performance-based investment results continue to be strong in the third quarter, we manage the portfolio with a longer-term view on returns. On the right, we have provided our annualized portfolio return in total and by strategy over various time horizons. 
Consistent with broader public and private equity markets, our portfolio has experienced returns above our historical trend over the last several quarters. While prospective returns will depend on future economic and market conditions, we do expect our performance-based returns to moderate in line with our longer-term results. 
Now let's move to Slide 13, which highlights Allstate's strong capital position. Allstate's balance sheet strength and excellent cash flow generation provides strong cash returns to shareholders while investing in growth. Significant cash returns to shareholders, including $1.5 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends, occurred during the third quarter. Common shares outstanding have been reduced by 5% over the last 12 months. 
Already in the fourth quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of SafeAuto on October 1 for $262 million to leverage National General's integration capabilities and further increased personal lines market share. We also recently closed on the divestitures of Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company in New York. These divestitures free up approximately $1.7 billion of deployable capital, which was factored into the $5 billion share repurchase program currently being executed. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let's finish with a longer-term view of Allstate's focus on execution, innovation and sustainable value creation. Allstate has an excellent track record of serving customers, earning attractive returns on risks and delivering for shareholders, as you can see by the industry-leading statistics on the upper right. 
f
Innovation is also critical to the execution, and our proactive implementation of Transformative Growth has positioned us well to address the macroeconomic challenges facing our business today and in the future. Sustainable value creation also requires excellent capital management and governance. 
As an example, Allstate is in the top 15% of S&P 500 companies and cash returns to shareholders by providing an attractive dividend and repurchasing 25% and 50% of outstanding shares over the last 5 and 10 years, respectively. Execution, innovation and long-term value creation will continue to drive increased shareholder value. 
With that context, let's open the line for your questions."

I'll start and then Glenn can jump in. First, as you know, we've long been focused on bundling auto and homeowners because those are good, stable, long-term customers. You do get a discount for putting those 2 together. So there's an ad",446,"Josh, this is Tom. I'll start and then Glenn can jump in. First, as you know, we've long been focused on bundling auto and homeowners because those are good, stable, long-term customers. You do get a discount for putting those 2 together. So there's an advantage to the customer from buying it and putting it all in one place besides just having one point of contact. And we've been good at that. 
If you look at our growth in homeowners this year, it's higher than our growth in auto insurance, and that appears to be because we are doing more bundling of individual customers. It's a little hard to get the exact attribution, but we feel good about what our agents are doing to drive that. 
As it relates to the growth of it, we've been -- we repositioned this business over multiple years back in the middle -- late 2000 -- the first decade of 2000. We've made, of course, a bunch of money since over the last 8 or 9 years, I think almost $9 billion of underwriting income on homeowners, which you need to do because we don't believe that a 4-point margin is attractive on homeowners for a couple of reasons. One is you don't get much investment income. Secondly, you got to put in more capital because the results are more volatile, and you have the big tail losses. So as we seek to grow it, we bring all of that math to bear on individual states is where we grow. And so if there's a state where -- even if there's a fair amount of catastrophe exposure, but we think we can get a good return that's got a margin on it that compensates us for the capital we have to put up and the reinsurance we have to buy, then we'll do that. And we're highly sophisticated in the way we run it. So the geographic focus is really we have a much a highly sophisticated model and do it. 
On the direct business, you don't sell as much direct homeowners right now. We still need to crack the code on that. Before I -- Glenn will have some view on how we can continue to run the table in homeowners as we have so far, but the -- an upcoming thing that Glenn might want to touch on is what we're doing in the independent agent channel because of -- the National General platform gives us with our products, our expertise, our pricing, our claims management and our reinsurance programs gives us the ability to really serve a lot of customers. 
Glenn, where would you go with that?"

And so we want to grow it, and we want to bundle it, as Tom said. So over the course of the past year, we've deepened bundling discounts. So we've made it more attractive for customers across 30 states. We've shifted our agency competition over the last couple of years to where it's more attractive for them to bundle, and the same is true in direct. As Tom said, we're looking to crack the code and write more there. We're writing some want to write more. And so some of the incentives for our direct team are around cross quoting and bundling. 
To the point around cat footprint, we're in good shape. Like if you look at our ability to write business, we can write it pretty broadly. We can write in some cat-prone areas, but we tend to offset it and create the diversity of our book by writing in other areas. I mean, right now, we're on a 12-month view right now. We're at 93.8 combined ratio, made about $400 million underwriting profit in the last 12 months in spite of having some really big cat quarters. So it's a good business that we're able to consistently make money in. And so we're looking to grow it. But as Tom said, we have pretty stringent guidelines of where we write, how we write so that we don't overgrow in cat-prone areas, but we're able to grow without that. 
And Tom mentioned something that I want to come back to in terms of the breadth of our distribution and growing, and that would be into our IA channel. The IA channel is a huge opportunity. Independent agents were in a lot of homeowners, and our National General and Allstate company as it will be branded is adding our middle market products, both auto and home, and we have sort of a whole new greenfield there to run in, and that would be a broad geographic spread, not just in cat-prone areas."

But as Glenn pointed out, when you look over a longer period of time -- we've had a fair amount of ups and downs, but we still made underwriting profit on a sort of 12-month basis. So we don't have a catastrophe problem. So we don't have to restrict stuff and end up with what you're poking at is retention issues. 
We have been there and done that, though. So -- and it was called the repositioning we did in the latter part of the decade I mentioned. And when you call a customer and say, I used to have -- used to be insured with us, and now I'm not going to share you with us -- and we're one of the biggest brokers of homeowners insurance product, I think, in the country, maybe [indiscernible] through our advantage. And even when you say to people, here's another company, it has some impact on your auto business so -- because people are like, well, I'll take my business someplace else or competitors decide they want to bundle and they'll go get those customers as well. So we had some issues with auto growth when we were downsizing. 
We went down by 2 million policies in the homeowners business over a 4-5-year period. So it does hurt. It's manageable. I can't speak for what our competitors are going to do. What I do know is what Glenn said, which is we've got a good business. We know how to run it. We have growth opportunities, and we're looking forward to serving more customers and make more money for our shareholders along the way."

So I think you're right, Greg, that there seems to be this -- a threat going through the markets today that this is kind of a once and done. And we don't necessarily see it that way. I mean I think there's -- I'm never bold enough to decide in claims we're ahead of anybody else because, first, that assumes everybody is in the same place. Exactly I assume the same trends are going to happen them. And third is that those trends are going to end. And the answer is we don't know when they will do. What we do know is what we can do differently. And we do know that some of our competitors had frequency increases sooner than we did so that you would expect them to raise prices sooner than we did. 
We do think that we have a good plan in place, and Glenn can take you through that, which is to make sure we get attractive returns in auto insurance, which is a key component of what we do in terms of delivering value for shareholders, and we're all over that, and we will go -- we're -- how that will move forward in terms of competitive position, that's also hard to tell. What I do know is that I'm really glad we started Transformative Growth 2 years ago. And so the cost reductions we already have in place certainly have benefited us. It's positioned us to be able to grow through many different venues, so we can dial a growth up if we choose to do that. So I'm really glad we are where we are, and we're positioned to take share in the future, which is, of course, our strategy, but we want to do that profitably.

So -- thanks, Greg, and you get a couple of important points that you're right about that everyone or close to everyone is going to have to take rate when you talk about competitive position.

So -- thanks, Greg, and you get a couple of important points that you're right about that everyone or close to everyone is going to have to take rate when you talk about competitive position. So we think about that as part of the process. But this is broad and this is going to be around for a while. Like everything you look at in terms of what the root cause is of severity, which is in its simplest terms, is the price of used cars. I'd like to talk about collision coverage as if the coverage that doesn't really have a policy limit that's stated other than the value of the vehicle itself. So in real terms, our policy limit on that coverage went up by 40-plus percent with no change in premium. And that experience happened to everybody across the industry. So it's a rarity where you have something is clear and clean as that, that is a root cause to your severity changes. So we think it'll be around for a bit, and we're going after rate to address that as one of the levers, and we've talked about our claims capabilities and certainly our expense reductions as other ones. 
So in the third quarter, we took 12 price increases that went effective in the third quarter, another 8 in the fourth quarter so far, with more to come. So this is broad, and we'll be doing it just about everywhere. And I think the key from a competitive position is that we made a lot of progress. So our starting point, we made significant progress over the last year with the expenses we've taken out. And therefore, the competitive position we were in improved significantly. Our close rates improved significantly, leading to some of the greater new business that you saw. 
And so as we take rates, and others do, it's our goal is certainly to keep that competitive position gain that we've made, but the primary goal is to get our margins back to where they need to be, and that's why we're going after rate, and we're doing it pretty proactively."

So Greg, thanks for the question and the acknowledgment of the progress we've made. I guess where I'd start is maybe to just kind of go up a level and reiterate again what our objective in reducing costs really is, which is to enhance customer value by improving our competitive price position. And we're going to do that by continuing to drive down the expense component of our combined ratio, which is inclusive of both underwriting and claim expenses. 
And to your point, we've made really good progress over the past several years. And in addition to the progress we've made, we've created plans and have line of sight to the additional 3-point objective that we've got by 2024 by focusing on things like digitizing processes to improve efficiency by continuing, as we do that, create opportunity to retire legacy technology to capture the synergies associated with the National General acquisition to continue to drive down distribution costs as we've talked about creating a -- kind of a more productive but lower cost distribution model. So we've got opportunity in both the -- from an operating cost perspective on both the underwriting and the claims side, and we've got a plan on how to get there. And that's why we established the goal. And we think once we can get the additional 3 points out of our cost structure, it's really going to position us well relative to our competitors to have a more competitive price point, to deliver higher customer value and really position ourselves to accelerate growth."

But boy, I'm sure glad we got started on Transformative Growth than we did because we were able to reposition the brand. We invested over $0.25 billion in repositioning the brand, new advertising, testing out new more sophisticated ways to do it. And we did it when frequency was low. So we were able to use some of that reduction in frequency, the margin it created to invest in long-term growth by repositioning the brand. 
When you look at Transformative Growth, it's very simple, right? You get a more competitive price. You have more places to buy it. You let people know about that's the increase in advertising that I was talking about. What we do in the future will be depending how much we want to grow. So as we move forward, I think our advertising will be flat or come down some because we want to make sure we've got the pricing right in the point that came up earlier about the longevity of the -- how long will severity keep coming up. You want to make sure you've got that pricing right before you go out and get that flywheel going by doing more advertising. 
That said, we're always going to do a lot of advertising because, as you know, it is a marketing war, really, out there between some of the large players. But the other part that's not as well known is it's getting every bit as sophisticated as auto insurance and home pricing. So you've really got to be good with your math on that. And whether it's upper front or lower front, or getting the right price to the right customer at the right time in the right space is -- it's complicated. 
And so the other thing we've been working on is building out the sophistication so that every dollar of advertising investment we spend is well done. The reason we took it out of the expense ratio guidance was because it is more volatile and it'll depend on what kind of growth we're looking to achieve in that quarter. And this is a measure of really how effectively you running the business. Like how are you keeping your costs down for your customers so you can have that competitive price."

So the effectiveness of our sales, whether it be our call centers or on the web, it's better. Our marketing sophistication, our partnership with marketing, all of those things getting better, and that helps move it up. 
The other thing is, actually, in this price environment that's going to be disrupted, we're likely to see some tailwind in new business but some headwinds in retention because if we were in a situation where we're the only ones taking rate, you might expect the opposite. But with a whole bunch of people having to take rate, that will create a lot of shoppers. It'll create shoppers of our own, too, because it disrupts our own customers. And when people shop, they often find a better price or situation even in a rising environment like this. So there will be a lot of customers shopping ours and other companies. And so it's an opportunity, as Tom said, to leverage what we did and say we're really happy with the Transformative Growth than we did because we have more ways for customers to buy when that disruptive market happens."

We've got lots of other priorities we're looking at. 
But when you look at inflation, I'm not in the camp that the inflationary that like used car prices are suddenly going to go back down. I think you buy a car for $14,000, it used to cost you $10,000, like you're not thinking it's worth $10,000 no matter what the Fed and everybody else thinks about it being transitory. I think the same thing is true with when you look at parts prices. Parts prices, it's not like the oil market where prices are -- the system is built to go up and down every day. It gets embedded in there. The dealers buy inventory. People, distributors buy inventory. They price it. So we don't really see that being transitory and coming down. 
How long it will take to work all the way through the system, what opportunities the OEs will take to push prices further up is really unknown at this part. So it's hard to determine when it will cross. What you do know is, Elyse, that top line is going to keep going up as long as we see movement in the bottom line, and it'll keep going up until the bottom line plans out that make the bottom line being loss cost. And that top line then we'll keep going past that point in time until we get back to the margins. But when we get back to the same underwriting margin on, let's call it, a dollar basis or a percentage basis on auto insurance, you can't really predict until you can have a better handle on where frequency and severity is going to shake out. 
Glenn, anything you would add to that?"

So we'll have to keep moving those and adjust. But the tactical answer on the rates, you're correct, Elyse, it's 6 months in almost all of our states and all of our policies. So it's about 6 months from the effective date to get all customers paying that and then another 6 months from the point they start paying it to where the full premium has been earned for 1 policy period.

I do think we waited a little while to really see what was happening with the frequency and ensure that it was long-standing, and it has remained a long-standing benefit before taking them. And we were modest in it. We've done some pretty significant givebacks in the shelter-in-place givebacks, which were onetime in that sort of durable discount. Actually changing rates and moving them down, we were more subtle with and more modest with. So I don't think people will see sort of a wild swing down and back up, but they will see it in same states. 
And the simple fact is, as you saw on the chart, I believe, is on Page 7, that the used car prices spiked dramatically in the second quarter. And those sites and then people start having claims, and then those claims start to be paid and working their way into the loss cost, and you have this hyperinflationary environment on auto physical damage lines. So it's just the appropriate response at the appropriate time for it, and we'll do everything we can to maintain our retention.

And I don't think that's been reviewed by any analysts as if it was a separate company. I mean we have 600 billion miles of data. We were a risk score in operation. We help people do marketing more effectively and efficiently. And so we're really building quite a platform that will do a number of things. One is it does exactly what you talked about, which is in the way we started, it was telematics as a service for us. We needed somebody to collect the data. We needed to get a mobile app up. We need to put it in files and be able to do something with it. And so rather than do that inside the insurance company, we decided to do it outside the insurance company because we said this is -- at the point we said, this is basically a service that other insurance companies will need, and we can provide it to them. And we do. So Arity provides that service to some other insurance companies, and we're working to try to expand that effort for them. But it moved beyond what I would just call telematics as a service, help me pull data and figure out what my customers are doing, too. 
We started collecting more data from ourselves and built a rating service organization so that we can help other insurance companies use telematics to price your insurance. We believe that they're going to get that capability anyway. So we think that we might as well do it through Arity and capture additional margin rather than just assuming we can take over 100% of the insurance industry by being a leader in telematics, which we are, but we don't think we can get the entire market share. So we created a rating services organization around that. It's then been expanded to include really lead generation because we started collecting more data. So we have data from the Allstate customers. We have data because we have our SDK embedded in other people's [indiscernible]. And we have hard data on -- I think it's over 25 million cars we're pulling every day, really high fidelity data that's in the same format. We also buy data that we're able to combine with that 25 million on an over another 75 million cars. So we're pulling data on 100 million cars per day right now. And so we're building this rating services organization for Allstate and other insurers so that we can not only do telematics as a service, we can do -- we think we can actually work to help people prequalify buyers, and it's called the Arity IQ. So significant value has been created.

And we don't want to give that up, and we'd like to continue to improve it so we get that flywheel of growth going.

Let's start on Slide 2. So this is Allstate's strategy on the left-hand side, which we've talked about before. We have 2 components: increase personal property-liability market share and expand the protection solution. Those are the 2 ovals you see on the left with the intersection between them. The key third quarter results are highlighted on the right-hand panel. Property-Liability policies in force increased by 12.5%. Allstate Protection Plans continue to grow rapidly by both broadening its product offering and expanding the network of retail providers. As a result, we now have almost 192 million policies in force across the enterprise. 
Financially, the results were more mixed. Revenues were up substantially, but net income and adjusted net income declined from the prior year quarter. Underwriting income declined primarily due to higher loss costs in settling auto insurance claims. We've implemented price increases to proactively respond to the sharp rise in loss cost, and Transformative Growth continues to position us for long-term success, both of which we'll talk about in a couple of minutes. This was partially offset by the benefits from our long-term risk and return programs that include significant reinsurance recoverables. They were primarily related to Hurricane Ida, and a substantial increase in performance-based investment income. 
Capital deployment results were excellent, with $1.5 billion of cash returned to shareholders in the quarter. We also completed the divestitures of our 2 largest life and annuity businesses, one in October and then one just earlier this week. 
So let's go to Slide 3. Revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 16.9% compared to the prior year quarter, and that reflects both the higher earned [indiscernible] National General acquisition, Allstate brand, homeowners premium growth and higher net investment income. Property-Liability premiums and policies in force increased 13.5% and 12.5%, respectively. 
Net investment income was $764 million, and that's up almost about $300 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting strong results from the performance-based portfolio. Net income was $508 million in the quarter, and that's compared to $1 billion in the prior quarter as lower underwriting income was partially offset by the higher investment income. Adjusted net income was $217 million or $0.73 per diluted share, and it's decreased [ $683 ] million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the lower underwriting due to the higher auto and homeowners insurance loss costs. Net income for the first 9 months of 2021 was below the prior year, and that's largely due to the loss on the sale of the life annuity business, which we reported earlier in the year. Adjusted net income was $10.70 per share for the first 9 months, and that was above the prior year as higher investment income and lower expenses [audio gap] more than offset higher loss costs. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. What I would do is put the pandemic in a longitudinal perspective because this created volatility for our results, and it obviously requires us to adapt quickly, which we do. But before we go through the impact on the third quarter results of the supply chain disruption, let's talk about the initial and subsequent impact of the pandemic. So in 2020, the economic lockdown resulted in fewer miles being driven and promoted -- and prompted an aggressive economic support response from, really, governments around the world. The impact on auto insurance was a dramatic drop in the number of accidents. And of course, due to this unprecedented driver in frequency, we proactively provided our customers with some money back, which increased customer retention. 
Since then, since there was less road congestion and fewer accidents that occurred during commuting hours, the average speed and severity of auto claims increased, offsetting some of the frequency benefit. Nevertheless, underwriting margins improved dramatically, so we introduced a temporary Shelter-in-Place payback rather than take a permanent rate reduction and took some modest overall reductions in rate levels. 
This year, as you can see from the right-hand column, the story has been just the opposite as it relates to frequency with large percentage increases. And while the overall level of accident frequency for the Allstate brand is still below prepandemic levels, the national and general nonstandard business is back to the levels before the pandemic. Auto severity this year, however, has been dramatically impacted by the supply chain disruption, and price increases on used cars and original equipment parts, and Mario will take you through that in a couple of slides. 
From a pricing perspective, this results in moving from modest rate reductions to significant increases in auto insurance prices. From a growth standpoint, at the onset of the pandemic, we began to see a material increase in the consumer acceptance telematics, and we've really leaned into that with our Milewise product, which is really the only national product out there to pay for the mile, and that's led to substantial increase in our telematics product. 
Now the pandemic has also had a significant impact on the investment portfolio, and this is the tale of the beginning and the end as well. So early in the crisis, equity valuations were down, and this had a negative impact on investment results. Then, of course, on -- and we have a broad-based long-term spread out over a decade really investing in these kinds of funds. And so we do it on a long-term basis, whether that's 3, 5 or 10 years. But -- so what's happened this year, of course, is we've had the opposite happen, which is with the economic stimulus, we've had equity valuations going up, and our returns have come back strongly. 
In the market-based portfolio, lower interest rates at the onset of this pandemic did lead to an increase in the unrealized gains in the portfolio. But of course, what that does is reduce future interest rate income, which you see slight decline in this quarter. And many of our other businesses have been impacted some positively, some negatively, but it's our ability to adapt and seize the opportunities that are presented that create shareholder value. 
So Mario will now go through the third quarter results in more detail and how Transformative Growth positions of Allstate for continued success."
18711,711316754,2425695,"The Allstate Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The Allstate Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Let's move to Slide 5 to review Property-Liability margin results in the third quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 105.3 increased 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased underlying losses as",1610,"Thanks, Tom. Let's move to Slide 5 to review Property-Liability margin results in the third quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 105.3 increased 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased underlying losses as well as higher catastrophe losses and non catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates. The chart at the bottom of the slide quantifies the impact of each component in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. 
As you can see, the personal auto underlying loss ratio drove most of the increase due to higher auto accident frequency and the inflationary impacts on auto severity. Higher catastrophe losses shown in the middle of the chart had a negative 1.4 point impact on the combined ratio as favorable reserve reestimates recorded in 2020 from wildfire subrogation settlements positively impacted the prior year quarter. 
Gross catastrophe losses were higher but were reduced by nearly $1 billion of net reinsurance recoveries following Hurricane Ida, demonstrating the benefits of our long-term approach to risk and return management of the homeowners insurance business and our comprehensive reinsurance program. 
Noncatastrophe prior year reserve strengthening of $162 million in the quarter drove an adverse impact of 0.8 points primarily from increases in auto and commercial lines. This also included $111 million of strengthening in the quarter related to asbestos, environmental and other reserves in the runoff Property-Liability segment following our annual comprehensive reserve review. This was partially offset by a lower expense ratio when excluding the impact of amortization of purchased intangibles primarily due to lower restructuring and related charges compared to the prior year quarter. 
Moving to Slide 6. Let's go a bit deeper on auto insurance profitability. Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio finished at 97.5 for the quarter and 89.7 over the first 9 months of 2021. The increase to the prior year quarter reflects higher loss cost due to higher accident frequency, increased severity and competitive pricing enhancements implemented in late 2020 and earlier this year. While claim frequency increased relative to prior year, we continue to experience favorable trends relative to prepandemic levels. Allstate brand auto property damage frequency increased 16.6% compared to 2020 but decreased 16.8% relative to 2019. 
The chart on the lower left compares the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter of 2019 to this quarter to remove some of the short-term pandemic volatility. The underlying combined ratio was 93.1 in 2019, which generates an attractive return on capital. Favorable auto frequency in the third quarter of 2021 lowered the combined ratio by 6.4 points compared to 2019. 
Increased auto claim severity, however, increased the combined ratio by 12 points versus 2 years ago, as you can see from the red bar. The cost reductions implemented as part of Transformative Growth reduced expenses by 1.3 points, which favorably impacted 2021 results. As Tom mentioned, early in the pandemic, the severity increases were driven by higher average losses due to a reduction in low severity claims. This year, the increase reflects the impact of supply chain disruptions in the auto markets, which has increased used car prices and enabled original equipment manufacturers to significantly increase part prices. 
The chart on the lower right shows used car values began increasing above the CPI in late 2020, which accelerated in 2021, resulting in an increase of 44% since the beginning of 2019. Similarly, OEM parts have also increased in 2021, roughly twice as much as core CPI. This has resulted in higher severities for both total loss vehicles and repairable vehicles. 
Since these increases were accelerating throughout the second and third quarters of the year, we increased expected loss costs for the first 2 quarters of 2021, and this prior quarter strengthening shows up in the combined ratio for the third quarter. Increases in report year severities for auto insurance claims during the first 2 quarters of 2021 increased the third quarter combined ratio by 2.6 points, as you can see by the green bar on the lower left. 
So let's flip to Slide 7, which lays out the steps we're taking to improve auto profitability. As you can see from the chart on the top, Allstate has maintained industry-leading auto insurance margins over a long period of time, with a combined ratio operating range in the mid-90s, exhibiting strong execution and operational expertise. 
To maintain industry-leading results, we are increasing rates, improving claims effectiveness and continuing the lower costs. After lowering prices in early 2021 to reflect in part Allstate's lower expense ratio, we have proactively been responding with increases in the third quarter, with actions continuing into the fourth quarter and into 2022. 
The chart on the right provides selected rate increases already implemented in the third and fourth quarter as well as publicly filed rates that have yet to be implemented in the fourth quarter. Those states denoted with the caret are top 10 states in terms of written premium as of year-end 2020. In the third quarter, we've received rate approvals for increases in 12 states, primarily in September. We adapted quickly to higher severities in the fourth quarter, with plans to file rates in an additional 20 states. We have already implemented rate increases in 8 states during the fourth quarter, with an average increase of 6.7% as of November 1. Looking ahead, we expect to pursue price increases in an additional 12 locations by year-end. 
We are working closely with state regulators to provide detailed support and decrease the lag time between filing, implementation and premium generation. As we move into next year, it is likely auto insurance prices will continue to be increased to reflect higher severities. We also continue to leverage advanced claims capabilities and process efficiencies. Cost reductions as part of Transformative Growth will also continue to be implemented. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss our expectations and commitment to further improve our cost structure through Transformative Growth. As you can see by the chart on the bottom of the slide, we've defined a new non-GAAP measure this quarter referred to as the adjusted expense ratio. This starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and investments in advertising. It then also adds in our claim expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims, which tend to be more variable. We believe this measure provides the best insight into the underlying expense trends within our Property-Liability business. 
Through innovation and strong execution, we achieved 2.6 points of improvement when comparing 2020 to 2018, with further improvement occurring through the first 9 months of 2021. Over time, we expect to drive an additional 3 points of improvement from current levels, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024. This represents about a 6-point reduction relative to 2018 or an average of 1 point per year over 6 years, enabling an improved price position relative to our competitors while maintaining attractive returns. 
Future cost reductions center around continued digital enhancements to automate processes, enabling the retirement of legacy technology, operating efficiency gains from combining organization -- combining organizations and transforming the distribution model to higher growth and lower costs. 
Transitioning to Slide 9, let's go up a level to show how Transformative Growth positions us for long-term success and how the components of Transformative Growth work together to create a flywheel of profitable growth. As you know, Transformative Growth is a multiyear initiative to increase personal Property-Liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition and deploying a new technology ecosystem. We've made significant progress to date across each component. 
Starting at the top of the flywheel visual, our commitment to further lower our costs, improves customer value and enables a more competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. Enhancing and expanding distribution puts us in a position to take advantage of more affordable pricing. Increasing the analytical sophistication of new customer acquisitions lets consumers know about this better value proposition. New technology platforms, lower costs and enable us to further broaden the solutions offered to property liability customers. This flywheel will enable us to increase market share and create additional shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 10. Let's look at the changes to the distribution system, which are also underway. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, Property-Liability policies in force grew by 12.5% compared to the prior year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4 million policies, and Allstate brand Property-Liability policies increased by 231,000 driven by growth across personal lines. Allstate brand auto policies in force increased slightly compared to the prior year quarter and sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, including growth of 142,000 policies compared to prior year-end, as you can see by the table on the lower left. 
The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to the prior year. [Audio gap] [ 38% ] increase in the direct channel more than offset a slight decline from existing agents and volume that would have normally been generated by newly appointed agents. As you know, we've significantly reduced the number of new Allstate agents being appointed beginning in early 2020 since we are developing a new agent model to drive higher growth at lower cost. The addition of National General also added 502,000 new auto applications in the quarter. 
Let me now turn it over to Mark to cover the remainder of the slides before we move to Q&A."

Revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 23.3% to $597 million in the third quarter. Protection Plans and net written premium increased by $139 million due to the launch of the Home Depot relationship focusing on appliances. Our quarterly net written premium is now 5.5x the level of when the company was acquired in 2017. 
Arity expanded revenues due to the integration of LeadCloud and Transparent.ly, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition as well as increased device sales driven by growth in the Milewise products. Policies in force increased 12.5% to 150 million driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Identity Protection. Adjusted net income was $45 million in the third quarter, representing an increase of $5 million compared to the prior year quarter driven by higher profitability at Allstate Identity Protection and Arity. This was partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses related to investments in growth. 
Now let's shift to Slide 12, which highlights our investment performance. Net investment income totaled $764 million in the quarter, which was $300 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income, as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $437 million in the quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting increases in private equity investments. 
As in prior quarters, several large idiosyncratic contributors had a meaningful impact on our results. These results represent a long-term and broad approach to growth investing, with nearly 90% of year-to-date performance-based income coming from assets with inception years of 2018 and prior. 
Market-based income, shown in blue, was $6 million below the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield was somewhat mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. 
Our total portfolio return was 1% in the third quarter and 3.3% year-to-date, reflecting income and changes in equity valuations, partially offset by higher interest rates. We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit risk for appropriate investment horizons. Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return process and play an important role in generating shareholder value. 
While the performance-based investment results continue to be strong in the third quarter, we manage the portfolio with a longer-term view on returns. On the right, we have provided our annualized portfolio return in total and by strategy over various time horizons. 
Consistent with broader public and private equity markets, our portfolio has experienced returns above our historical trend over the last several quarters. While prospective returns will depend on future economic and market conditions, we do expect our performance-based returns to moderate in line with our longer-term results. 
Now let's move to Slide 13, which highlights Allstate's strong capital position. Allstate's balance sheet strength and excellent cash flow generation provides strong cash returns to shareholders while investing in growth. Significant cash returns to shareholders, including $1.5 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends, occurred during the third quarter. Common shares outstanding have been reduced by 5% over the last 12 months. 
Already in the fourth quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of SafeAuto on October 1 for $262 million to leverage National General's integration capabilities and further increased personal lines market share. We also recently closed on the divestitures of Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company in New York. These divestitures free up approximately $1.7 billion of deployable capital, which was factored into the $5 billion share repurchase program currently being executed. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let's finish with a longer-term view of Allstate's focus on execution, innovation and sustainable value creation. Allstate has an excellent track record of serving customers, earning attractive returns on risks and delivering for shareholders, as you can see by the industry-leading statistics on the upper right. 
f
Innovation is also critical to the execution, and our proactive implementation of Transformative Growth has positioned us well to address the macroeconomic challenges facing our business today and in the future. Sustainable value creation also requires excellent capital management and governance. 
As an example, Allstate is in the top 15% of S&P 500 companies and cash returns to shareholders by providing an attractive dividend and repurchasing 25% and 50% of outstanding shares over the last 5 and 10 years, respectively. Execution, innovation and long-term value creation will continue to drive increased shareholder value. 
With that context, let's open the line for your questions."

First, as you know, we've long been focused on bundling auto and homeowners because those are good, stable, long-term customers. You do get a discount for putting those 2 together. So there's an advantage to the customer from buying it and putting it all in one place besides just having one point of contact. And we've been good at that. 
If you look at our growth in homeowners this year, it's higher than our growth in auto insurance, and that appears to be because we are doing more bundling of individual customers. It's a little hard to get the exact attribution, but we feel good about what our agents are doing to drive that. 
As it relates to the growth of it, we've been -- we repositioned this business over multiple years back in the middle -- late 2000 -- the first decade of 2000. We've made, of course, a bunch of money since over the last 8 or 9 years, I think almost $9 billion of underwriting income on homeowners, which you need to do because we don't believe that a 4-point margin is attractive on homeowners for a couple of reasons. One is you don't get much investment income. Secondly, you got to put in more capital because the results are more volatile, and you have the big tail losses. So as we seek to grow it, we bring all of that math to bear on individual states is where we grow. And so if there's a state where -- even if there's a fair amount of catastrophe exposure, but we think we can get a good return that's got a margin on it that compensates us for the capital we have to put up and the reinsurance we have to buy, then we'll do that. And we're highly sophisticated in the way we run it. So the geographic focus is really we have a much a highly sophisticated model and do it. 
On the direct business, you don't sell as much direct homeowners right now. We still need to crack the code on that. Before I -- Glenn will have some view on how we can continue to run the table in homeowners as we have so far, but the -- an upcoming thing that Glenn might want to touch on is what we're doing in the independent agent channel because of -- the National General platform gives us with our products, our expertise, our pricing, our claims management and our reinsurance programs gives us the ability to really serve a lot of customers. 
Glenn, where would you go with that?"

And so we want to grow it, and we want to bundle it, as Tom said. So over the course of the past year, we've deepened bundling discounts. So we've made it more attractive for customers across 30 states. We've shifted our agency competition over the last couple of years to where it's more attractive for them to bundle, and the same is true in direct. As Tom said, we're looking to crack the code and write more there. We're writing some want to write more. And so some of the incentives for our direct team are around cross quoting and bundling. 
To the point around cat footprint, we're in good shape. Like if you look at our ability to write business, we can write it pretty broadly. We can write in some cat-prone areas, but we tend to offset it and create the diversity of our book by writing in other areas. I mean, right now, we're on a 12-month view right now. We're at 93.8 combined ratio, made about $400 million underwriting profit in the last 12 months in spite of having some really big cat quarters. So it's a good business that we're able to consistently make money in. And so we're looking to grow it. But as Tom said, we have pretty stringent guidelines of where we write, how we write so that we don't overgrow in cat-prone areas, but we're able to grow without that. 
And Tom mentioned something that I want to come back to in terms of the breadth of our distribution and growing, and that would be into our IA channel. The IA channel is a huge opportunity. Independent agents were in a lot of homeowners, and our National General and Allstate company as it will be branded is adding our middle market products, both auto and home, and we have sort of a whole new greenfield there to run in, and that would be a broad geographic spread, not just in cat-prone areas."

First, we don't have a catastrophe exposure problem. We don't have a profitability problem, we believe, in homeowners. I mean we only made about -- we lost about [ $16 ] million on $7.3 billion so far this year. So we'd like to make more money. But as Glenn pointed out, when you look over a longer period of time -- we've had a fair amount of ups and downs, but we still made underwriting profit on a sort of 12-month basis. So we don't have a catastrophe problem. So we don't have to restrict stuff and end up with what you're poking at is retention issues. 
We have been there and done that, though. So -- and it was called the repositioning we did in the latter part of the decade I mentioned. And when you call a customer and say, I used to have -- used to be insured with us, and now I'm not going to share you with us -- and we're one of the biggest brokers of homeowners insurance product, I think, in the country, maybe [indiscernible] through our advantage. And even when you say to people, here's another company, it has some impact on your auto business so -- because people are like, well, I'll take my business someplace else or competitors decide they want to bundle and they'll go get those customers as well. So we had some issues with auto growth when we were downsizing. 
We went down by 2 million policies in the homeowners business over a 4-5-year period. So it does hurt. It's manageable. I can't speak for what our competitors are going to do. What I do know is what Glenn said, which is we've got a good business. We know how to run it. We have growth opportunities, and we're looking forward to serving more customers and make more money for our shareholders along the way."

So I think you're right, Greg, that there seems to be this -- a threat going through the markets today that this is kind of a once and done. And we don't necessarily see it that way.

Exactly I assume the same trends are going to happen them. And third is that those trends are going to end. And the answer is we don't know when they will do. What we do know is what we can do differently. And we do know that some of our competitors had frequency increases sooner than we did so that you would expect them to raise prices sooner than we did. 
We do think that we have a good plan in place, and Glenn can take you through that, which is to make sure we get attractive returns in auto insurance, which is a key component of what we do in terms of delivering value for shareholders, and we're all over that, and we will go -- we're -- how that will move forward in terms of competitive position, that's also hard to tell. What I do know is that I'm really glad we started Transformative Growth 2 years ago. And so the cost reductions we already have in place certainly have benefited us. It's positioned us to be able to grow through many different venues, so we can dial a growth up if we choose to do that. So I'm really glad we are where we are, and we're positioned to take share in the future, which is, of course, our strategy, but we want to do that profitably.

So -- thanks, Greg, and you get a couple of important points that you're right about that everyone or close to everyone is going to have to take rate when you talk about competitive position. So we think about that as part of the process. But this is broad and this is going to be around for a while. Like everything you look at in terms of what the root cause is of severity, which is in its simplest terms, is the price of used cars. I'd like to talk about collision coverage as if the coverage that doesn't really have a policy limit that's stated other than the value of the vehicle itself. So in real terms, our policy limit on that coverage went up by 40-plus percent with no change in premium. And that experience happened to everybody across the industry. So it's a rarity where you have something is clear and clean as that, that is a root cause to your severity changes. So we think it'll be around for a bit, and we're going after rate to address that as one of the levers, and we've talked about our claims capabilities and certainly our expense reductions as other ones. 
So in the third quarter, we took 12 price increases that went effective in the third quarter, another 8 in the fourth quarter so far, with more to come. So this is broad, and we'll be doing it just about everywhere. And I think the key from a competitive position is that we made a lot of progress. So our starting point, we made significant progress over the last year with the expenses we've taken out. And therefore, the competitive position we were in improved significantly. Our close rates improved significantly, leading to some of the greater new business that you saw. 
And so as we take rates, and others do, it's our goal is certainly to keep that competitive position gain that we've made, but the primary goal is to get our margins back to where they need to be, and that's why we're going after rate, and we're doing it pretty proactively."

So Greg, thanks for the question and the acknowledgment of the progress we've made. I guess where I'd start is maybe to just kind of go up a level and reiterate again what our objective in reducing costs really is, which is to enhance customer value by improving our competitive price position. And we're going to do that by continuing to drive down the expense component of our combined ratio, which is inclusive of both underwriting and claim expenses. 
And to your point, we've made really good progress over the past several years. And in addition to the progress we've made, we've created plans and have line of sight to the additional 3-point objective that we've got by 2024 by focusing on things like digitizing processes to improve efficiency by continuing, as we do that, create opportunity to retire legacy technology to capture the synergies associated with the National General acquisition to continue to drive down distribution costs as we've talked about creating a -- kind of a more productive but lower cost distribution model. So we've got opportunity in both the -- from an operating cost perspective on both the underwriting and the claims side, and we've got a plan on how to get there. And that's why we established the goal. And we think once we can get the additional 3 points out of our cost structure, it's really going to position us well relative to our competitors to have a more competitive price point, to deliver higher customer value and really position ourselves to accelerate growth."

But boy, I'm sure glad we got started on Transformative Growth than we did because we were able to reposition the brand. We invested over $0.25 billion in repositioning the brand, new advertising, testing out new more sophisticated ways to do it. And we did it when frequency was low. So we were able to use some of that reduction in frequency, the margin it created to invest in long-term growth by repositioning the brand. 
When you look at Transformative Growth, it's very simple, right? You get a more competitive price. You have more places to buy it. You let people know about that's the increase in advertising that I was talking about. What we do in the future will be depending how much we want to grow. So as we move forward, I think our advertising will be flat or come down some because we want to make sure we've got the pricing right in the point that came up earlier about the longevity of the -- how long will severity keep coming up. You want to make sure you've got that pricing right before you go out and get that flywheel going by doing more advertising. 
That said, we're always going to do a lot of advertising because, as you know, it is a marketing war, really, out there between some of the large players. But the other part that's not as well known is it's getting every bit as sophisticated as auto insurance and home pricing. So you've really got to be good with your math on that. And whether it's upper front or lower front, or getting the right price to the right customer at the right time in the right space is -- it's complicated. 
And so the other thing we've been working on is building out the sophistication so that every dollar of advertising investment we spend is well done. The reason we took it out of the expense ratio guidance was because it is more volatile and it'll depend on what kind of growth we're looking to achieve in that quarter. And this is a measure of really how effectively you running the business. Like how are you keeping your costs down for your customers so you can have that competitive price."

So the effectiveness of our sales, whether it be our call centers or on the web, it's better. Our marketing sophistication, our partnership with marketing, all of those things getting better, and that helps move it up. 
The other thing is, actually, in this price environment that's going to be disrupted, we're likely to see some tailwind in new business but some headwinds in retention because if we were in a situation where we're the only ones taking rate, you might expect the opposite. But with a whole bunch of people having to take rate, that will create a lot of shoppers. It'll create shoppers of our own, too, because it disrupts our own customers. And when people shop, they often find a better price or situation even in a rising environment like this. So there will be a lot of customers shopping ours and other companies. And so it's an opportunity, as Tom said, to leverage what we did and say we're really happy with the Transformative Growth than we did because we have more ways for customers to buy when that disruptive market happens."

We've got lots of other priorities we're looking at. 
But when you look at inflation, I'm not in the camp that the inflationary that like used car prices are suddenly going to go back down. I think you buy a car for $14,000, it used to cost you $10,000, like you're not thinking it's worth $10,000 no matter what the Fed and everybody else thinks about it being transitory. I think the same thing is true with when you look at parts prices. Parts prices, it's not like the oil market where prices are -- the system is built to go up and down every day. It gets embedded in there. The dealers buy inventory. People, distributors buy inventory. They price it. So we don't really see that being transitory and coming down. 
How long it will take to work all the way through the system, what opportunities the OEs will take to push prices further up is really unknown at this part. So it's hard to determine when it will cross. What you do know is, Elyse, that top line is going to keep going up as long as we see movement in the bottom line, and it'll keep going up until the bottom line plans out that make the bottom line being loss cost. And that top line then we'll keep going past that point in time until we get back to the margins. But when we get back to the same underwriting margin on, let's call it, a dollar basis or a percentage basis on auto insurance, you can't really predict until you can have a better handle on where frequency and severity is going to shake out. 
Glenn, anything you would add to that?"

So it's about 6 months from the effective date to get all customers paying that and then another 6 months from the point they start paying it to where the full premium has been earned for 1 policy period.

I do think we waited a little while to really see what was happening with the frequency and ensure that it was long-standing, and it has remained a long-standing benefit before taking them. And we were modest in it. We've done some pretty significant givebacks in the shelter-in-place givebacks, which were onetime in that sort of durable discount. Actually changing rates and moving them down, we were more subtle with and more modest with. So I don't think people will see sort of a wild swing down and back up, but they will see it in same states. 
And the simple fact is, as you saw on the chart, I believe, is on Page 7, that the used car prices spiked dramatically in the second quarter. And those sites and then people start having claims, and then those claims start to be paid and working their way into the loss cost, and you have this hyperinflationary environment on auto physical damage lines. So it's just the appropriate response at the appropriate time for it, and we'll do everything we can to maintain our retention. It's one of the wonderful things -- one of the many wonderful things about our agency force. Our agency force do a really good job of building relationships and talking to customers through changes in their policies and helping us through things like this."

The second question, kind of a different one then on Arity. I guess I'm curious, how you think about Arity? Do you think of it as either, a, more of a use it for our own pricing and telematics business or that plus kind of formed it off to others and having it more of a income-generating machine? It's still not giving you a lot of lift on that second piece. But do you think of it more that way longer term? We've seen more and more companies kind of go that route, and you're about the only one that isn't that go the route of farming that business off. I mean [ Hartford ] just announced it recently when they formed it off, and more and more companies are doing that. So how do you think about Arity? Is it more just for your own pricing? Or do you want to have it be more of a, again, income-generating machine as well?"

And I don't think that's been reviewed by any analysts as if it was a separate company. I mean we have 600 billion miles of data. We were a risk score in operation. We help people do marketing more effectively and efficiently. And so we're really building quite a platform that will do a number of things. One is it does exactly what you talked about, which is in the way we started, it was telematics as a service for us. We needed somebody to collect the data. We needed to get a mobile app up. We need to put it in files and be able to do something with it. And so rather than do that inside the insurance company, we decided to do it outside the insurance company because we said this is -- at the point we said, this is basically a service that other insurance companies will need, and we can provide it to them. And we do. So Arity provides that service to some other insurance companies, and we're working to try to expand that effort for them. But it moved beyond what I would just call telematics as a service, help me pull data and figure out what my customers are doing, too. 
We started collecting more data from ourselves and built a rating service organization so that we can help other insurance companies use telematics to price your insurance. We believe that they're going to get that capability anyway. So we think that we might as well do it through Arity and capture additional margin rather than just assuming we can take over 100% of the insurance industry by being a leader in telematics, which we are, but we don't think we can get the entire market share. So we created a rating services organization around that. It's then been expanded to include really lead generation because we started collecting more data. So we have data from the Allstate customers. We have data because we have our SDK embedded in other people's [indiscernible]. And we have hard data on -- I think it's over 25 million cars we're pulling every day, really high fidelity data that's in the same format. We also buy data that we're able to combine with that 25 million on an over another 75 million cars. So we're pulling data on 100 million cars per day right now. And so we're building this rating services organization for Allstate and other insurers so that we can not only do telematics as a service, we can do -- we think we can actually work to help people prequalify buyers, and it's called the Arity IQ. So significant value has been created. 
I don't think that shows up in shareholder value today because I don't really see any of the analysts really looking hard and saying, what's it worth, but we think it's a substantial value, and we expect to continue to grow that business and expand its total addressable market."

I guess that feels high to me, just especially considering that the loss ratio, if I take out the reserve charge, was only about 1.5 points higher than the third quarter of 2019 and then also just considering the expense initiatives that you guys have taken to date. I guess my thought was -- I thought that the expense plan would maybe sort of help reduce the amount of rate that you guys would need to take. I guess is that the right way of thinking about it? Or is it just too uncertain at this time and you guys just want to get in front of what might be coming down the road in terms of future loss cost increases?"

But being unclear as to where this inflation will sort out, we're being what we think is fair and appropriate as opposed to overly aggressive in increasing prices now. 
As to the extent in the future, we don't need that as much, and our expenses come down, then we can improve our competitive position, which we've improved our competitive position pretty significantly in 2021. And we don't want to give that up, and we'd like to continue to improve it so we get that flywheel of growth going. But in this case, we're using the expense reductions for future competitive price improvement as opposed to saying we don't need to raise prices because loss costs are going up. 
Glenn or Mario, anything you would add to that?"
