I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Do",1704,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. 
2020 was a year like no other, and Marsh & McLennan's response and performance was nothing short of remarkable in the circumstances. The year was characterized by tough choices that we made as a business and as individuals. Our colleagues rose to the occasion and demonstrated resilience, courage, agility, collaboration and empathy in the face of the global pandemic and social unrest. 
Times like these validate our purpose to make a difference in the moments that matter for our clients, colleagues and communities, and we did exactly that. 
Our 2020 adjusted EPS growth of 7% is impressive in one of the worst economic recessions ever. Our strong financial performance also enabled us to continue to invest for the future. We continue to develop digital technologies to offer more robust client solutions. We made a number of strategic hires and achieved a record year of acquired revenue at MMA through 8 acquisitions with approximately $235 million of annualized revenue. 
Looking forward, while the global pandemic will most likely dominate at least the first half of 2021, there are brighter days ahead. Our proprietary Pandemic Navigator model predicts that as vaccines are rolled out and we move closer to herd immunity through natural immunity, infection case counts and vaccinations, the U.S. and U.K. could see a return to more normal patterns sometime in the back half of the year. 
As we emerge from the crisis, clients around the world can rely on our expertise in the 3 areas that are critical for every organization: risk, strategy and people. The World's Economic Forum of annual global risk report, which was released last week and prepared with the support of Marsh & Mclennan and other partners, highlight some of the most likely and impactful risks facing the world today. And we are working with clients to navigate these issues. 
Marsh & McLennan has collaborated in the preparation of the annual global risk report for 16 years. In its first edition in 2006, the report warned against the risk of a lethal flu spread by global travel patterns. And in 2015, pandemics were identified as the #2 global risk. It also drew attention to the risk of global climate change and cyber threat many times over the past 10 years. This year's report highlights infectious disease, extreme weather and climate action failure as top impact risks, while social, digital and economic inequality have ascended as major risk. 
Marsh & McLennan continues to help clients adapt to an evolving risk landscape and navigate long-term secular challenges while, at the same time, providing advice and solutions for their most pressing issues of the day. 
Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. The fourth quarter marks the 13th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 22% year-over-year versus 20% in the third quarter. Global property insurance was up 20%, and global financial and professional lines were up 47%, while global casualty rates were up 7% on average. And U.S. workers' compensation pricing declined modestly. Keep in mind, our index skews to large account business. However, U.S. small and middle market insurance pricing continues to rise as well, although the magnitude of price increases is less than for large complex accounts. 
At the January renewals, commercial insurance market conditions remained challenging across products and regions. Risks are able to be placed, although at higher prices and, in some cases, with less coverage and stricter terms. Insurance carriers continue to push for rate increases in the face of losses, low returns and interest rates. At the January 1 reinsurance renewals, while pricing ultimately settled at the lower end of early predictions, negotiations were lengthy and complex with a significant focus on coverage and structure. 
Traditional dedicated reinsurance capital increased slightly, as calculated by Guy Carpenter and AM Best. However, alternative capital was down marginally. The willingness of providers to deploy capital improved over the very constrained midyear 2020 conditions. Capacity was generally available for both property and casualty lines. Non loss impacted property programs saw pricing up mid-single digit to low teens in the U.S. and low single digits in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Significant recent loss activity drove pricing up in excess of 30% on some segments of impacted business. Casualty renewals were subject to increased underwriting rigor due to ongoing pressures of social inflation and challenging experience. 
Price increases continue to be pervasive in both the P&C insurance and reinsurance markets overall. While capital levels remain reasonable, 2020 saw elevated loss activity, a historic pandemic and low interest rates. Periods of rising P&C rates, changing risk environment and uncertainty present challenges for our clients and the value of our advice and services becomes even more critical. 
Now let me turn to our fourth quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.19, which caps a strong year for Marsh & McLennan,despite the ongoing global pandemic and economic recession. Total revenue increased 4% versus a year ago and rose 1% on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue grew 3% in RIS or 4% excluding the decline in fiduciary interest and declined 2 -- 1% in Consulting. Marsh grew 4% in the quarter on an underlying basis, finishing the year strong. Guy Carpenter grew 5% on an underlying basis in the quarter. Mercer underlying revenue declined 3% in the quarter, and Oliver Wyman grew by 4% as new business picked up into the end of the year. 
The overall fourth quarter saw adjusted operating income consistent with prior year, with our adjusted operating margin down 60 basis points year-over-year. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we expected to see a sequential uptick in expenses in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects employee-related actions that would have taken place over the course of the year,but were delayed in the peak of the pandemic, an increase in variable compensation accruals due to Oliver Wyman's better-than-expected performance as well as strategic hiring and other investments. 
As we consistently say, it is important not to overemphasize a single quarter and rather look at performance over a longer period of time. For the full year 2020, adjusted operating income increased 9% with 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. RIS achieved 170 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the full year, while Consulting gained 20 basis points. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 7%. Overall revenue grew 3% or 1% on an underlying basis. RIS underlying growth of 3% was driven by growth of 3% in Marsh and 6% at Guy Carpenter partially offset by a significant decline in fiduciary interest. Consulting revenue held up well despite the more discretionary nature of revenue and higher economic sensitivity, with Mercer's underlying revenue down 1% and Oliver Wyman down 4% for the full year. 
As we look to 2021, we are well positioned given the resilience of our business, strong demand for our services and our expectation for a better economic backdrop. For the full year 2021, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS. This is based on our outlook today, which assumes the global economy recovers in 2021 with a return to positive economic growth in the second quarter. 
2021 represents the 150th anniversary of Marsh & McLennan. Few enterprises endure, let alone prosper for 1.5 centuries. Our predecessors helped our clients navigate through world Wars, depressions and, yes, pandemics. From our very beginning, we developed unique solutions and markets to address complex issues. We helped enable the development of major industries by creating insurance solutions for the automobile, telephone and electric power sectors. We pioneered innovative pension products that enhance retirement security. Decades ago, we developed some of the first space protection programs. Today, we are boldly working with governments around the world on a new type of public-private partnership to help address systemic risk from pandemics. We are also at the forefront of tackling society challenges such as cybersecurity, the protection cap, healthy societies, the retirement gap and climate resilience. 
Our growth and financial performance over this period was also outstanding. At the beginning of the 20th Century, we had approximately 20 employees and less than $1 million of revenue. Fast forward to today, we have over 76,000 employees in 130 countries and over $17 billion of revenue. Since going public in 1962, our financial returns have been exceptional with significant earnings growth. During this time, our revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS all have grown by a double-digit CAGR with a share price return CAGR over 10% annually. These stock returns meaningfully outpaced the S&P 500 and are testament to the value that Marsh & McLennan delivers for clients, colleagues and shareholders. 
We intend to use the occasion of our 150th anniversary to celebrate our history, chart our future and demonstrate indeed our commitment to the community. To that end, we announced earlier this month that we have committed to be carbon neutral as a company in 2021 and will reduce our carbon emissions by 15% by 2025. Over the balance of the year, we will roll out other initiatives, including fellowships for racial and social justice. 
As 2020 has powerfully demonstrated, the age of risk has really just begun. We want to preserve the best of what we have learned in 2020 about the importance of resilience, flexibility and empathy and then build on that foundation with a relentless spirit of innovation to shape the future. And one thing Marsh & McLennan will never change: We put clients at the center of everything that we do. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results."

We're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results which were strong despite the challenges of 2020. We grew our top line, delivered solid earnings growth and entered 2021 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. 
Consolidated revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter to $4.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 1%. Operating income was $571 million, while adjusted operating income was $855 million. Our adjusted operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 21.3%. GAAP EPS was $0.73, and adjusted EPS was $1.19. 
Looking at Risk & Insurance Services. Fourth quarter revenue grew 6% to $2.5 billion and was up 3% on an underlying basis or 4% excluding the impact of a decline in fiduciary interest. We are pleased with this excellent finish to the year, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business in the face of the pandemic. Adjusted operating income decreased 5% to $525 million, and the adjusted margin contracted 220 basis points to 23.5%, reflecting the expected increase in expense in the fourth quarter. 
For the year, revenue was $10.3 billion, an increase of 8% with solid underlying growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income growth for the year was impressive at 14%, and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 170 basis points to 28%. 
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 7% to $2.4 billion, increasing 4% on an underlying basis. In the U.S. and Canada division, underlying growth was 7% for the quarter and 5% for the full year driven by strength across the portfolio. 2020 represents the third straight year of 5% or higher underlying growth in U.S. and Canada. In the International division, underlying revenue was flat in the quarter, with Latin America up 3%, Asia Pacific up 1% and EMEA down 2%. For the full year, revenue at Marsh was $8.6 billion, an increase of 7% or 3% on an underlying basis. 
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $162 million, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis for the quarter, representing a great finish to a strong year. The performance in the quarter benefited from growth at GC Securities as well as strength in new and renewal business across our region. For the year, revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 15% or 6% on an underlying basis. The full year growth was well balanced with all businesses producing strong results. 
In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 1% to $1.9 billion with an underlying revenue decline of 1%. Consulting operating income was $179 million, and adjusted operating income was $387 million, up 8%. The adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, an increase of 170 basis points versus a year ago. For the year, revenue was $7 billion, a decrease of 2% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the year declined 2% to $1.2 billion, while our adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points to 18.8%. 
Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, representing a decrease of 3% on an underlying basis. Wealth decreased 1% on an underlying basis with an increase in investment management offset by a decline in DB. Our overall assets under management continued to grow and at year-end exceeded $357 billion, up 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Health revenue declined 2% on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter, reflecting headwinds from higher unemployment levels along with a tough comparison to a strong quarter for project work in the fourth quarter of 2019. Career revenue declined 7% on an underlying basis. For the year, revenue at Mercer was $4.9 billion, a decrease of 1% on an underlying basis. 
Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was $590 million, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. The stronger-than-expected results were driven by increased client demand across most segments of the business. We are pleased with the sequential improvement of positive underlying growth to finish out the year, although we recognize the environment remains uncertain. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $2 billion, a decrease of 4% on an underlying basis. 
Adjusted corporate expense was $57 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we reported $284 million of noteworthy items, the majority of which are related to JLT. Included in this total are $70 million of JLT integration costs, $13 million of JLT acquisition-related costs, $46 million of other restructuring costs and $161 million related to a legacy JLT E&O in the U.K. This E&O relates to an industry-wide review commenced by the FCA in 2014. The FCA focused on the suitability of financial advice provided to individuals by a number of companies, including JLT, relating to enhanced transfer value exercises that, in some cases, date back to 2001. At the time of the JLT acquisition, a gross liability of approximately $77 million had already been recorded. This latest update reflects our best estimate of the ultimate liability. We expect this gross liability to be partially offset by insurance recoveries from JLT's insurers and indemnification plans. 
As we typically do on our fourth quarter call, I will give a brief update on our global retirement plan. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $143 million in 2020 compared to $122 million in 2019. We expect cash contributions in 2021 will be roughly $124 million. For 2021, based on our current expectations, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will increase modestly year-over-year. 
Investment income was $25 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and was $11 million on an adjusted basis. For the full year 2020, our GAAP investment income was a loss of $22 million, and adjusted investment income was a gain of approximately $6 million. The differences between GAAP and adjusted primarily relate to mark-to-market adjustments on our remaining investment in Alexander IV, which we exclude from our adjusted results. For 2021, we expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis. 
Our effective adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 24% compared with 23.4% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2020, our adjusted tax rate was 24.4% as compared to 24.1% for the full year 2019. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted tax rate for the full year was approximately 25.3%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% to 26% for 2021. 
We made great progress in 2020 on our integration of JLT and have exceeded the key milestones we laid out when we announced the transaction. We incurred $70 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to date to $586 million. The remaining work to be done in 2021 consists primarily of ongoing technology application migrations and the further consolidation of real estate. 
Through year-end 2020, we have exceeded the estimated savings of $350 million. We now expect to achieve approximately $425 million of savings by the time the integration is completed in 2021. We expect to incur approximately $650 million of cash cost to generate these savings. In addition, we continue to expect approximately $75 million of noncash charges. 
We ended the year with $2.1 billion of cash due to the strength of our cash flow from operations and efforts made during the crisis to improve working cap. Our strong cash generation during the year enabled us to raise our dividend, complete a record level of acquisition activity at Marsh & McLennan Agency,and stay on pace with our deleveraging plan, with $1.5 billion of total debt repaid in the fourth quarter. Total debt at the end of the year was $11.3 billion, down from $12.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, reflecting the repayment of $700 million of senior notes, the prepayment of $300 million floating rate notes due in December 2021 and repayment of the remaining $500 million due on our term loan. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in July when $500 million of senior notes mature. 
Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $128 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $119 million of interest expense in the first quarter of 2021. 
In line with our prior commentary, we did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter 2020. As we look to 2021, while uncertainty remains high, the combination of our available cash and expected cash generation positions us well for a year of significant capital deployment. Based on our outlook today, we currently expect to deploy approximately $3.5 billion of capital in 2021 across dividends, debt reduction, acquisitions and share repurchases. Due to our debt reduction in Q4, we expect only a modest amount of debt pay-down in 2021, which will complete our deleveraging. 
We've consistently stated that we favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases as we do high-quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term. Our track record is good, as evidenced by our high-teens return on invested capital over the past 3 years. We expect to resume share repurchases in 2021, and the ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. 
Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled $365 million and included $124 million for acquisitions,and $241 million for dividends. For the full year 2020, uses of cash totaled $1.8 billion and included $877 million for acquisitions and $943 million for dividend. 
In summary, we are proud of the resilience, courage and agility of our colleagues in a year that presented unique challenges. As we look forward to 2021, our outlook is for another year of strong performance. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

And the difference between RIS and Consulting has more to do with what's happening in the global economy and macro factors, business confidence, obviously, is demonstrated this year. The RIS business is a bit more resilient with higher levels of recurring revenue than the Consulting business. But we're still hopeful actually that we will grow our Consulting business in 2021 in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman, and that's actually our plan. 
We do expect that there would be more strength from the second quarter onwards because the first quarter, you're basically comparing a pre COVID world with a COVID world, and so there'll be some challenges within that. But we're -- we've got some pretty decent momentum that we built throughout the year, and so we're expecting a good year in 2021. As we mentioned in the script, we expect to have margin expansion for the year, and we also expect to have solid adjusted EPS growth."

It sounds like maybe there could be some strains on the Q2 and the Q3 because those are pretty tough comps. But I guess that's one part of the question. 
And then the same thing, are you implying, Dan, since you said potentially growth in both Consulting and RIS, that both segments could see margin improvement in 2021?"

When we look at it, you say we did a pretty good job in the second quarter. My god, we rattled back expenses fast. Expense growth was down 5% in the second quarter, 4% in the third quarter. So I think it was a remarkable job, not impacting the business itself, continuing to invest in the business but managing our expenses aggressively in setting a very high bar for what was required in the midst of a real crisis, a real global crisis. And so the fourth quarter represents to us of getting back not quite to normal but looking at pacing the way we normally would do. A little inside baseball in that we -- clearly, we did a number of strategic hiring in the fourth quarter. We're actually up 500 -- or actually close to 500 head count in the fourth quarter, and so we're positioned well for 2021. I'm not worried about quarter-by-quarter comparisons looking at 2021 versus 2020 because 2020 in a lot of ways in such a unique, bizarre type of year. So we're going to run our business the way we want to run our business as we usually do, where revenue growth exceeds expense growth in almost every quarter and certainly in every year, as it has done for the last 13 years. So I know that the entire firm was very interested in doing our best to turn the page on 2020 and focus on 2021. And in the fourth quarter, we started really focusing on what that would mean. So I think we're positioned to grow decently in both. And whether our margin goes up in both segments, I'm not going to really talk about right now. I mean our expectation is that we will grow margins. 
Now I mean are we going to grow margins to the extent that we did as an overall company in 2020? When that would be a very tall ask, bearing in mind all the expenses that were pulled back in the second and third quarter."

So our choice of returning to offices is just that, it's a choice. We think it's better for the business. We expect our offices -- physical offices to remain really the hub of activity in Marsh & McLennan. But having said that, we also think that over a period of a few years,that we would be able to reduce our footprint a bit, and that would actually benefit shareholders, but it would also benefit colleagues by making their lives a bit more flexible and a bit easier. So certainly, that's an area of having a more agile real estate footprint is an example. 
We also operated much faster and more connected during COVID than we did previously. And there's an efficiency gain with that, that we absolutely want to keep. I look at T&E. I think it's going to be a while before travel snaps back to the levels that we had in like 2019, and maybe it will be quite a while. I do expect people, once COVID clears and the crisis is over, to return to travel, to see markets and to see clients. But maybe we don't travel quite as much impacts like we used to. And maybe we won't jump on an airplane at a moment's notice. It could be more like, well, let's talk on Zoom because everybody is used to that now. So I do think that there is lasting efficiency gain which will benefit shareholders in the post COVID world."

I mean our Consulting businesses, yes, they have less recurring revenue and parts of the career business and Oliver Wyman are project-based. But having said that, they're resilient businesses, and there's still plenty of activity as demonstrated by Mercer's performance through the year, which was minus 3% but much stronger -- minus 3% in the last 3 quarters and actually minus 1% for the year, which actually is much stronger than during the financial crisis. And areas like health and investments, retirement security are lasting and have resilience in and of themselves. 
Oliver Wyman's pop in the fourth quarter was a bit unexpected for us. And it gave us -- usually, as I've mentioned before, they tend to be a bit of our canary in the coal mine as the business confidence and thoughts. And so let me go to Martine first and then Scott, who can give you a little bit more flavor for how they see growth in their business in 2021. Martine?"

No, actually, we're pleased, as Dan said, about the new business activities that we've seen in the current challenging circumstances. And we look at what the world needs right now in terms of redefining the world of work, addressing health challenges. And also, we've seen quite a lot of demand in the investment solutions side of our portfolio, and we've closed the year at a record level of assets under management, that $357 billion. 
So I'd say health has been resilient through the crisis. We grew 2%, and we see bright spot there in terms of digital solutions demand for virtual care, mental health, for example, or workforce communication. As I said, Wealth, of course, we have the structural decline in the defined benefit, but that has slowed down a bit during 2020. And we've seen a lot of project work related to market volatility, so that could continue. But definitely, our investment solutions are very much in demand. 
And then for us, Career is our most discretionary project work business, in particular, on the service side of Career. But Careers usually rebound with the economy. And as Dan said in his remarks, we expect the economy to -- and the recovery to come back at least in part of H2 and therefore -- and we've seen -- we are seeing some strength in the current pipeline, and we've seen that in Q4. 
So all in all, I think our services are very relevant for the times. We're watching, of course, the agenda from the Biden administration, but we think that we are well positioned there. In particular, we are very strong in ESG, like diversity and inclusion, consulting and also on responsible investment and helping clients address the transition to a low-carbon economy. So I think as soon as the economy comes back, I think we should see a good rebound."

Sure, Dan and Mike. From an Oliver Wyman perspective, I mean, we had a very strong Q4, and we had strong business activity across most segments of the business and real particular strength in areas like financial services, health, the public sector and our actuarial and [indiscernible] businesses. 
And the type of business we were doing was really broad-based. And it ranged all the way from growth strategies and digital transformation to the other end of restructuring and bankruptcy. And I think the lesson I'm drawing from that is that there is lots to do out there as businesses recover after the pandemic and they rebuild, they grow, they evolve, transform. Oliver Wyman also tends to focus on big companies which have performed relatively better than small companies over the last period. 
Looking into the new year, our new sales and the pipeline are also strong. But as you said in your question, clients are facing significant uncertainty as they hopefully manage through the last legs of the pandemic. But looking out to the whole year, I think the first quarter could be challenging. But beyond that, I feel really good about our business, our prospects and our ability to grow. Companies are certainly challenged, and they've got at least another quarter or more of challenge and uncertainty. But they have a lot to do. They need a lot of support. And I think between Oliver Wyman and Mercer, we have many of the things they need."

My expectation on the call for our third quarter was that, that expenses would uptick in the fourth quarter but they would still be negative on a year-over-year basis. And actually, they're positive on a year-over-year basis. Our expenses grew 1.5% or 2% in the fourth quarter. And so it was a bit of a surprise. 
There's 2 factors underneath that. One, we didn't expect Oliver Wyman to grow in the fourth quarter, and Oliver Wyman grew. And as I've mentioned before, they have the most variable compensation model. And so when they're growing, that's when we build in more on terms of variable comps. So that was something that we didn't. And the hiring that we did in the fourth quarter on the strategic recruitment side was higher than what we expected. We see a lot of opportunities out there. And as I mentioned, we're up nearly 500 headcount on a net basis in the fourth quarter. So that has a little bit more. So those are the 2 factors that contributed to us having expenses. 
It's important to point out, neither of those factors in and of themselves are one way. I mean certainly, with the strategic recruitment, we expect revenue over time as a result of building out our headcount as we've done for many years in a row. And so -- and the variable comp increase in otherwise to me is a good news story because it's attached to growth. And so I would love for that to continue because it would signify that we're growing the top line in Oliver Wyman."

So if you look at the United States, U.K., Canada, Australia, France and Germany, that's a big part of our company, and so it's pretty developed economy stuff. But we always have some level of variability, as you mentioned, and there's going to be different rollouts, and there's going to be different timing as to when the individual countries return to normal.

Of course, the economic outlook matters, and many parts of the world struggled more from an economic perspective as a byproduct, of course, of the pandemics, saw maybe less government intervention to support the economies. 
What I would say, too, internationally, at least in many markets, maybe not the U.K., maybe not Australia or some other more developed markets, a lot of premium spend can be quite discretionary, right? And so -- and you have liability environments that are very, very different than the countries that I mentioned earlier. And so -- and we also saw less price and less rate increase in many of those markets as well. So I think overall, I would expect less premium growth from an insurer perspective internationally than what we saw in the U.S., where, as you saw, we had very, very strong revenue growth this year.

I mean our bonus pool increased in 2020. In fact, the overall Marsh & McLennan bonus pool has never been higher than in 2020 because profitability was up considerably. And so when I look forward to next year -- or 2021 rather, I look at it and say, almost certainly, revenue is going to exceed expense growth as it has for the last 13 years. It may not be in every quarter, but certainly, that's how we run the business for a year. I think a lot of our expense pop in the fourth quarter was non run rate. I mean some of it was, but a lot of it wasn't. And so I look at it pretty simply. For 10 years prior to COVID, we grew underlying revenue between 3% to 5%, and we delivered an adjusted EPS CAGR over that decade of close to 12%. So ultimately, that's what we were playing for the idea that as long as we grow underlying revenue, we can run our business and the expense side of our business in a way to develop strong adjusted EPS growth. And that's kind of how I think about 2021."

The market remained very challenging for our clients in the quarter.

U.S., U.K. and Australia are the most difficult markets, generally speaking, for our clients. Looking forward, I'm most concerned, again from our clients' perspective, about D&O pricing and excess liability pricing. The excess liability market really primarily here in the U.S., just a lot of ongoing discussion about growing claim frequency, growing claim severity, in part, again, driven by social inflation. But just broad concerns in the underwriting community about rate adequacy there. Work comp remains -- pricing remains down, on the other hand, and it's been down candidly a bit longer than I've been expecting but good for our clients. We are seeing some lines of business where the rate increase line kind of flattened out or began to moderate. And that's not to say that prices were down, but the average increase in the fourth quarter, like in our property book, for example, wasn't up as much as it was in the third quarter. So again, overall, from a client's point of view, I'm most concerned about D&O and excess liability pricing. I do think as time wears on throughout the rest of 2021, other lines of business will likely moderate a bit."

I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations.  
2020 was a year like no other, and Marsh & McLennan's response and performance was nothing short of remarkable in the circumstances. The year was characterized by tough choices that we made as a business and as individuals. Our colleagues rose to the occasion and demonstrated resilience, courage, agility, collaboration and empathy in the face of the global pandemic and social unrest.  
Times like these validate our purpose to make a difference in the moments that matter for our clients, colleagues and communities, and we did exactly that.  
Our 2020 adjusted EPS growth of 7% is impressive in one of the worst economic recessions ever. Our strong financial performance also enabled us to continue to invest for the future. We continue to develop digital technologies to offer more robust client solutions. We made a number of strategic hires and achieved a record year of acquired revenue at MMA through 8 acquisitions with approximately $235 million of annualized revenue.  
Looking forward, while the global pandemic will most likely dominate at least the first half of 2021, there are brighter days ahead. Our proprietary Pandemic Navigator model predicts that as vaccines are rolled out and we move closer to herd immunity through natural immunity, infection case counts and vaccinations, the U.S. and U.K. could see a return to more normal patterns sometime in the back half of the year.  
As we emerge from the crisis, clients around the world can rely on our expertise in the 3 areas that are critical for every organization: risk, strategy and people. The World Economic Forum of annual Global Risk Report, which was released last week and prepared with the support of Marsh & McLennan and other partners, highlight some of the most likely and impactful risks facing the world today. And we are working with clients to navigate these issues.  
Marsh & McLennan has collaborated in the preparation of the annual Global Risk Report for 16 years. In its first edition in 2006, the report warned against the risk of a lethal flu spread by global travel patterns. And in 2015, pandemics were identified as the #2 global risk. It also drew attention to the risk of global climate change and cyber threat many times over the past 10 years. This year's report highlights infectious disease, extreme weather and climate action failure as top impact risks, while social, digital and economic inequality have ascended as major risk.  
Marsh & McLennan continues to help clients adapt to an evolving risk landscape and navigate long-term secular challenges while, at the same time, providing advice and solutions for their most pressing issues of the day.  
Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. The fourth quarter marks the 13th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 22% year-over-year versus 20% in the third quarter. Global property insurance was up 20%, and global financial and professional lines were up 47%, while global casualty rates were up 7% on average. And U.S. workers' compensation pricing declined modestly. Keep in mind, our index skews to large account business. However, U.S. small and middle market insurance pricing continues to rise as well, although the magnitude of price increases is less than for large complex accounts.  
At the January renewals, commercial insurance market conditions remained challenging across products and regions. Risks are able to be placed, although at higher prices and, in some cases, with less coverage and stricter terms. Insurance carriers continue to push for rate increases in the face of losses, low returns and interest rates. At the January 1 reinsurance renewals, while pricing ultimately settled at the lower end of our early predictions, negotiations were lengthy and complex with a significant focus on coverage and structure.  
Traditional dedicated reinsurance capital increased slightly, as calculated by Guy Carpenter and AM Best. However, alternative capital was down marginally. The willingness of providers to deploy capital improved over the very constrained midyear 2020 conditions. Capacity was generally available for both property and casualty lines. Nonloss impacted property programs saw pricing up mid-single digit to low teens in the U.S. and low single digits in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Significant recent loss activity drove pricing up in excess of 30% on some segments of impacted business. Casualty renewals were subject to increased underwriting rigor due to ongoing pressures of social inflation and challenging experience.  
Price increases continue to be pervasive in both the P&C insurance and reinsurance markets overall. While capital levels remain reasonable, 2020 saw elevated loss activity at historic pandemic and low interest rates. Periods of rising P&C rates, changing risk environment and uncertainty present challenges for our clients and the value of our advice and services becomes even more critical.  
Now let me turn to our fourth quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.19, which caps a strong year for Marsh & McLennan, despite the ongoing global pandemic and economic recession. Total revenue increased 4% versus a year ago and rose 1% on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue grew 3% in RIS or 4% excluding the decline in fiduciary interest and declined 2 -- 1% in Consulting. Marsh grew 4% in the quarter on an underlying basis, finishing the year strong. Guy Carpenter grew 5% on an underlying basis in the quarter. Mercer underlying revenue declined 3% in the quarter, and Oliver Wyman grew by 4% as new business picked up into the end of the year.  
The overall fourth quarter saw adjusted operating income consistent with prior year, with our adjusted operating margin down 60 basis points year-over-year. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we expected to see a sequential uptick in expenses in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects employee-related actions that would have taken place over the course of the year, but were delayed in the thick of the pandemic, and increase in variable compensation accruals due to Oliver Wyman's better-than-expected performance as well as strategic hiring and other investments.  
As we consistently say, it is important not to overemphasize a single quarter and rather look at performance over a longer period of time. For the full year 2020, adjusted operating income increased 9%, with 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. RIS achieved 170 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the full year, while Consulting gained 20 basis points. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 7%. Overall revenue grew 3% or 1% on an underlying basis. RIS underlying growth of 3% was driven by growth of 3% in Marsh and 6% at Guy Carpenter partially offset by a significant decline in fiduciary interest. Consulting revenue held up well despite the more discretionary nature of revenue and higher economic sensitivity, with Mercer's underlying revenue down 1% and Oliver Wyman down 4% for the full year.  
As we look to 2021, we are well positioned given the resilience of our business, strong demand for our services and our expectation for a better economic backdrop. For the full year 2021, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS. This is based on our outlook today, which assumes the global economy recovers in 2021 with a return to positive economic growth in the second quarter.  
2021 represents the 150th anniversary of Marsh & McLennan. Few enterprises endure, let alone prosper for 1.5 centuries. Our predecessors helped our clients navigate through world wars, depressions and, yes, pandemics. From our very beginning, we developed unique solutions and markets to address complex issues. We helped enable the development of major industries by creating insurance solutions for the automobile, telephone and electric power sectors. We pioneered innovative pension products that enhance retirement security. Decades ago, we developed some of the first space protection programs. Today, we are boldly working with governments around the world on a new type of public-private partnership to help address systemic risk from pandemics. We are also at the forefront of tackling society challenges such as cybersecurity, the protection gap, healthy societies, the retirement gap and climate resilience.  
Our growth and financial performance over this period was also outstanding. At the beginning of the 20th Century, we had approximately 20 employees and less than $1 million of revenue. Fast forward to today, we have over 76,000 employees in 130 countries and over $17 billion of revenue. Since going public in 1962, our financial returns have been exceptional with significant earnings growth. During this time, our revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS all have grown by a double-digit CAGR with a share price return CAGR over 10% annually. These stock returns meaningfully outpaced the S&P 500 and are testament to the value that Marsh & McLennan delivers for clients, colleagues and shareholders.  
We intend to use the occasion of our 150th anniversary to celebrate our history, chart our future and demonstrate indeed our commitment to the community. To that end, we announced earlier this month that we have committed to be carbon neutral as a company in 2021 and will reduce our carbon emissions by 15% by 2025. Over the balance of the year, we will roll out other initiatives, including fellowships for racial and social justice.  
As 2020 has powerfully demonstrated, the age of risk has really just begun. We want to preserve the best of what we have learned in 2020 about the importance of resilience, flexibility and empathy and then build on that foundation with a relentless spirit of innovation to shape the future. And one thing that Marsh & McLennan will never change: we put clients at the center of everything that we do.  
With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results."

We're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results which were strong despite the challenges of 2020. We grew our top line, delivered solid earnings growth and entered 2021 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position.  
Consolidated revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter to $4.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 1%. Operating income was $571 million, while adjusted operating income was $855 million. Our adjusted operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 21.3%. GAAP EPS was $0.73, and adjusted EPS was $1.19.  
Looking at Risk & Insurance Services. Fourth quarter revenue grew 6% to $2.5 billion and was up 3% on an underlying basis or 4% excluding the impact of the decline in fiduciary interest. We are pleased with this excellent finish to the year, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business in the face of the pandemic. Adjusted operating income decreased 5% to $525 million, and the adjusted margin contracted 220 basis points to 23.5%, reflecting the expected increase in expense in the fourth quarter.  
For the year, revenue was $10.3 billion, an increase of 8% with solid underlying growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income growth for the year was impressive at 14%, and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 170 basis points to 28%.  
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 7% to $2.4 billion, increasing 4% on an underlying basis. In the U.S. and Canada division, underlying growth was 7% for the quarter and 5% for the full year, driven by strength across the portfolio. 2020 represents the third straight year of 5% or higher underlying growth in U.S. and Canada.  
In the International division, underlying revenue was flat in the quarter, with Latin America up 3%, Asia Pacific up 1% and EMEA down 2%. For the full year, revenue at Marsh was $8.6 billion, an increase of 7% or 3% on an underlying basis.  
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $162 million, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis for the quarter, representing a great finish to a strong year. The performance in the quarter benefited from growth at GC Securities as well as strength in new and renewal business across our region. For the year, revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 15% or 6% on an underlying basis. The full year growth was well balanced with all businesses producing strong results.  
In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 1% to $1.9 billion with an underlying revenue decline of 1%. Consulting operating income was $179 million, and adjusted operating income was $387 million, up 8%. The adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, an increase of 170 basis points versus a year ago. For the year, revenue was $7 billion, a decrease of 2% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the year declined 2% to $1.2 billion, while our adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points to 18.8%.  
Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, representing a decrease of 3% on an underlying basis. Wealth decreased 1% on an underlying basis with an increase in investment management offset by a decline in DB. Our overall assets under management continued to grow and at year-end exceeded $357 billion, up 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Health revenue declined 2% on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter, reflecting headwinds from higher unemployment levels along with a tough comparison to a strong quarter for project work in the fourth quarter of 2019. Career revenue declined 7% on an underlying basis.  
For the year, revenue at Mercer was $4.9 billion, a decrease of 1% on an underlying basis.  
Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was $590 million, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. The stronger-than-expected results were driven by increased client demand across most segments of the business. We are pleased with the sequential improvement of positive underlying growth to finish out the year, although we recognize the environment remains uncertain. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $2 billion, a decrease of 4% on an underlying basis.  
Adjusted corporate expense was $57 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we reported $284 million of noteworthy items, the majority of which are related to JLT. Included in this total are $70 million of JLT integration costs, $13 million of JLT acquisition-related costs, $46 million of other restructuring costs and $161 million related to a legacy JLT E&O in the U.K. This E&O relates to an industry-wide review commenced by the FCA in 2014. The FCA focused on the suitability of financial advice provided to individuals by a number of companies, including JLT, relating to enhanced transfer value exercises that, in some cases, date back to 2001. At the time of the JLT acquisition, a gross liability of approximately $77 million had already been recorded. This latest update reflects our best estimate of the ultimate liability. We expect this gross liability to be partially offset by insurance recoveries from JLT's insurers and indemnification plans.  
As we typically do on our fourth quarter call, I will give a brief update on our global retirement plan. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $143 million in 2020 compared to $122 million in 2019. We expect cash contributions in 2021 will be roughly $124 million. For 2021, based on our current expectations, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will increase modestly year-over-year.  
Investment income was $25 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and was $11 million on an adjusted basis. For the full year 2020, our GAAP investment income was a loss of $22 million, and adjusted investment income was a gain of approximately $6 million. The differences between GAAP and adjusted primarily relate to mark-to-market adjustments on our remaining investment in Alexander IV, which we exclude from our adjusted results. For 2021, we expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis.  
Our effective adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 24% compared with 23.4% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2020, our adjusted tax rate was 24.4% as compared to 24.1% for the full year 2019. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted tax rate for the full year was approximately 25.3%.  
When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% to 26% for 2021.  
We made great progress in 2020 on our integration of JLT and have exceeded the key milestones we laid out when we announced the transaction. We incurred $70 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to date to $586 million. The remaining work to be done in 2021 consists primarily of ongoing technology application migrations and the further consolidation of real estate.  
Through year-end 2020, we have exceeded the estimated savings of $350 million. We now expect to achieve approximately $425 million of savings by the time the integration is completed in 2021. We expect to incur approximately $650 million of cash cost to generate these savings. In addition, we continue to expect approximately $75 million of noncash charges.  
We ended the year with $2.1 billion of cash due to the strength of our cash flow from operations and efforts made during the crisis to improve working cap. Our strong cash generation during the year enabled us to raise our dividend, complete a record level of acquisition activity at Marsh & McLennan Agency, and stay on pace with our deleveraging plan, with $1.5 billion of total debt repaid in the fourth quarter. Total debt at the end of the year was $11.3 billion, down from $12.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, reflecting the repayment of $700 million of senior notes, the prepayment of $300 million floating rate notes due in December 2021 and repayment of the remaining $500 million due on our term loan. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in July when $500 million of senior notes mature.  
Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $128 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $119 million of interest expense in the first quarter of 2021.  
In line with our prior commentary, we did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter of 2020. As we look to 2021, while uncertainty remains high, the combination of our available cash and expected cash generation positions us well for a year of significant capital deployment. Based on our outlook today, we currently expect to deploy approximately $3.5 billion of capital in 2021 across dividends, debt reduction, acquisitions and share repurchases. Due to our debt reduction in Q4, we expect only a modest amount of debt paydown in 2021, which will complete our deleveraging.  
We've consistently stated that we favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases as we do high-quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term. Our track record is good, as evidenced by our high-teens return on invested capital over the past 3 years. We expect to resume share repurchases in 2021, and the ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops.  
Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled $365 million and included $124 million for acquisitions, and $241 million for dividends. For the full year of 2020, uses of cash totaled $1.8 billion and included $877 million for acquisitions and $943 million for dividend.  
In summary, we are proud of the resilience, courage and agility of our colleagues in a year that presented unique challenges. As we look forward to 2021, our outlook is for another year of strong performance. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

And so I -- we feel that it's actually really positive that we're believing we will return to that 3% to 5% growth in 2021. The difference between RIS and Consulting has more to do with what's happening in the global economy and macro factors, business confidence, obviously, as demonstrated this year. The RIS business is a bit more resilient with higher levels of recurring revenue than the Consulting business. But we're still hopeful actually that we will grow our Consulting business in 2021 in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman, and that's actually our plan.  
We do expect that there would be more strength from the second quarter onwards because the first quarter, you're basically comparing a pre-COVID world with a COVID world, and so there'll be some challenges within that. But we're -- we've got some pretty decent momentum that we built throughout the year, and so we're expecting a good year in 2021. As we mentioned on -- in the script, we expect to have margin expansion for the year, and we also expect to have solid adjusted EPS growth."

And then my second question, I guess is also one of the other component of guidance, some margin improvement. You guys did, like you said, a pretty good job of managing your expenses during the second and the third quarter. It sounds like there was a little bit more reinvestment, some stuff that got put off, I think you said, in the fourth quarter. So I guess the same question I was thinking about on the margin side. It sounds like maybe there could be some strain on the Q2 and the Q3 because those are pretty tough comps. But I guess that's one part of the question.  
And then the same thing, are you implying, Dan, since you said potentially growth in both Consulting and RIS, that both segments could see margin improvement in 2021?"

When we look at it, you say we did a pretty good job in the second quarter. My god, we rattled back expenses fast. Expense growth was down 5% in the second quarter, 4% in the third quarter. So I think it was a remarkable job, not impacting the business itself, continuing to invest in the business, but managing our expenses aggressively in setting a very high bar for what was required in the midst of a real crisis, a real global crisis. 
And so the fourth quarter represents, to us, of getting back, not quite to normal, but looking at pacing the way we normally would do. A little inside baseball in that we clearly -- we did a number of strategic hiring in the fourth quarter. We're actually up 500 -- or actually close to 500 headcount in the fourth quarter, and so we're positioned well for 2021. I'm not worried about quarter-by-quarter comparisons looking at 2021 versus 2020 because 2020 in a lot of ways in such a unique, bizarre type of year. 
So we're going to run our business the way we want to run our business as we usually do, where revenue growth exceeds expense growth in almost every quarter and certainly in every year, as it has done for the last 13 years. So I know that the entire firm was very interested in doing our best to turn the page on 2020 and focus on 2021. And in the fourth quarter, we started really focusing on what that would mean. So I think we're positioned to grow decently in both. And whether our margin goes up in both segments or not, I'm not going to really talk about right now. I mean our expectation is that we will grow margins.  
Now I mean are we going to grow margins to the extent that we did as an overall company in 2020? Well that would be a very [ tall ] ask, bearing in mind all the expenses that were pulled back in the second and third quarter."

I do think we will return to a more normal pattern to where we look at revenue growth in the 3% to 5% area. Our expense growth for a number of years, 4 out of the last 5 years before 2020 was average -- well not average, was actually 2% growth. So our expense growth, normally, would be around 2%, as it's been. Now some years might be 3%, some years might be 1%, but ultimately, I think that's the more normal pattern. We do see the opportunity of certain things that we've learned during this year or during the year 2020 to continue.  
Clearly, when you think about things like we're a business that's filled with knowledge workers and subject matter experts, so remote working is manageable for us. So our choice of returning to offices is just that, it's a choice. We think it's better for the business. We expect our offices -- physical offices to remain really the hub of activity in Marsh & McLennan. But having said that, we also think that over a period of a few years, that we would be able to reduce our footprint a bit, and that would actually benefit shareholders, but it would also benefit colleagues by making their lives a bit more flexible and a bit easier. So certainly, that's an area of having a more agile real estate footprint is an example.  
We also operated much faster and more connected during COVID than we did previously. And there's an efficiency gain with that, that we absolutely want to keep. I look at T&E. I think it's going to be a while before travel snaps back to the levels that we had in like 2019, and maybe it will be quite a while. I do expect people, once COVID clears and the crisis is over, to return to travel, to see markets and to see clients. But maybe we don't travel quite as much in packs like we used to. And maybe we won't jump on an airplane at a moment's notice. It could be more like, well, let's talk on Zoom because everybody is used to that now. So I do think that there is lasting efficiency gain which will benefit shareholders in the post-COVID world."

And areas like health and investments, retirement security are lasting and have resilience in and of themselves.  
Oliver Wyman's pop in the fourth quarter was a bit unexpected for us. And it gave us -- usually, as I've mentioned before, they tend to be a bit of our canary in the coal mine as the business confidence and the thoughts. And so let me go to Martine first and then Scott, who can give you a little bit more flavor for how they see growth in their business in 2021. Martine?"

No, actually, we're pleased, as Dan said, about the new business activities that we've seen in the current challenging circumstances. And we look at what the world needs right now in terms of redefining the world of work, addressing health challenges. And also, we've seen quite a lot of demand in the investment solutions side of our portfolio, and we've closed the year at a record level of assets under management, that $357 billion.  
So I'd say health has been resilient through the crisis. We grew 2%, and we see bright spot there in terms of digital solutions demand for virtual care, mental health, for example, or workforce communication. As I said, Wealth, of course, we have the structural decline in the defined benefit, but that has slowed down a bit during 2020. And we've seen a lot of project work related to market volatility, so that could continue. But definitely, our investment solutions are very much in demand.  
And then for us, Career is our most discretionary project work business, in particular, on the service side of Career. But Careers usually rebound with the economy. And as Dan said in his remarks, we expect the economy to -- and the recovery to come back at least in part of H2 and therefore -- and we've seen -- we are seeing some strength in the current pipeline, and we've seen that in Q4.  
So all in all, I think our services are very relevant for the times. We're watching, of course, the agenda from the Biden administration, but we think that we are well positioned there. In particular, we are very strong in ESG, like diversity and inclusion, consulting and also on responsible investment and helping clients address the transition to a low-carbon economy. So I think as soon as the economy comes back, I think we should see a good rebound."

Sure, Dan and Mike. From an Oliver Wyman perspective, I mean, we had a very strong Q4, and we had strong business activity across most segments of the business and real particular strength in areas like financial services, health, the public sector and our actuarial and living cost businesses.  
And the type of business we were doing was really broad-based. And it ranged all the way from growth strategies and digital transformation to the other end of restructuring and bankruptcy. And I think, yes, the lesson I'm drawing from that is that there is lots to do out there as businesses recover after the pandemic and they rebuild, they grow, they evolve, transform. Oliver Wyman also tends to focus on big companies, which have performed relatively better than small companies over the last period.  
Looking into the new year, our new sales and the pipeline are also strong. But as said -- as you said in your question, clients are facing significant uncertainty as they hopefully manage through the last legs of the pandemic. But looking out to the whole year, I think the first quarter could be challenging. But beyond that, I feel really good about our business, our prospects and our ability to grow. Companies are certainly challenged, and they've got at least another quarter or more of challenge and uncertainty. But they have a lot to do. They need a lot of support. And I think between Oliver Wyman and Mercer, we have many of the things they need."

My expectation on the call for our third quarter was that, that expenses would uptick in the fourth quarter, but they would still be negative on a year-over-year basis. And actually, they're positive on a year-over-year basis. Our expenses grew 1.5% or 2% in the fourth quarter. And so it was a bit of a surprise.  
There's 2 factors underneath that. One, we didn't expect Oliver Wyman to grow in the fourth quarter, and Oliver Wyman grew. And as I've mentioned before, they have the most variable compensation model. And so when they're growing, that's when we build in more on terms of variable comps. So that was something that we did. And the hiring that we did in the fourth quarter on the strategic recruitment side was higher than what we expected. We see a lot of opportunities out there. And as I mentioned, we're up nearly 500 headcount on a net basis in the fourth quarter. So that was a little bit more. So those are the 2 factors that contributed to us having expenses.  
It's important to point out, neither of those factors in and of themselves are run rate. I mean certainly, with the strategic recruitment, we expect revenue over time as a result of building out our headcount as we've done for many years in a row. And so -- and the variable comp increase in OW, to me, is a good news story because it's attached to growth. And so I would love for that to continue because it would signify that we're growing the top line in Oliver Wyman."

What I would say, too, internationally, and at least in many markets, maybe not the U.K., maybe not the -- Australia or some other more developed markets. 
A lot of premium spend can be quite discretionary, right? And so -- and you have liability environments that are very, very different than the countries that I mentioned earlier. And so -- and we also saw less price and less rate increase in many of those markets as well. So I think, overall, I would expect less premium growth from an insurer perspective internationally than what we saw in the U.S., where, as you saw, we had very, very strong revenue growth this year.

And then within the offering, Meyer, there's different types. So we have assets, pension assets, and we have non-pension assets. And there's -- the client really decide on the asset mix, so the exposure to whether equity or bonds or private market. We think that actually the way that we deploy these assets, it's -- there's just mitigation of risk in itself because of the diversification of the portfolio. So I would say that the revenue flows, it depends on when the AUM funds in the year, but it's been a success and growth story so far."

And so when I look forward to next year -- or 2021 rather, I look at it and say, almost certainly, revenue is going to exceed expense growth as it has for the last 13 years. 
It may not be in every quarter, but certainly, that's how we run the business for a year. I think a lot of our expense pop in the fourth quarter was nonrun rate. I mean some of it was, but a lot of it wasn't. And so I look at it pretty simply. For 10 years prior to COVID, we grew underlying revenue between 3% to 5%, and we delivered an adjusted EPA -- EPS CAGR over that decade of close to 12%. So ultimately, that's what we were playing for. The idea is that as long we grow underlying revenue, we can run our business and the expense side of our business in a way to develop strong adjusted EPS growth. And that's kind of how I think about 2021."

The market remained very challenging for our clients in the quarter.

U.S., U.K. and Australia are the most difficult markets, generally speaking, for our clients. Looking forward, I'm most concerned, again from our clients' perspective, about D&O pricing and excess liability pricing. The excess liability market really primarily here in the U.S., just a lot of ongoing discussion about growing claim frequency, growing claim severity, in part, again, driven by social inflation. But just broad concerns in the underwriting community about rate adequacy there. Work comp remains -- pricing remains down, on the other hand, and it's been down candidly a bit longer than I've been expecting but good for our clients. 
We are seeing some lines of business where the rate increase line kind of flattened out or began to moderate. And that's not to say that prices were down, but the average increase in the fourth quarter, like in our property book, for example, wasn't up as much as it was in the third quarter. So again, overall, from a client's point of view, I'm most concerned about D&O and excess liability pricing. I do think as time wears on throughout the rest of 2021, other lines of business will likely moderate a bit."

Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. 
2020 was a year like no other, and Marsh & McLennan's response and performance was nothing short of remarkable in the circumstances. The year was characterized by tough choices that we made as a business and as individuals. Our colleagues rose to the occasion and demonstrated resilience, courage, agility, collaboration and empathy in the face of the global pandemic and social unrest. 
Times like these validate our purpose to make a difference in the moments that matter for our clients, colleagues and communities, and we did exactly that. 
Our 2020 adjusted EPS growth of 7% is impressive in one of the worst economic recessions ever. Our strong financial performance also enabled us to continue to invest for the future. We continue to develop digital technologies to offer more robust client solutions. We made a number of strategic hires and achieved a record year of acquired revenue at MMA through 8 acquisitions with approximately $235 million of annualized revenue. 
Looking forward, while the global pandemic will most likely dominate at least the first half of 2021, there are brighter days ahead. Our proprietary Pandemic Navigator model predicts that as vaccines are rolled out and we move closer to herd immunity through natural immunity, infection case counts and vaccinations, the U.S. and U.K. could see a return to more normal patterns sometime in the back half of the year. 
As we emerge from the crisis, clients around the world can rely on our expertise in the 3 areas that are critical for every organization: risk, strategy and people. The World Economic Forum of annual Global Risk Report, which was released last week and prepared with the support of Marsh & McLennan and other partners, highlight some of the most likely and impactful risks facing the world today. And we are working with clients to navigate these issues. 
Marsh & McLennan has collaborated in the preparation of the annual Global Risk Report for 16 years. In its first edition in 2006, the report warned against the risk of a lethal flu spread by global travel patterns. And in 2015, pandemics were identified as the #2 global risk. It also drew attention to the risk of global climate change and cyber threat many times over the past 10 years. This year's report highlights infectious disease, extreme weather and climate action failure as top impact risks, while social, digital and economic inequality have ascended as major risk. 
Marsh & McLennan continues to help clients adapt to an evolving risk landscape and navigate long-term secular challenges while, at the same time, providing advice and solutions for their most pressing issues of the day. 
Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. The fourth quarter marks the 13th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 22% year-over-year versus 20% in the third quarter. Global property insurance was up 20%, and global financial and professional lines were up 47%, while global casualty rates were up 7% on average. And U.S. workers' compensation pricing declined modestly. Keep in mind, our index skews to large account business. However, U.S. small and middle-market insurance pricing continues to rise as well, although the magnitude of price increases is less than for large complex accounts. 
At the January renewals, commercial insurance market conditions remained challenging across products and regions. Risks are able to be placed, although at higher prices and, in some cases, with less coverage and stricter terms. Insurance carriers continue to push for rate increases in the face of losses, low returns and interest rates. At the January 1 reinsurance renewals, while pricing ultimately settled at the lower end of our early predictions, negotiations were lengthy and complex with a significant focus on coverage and structure. 
Traditional dedicated reinsurance capital increased slightly, as calculated by Guy Carpenter and AM Best. However, alternative capital was down marginally. The willingness of providers to deploy capital improved over the very constrained midyear 2020 conditions. Capacity was generally available for both property and casualty lines. Nonloss impacted property programs saw pricing up mid-single digit to low teens in the U.S. and low single digits in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Significant recent loss activity drove pricing up in excess of 30% on some segments of impacted business. Casualty renewals were subject to increased underwriting rigor due to ongoing pressures of social inflation and challenging experience. 
Price increases continue to be pervasive in both the P&C insurance and reinsurance markets overall. While capital levels remain reasonable, 2020 saw elevated loss activity at historic pandemic and low interest rates. Periods of rising P&C rates, changing risk environment and uncertainty present challenges for our clients and the value of our advice and services becomes even more critical. 
Now let me turn to our fourth quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.19, which caps a strong year for Marsh & McLennan, despite the ongoing global pandemic and economic recession. Total revenue increased 4% versus a year ago and rose 1% on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue grew 3% in RIS or 4% excluding the decline in fiduciary interest and declined 2 -- 1% in Consulting. Marsh grew 4% in the quarter on an underlying basis, finishing the year strong. Guy Carpenter grew 5% on an underlying basis in the quarter. Mercer underlying revenue declined 3% in the quarter, and Oliver Wyman grew by 4% as new business picked up into the end of the year. 
The overall fourth quarter saw adjusted operating income consistent with prior year, with our adjusted operating margin down 60 basis points year-over-year. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we expected to see a sequential uptick in expenses in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects employee-related actions that would have taken place over the course of the year, but were delayed in the thick of the pandemic, and increase in variable compensation accruals due to Oliver Wyman's better-than-expected performance as well as strategic hiring and other investments. 
As we consistently say, it is important not to overemphasize a single quarter and rather look at performance over a longer period of time. For the full year 2020, adjusted operating income increased 9%, with 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. RIS achieved 170 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the full year, while Consulting gained 20 basis points. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 7%. Overall revenue grew 3% or 1% on an underlying basis. RIS underlying growth of 3% was driven by growth of 3% in Marsh and 6% at Guy Carpenter partially offset by a significant decline in fiduciary interest. Consulting revenue held up well despite the more discretionary nature of revenue and higher economic sensitivity, with Mercer's underlying revenue down 1% and Oliver Wyman down 4% for the full year. 
As we look to 2021, we are well positioned given the resilience of our business, strong demand for our services and our expectation for a better economic backdrop. For the full year 2021, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS. This is based on our outlook today, which assumes the global economy recovers in 2021 with a return to positive economic growth in the second quarter. 
2021 represents the 150th anniversary of Marsh & McLennan. Few enterprises endure, let alone prosper for 1.5 centuries. Our predecessors helped our clients navigate through world wars, depressions and, yes, pandemics. From our very beginning, we developed unique solutions and markets to address complex issues. We helped enable the development of major industries by creating insurance solutions for the automobile, telephone and electric power sectors. We pioneered innovative pension products that enhance retirement security. Decades ago, we developed some of the first space protection programs. Today, we are boldly working with governments around the world on a new type of public-private partnership to help address systemic risk from pandemics. We are also at the forefront of tackling society challenges such as cybersecurity, the protection gap, healthy societies, the retirement gap and climate resilience. 
Our growth and financial performance over this period was also outstanding. At the beginning of the 20th Century, we had approximately 20 employees and less than $1 million of revenue. Fast forward to today, we have over 76,000 employees in 130 countries and over $17 billion of revenue. Since going public in 1962, our financial returns have been exceptional with significant earnings growth. During this time, our revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS all have grown by a double-digit CAGR with a share price return CAGR over 10% annually. These stock returns meaningfully outpaced the S&P 500 and are testament to the value that Marsh & McLennan delivers for clients, colleagues and shareholders. 
We intend to use the occasion of our 150th anniversary to celebrate our history, chart our future and demonstrate indeed our commitment to the community. To that end, we announced earlier this month that we have committed to be carbon neutral as a company in 2021 and will reduce our carbon emissions by 15% by 2025. Over the balance of the year, we will roll out other initiatives, including fellowships for racial and social justice. 
As 2020 has powerfully demonstrated, the age of risk has really just begun. We want to preserve the best of what we have learned in 2020 about the importance of resilience, flexibility and empathy and then build on that foundation with a relentless spirit of innovation to shape the future. And one thing that Marsh & McLennan will never change: we put clients at the center of everything that we do. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results."

For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $2 billion, a decrease of 4% on an underlying basis. 
Adjusted corporate expense was $57 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we reported $284 million of noteworthy items, the majority of which are related to JLT. Included in this total are $70 million of JLT integration costs, $13 million of JLT acquisition-related costs, $46 million of other restructuring costs and $161 million related to a legacy JLT E&O in the U.K. This E&O relates to an industry-wide review commenced by the FCA in 2014. The FCA focused on the suitability of financial advice provided to individuals by a number of companies, including JLT, relating to enhanced transfer value exercises that, in some cases, date back to 2001. At the time of the JLT acquisition, a gross liability of approximately $77 million had already been recorded. This latest update reflects our best estimate of the ultimate liability. We expect this gross liability to be partially offset by insurance recoveries from JLT's insurers and indemnification plans. 
As we typically do on our fourth quarter call, I will give a brief update on our global retirement plan. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $143 million in 2020 compared to $122 million in 2019. We expect cash contributions in 2021 will be roughly $124 million. For 2021, based on our current expectations, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will increase modestly year-over-year. 
Investment income was $25 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and was $11 million on an adjusted basis. For the full year 2020, our GAAP investment income was a loss of $22 million, and adjusted investment income was a gain of approximately $6 million. The differences between GAAP and adjusted primarily relate to mark-to-market adjustments on our remaining investment in Alexander IV, which we exclude from our adjusted results. For 2021, we expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis. 
Our effective adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 24% compared with 23.4% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2020, our adjusted tax rate was 24.4% as compared to 24.1% for the full year 2019. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted tax rate for the full year was approximately 25.3%. 
When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% to 26% for 2021. 
We made great progress in 2020 on our integration of JLT and have exceeded the key milestones we laid out when we announced the transaction. We incurred $70 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to date to $586 million. The remaining work to be done in 2021 consists primarily of ongoing technology application migrations and the further consolidation of real estate. 
Through year-end 2020, we have exceeded the estimated savings of $350 million. We now expect to achieve approximately $425 million of savings by the time the integration is completed in 2021. We expect to incur approximately $650 million of cash cost to generate these savings. In addition, we continue to expect approximately $75 million of noncash charges. 
We ended the year with $2.1 billion of cash due to the strength of our cash flow from operations and efforts made during the crisis to improve working cap. Our strong cash generation during the year enabled us to raise our dividend, complete a record level of acquisition activity at Marsh & McLennan Agency, and stay on pace with our deleveraging plan, with $1.5 billion of total debt repaid in the fourth quarter. Total debt at the end of the year was $11.3 billion, down from $12.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, reflecting the repayment of $700 million of senior notes, the prepayment of $300 million floating rate notes due in December 2021 and repayment of the remaining $500 million due on our term loan. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in July when $500 million of senior notes mature. 
Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $128 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $119 million of interest expense in the first quarter of 2021. 
In line with our prior commentary, we did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter of 2020. As we look to 2021, while uncertainty remains high, the combination of our available cash and expected cash generation positions us well for a year of significant capital deployment. Based on our outlook today, we currently expect to deploy approximately $3.5 billion of capital in 2021 across dividends, debt reduction, acquisitions and share repurchases. Due to our debt reduction in Q4, we expect only a modest amount of debt paydown in 2021, which will complete our deleveraging. 
We've consistently stated that we favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases as we do high-quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term. Our track record is good, as evidenced by our high-teens return on invested capital over the past 3 years. We expect to resume share repurchases in 2021, and the ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. 
Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled $365 million and included $124 million for acquisitions, and $241 million for dividends. For the full year of 2020, uses of cash totaled $1.8 billion and included $877 million for acquisitions and $943 million for dividend. 
In summary, we are proud of the resilience, courage and agility of our colleagues in a year that presented unique challenges. As we look forward to 2021, our outlook is for another year of strong performance. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

The difference between RIS and Consulting has more to do with what's happening in the global economy and macro factors, business confidence, obviously, as demonstrated this year. The RIS business is a bit more resilient with higher levels of recurring revenue than the Consulting business. But we're still hopeful actually that we will grow our Consulting business in 2021 in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman, and that's actually our plan. 
We do expect that there would be more strength from the second quarter onwards because the first quarter, you're basically comparing a pre-COVID world with a COVID world, and so there'll be some challenges within that. But we're -- we've got some pretty decent momentum that we built throughout the year, and so we're expecting a good year in 2021. As we mentioned on -- in the script, we expect to have margin expansion for the year, and we also expect to have solid adjusted EPS growth."

You guys did, like you said, a pretty good job of managing your expenses during the second and the third quarter. It sounds like there was a little bit more reinvestment, some stuff that got put off, I think you said, in the fourth quarter. So I guess the same question I was thinking about on the margin side. It sounds like maybe there could be some strain on the Q2 and the Q3 because those are pretty tough comps. But I guess that's one part of the question. 
And then the same thing, are you implying, Dan, since you said potentially growth in both Consulting and RIS, that both segments could see margin improvement in 2021?"

When we look at it, you say we did a pretty good job in the second quarter. My god, we rattled back expenses fast. Expense growth was down 5% in the second quarter, 4% in the third quarter. So I think it was a remarkable job, not impacting the business itself, continuing to invest in the business, but managing our expenses aggressively in setting a very high bar for what was required in the midst of a real crisis, a real global crisis. 
And so the fourth quarter represents, to us, of getting back, not quite to normal, but looking at pacing the way we normally would do. A little inside baseball in that we clearly -- we did a number of strategic hiring in the fourth quarter. We're actually up 500 -- or actually close to 500 headcount in the fourth quarter, and so we're positioned well for 2021. I'm not worried about quarter-by-quarter comparisons looking at 2021 versus 2020 because 2020 in a lot of ways in such a unique, bizarre type of year. 
So we're going to run our business the way we want to run our business as we usually do, where revenue growth exceeds expense growth in almost every quarter and certainly in every year, as it has done for the last 13 years. So I know that the entire firm was very interested in doing our best to turn the page on 2020 and focus on 2021. And in the fourth quarter, we started really focusing on what that would mean. So I think we're positioned to grow decently in both. And whether our margin goes up in both segments or not, I'm not going to really talk about right now. I mean our expectation is that we will grow margins. 
Now I mean are we going to grow margins to the extent that we did as an overall company in 2020? Well that would be a very [ tall ] ask, bearing in mind all the expenses that were pulled back in the second and third quarter."

I do think we will return to a more normal pattern to where we look at revenue growth in the 3% to 5% area. Our expense growth for a number of years, 4 out of the last 5 years before 2020 was average -- well not average, was actually 2% growth. So our expense growth, normally, would be around 2%, as it's been. Now some years might be 3%, some years might be 1%, but ultimately, I think that's the more normal pattern. We do see the opportunity of certain things that we've learned during this year or during the year 2020 to continue. 
Clearly, when you think about things like we're a business that's filled with knowledge workers and subject matter experts, so remote working is manageable for us. So our choice of returning to offices is just that, it's a choice. We think it's better for the business. We expect our offices -- physical offices to remain really the hub of activity in Marsh & McLennan. But having said that, we also think that over a period of a few years, that we would be able to reduce our footprint a bit, and that would actually benefit shareholders, but it would also benefit colleagues by making their lives a bit more flexible and a bit easier. So certainly, that's an area of having a more agile real estate footprint is an example. 
We also operated much faster and more connected during COVID than we did previously. And there's an efficiency gain with that, that we absolutely want to keep. I look at T&E. I think it's going to be a while before travel snaps back to the levels that we had in like 2019, and maybe it will be quite a while. I do expect people, once COVID clears and the crisis is over, to return to travel, to see markets and to see clients. But maybe we don't travel quite as much in packs like we used to. And maybe we won't jump on an airplane at a moment's notice. It could be more like, well, let's talk on Zoom because everybody is used to that now. So I do think that there is lasting efficiency gain which will benefit shareholders in the post-COVID world."

And areas like health and investments, retirement security are lasting and have resilience in and of themselves. 
Oliver Wyman's pop in the fourth quarter was a bit unexpected for us. And it gave us -- usually, as I've mentioned before, they tend to be a bit of our canary in the coal mine as the business confidence and the thoughts.

No, actually, we're pleased, as Dan said, about the new business activities that we've seen in the current challenging circumstances. And we look at what the world needs right now in terms of redefining the world of work, addressing health challenges. And also, we've seen quite a lot of demand in the investment solutions side of our portfolio, and we've closed the year at a record level of assets under management, that $357 billion. 
So I'd say health has been resilient through the crisis. We grew 2%, and we see bright spot there in terms of digital solutions demand for virtual care, mental health, for example, or workforce communication. As I said, Wealth, of course, we have the structural decline in the defined benefit, but that has slowed down a bit during 2020. And we've seen a lot of project work related to market volatility, so that could continue. But definitely, our investment solutions are very much in demand. 
And then for us, Career is our most discretionary project work business, in particular, on the service side of Career. But Careers usually rebound with the economy. And as Dan said in his remarks, we expect the economy to -- and the recovery to come back at least in part of H2 and therefore -- and we've seen -- we are seeing some strength in the current pipeline, and we've seen that in Q4. 
So all in all, I think our services are very relevant for the times. We're watching, of course, the agenda from the Biden administration, but we think that we are well positioned there. In particular, we are very strong in ESG, like diversity and inclusion, consulting and also on responsible investment and helping clients address the transition to a low-carbon economy. So I think as soon as the economy comes back, I think we should see a good rebound."

Sure, Dan and Mike. From an Oliver Wyman perspective, I mean, we had a very strong Q4, and we had strong business activity across most segments of the business and real particular strength in areas like financial services, health, the public sector and our actuarial and living cost businesses. 
And the type of business we were doing was really broad-based. And it ranged all the way from growth strategies and digital transformation to the other end of restructuring and bankruptcy. And I think, yes, the lesson I'm drawing from that is that there is lots to do out there as businesses recover after the pandemic and they rebuild, they grow, they evolve, transform. Oliver Wyman also tends to focus on big companies, which have performed relatively better than small companies over the last period. 
Looking into the new year, our new sales and the pipeline are also strong. But as said -- as you said in your question, clients are facing significant uncertainty as they hopefully manage through the last legs of the pandemic. But looking out to the whole year, I think the first quarter could be challenging. But beyond that, I feel really good about our business, our prospects and our ability to grow. Companies are certainly challenged, and they've got at least another quarter or more of challenge and uncertainty. But they have a lot to do. They need a lot of support. And I think between Oliver Wyman and Mercer, we have many of the things they need."

And actually, they're positive on a year-over-year basis. Our expenses grew 1.5% or 2% in the fourth quarter. And so it was a bit of a surprise. 
There's 2 factors underneath that. One, we didn't expect Oliver Wyman to grow in the fourth quarter, and Oliver Wyman grew. And as I've mentioned before, they have the most variable compensation model. And so when they're growing, that's when we build in more on terms of variable comps. So that was something that we did. And the hiring that we did in the fourth quarter on the strategic recruitment side was higher than what we expected. We see a lot of opportunities out there. And as I mentioned, we're up nearly 500 headcount on a net basis in the fourth quarter. So that was a little bit more. So those are the 2 factors that contributed to us having expenses. 
It's important to point out, neither of those factors in and of themselves are run rate. I mean certainly, with the strategic recruitment, we expect revenue over time as a result of building out our headcount as we've done for many years in a row. And so -- and the variable comp increase in OW, to me, is a good news story because it's attached to growth. And so I would love for that to continue because it would signify that we're growing the top line in Oliver Wyman."

So I think, overall, I would expect less premium growth from an insurer perspective internationally than what we saw in the U.S., where, as you saw, we had very, very strong revenue growth this year. But again, I'm optimistic about '21. It should be a better year."

And so when I look forward to next year -- or 2021 rather, I look at it and say, almost certainly, revenue is going to exceed expense growth as it has for the last 13 years. 
It may not be in every quarter, but certainly, that's how we run the business for a year. I think a lot of our expense pop in the fourth quarter was nonrun rate. I mean some of it was, but a lot of it wasn't. And so I look at it pretty simply. For 10 years prior to COVID, we grew underlying revenue between 3% to 5%, and we delivered an adjusted EPA -- EPS CAGR over that decade of close to 12%. So ultimately, that's what we were playing for. The idea is that as long we grow underlying revenue, we can run our business and the expense side of our business in a way to develop strong adjusted EPS growth.

U.S., U.K. and Australia are the most difficult markets, generally speaking, for our clients. Looking forward, I'm most concerned, again from our clients' perspective, about D&O pricing and excess liability pricing. The excess liability market really primarily here in the U.S., just a lot of ongoing discussion about growing claim frequency, growing claim severity, in part, again, driven by social inflation. But just broad concerns in the underwriting community about rate adequacy there. Work comp remains -- pricing remains down, on the other hand, and it's been down candidly a bit longer than I've been expecting but good for our clients. 
We are seeing some lines of business where the rate increase line kind of flattened out or began to moderate. And that's not to say that prices were down, but the average increase in the fourth quarter, like in our property book, for example, wasn't up as much as it was in the third quarter. So again, overall, from a client's point of view, I'm most concerned about D&O and excess liability pricing. I do think as time wears on throughout the rest of 2021, other lines of business will likely moderate a bit."

Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. 
2020 was a year like no other, and Marsh & McLennan's response and performance was nothing short of remarkable in the circumstances. The year was characterized by tough choices that we made as a business and as individuals. Our colleagues rose to the occasion and demonstrated resilience, courage, agility, collaboration and empathy in the face of the global pandemic and social unrest. 
Times like these validate our purpose to make a difference in the moments that matter for our clients, colleagues and communities, and we did exactly that. 
Our 2020 adjusted EPS growth of 7% is impressive in one of the worst economic recessions ever. Our strong financial performance also enabled us to continue to invest for the future. We continue to develop digital technologies to offer more robust client solutions. We made a number of strategic hires and achieved a record year of acquired revenue at MMA through 8 acquisitions with approximately $235 million of annualized revenue. 
Looking forward, while the global pandemic will most likely dominate at least the first half of 2021, there are brighter days ahead. Our proprietary Pandemic Navigator model predicts that as vaccines are rolled out and we move closer to herd immunity through natural immunity, infection case counts and vaccinations, the U.S. and U.K. could see a return to more normal patterns sometime in the back half of the year. 
As we emerge from the crisis, clients around the world can rely on our expertise in the 3 areas that are critical for every organization: risk, strategy and people. The World Economic Forum of annual Global Risk Report, which was released last week and prepared with the support of Marsh & McLennan and other partners, highlight some of the most likely and impactful risks facing the world today. And we are working with clients to navigate these issues. 
Marsh & McLennan has collaborated in the preparation of the annual Global Risk Report for 16 years. In its first edition in 2006, the report warned against the risk of a lethal flu spread by global travel patterns. And in 2015, pandemics were identified as the #2 global risk. It also drew attention to the risk of global climate change and cyber threat many times over the past 10 years. This year's report highlights infectious disease, extreme weather and climate action failure as top impact risks, while social, digital and economic inequality have ascended as major risk. 
Marsh & McLennan continues to help clients adapt to an evolving risk landscape and navigate long-term secular challenges while, at the same time, providing advice and solutions for their most pressing issues of the day. 
Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. The fourth quarter marks the 13th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 22% year-over-year versus 20% in the third quarter. Global property insurance was up 20%, and global financial and professional lines were up 47%, while global casualty rates were up 7% on average. And U.S. workers' compensation pricing declined modestly. Keep in mind, our index skews to large account business. However, U.S. small and middle-market insurance pricing continues to rise as well, although the magnitude of price increases is less than for large complex accounts. 
At the January renewals, commercial insurance market conditions remained challenging across products and regions. Risks are able to be placed, although at higher prices and, in some cases, with less coverage and stricter terms. Insurance carriers continue to push for rate increases in the face of losses, low returns and interest rates. At the January 1 reinsurance renewals, while pricing ultimately settled at the lower end of our early predictions, negotiations were lengthy and complex with a significant focus on coverage and structure. 
Traditional dedicated reinsurance capital increased slightly, as calculated by Guy Carpenter and AM Best. However, alternative capital was down marginally. The willingness of providers to deploy capital improved over the very constrained midyear 2020 conditions. Capacity was generally available for both property and casualty lines. Nonloss impacted property programs saw pricing up mid-single digit to low teens in the U.S. and low single digits in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Significant recent loss activity drove pricing up in excess of 30% on some segments of impacted business. Casualty renewals were subject to increased underwriting rigor due to ongoing pressures of social inflation and challenging experience. 
Price increases continue to be pervasive in both the P&C insurance and reinsurance markets overall. While capital levels remain reasonable, 2020 saw elevated loss activity at historic pandemic and low interest rates. Periods of rising P&C rates, changing risk environment and uncertainty present challenges for our clients and the value of our advice and services becomes even more critical. 
Now let me turn to our fourth quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.19, which caps a strong year for Marsh & McLennan, despite the ongoing global pandemic and economic recession. Total revenue increased 4% versus a year ago and rose 1% on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue grew 3% in RIS or 4% excluding the decline in fiduciary interest and declined 2 -- 1% in Consulting. Marsh grew 4% in the quarter on an underlying basis, finishing the year strong. Guy Carpenter grew 5% on an underlying basis in the quarter. Mercer underlying revenue declined 3% in the quarter, and Oliver Wyman grew by 4% as new business picked up into the end of the year. 
The overall fourth quarter saw adjusted operating income consistent with prior year, with our adjusted operating margin down 60 basis points year-over-year. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we expected to see a sequential uptick in expenses in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects employee-related actions that would have taken place over the course of the year, but were delayed in the thick of the pandemic, and increase in variable compensation accruals due to Oliver Wyman's better-than-expected performance as well as strategic hiring and other investments. 
As we consistently say, it is important not to overemphasize a single quarter and rather look at performance over a longer period of time. For the full year 2020, adjusted operating income increased 9%, with 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. RIS achieved 170 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the full year, while Consulting gained 20 basis points. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 7%. Overall revenue grew 3% or 1% on an underlying basis. RIS underlying growth of 3% was driven by growth of 3% in Marsh and 6% at Guy Carpenter partially offset by a significant decline in fiduciary interest. Consulting revenue held up well despite the more discretionary nature of revenue and higher economic sensitivity, with Mercer's underlying revenue down 1% and Oliver Wyman down 4% for the full year. 
As we look to 2021, we are well positioned given the resilience of our business, strong demand for our services and our expectation for a better economic backdrop. For the full year 2021, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS. This is based on our outlook today, which assumes the global economy recovers in 2021 with a return to positive economic growth in the second quarter. 
2021 represents the 150th anniversary of Marsh & McLennan. Few enterprises endure, let alone prosper for 1.5 centuries. Our predecessors helped our clients navigate through world wars, depressions and, yes, pandemics. From our very beginning, we developed unique solutions and markets to address complex issues. We helped enable the development of major industries by creating insurance solutions for the automobile, telephone and electric power sectors. We pioneered innovative pension products that enhance retirement security. Decades ago, we developed some of the first space protection programs. Today, we are boldly working with governments around the world on a new type of public-private partnership to help address systemic risk from pandemics. We are also at the forefront of tackling society challenges such as cybersecurity, the protection gap, healthy societies, the retirement gap and climate resilience. 
Our growth and financial performance over this period was also outstanding. At the beginning of the 20th Century, we had approximately 20 employees and less than $1 million of revenue. Fast forward to today, we have over 76,000 employees in 130 countries and over $17 billion of revenue. Since going public in 1962, our financial returns have been exceptional with significant earnings growth. During this time, our revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS all have grown by a double-digit CAGR with a share price return CAGR over 10% annually. These stock returns meaningfully outpaced the S&P 500 and are testament to the value that Marsh & McLennan delivers for clients, colleagues and shareholders. 
We intend to use the occasion of our 150th anniversary to celebrate our history, chart our future and demonstrate indeed our commitment to the community. To that end, we announced earlier this month that we have committed to be carbon neutral as a company in 2021 and will reduce our carbon emissions by 15% by 2025. Over the balance of the year, we will roll out other initiatives, including fellowships for racial and social justice. 
As 2020 has powerfully demonstrated, the age of risk has really just begun. We want to preserve the best of what we have learned in 2020 about the importance of resilience, flexibility and empathy and then build on that foundation with a relentless spirit of innovation to shape the future. And one thing that Marsh & McLennan will never change: we put clients at the center of everything that we do. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results."

We're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results which were strong despite the challenges of 2020. We grew our top line, delivered solid earnings growth and entered 2021 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. 
Consolidated revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter to $4.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 1%. Operating income was $571 million, while adjusted operating income was $855 million. Our adjusted operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 21.3%. GAAP EPS was $0.73, and adjusted EPS was $1.19. 
Looking at Risk & Insurance Services. Fourth quarter revenue grew 6% to $2.5 billion and was up 3% on an underlying basis or 4% excluding the impact of the decline in fiduciary interest. We are pleased with this excellent finish to the year, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business in the face of the pandemic. Adjusted operating income decreased 5% to $525 million, and the adjusted margin contracted 220 basis points to 23.5%, reflecting the expected increase in expense in the fourth quarter. 
For the year, revenue was $10.3 billion, an increase of 8% with solid underlying growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income growth for the year was impressive at 14%, and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 170 basis points to 28%. 
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 7% to $2.4 billion, increasing 4% on an underlying basis. In the U.S. and Canada division, underlying growth was 7% for the quarter and 5% for the full year, driven by strength across the portfolio. 2020 represents the third straight year of 5% or higher underlying growth in U.S. and Canada. 
In the International division, underlying revenue was flat in the quarter, with Latin America up 3%, Asia Pacific up 1% and EMEA down 2%. For the full year, revenue at Marsh was $8.6 billion, an increase of 7% or 3% on an underlying basis. 
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $162 million, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis for the quarter, representing a great finish to a strong year. The performance in the quarter benefited from growth at GC Securities as well as strength in new and renewal business across our region. For the year, revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 15% or 6% on an underlying basis. The full year growth was well balanced with all businesses producing strong results. 
In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 1% to $1.9 billion with an underlying revenue decline of 1%. Consulting operating income was $179 million, and adjusted operating income was $387 million, up 8%. The adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, an increase of 170 basis points versus a year ago. For the year, revenue was $7 billion, a decrease of 2% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the year declined 2% to $1.2 billion, while our adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points to 18.8%. 
Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, representing a decrease of 3% on an underlying basis. Wealth decreased 1% on an underlying basis with an increase in investment management offset by a decline in DB. Our overall assets under management continued to grow and at year-end exceeded $357 billion, up 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Health revenue declined 2% on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter, reflecting headwinds from higher unemployment levels along with a tough comparison to a strong quarter for project work in the fourth quarter of 2019. Career revenue declined 7% on an underlying basis. 
For the year, revenue at Mercer was $4.9 billion, a decrease of 1% on an underlying basis. 
Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was $590 million, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. The stronger-than-expected results were driven by increased client demand across most segments of the business. We are pleased with the sequential improvement of positive underlying growth to finish out the year, although we recognize the environment remains uncertain. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $2 billion, a decrease of 4% on an underlying basis. 
Adjusted corporate expense was $57 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we reported $284 million of noteworthy items, the majority of which are related to JLT. Included in this total are $70 million of JLT integration costs, $13 million of JLT acquisition-related costs, $46 million of other restructuring costs and $161 million related to a legacy JLT E&O in the U.K. This E&O relates to an industry-wide review commenced by the FCA in 2014. The FCA focused on the suitability of financial advice provided to individuals by a number of companies, including JLT, relating to enhanced transfer value exercises that, in some cases, date back to 2001. At the time of the JLT acquisition, a gross liability of approximately $77 million had already been recorded. This latest update reflects our best estimate of the ultimate liability. We expect this gross liability to be partially offset by insurance recoveries from JLT's insurers and indemnification plans. 
As we typically do on our fourth quarter call, I will give a brief update on our global retirement plan. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $143 million in 2020 compared to $122 million in 2019. We expect cash contributions in 2021 will be roughly $124 million. For 2021, based on our current expectations, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will increase modestly year-over-year. 
Investment income was $25 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and was $11 million on an adjusted basis. For the full year 2020, our GAAP investment income was a loss of $22 million, and adjusted investment income was a gain of approximately $6 million. The differences between GAAP and adjusted primarily relate to mark-to-market adjustments on our remaining investment in Alexander IV, which we exclude from our adjusted results. For 2021, we expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis. 
Our effective adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 24% compared with 23.4% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2020, our adjusted tax rate was 24.4% as compared to 24.1% for the full year 2019. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted tax rate for the full year was approximately 25.3%. 
When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% to 26% for 2021. 
We made great progress in 2020 on our integration of JLT and have exceeded the key milestones we laid out when we announced the transaction. We incurred $70 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to date to $586 million. The remaining work to be done in 2021 consists primarily of ongoing technology application migrations and the further consolidation of real estate. 
Through year-end 2020, we have exceeded the estimated savings of $350 million. We now expect to achieve approximately $425 million of savings by the time the integration is completed in 2021. We expect to incur approximately $650 million of cash cost to generate these savings. In addition, we continue to expect approximately $75 million of noncash charges. 
We ended the year with $2.1 billion of cash due to the strength of our cash flow from operations and efforts made during the crisis to improve working cap. Our strong cash generation during the year enabled us to raise our dividend, complete a record level of acquisition activity at Marsh & McLennan Agency, and stay on pace with our deleveraging plan, with $1.5 billion of total debt repaid in the fourth quarter. Total debt at the end of the year was $11.3 billion, down from $12.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, reflecting the repayment of $700 million of senior notes, the prepayment of $300 million floating rate notes due in December 2021 and repayment of the remaining $500 million due on our term loan. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in July when $500 million of senior notes mature. 
Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $128 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $119 million of interest expense in the first quarter of 2021. 
In line with our prior commentary, we did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter of 2020. As we look to 2021, while uncertainty remains high, the combination of our available cash and expected cash generation positions us well for a year of significant capital deployment. Based on our outlook today, we currently expect to deploy approximately $3.5 billion of capital in 2021 across dividends, debt reduction, acquisitions and share repurchases. Due to our debt reduction in Q4, we expect only a modest amount of debt paydown in 2021, which will complete our deleveraging. 
We've consistently stated that we favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases as we do high-quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term. Our track record is good, as evidenced by our high-teens return on invested capital over the past 3 years. We expect to resume share repurchases in 2021, and the ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. 
Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled $365 million and included $124 million for acquisitions, and $241 million for dividends. For the full year of 2020, uses of cash totaled $1.8 billion and included $877 million for acquisitions and $943 million for dividend. 
In summary, we are proud of the resilience, courage and agility of our colleagues in a year that presented unique challenges. As we look forward to 2021, our outlook is for another year of strong performance. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

The difference between RIS and Consulting has more to do with what's happening in the global economy and macro factors, business confidence, obviously, as demonstrated this year. The RIS business is a bit more resilient with higher levels of recurring revenue than the Consulting business. But we're still hopeful actually that we will grow our Consulting business in 2021 in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman, and that's actually our plan. 
We do expect that there would be more strength from the second quarter onwards because the first quarter, you're basically comparing a pre-COVID world with a COVID world, and so there'll be some challenges within that. But we're -- we've got some pretty decent momentum that we built throughout the year, and so we're expecting a good year in 2021. As we mentioned on -- in the script, we expect to have margin expansion for the year, and we also expect to have solid adjusted EPS growth."

You guys did, like you said, a pretty good job of managing your expenses during the second and the third quarter. It sounds like there was a little bit more reinvestment, some stuff that got put off, I think you said, in the fourth quarter. So I guess the same question I was thinking about on the margin side. It sounds like maybe there could be some strain on the Q2 and the Q3 because those are pretty tough comps. But I guess that's one part of the question. 
And then the same thing, are you implying, Dan, since you said potentially growth in both Consulting and RIS, that both segments could see margin improvement in 2021?"

When we look at it, you say we did a pretty good job in the second quarter. My god, we rattled back expenses fast. Expense growth was down 5% in the second quarter, 4% in the third quarter. So I think it was a remarkable job, not impacting the business itself, continuing to invest in the business, but managing our expenses aggressively in setting a very high bar for what was required in the midst of a real crisis, a real global crisis. 
And so the fourth quarter represents, to us, of getting back, not quite to normal, but looking at pacing the way we normally would do. A little inside baseball in that we clearly -- we did a number of strategic hiring in the fourth quarter. We're actually up 500 -- or actually close to 500 headcount in the fourth quarter, and so we're positioned well for 2021. I'm not worried about quarter-by-quarter comparisons looking at 2021 versus 2020 because 2020 in a lot of ways in such a unique, bizarre type of year. 
So we're going to run our business the way we want to run our business as we usually do, where revenue growth exceeds expense growth in almost every quarter and certainly in every year, as it has done for the last 13 years. So I know that the entire firm was very interested in doing our best to turn the page on 2020 and focus on 2021. And in the fourth quarter, we started really focusing on what that would mean. So I think we're positioned to grow decently in both. And whether our margin goes up in both segments or not, I'm not going to really talk about right now. I mean our expectation is that we will grow margins. 
Now I mean are we going to grow margins to the extent that we did as an overall company in 2020? Well that would be a very [ tall ] ask, bearing in mind all the expenses that were pulled back in the second and third quarter."

I do think we will return to a more normal pattern to where we look at revenue growth in the 3% to 5% area. Our expense growth for a number of years, 4 out of the last 5 years before 2020 was average -- well not average, was actually 2% growth. So our expense growth, normally, would be around 2%, as it's been. Now some years might be 3%, some years might be 1%, but ultimately, I think that's the more normal pattern. We do see the opportunity of certain things that we've learned during this year or during the year 2020 to continue. 
Clearly, when you think about things like we're a business that's filled with knowledge workers and subject matter experts, so remote working is manageable for us. So our choice of returning to offices is just that, it's a choice. We think it's better for the business. We expect our offices -- physical offices to remain really the hub of activity in Marsh & McLennan. But having said that, we also think that over a period of a few years, that we would be able to reduce our footprint a bit, and that would actually benefit shareholders, but it would also benefit colleagues by making their lives a bit more flexible and a bit easier. So certainly, that's an area of having a more agile real estate footprint is an example. 
We also operated much faster and more connected during COVID than we did previously. And there's an efficiency gain with that, that we absolutely want to keep. I look at T&E. I think it's going to be a while before travel snaps back to the levels that we had in like 2019, and maybe it will be quite a while. I do expect people, once COVID clears and the crisis is over, to return to travel, to see markets and to see clients. But maybe we don't travel quite as much in packs like we used to. And maybe we won't jump on an airplane at a moment's notice. It could be more like, well, let's talk on Zoom because everybody is used to that now. So I do think that there is lasting efficiency gain which will benefit shareholders in the post-COVID world."

And areas like health and investments, retirement security are lasting and have resilience in and of themselves. 
Oliver Wyman's pop in the fourth quarter was a bit unexpected for us. And it gave us -- usually, as I've mentioned before, they tend to be a bit of our canary in the coal mine as the business confidence and the thoughts.

No, actually, we're pleased, as Dan said, about the new business activities that we've seen in the current challenging circumstances. And we look at what the world needs right now in terms of redefining the world of work, addressing health challenges. And also, we've seen quite a lot of demand in the investment solutions side of our portfolio, and we've closed the year at a record level of assets under management, that $357 billion. 
So I'd say health has been resilient through the crisis. We grew 2%, and we see bright spot there in terms of digital solutions demand for virtual care, mental health, for example, or workforce communication. As I said, Wealth, of course, we have the structural decline in the defined benefit, but that has slowed down a bit during 2020. And we've seen a lot of project work related to market volatility, so that could continue. But definitely, our investment solutions are very much in demand. 
And then for us, Career is our most discretionary project work business, in particular, on the service side of Career. But Careers usually rebound with the economy. And as Dan said in his remarks, we expect the economy to -- and the recovery to come back at least in part of H2 and therefore -- and we've seen -- we are seeing some strength in the current pipeline, and we've seen that in Q4. 
So all in all, I think our services are very relevant for the times. We're watching, of course, the agenda from the Biden administration, but we think that we are well positioned there. In particular, we are very strong in ESG, like diversity and inclusion, consulting and also on responsible investment and helping clients address the transition to a low-carbon economy. So I think as soon as the economy comes back, I think we should see a good rebound."

Sure, Dan and Mike. From an Oliver Wyman perspective, I mean, we had a very strong Q4, and we had strong business activity across most segments of the business and real particular strength in areas like financial services, health, the public sector and our actuarial and living cost businesses. 
And the type of business we were doing was really broad-based. And it ranged all the way from growth strategies and digital transformation to the other end of restructuring and bankruptcy. And I think, yes, the lesson I'm drawing from that is that there is lots to do out there as businesses recover after the pandemic and they rebuild, they grow, they evolve, transform. Oliver Wyman also tends to focus on big companies, which have performed relatively better than small companies over the last period. 
Looking into the new year, our new sales and the pipeline are also strong. But as said -- as you said in your question, clients are facing significant uncertainty as they hopefully manage through the last legs of the pandemic. But looking out to the whole year, I think the first quarter could be challenging. But beyond that, I feel really good about our business, our prospects and our ability to grow.

My expectation on the call for our third quarter was that, that expenses would uptick in the fourth quarter, but they would still be negative on a year-over-year basis. And actually, they're positive on a year-over-year basis. Our expenses grew 1.5% or 2% in the fourth quarter. And so it was a bit of a surprise. 
There's 2 factors underneath that. One, we didn't expect Oliver Wyman to grow in the fourth quarter, and Oliver Wyman grew. And as I've mentioned before, they have the most variable compensation model. And so when they're growing, that's when we build in more on terms of variable comps. So that was something that we did. And the hiring that we did in the fourth quarter on the strategic recruitment side was higher than what we expected. We see a lot of opportunities out there. And as I mentioned, we're up nearly 500 headcount on a net basis in the fourth quarter. So that was a little bit more. So those are the 2 factors that contributed to us having expenses. 
It's important to point out, neither of those factors in and of themselves are run rate. I mean certainly, with the strategic recruitment, we expect revenue over time as a result of building out our headcount as we've done for many years in a row. And so -- and the variable comp increase in OW, to me, is a good news story because it's attached to growth. And so I would love for that to continue because it would signify that we're growing the top line in Oliver Wyman."

What I would say, too, internationally, and at least in many markets, maybe not the U.K., maybe not the -- Australia or some other more developed markets. 
A lot of premium spend can be quite discretionary, right? And so -- and you have liability environments that are very, very different than the countries that I mentioned earlier. And so -- and we also saw less price and less rate increase in many of those markets as well. So I think, overall, I would expect less premium growth from an insurer perspective internationally than what we saw in the U.S., where, as you saw, we had very, very strong revenue growth this year.

And then within the offering, Meyer, there's different types. So we have assets, pension assets, and we have non-pension assets. And there's -- the client really decide on the asset mix, so the exposure to whether equity or bonds or private market. We think that actually the way that we deploy these assets, it's -- there's just mitigation of risk in itself because of the diversification of the portfolio.

And so when I look forward to next year -- or 2021 rather, I look at it and say, almost certainly, revenue is going to exceed expense growth as it has for the last 13 years. 
It may not be in every quarter, but certainly, that's how we run the business for a year. I think a lot of our expense pop in the fourth quarter was nonrun rate. I mean some of it was, but a lot of it wasn't. And so I look at it pretty simply. For 10 years prior to COVID, we grew underlying revenue between 3% to 5%, and we delivered an adjusted EPA -- EPS CAGR over that decade of close to 12%. So ultimately, that's what we were playing for. The idea is that as long we grow underlying revenue, we can run our business and the expense side of our business in a way to develop strong adjusted EPS growth.

U.S., U.K. and Australia are the most difficult markets, generally speaking, for our clients. Looking forward, I'm most concerned, again from our clients' perspective, about D&O pricing and excess liability pricing. The excess liability market really primarily here in the U.S., just a lot of ongoing discussion about growing claim frequency, growing claim severity, in part, again, driven by social inflation. But just broad concerns in the underwriting community about rate adequacy there. Work comp remains -- pricing remains down, on the other hand, and it's been down candidly a bit longer than I've been expecting but good for our clients. 
We are seeing some lines of business where the rate increase line kind of flattened out or began to moderate. And that's not to say that prices were down, but the average increase in the fourth quarter, like in our property book, for example, wasn't up as much as it was in the third quarter. So again, overall, from a client's point of view, I'm most concerned about D&O and excess liability pricing.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesse",1704,"Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. 
Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations.
Marsh McLennan had an outstanding start to 2021. Our first quarter results were excellent, and we are well positioned for a very good year. Even though the pandemic is ongoing, our underlying revenue growth of 6% is the highest in over 6 years and accelerated sequentially across every business. We also grew adjusted EPS by 21% and generated significant margin expansion.
Our business has proven resilient throughout the pandemic. And with the global economy now beginning to turn the corner, we saw an acceleration in our growth. With 6% underlying growth to begin the year, we now expect full year 2021 underlying revenue growth to be at the high end of our 3% to 5% guidance range and possibly above.
As we look ahead, the outlook for the U.S. and many of the countries we operate in is encouraging. However, many parts of the world continue to suffer with high levels of infection, and there is still a significant amount of uncertainty. GDP in the U.S. was close to flat in the first quarter and strong levels of growth are expected, starting in the second quarter, due to a rebound in demand as the impact of vaccines takes hold, along with favorable economic comparisons to a year ago.
Meanwhile, in India, Brazil and many other parts of the world, case counts continue to rise and broad levels of vaccination remain a long way off. Our proprietary pandemic navigator now forecasts that the U.S. will achieve the herd immunity threshold by early to mid-summer, and we see a fairly similar time line in the U.K.
These milestones bring hope for reopening and economic growth, although it will vary by country. We are also mindful that the risk exists and that there still are many unknowns, such as variance of the virus, the efficacy of vaccines on the variants, the duration of immunity and vaccine hesitancy. But we are resilient and are confident we will be able to adapt to a wide range of scenarios, just as we have since the beginning of this crisis. 
Our colleagues are our single largest competitive advantage. We have world-class talent that has delivered for clients and one another throughout the crisis. We continue to invest in hiring. We are an employer of choice for smart, hard-working, talented individuals and are adding to what is already the deepest talent pool in the industry. We are also pressing ahead with acquisitions. MMA made a significant acquisition on April 1, PayneWest. PayneWest was one of the largest independent agencies in the U.S. with more than 700 employees in 26 locations. The acquisition adds nicely to our geographic footprint in the middle market space and brings the Northwest hub.
Overall, we are on track for a very good year. Demand for our advice and solutions is strong, the economy is recovering, P&C insurance pricing remains firm, and we are benefiting from industry disruption. Although the outlook remains uncertain, we are more optimistic than we were when we started the year, and our efforts are focused on resurgence rather than recovery.
At the end of the first quarter, Marsh McLennan released our inaugural environmental, social and governance report. Truly great companies must deliver both exceptional financial performance and be good employers and global citizens, and we are working on many fronts to advance the interest of all of our stakeholders.
We believe that starts with transparency. Our report provides enhanced disclosure in a variety of ESG-related areas, from how we measure our own carbon footprint to how we use data to manage our workforce. For the first time, we provide gender, ethnic and racial diversity representation data at all levels of our organization and workforce maps that track talent flows and inform how and where we build and recruit talent.
Our report highlights our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace. In 2020, we launched our Leading The Change initiative to underscore the need to continuously nurture our inclusive culture and serve the fundamental principles of human dignity, equality, community and mutual respect.
We also strengthened our commitment to a better sustainable future through our pledge to be carbon-neutral this year, along with the commitment to reduce our carbon emissions by 15% by 2025. ESG issues are among the most critical challenges facing our clients today. We are creating solutions for our clients related to complex business issues, such as climate change, diversity and inclusion, affordable health care, cybersecurity and responsible investing. Marsh and Guy Carpenter are helping clients build resilience to flood risk and the documented increase in natural catastrophe perils witnessed in recent years. Marsh and Guy Carpenter's experience in the alternative energy space has sparked innovation and been a growth driver.
Marsh designed in place the first-of-its-kind policy for a European utility, which set lower upfront premium payments based on the clients' achievement of sustainability targets. Oliver Wyman is actively advising its clients across sectors, including banking, energy, industrials and transportation, imagining the risks and capturing the opportunities associated with climate change and then transition to a low-carbon economy through a new climate and sustainability practice.
Away from climate risk, Mercer is helping address the gender pay gap, diversity and inclusion in the workplace, the workforce of the future and consulting on new normal strategies in the wake of the pandemic. Overall, we see significant growth potential in the areas of ESG as well as an opportunity to benefit our clients, colleagues and communities.
Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. The first quarter marks the 14th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 18% year-over-year versus 22% in the fourth quarter. The pace of price increases moderated sequentially in the first quarter after accelerating for 11 straight quarters. However, the 18% increase is still one of the highest since we started publishing the index in 2012.
Global property insurance was 15%, and global financial and professional lines were up 40%, while global casualty rates were up 6% on average, and U.S. workers' compensation rates were modestly negative. Keep in mind, our index skews to large account business. However, U.S. small and middle market insurance pricing continues to rise as well, although the magnitude of price increases is less than for large complex accounts.
Turning to reinsurance. The Guy Carpenter's global property catastrophe rate online index increased just under 5% at the January 1 reinsurance renewals. For the April 1 renewals, Japanese property catastrophe pricing increased for the third year in a row, but at a more moderate pace versus prior years. Meanwhile, pricing and terms and conditions in the U.S. on April 1 business were largely a continuation of the January 1 pricing environment. Capacity is more than adequate and demand remains high. However, reinsurer's capacity remains constrained on all -- on certain lines of business, most notably for cyber risk.
Overall price increases continue to persist in both the P&C insurance and reinsurance markets, low interest rates, elevated loss activity and continued uncertainty related to the pandemic present challenges for underwriters. Times of uncertainty underscore the need for our advice and solutions, and we are working hard to help our clients navigate these challenges.
Now let me turn to our first quarter financial performance, which represents an excellent start to 2021. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.99, which is up 21% versus a year ago, driven by a combination of strong growth and the continuation of the suppressed environment for travel and entertainment expenses as we continue to operate largely remotely.
Total revenue increased 9% versus a year ago and rose 6% on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue grew 7% in RIS and 3% in Consulting. Marsh grew 8% in the quarter on an underlying basis, the highest quarterly underlying growth since 2003 and benefited from double-digit new business growth. Guy Carpenter grew 7% on an underlying basis in the quarter. Mercer underlying revenue was flat in the quarter, but showed sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. Oliver Wyman underlying revenue grew by 11% as demand accelerated.
Overall, this quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 20% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 260 basis points year-over-year, reflecting positive operating leverage and favorable expense comparison. As we look out for the remainder of 2021, we are well positioned given the strong demand for our advice and solutions and our expectation for an improving economic backdrop. As we mentioned, we now expect 2021 underlying revenue growth to be at the high end of our 3% to 5% range and possibly above. We also expect to generate margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS.
As we mentioned last quarter, 2021 represents the 150th anniversary of Marsh McLennan. As we look back on our storied history, one theme runs through it all. This company steps up in the moments that matter, at times of war and peace, in errors of transcending innovation, in serving the public good. 
In March, we changed our name from Marsh & McLennan Companies to Marsh McLennan. It was a small, but important change that better reflects the way that our company has come together. One company with 4 global businesses united by a shared purpose to make a difference in the moments that matter.
The challenges before us all are vast, it so are the possibilities, climate resilience, systemic risks, digital disruption, the protection gap, affordable health care, the future of work. As we face this new world together, one thing will never change, Marsh McLennan will be at our clients' side finding opportunity and navigating uncertainty in the areas of risk, strategy and people.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results."

Our first quarter results were outstanding, and we are well positioned for a very good 2021 despite the continued uncertainty associated with the pandemic.Underlying growth accelerated across all of our businesses, and",1378,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our first quarter results were outstanding, and we are well positioned for a very good 2021 despite the continued uncertainty associated with the pandemic.
Underlying growth accelerated across all of our businesses, and our margin expansion and earnings growth were impressive. Consolidated revenue increased 9% in the first quarter to $5.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 6%. Operating income and adjusted operating income were both approximately $1.4 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points to 29.6%, GAAP EPS was $1.91, and adjusted EPS was $1.99, up 21% compared with the first quarter a year ago.
Looking at Risk & Insurance Services. First quarter revenue was $3.2 billion, up 11% compared with the year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This marks the highest level of underlying growth since 2012. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $1.1 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 36.6%.
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, up 13% compared with a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. This was Marsh's highest level of underlying growth in nearly 2 decades. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and driven by double-digit new business growth and solid retention and was impressive considering Marsh's strong growth in the first quarter of last year.
The U.S. and Canada division delivered another exceptional quarter, with underlying revenue growth of 9%. This is the highest quarterly underlying growth U.S. and Canada has achieved since we began reporting their results, and they have now averaged 6% underlying growth over the last 12 quarters.
In international, underlying growth was strong at 6%, marking the highest underlying growth since 2013. EMEA was up 6%, with strong results in each region, including in the U.K. Asia Pacific was up 8%, a strong rebound from the fourth quarter and comes on top of 6% growth in the first quarter of 2020. And Latin America grew 6% on an underlying basis, continuing to show sequential improvement.
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $895 million, up 8% or 7% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in North America, EMEA, Global Specialties and Latin America Treaty. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 5% or higher underlying growth in 12 of the last 14 quarters.
In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 6% from a year ago or 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $370 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded by 330 basis points to 20.5%. 
At Mercer, revenue in the quarter was $1.3 billion, which was flat on an underlying basis. Mercer's top line performance improved each month in the first quarter, and we expect Mercer to return to underlying growth in the second quarter. Wealth increased 1% on an underlying basis, reflecting strong growth in investment management, offset by a modest decline in defined benefit. Our assets under delegated management grew to approximately $380 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 42% year-over-year or 6% sequentially, benefiting from net new inflows and market gains.
Health underlying revenue was flat in the quarter, but faced a tough comparison to 8% growth in the first quarter of last year, and Korea grew 1% on an underlying basis, reflecting strong sequential improvement. At Oliver Wyman, revenue in the quarter was $585 million, an increase of 11% on an underlying basis. First quarter results were a continuation of the momentum we started to see materializing in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted corporate expense was $57 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange added approximately $0.06 to our adjusted EPS. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a slight benefit in the second quarter, with limited impact thereafter.
Our other net benefit credit was $71 million in the quarter. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect our other net benefit credit will increase modestly year-over-year. Investment income was $11 million in the first quarter on a GAAP basis or $10 million on an adjusted basis and mainly reflects gains in our private equity portfolio.
Interest expense in the first quarter was $118 million compared to $127 million in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting lower debt levels in the period. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $114 million of interest expense in the second quarter.
Our effective adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 24.3% compared to 23.2% in the first quarter last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which would be accounting for share-based compensation similar to a year ago. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. 
When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2021.
Our current outlook for 2021 assumes the global economy returns to growth in the second quarter, with a strong recovery in the U.S. Based on this outlook and our strong first quarter performance, we now expect underlying revenue growth to be at the high end of our 3% to 5% underlying growth guidance and possibly above. We currently expect we will deliver margin expansion for the full year. But as you think through the quarterly cadence, keep in mind we have tough expense comparisons in the second and third quarters.
This view is based on our outlook today, and it goes without saying that conditions could turn out materially different than our assumptions, which would affect our projection.
Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. So far this year, we have completed our JLT-related deleveraging, enhanced our short-term liquidity flexibility and seen S&P, Moody's and Fitch view our rating outlook is stable. We ended the quarter with $11.3 billion of total debt, which was consistent with the level at December 31.
In April, we repaid $500 million of senior notes scheduled to mature in July, taking advantage of a prepayment option. This repayment brought our debt down to $10.8 billion and completed our planned deleveraging, marking an important milestone for us.
Our next scheduled debt maturity is in January of 2022 when $500 million of senior notes will mature. Earlier this month, we entered into a new 5-year revolving credit agreement. Under this new facility, we increased the credit available to $2.8 billion from $1.8 billion. In addition, we increased the size of our commercial paper program and now have capacity to issue $2 billion, up from $1.5 billion previously. We view these changes as prudent steps that enhance our liquidity profile and provide additional flexibility.
In the first quarter, we resumed share repurchases, reflecting our strong financial position and outlook for cash generation. We repurchased 1 million shares of our stock for $112 million. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $3.5 billion of capital in 2021 across dividends, debt reduction, acquisitions and share repurchase. The ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops.
As we've consistently said, we favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases, as we view high-quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term. Now that our deleveraging is behind us, we are back to our normal focus for capital management.
Our capital management strategy reflects balance and supports our consistent focus on delivering solid performance in the near term, while investing for sustained growth over the long term. For the capital we generate and target to deploy, we prioritize reinvestment in the business, both through organic investments and acquisitions. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generate meaningful returns for investors over time. And each year, we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count.
Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1.1 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $392 million and included $237 million for dividends, $112 million for share repurchases and $43 million for acquisitions.
Overall, we had an outstanding first quarter, positioning us well to deliver strong growth in both underlying revenue and adjusted earnings in 2021. 
And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

So if I understood correctly, then I think it implies that there might be some deceleration in parts of the business in later quarters. So maybe just kind of curious, were there any kind of onetime items in nature? Or things we should be thinking about in the back half of the year that could show less positive momentum?"

So why don't I take that to begin with, and then I'll hand off to each of our business leaders, so they can talk a little bit about their growth prospects and how they looked at the quarter and what they're looking at going forward.
I would just start by saying we've got real momentum right now. I mean the U.S. economy is getting stronger. The JLT integration is well behind us, and the combined organization is emerging from the pandemic strong, focused and on our front foot.
New business generation was terrific across the business and in particular, at Marsh and Oliver Wyman. So when Scott and John speak, they can talk to you a little bit about their new business.
But overall, retention was strong, growth was broad-based. On the RIS side, pricing is a tailwind, and we are benefiting from some disruption and flight to quality. That said, Mike, there is nothing one-off or unusual about our results. So we're not really going to get into, in coming quarters, do we expect a deceleration? 
Obviously, as Mark was saying, we start to get some easier comps on the top line and some tougher comps on the expense line, but it will play itself out, and we expect to have a very strong year. But why don't we start with Marsh, and John to just talk about growth a little bit. John?"

We know that during the pandemic, clients have postponed discretionary work due to uncertainty and also employment levels have dropped.
But now we expect tailwinds from economic and job growth partially offset, of course, by the continued structural decline in the client benefit. But clearly, we see a return to growth for the rest of the year, starting with Q2.
In terms of demands, our investment business, investment management business, in particular, with lots of demand in the alternative space, And ESG and ENI seemed investment opportunities is strong. We started the year with strong inflow. Demand for digital solutions around the whole of business is also strong. Health has been resilient through the pandemic, and we see lots of demand in our Darwin health platform and global benefit management.

I think though, Mike, given the volatility in our business, it's just important to maintain a long-term perspective. And we continue to be able to think we can grow the business at mid- to high single digits over the long term.

And obviously, an uneven economy for so many of our clients. And so our clients, of course, are adapting to that. Some in this market and certainly throughout 2020. We're choosing to retain some more risks, whether it's through higher retentions or lower limits.
Our captive management business is experiencing pretty strong growth as well as an indicator of maybe how our clients are reacting to the market. But it's still a difficult market. The D&O market, the excess casualty market in the U.S. and the cyber markets remain the most challenging.
On the other hand, the work comp pricing continues to be pretty favorable for our clients and was modestly down. Pricing was modestly down in that product area here in the United States. So the underwriting community is clearly concerned about elevated cat activity was obviously a busy cat quarter in the United States in the first quarter. They're worried about loss cost inflation, lower interest rates, But my expectation is that we'll continue to see some moderation of price increases throughout the rest of the year. Again, I expect prices to be up year-over-year, but I do expect them to be up somewhat less than they've been up in recent quarters."

So at least many companies, including Marsh McLennan reduced expenses significantly, particularly in the second and third quarter. And as you know, last year, we started coming back. It had positive expense growth in the fourth quarter because we did some hiring and that sort of thing. 
The largest reductions were in T&E and our view is that will be a gradual comeback And we believe people will travel with more purpose and more for thought than pre-pandemic, and we're certainly going to encourage that within the company. We're going to try to get away from the -- anytime anywhere, hop on an airplane culture and pause and say, okay, there are important times where you go visit a client or you go visit a market. That's absolutely to be sure.
But we have proven that we can operate effectively and remotely. And so we want to create that a little bit of pause and say, ""Can I do this?"" via a remote access like a Zoom or Teams, et cetera. And so it also is important for us in terms of as we manage our carbon footprint going forward, and it's important for other companies, I think, to act in a similar fashion. So now one thing that let's not to lose sight of, even though there may be some pressure as some expenses start to come back, as we go through the year. That's actually good news. That means that the world is recovering, the economy is recovering at means business is getting back to normal, that has growth implications for us.
And longer term, we've learned a lot during this pandemic period, and we believe we can be a leaner, more agile organization. And that has implications. That means that while the office is core to our culture, and is a central part of how we operate, we know we can operate with more flexibility and more agility than we have done in the past. And longer term, that has implications for our real estate expense, which are quite heavy. And so I would expect that we'll be able to get some savings there over time.

We've been at it for 150 years, and we have been acquiring firms for that entire period of time. Let's not forget Henry Marsh and Donald McLennan came together and formed Marsh & McLennan.

We cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. We almost always for our important acquisitions are in exclusive discussions with the other company.

Now having said that, there are plenty of very good, high-quality firms that we're in discussions with.

So we feel very good about our ability to continue to add to the strength.
And I would just use that as a backdrop to growth in general. Like we generally feel that underlying growth is the most important measure to evaluate the health of the overall organization. So our focus is generally on underlying growth. But every once in a while, you have to look at GAAP. What's the company doing on an overall basis? And if I just look at RIS, as an example, first quarter last year, we grew a very big organization on a GAAP basis, 20%, and followed up in this first quarter by an 11% on top of the 20% on a GAAP basis. We are significantly growing the organization. And on the Consulting side, it was more like a 5 on GAAP last year, followed by a 6 this year on GAAP. So we're having good underlying performance, but we're also having a much larger organization and growing a much larger organization.

Ultimately, when we look at deals, as I mentioned before, we're not chasing any deals. Your conclusion that multiples have gone up over the last number of years is absolutely true. Multiples are higher, which means we should be more selective. And it means that we should understand the pro forma calculations in a deep way, because most of these organizations are private.
So the pro forma results are far different than the actual results over the previous years and there can be a disconnect in terms of what expectations are versus the reality of a performing business. Now our goal is actually to buy high-quality firms. That's our primary goal. Firms have matched our culture, where there's good chemistry, where the leader's plan to stay in the business and keep growing the business. And there are a number. It's still a very fragmented market, and there are a number of small to midsized companies in which we're able to speak with who really recognize the value of Marsh McLennan. 
I mean we can demonstrate the companies, the amount of additional mega producers that are developed post-acquisition by Marsh McLennan and existed pre-acquisition. So joining Marsh McLennan is good for the production force of these companies. And that is a -- that's our unique selling proposition. The capabilities and resources of the organization broadly enable producers to be more successful than they otherwise would be.

As we've shared in the past, this is -- our index skews to large accounts. The middle market pricing is more modest than that.
I think the most notable quarter-to-quarter change was in cyber, where the average price increase actually doubled from the fourth quarter into the first quarter from high teens to mid-30s.

Thank you, Dan. Meyer, if we look through the rest of the year and obviously, June, what is the next big renewal date, I think we have to separate Florida from the rest of the -- of our portfolio because it's a different animal in a lot of different ways, not only from a regulatory environment, not only from a capital environment, not only from a capacity environment, not only from a legal environment.
So as we look out into the rest of the year, we anticipate that for the broad percentage of our portfolio that pricing will remain consistent. Again, as I just said, it is based on individual client exposure and experience.
Florida, obviously, has gone through quite a turbulent time not only from a loss standpoint, but an underlying erosion of capital due to heightened litigation. What that's resulted in is demand is actually going to be less because people are re-underwriting their books of business. to deal with some of the spikes and exposure that they have. 
But all I'd say there's more than enough capacity in Florida. And for the non-frequency layers and more capacity layers, there'll be plenty of capacity. And for the lower down, higher risk layers, pricing will go up. We're still unsure as to what the dimensions are. We're expecting mid- to high single digits for loss experience, loss experience. And it's still wait-and-see.
But a lot of the capital in Florida comes from third-party capital, unlike the rest of our portfolio save for our retrocessional business."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations.
Marsh McLennan had an outstanding start to 2021. Our first quarter results were excellent, and we are well positioned for a very good year. Even though the pandemic is ongoing, our underlying revenue growth of 6% is the highest in over 6 years and accelerated sequentially across every business. We also grew adjusted EPS by 21% and generated significant margin expansion.
Our business has proven resilient throughout the pandemic. And with the global economy now beginning to turn the corner, we saw an acceleration in our growth. With 6% underlying growth to begin the year, we now expect full year 2021 underlying revenue growth to be at the high end of our 3% to 5% guidance range and possibly above. 
As we look ahead, the outlook for the U.S. and many of the countries we operate in is encouraging. However, many parts of the world continue to suffer with high levels of infection, and there is still a significant amount of uncertainty. GDP in the U.S. was close to flat in the first quarter and strong levels of growth are expected, starting in the second quarter, due to a rebound in demand as the impact of vaccines takes hold, along with favorable economic comparisons to a year ago.
Meanwhile, in India, Brazil and many other parts of the world, case counts continue to rise and broad levels of vaccination remain a long way off. Our proprietary pandemic navigator now forecasts that the U.S. will achieve the herd immunity threshold by early to mid-summer, and we see a fairly similar time line in the U.K.
These milestones bring hope for reopening and economic growth, although it will vary by country. We are also mindful that the risk exists and that there still are many unknowns, such as variance of the virus, the efficacy of vaccines on the variants, the duration of immunity and vaccine hesitancy. But we are resilient and are confident we will be able to adapt to a wide range of scenarios, just as we have since the beginning of this crisis.
Our colleagues are our single-largest competitive advantage. We have world-class talent that has delivered for clients and one another throughout the crisis. We continue to invest in hiring. We are an employer of choice for smart, hard-working, talented individuals and are adding to what is already the deepest talent pool in the industry. We are also pressing ahead with acquisitions. MMA made a significant acquisition on April 1, PayneWest. PayneWest was one of the largest independent agencies in the U.S., with more than 700 employees in 26 locations. The acquisition adds nicely to our geographic footprint in the middle market space and brings the northwest hub.
Overall, we are on track for a very good year. Demand for our advice and solutions is strong, the economy is recovering, P&C insurance pricing remains firm, and we are benefiting from industry disruption. Although the outlook remains uncertain, we are more optimistic than we were when we started the year, and our efforts are focused on resurgence rather than recovery.
At the end of the first quarter, Marsh McLennan released our inaugural environmental, social and governance report. Truly, great companies must deliver both exceptional financial performance and be good employers and global citizens, and we are working on many fronts to advance the interest of all of our stakeholders. We believe that starts with transparency. Our report provides enhanced disclosure in a variety of ESG-related areas, from how we measure our own carbon footprint to how we use data to manage our workforce. For the first time, we provide gender, ethnic and racial diversity representation data at all levels of our organization and workforce maps that track talent flows and inform how and where we build and recruit talent.
Our report highlights our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace. In 2020, we launched our ""Leading the Change"" initiative to underscore the need to continuously nurture our inclusive culture and serve the fundamental principles of human dignity, equality, community and mutual respect. We also strengthened our commitment to a better sustainable future through our pledge to be carbon-neutral this year, along with the commitment to reduce our carbon emissions by 15% by 2025. 
ESG issues are among the most critical challenges facing our clients today. We are creating solutions for our clients related to complex business issues, such as climate change, diversity and inclusion, affordable health care, cybersecurity and responsible investing. Marsh and Guy Carpenter are helping clients build resilience to flood risk and the documented increase in natural catastrophe perils witnessed in recent years. Marsh and Guy Carpenter's experience in the alternative energy space has sparked innovation and been a growth driver.
Marsh designed in place the first-of-its-kind policy for a European utility, which set lower upfront premium payments based on the clients' achievement of sustainability targets. Oliver Wyman is actively advising its clients across sectors, including banking, energy, industrials and transportation, imagining the risks and capturing the opportunities associated with climate change and then transition to a low-carbon economy through a new climate and sustainability practice. Away from climate risk, Mercer is helping address the gender pay gap, diversity and inclusion in the workplace, the workforce of the future and consulting on new normal strategies in the wake of the pandemic. Overall, we see significant growth potential in the areas of ESG as well as an opportunity to benefit our clients, colleagues and communities.
Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. The first quarter marks the 14th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 18% year-over-year versus 22% in the fourth quarter. The pace of price increases moderated sequentially in the first quarter after accelerating for 11 straight quarters. However, the 18% increase is still one of the highest since we started publishing the index in 2012.
Global property insurance was up 15%. And global financial and professional lines were up 40%, while global casualty rates were up 6% on average. And U.S. workers' compensation rates were modestly negative. Keep in mind, our index skews to large account business. However, U.S. small and middle market insurance pricing continues to rise as well, although the magnitude of price increases is less than for large complex accounts.
Turning to reinsurance. The Guy Carpenter's Global Property Catastrophe Rate-on-line Index increased just under 5% at the January 1 reinsurance renewals. For the April 1 renewals, Japanese property catastrophe pricing increased for the third year in a row, but at a more moderate pace versus prior years. Meanwhile, pricing and terms and conditions in the U.S. on April 1 business were largely a continuation of the January 1 pricing environment. Capacity is more than adequate and demand remains high. However, reinsurer's capacity remains constrained on all -- on certain lines of business, most notably for cyber risk. 
Overall price increases continue to persist in both the P&C insurance and reinsurance markets. Low interest rates, elevated loss activity and continued uncertainty related to the pandemic present challenges for underwriters. Times of uncertainty underscore the need for our advice and solutions, and we are working hard to help our clients navigate these challenges.
Now let me turn to our first quarter financial performance, which represents an excellent start to 2021. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.99, which is up 21% versus a year ago, driven by a combination of strong growth and the continuation of the suppressed environment for travel and entertainment expenses as we continue to operate largely remotely. 
Total revenue increased 9% versus a year ago and rose 6% on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue grew 7% in RIS and 3% in Consulting. Marsh grew 8% in the quarter on an underlying basis, the highest quarterly underlying growth since 2003 and benefited from double-digit new business growth. Guy Carpenter grew 7% on an underlying basis in the quarter. Mercer underlying revenue was flat in the quarter, but showed sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. Oliver Wyman underlying revenue grew by 11% as demand accelerated. 
Overall, this quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 20%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 260 basis points year-over-year, reflecting positive operating leverage and favorable expense comparison. As we look out for the remainder of 2021, we are well positioned given the strong demand for our advice and solutions and our expectation for an improving economic backdrop. As we mentioned, we now expect 2021 underlying revenue growth to be at the high end of our 3% to 5% range and possibly above. We also expect to generate margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. 
As we mentioned last quarter, 2021 represents the 150th anniversary of Marsh McLennan. As we look back on our storied history, one theme runs through it all. This company steps up in the moments that matter, at times of war and peace, in areas of transcending innovation, in serving the public good. In March, we changed our name from Marsh & McLennan Companies to Marsh McLennan. It was a small but important change that better reflects the way that our company has come together. One company with 4 global businesses united by a shared purpose to make a difference in the moments that matter.
The challenges before us all are vast and so are the possibilities: climate resilience, systemic risks, digital disruption, the protection gap, affordable health care, the future of work. As we face this new world together, one thing will never change, Marsh McLennan will be at our clients' side finding opportunity and navigating uncertainty in the areas of risk, strategy and people. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results."

Our first quarter results were outstanding, and we are well positioned for a very good 2021 despite the continued uncertainty associated with the pandemic. Underlying growth accelerated across all of our businesses, and our margin expansion and earnings growth were impressive. Consolidated revenue increased 9% in the first quarter to $5.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 6%. Operating income and adjusted operating income were both approximately $1.4 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points to 29.6%. GAAP EPS was $1.91, and adjusted EPS was $1.99, up 21% compared with the first quarter a year ago.
Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $3.2 billion, up 11% compared with the year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This marks the highest level of underlying growth since 2012. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $1.1 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 36.6%.
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, up 13% compared with a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. This was Marsh's highest level of underlying growth in nearly 2 decades. Growth in the quarter was broad based and driven by double-digit new business growth and solid retention and was impressive considering Marsh's strong growth in the first quarter of last year. The U.S. and Canada division delivered another exceptional quarter, with underlying revenue growth of 9%. This is the highest quarterly underlying growth U.S. and Canada has achieved since we began reporting their results, and they have now averaged 6% underlying growth over the last 12 quarters. In international, underlying growth was strong at 6%, marking the highest underlying growth since 2013. EMEA was up 6%, with strong results in each region, including in the U.K. Asia Pacific was up 8%, a strong rebound from the fourth quarter and comes on top of 6% growth in the first quarter of 2020. And Latin America grew 6% on an underlying basis, continuing to show sequential improvement. 
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $895 million, up 8% or 7% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in North America, EMEA, Global Specialties and Latin America Treaty. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 5% or higher underlying growth in 12 of the last 14 quarters. In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 6% from a year ago or 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $370 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded by 330 basis points to 20.5%.
At Mercer, revenue in the quarter was $1.3 billion, which was flat on an underlying basis. Mercer's top line performance improved each month in the first quarter, and we expect Mercer to return to underlying growth in the second quarter. Wealth increased 1% on an underlying basis, reflecting strong growth in investment management, offset by a modest decline in defined benefit. Our assets under delegated management grew to approximately $380 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 42% year-over-year or 6% sequentially, benefiting from net new inflows and market gains. 
Health underlying revenue was flat in the quarter, but faced a tough comparison to 8% growth in the first quarter of last year. And Korea grew 1% on an underlying basis reflecting strong sequential improvement. At Oliver Wyman, revenue in the quarter was $585 million, an increase of 11% on an underlying basis. First quarter results were a continuation of the momentum we started to see materializing in the fourth quarter. Adjusted corporate expense was $57 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange added approximately $0.06 to our adjusted EPS. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a slight benefit in the second quarter, with limited impact thereafter.
Our other net benefit credit was $71 million in the quarter. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect our other net benefit credit will increase modestly year-over-year. Investment income was $11 million in the first quarter on a GAAP basis or $10 million on an adjusted basis and mainly reflects gains in our private equity portfolio. Interest expense in the first quarter was $118 million compared to $127 million in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting lower debt levels in the period. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $114 million of interest expense in the second quarter. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 24.3% compared to 23.2% in the first quarter last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which would be accounting for share-based compensation similar to a year ago. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%.  
When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2021. Our current outlook for 2021 assumes the global economy returns to growth in the second quarter, with a strong recovery in the U.S. Based on this outlook and our strong first quarter performance, we now expect underlying revenue growth to be at the high end of our 3% to 5% underlying growth guidance and possibly above. We currently expect we will deliver margin expansion for the full year. But as you think through the quarterly cadence, keep in mind we have tough expense comparisons in the second and third quarters. This view is based on our outlook today, and it goes without saying that conditions could turn out materially different than our assumptions, which would affect our projection.
Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. So far this year, we have completed our JLT-related deleveraging, enhanced our short-term liquidity flexibility and seen S&P, Moody's and Fitch restore our rating outlook to stable. We ended the quarter with $11.3 billion of total debt, which was consistent with the level at December 31. In April, we repaid $500 million of senior notes scheduled to mature in July, taking advantage of a prepayment option. This repayment brought our debt down to $10.8 billion and completed our planned deleveraging, marking an important milestone for us.
Our next scheduled debt maturity is in January of 2022 when $500 million of senior notes will mature. Earlier this month, we entered into a new 5-year revolving credit agreement. Under this new facility, we increased the credit available to $2.8 billion from $1.8 billion. In addition, we increased the size of our commercial paper program and now have capacity to issue $2 billion, up from $1.5 billion previously. We view these changes as prudent steps that enhance our liquidity profile and provide additional flexibility.
In the first quarter, we resumed share repurchases, reflecting our strong financial position and outlook for cash generation. We repurchased 1 million shares of our stock for $112 million. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $3.5 billion of capital in 2021 across dividends, debt reduction, acquisitions and share repurchase. The ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As we've consistently said, we favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases, as we view high-quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term. 
Now that our deleveraging is behind us, we are back to our normal focus for capital management. Our capital management strategy reflects balance and supports our consistent focus on delivering solid performance in the near term, while investing for sustained growth over the long term. For the capital we generate and target to deploy, we prioritize reinvestment in the business, both through organic investments and acquisitions. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generate meaningful returns for investors over time, and each year, we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count. 
Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1.1 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $392 million and included $237 million for dividends, $112 million for share repurchases and $43 million for acquisitions. Overall, we had an outstanding first quarter, positioning us well to deliver strong growth in both underlying revenue and adjusted earnings in 2021.
And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

We're very, very focused in what is still a very difficult market for our clients, but I think we're positioned well. And as Dan noted, the economy is picking up in some important markets for us. There's still obviously some uncertainty as Dan and Mark both annotated in the macros, but I'm very, very pleased with the start to the year."

Now Q3 and 4 tend to be very small quarters for us. So there's more volatility inherent in them.

We know that during the pandemic, clients have postponed discretionary work due to uncertainty and also employment levels have dropped. But now we expect tailwinds from economic and job growth, partially offset, of course, by the continued structural decline in the client benefit, but clearly, we see a return to growth for the rest of the year starting with Q2.
In terms of demands, our investment business, investment management business, in particular, with lots of demand in the alternative space, and ESG and ENI seem investment opportunities is strong. We started the year with strong inflow. Demand for digital solutions around the whole of business is also strong. Health has been resilient through the pandemic, and we see lots of demand in our Darwin health platform and global benefit management. And we've seen quite a good uptick in Korea as well with demand for engagement surveys, transformation of the workplace, return to a new normal, a redefinition of the way to work.

I think, though, Mike, given the volatility in our business, it's just important to maintain a long-term perspective. And we continue to be able to think we can grow the business at mid- to high single digits over the long term. In the shorter term, with the current robust demand, the strong new sales, combined with the weaker performance from last year, we may exceed that long-term target in any quarter and possibly for the year, overall."

So as Dan noted, it's still a very, very difficult market for our clients in, obviously, an uneven economy for so many of our clients. And so our clients, of course, are adapting to that. Some in this market and certainly throughout 2020, we're choosing to retain some more risks, whether it's through higher retentions or lower limits. Our captive management business is experiencing pretty strong growth as well as an indicator of maybe how our clients are reacting to the market. But it's still a difficult market. The D&O market, the excess casualty market in the U.S. and the cyber markets remain the most challenging.
On the other hand, the work comp pricing continues to be pretty favorable for our clients and was modestly down, pricing was modestly down in that product area, here, in the United States. So the underwriting community is clearly concerned about elevated cat activity. It was obviously a busy cat quarter in the United States in the first quarter. They're worried about loss cost inflation, lower interest rates. But my expectation is that we'll continue to see some moderation of price increases throughout the rest of the year. Again, I expect prices to be up year-over-year, but I do expect them to be up somewhat less than they have been up in recent quarters."

So at least many companies, including Marsh McLennan reduced expenses significantly, particularly in the second and third quarter. And as you know, last year, we started coming back. It had positive expense growth in the fourth quarter because we did some hiring and that sort of thing. The largest reductions were in T&E, and our view is that will be a gradual comeback. We believe people will travel with more purpose and more forethought than pre-pandemic, and we're certainly going to encourage that within the company. We're going to try to get away from the ""anytime, anywhere, hop on an airplane culture"" and pause and say, ""Okay. There are important times where you go visit a client or you go visit a market. That's absolutely to be sure."" But we have proven that we can operate effectively remotely. And so we want to create that a little bit of pause and say, ""Can I do this via a remote access like a Zoom or Teams, et cetera."" And so it also is important for us in terms of as we manage our carbon footprint going forward, and it's important for other companies, I think, to act in a similar fashion. 
So now one thing -- let's not lose sight of, even though there may be some pressure as some expenses start to come back, as we go through the year. That's actually good news. That means that the world is recovering. The economy is recovering. That means business is getting back to normal, that has growth implications for us. And longer term, we've learned a lot during this pandemic period, and we believe we can be a leaner, more agile organization. And that has implications. That means that while the office is core to our culture and is a central part of how we operate, we know we can operate with more flexibility and more agility than we have done in the past. And longer term, that has implications for our real estate expense, which are quite heavy. And so I would expect that we'll be able to get some savings there over time.

So we feel very good about our ability to continue to add to the strength. And I would just use that as a backdrop to growth in general. Like, we generally feel that underlying growth is the most important measure to evaluate the health of the overall organization. So our focus is generally on underlying growth. 
But every once in a while, you have to look at GAAP. What's the company doing on an overall basis? And if I just look at RIS, as an example, first quarter last year, we grew a very big organization on a GAAP basis, 20%, and followed up in this first quarter by an 11% on top of the 20% on a GAAP basis. We are significantly growing the organization. And on the consulting side, it was more like a 5% on GAAP last year, followed by a 6% this year on GAAP. So we're having good underlying performance, but we're also having a much larger organization and growing a much larger organization.

Ultimately, when we look at deals, as I mentioned before, we're not chasing any deals. Your conclusion that multiples have gone up over the last number of years is absolutely true. Multiples are higher, which means we should be more selective. And it means that we should understand the pro forma calculations in a deep way. Because most of these organizations are private so the pro forma results are far different than the actual results over the previous years and there can be a disconnect in terms of what expectations are versus the reality of a performing business. 
Now our goal is actually to buy high-quality firms. That's our primary goal. Firms that match our culture, whether it's good chemistry, whether the leader has planned to stay in the business and keep growing the business, and there are a number. It's still a very fragmented market, and there are a number of small-to-midsized companies in which we're able to speak with who really recognize the value of Marsh McLennan.

The capabilities and resources of the organization broadly enable producers to be more successful than they otherwise would be. But John, do you want to talk about rating environment? And what's been moving around the most? Yes, I think it's pretty high level, and then we can move on to Peter on that."

Sure, Dan. Jimmy, I covered it before. What I would say is that in most geographies and in most major product lines, there was a slight moderation in the average price increase in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter.
It was pretty consistent, I would say, is probably the most notable thing when you look at it on a line-by-line basis and country-by-country basis. So prices, on average, again, went from 22% to 18%. As we've shared in the past, this is -- our index skews to large accounts. The middle market pricing is more modest than that.
I think the most notable quarter-to-quarter change was in cyber, where the average price increase actually doubled from the fourth quarter into the first quarter from high teens to mid-30s. And so -- and as you might expect, given the exposure environment there, our cyber sales are growing quite rapidly at the moment."

And so prices, I wouldn't say, have gone down. I'd say prices have moderated, but that's based on capacity, but it's a function of exposure and experience by client. It is not a broad-based, across-the-board rate increase for everybody regardless of how you performed."

We were always working to move our other operating expenses down. 
To me, the glory would be a nice, solid, chunky comp and ben ratio and a much lower other operating expense ratio. That's the kind of thing over time that we want to do. And we have all kinds of initiatives in the firm to try to reduce other operating expenses as a way to deliver better margin, but also to deliver better comp and ben ratios as well. And as you know, comp and ben ratios were up in the quarter. And so that to me is a pretty good thing. Other operating expense is down, comp and ben flat or up.

Thank you, Dan.

So as we look out into the rest of the year, we anticipate that for the broad percentage of our portfolio that pricing will remain consistent. Again, as I just said, it is based on individual client exposure and experience.
Florida, obviously, has gone through quite a turbulent time, not only from a loss standpoint but an underlying erosion of capital due to heightened litigation. What that's resulted in is demand is actually going to be less because people are re-underwriting their books of business to deal with some of the spikes and exposure that they have. But overall, I'd say there's more than enough capacity in Florida. And for the non-frequency layers and more capacity layers, there will be plenty of capacity. And for the lower-down, higher-risk layers, pricing will go up. We're still unsure as to what the dimensions are. We're expecting mid- to high single digits for loss experience, high loss experience, and it's still wait-and-see. But a lot of the capital in Florida comes from third-party capital, unlike the rest of our portfolio, say, for our retrocessional business."

I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick [indiscernible] Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. 
I'd like to welcome Nick who became CEO of Oliver Wyman in July 1. Nick has led many of Oliver Wyman's major practices in his 23 years with the business, and I look forward to seeing as Oliver Wyman continue to grow and thrive under his leadership.  On behalf of the executive committee, I also want to thank Scott McDonald for his many contributions during his distinguished 26-year career at the firm. 
Marsh McLennan had an outstanding second quarter. We are well positioned in benefiting from the abundance of opportunities. We are stronger and have broader capabilities post the JLT acquisition. We are benefiting from what may be the strongest economic rebound for nearly 4 decades, led by our largest region, the U.S. 
There is high demand for our advice and solutions in this time of uncertainty and in the face of challenging market conditions. We are seeing a flight to quality and stability, which is contributing to high levels of new business growth and client retention and is helping us to attract talent. And there is a long runway for growth as we think about major protection gaps around the world, new emerging risks, digitization, workforce of the future and underpenetrated markets such as small commercial. 
We are focused on capitalizing on these opportunities, and I am proud of our execution in the quarter. We generated record second quarter revenue and earnings, the best underlying growth of any quarter in 2 decades, and we are poised for an excellent year. The strength of our results was broad-based with each of our businesses and virtually all of our major geographies seeing an acceleration in growth. Our adjusted EPS increased by an impressive 33%, and we generated margin expansion despite challenging expense comparisons. 
As we look ahead, the economic outlook for the U.S. and most of the major countries we operate in is encouraging. However, the pandemic is not over yet. Vaccine hesitancy creates risk and there are many parts of the world where vaccine availability is limited. As a result, much of the world is experiencing another wave of the pandemic with rising case counts due to the spread of variants. In addition, the shape of this economic recovery is very different from any we have seen before. Some industries are thriving, while others are being impacted by supply chain disruption, inventory issues and labor shortages. 
Navigating this dynamic landscape is challenging, even confounding for some businesses. The growth opportunity for Marsh McLennan is significant during this time of uncertainty and recovery. We are aiding and guiding our clients through the complexities of the new normal as well as helping them tackle issues like climate risk, cyber, diversity and inclusion, employee safety and well-being and workforce disruption. 
Our ability to provide differentiated high-quality solutions to our clients rest on our talent and expertise. Our colleagues are our #1 competitive advantage. And with the potential for industry consolidation, we see a meaningful opportunity to invest in hiring and deepen our world-class talent pool. 
We have strong momentum. And as we mentioned last quarter, our efforts are focused on resurgence and expansion. Let me provide some examples of how we are helping our clients address complex issues of the day, specifically 2 major challenges: cybersecurity and climate change. 
Cybersecurity is one of the greatest risks facing society. Supply chain and ransomware attacks continue to rise with a number of recent high-profile attacks affecting organizations across all sectors and segments from technology to critical infrastructure and health care. Marsh & McLennan is helping clients manage cyber risk. Increasingly, we are bringing our businesses together to leverage all of our expertise, data and relationships with public and private partners to help clients become more resilient. Our growth in participation in cyber extends well beyond the placement of insurance,  under the leadership of Tom Doyle, we are leveraging the collective capabilities of Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman to bring cyber solutions from across our enterprise to clients. Not only are we helping clients with risk transfer throughout our insurance businesses, but through our cyber risk assessment tools, we help clients measure and quantify their cyber risk exposure to better inform decisions about cybersecurity, risk mitigation and transfer strategies. 
We also  help clients with incident response before, during and after events as well as part of our broader efforts to outlines build resilience in the face of a constantly evolving threat landscape. 
A second defining challenge of our time is climate change. Climate and the broader topic of ESG are complex multidimensional challenges, virtually all companies face. The threats to the changing time may present obvious questions for companies touching everything from strategy to resilience to their workforce and how they communicate. Even if climate change is a long-term threat, the issue is proximate and has immediate consequences as firms deal with calls for action, strategies to respond and more input from various stakeholders. 
Led by Nick Studer, we are bringing together our businesses to help our clients anticipate climate risks and opportunities. For example, Oliver Wyman is working with our insurance businesses to support clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy and manage climate risk. We are assisting clients with the development of carbon-light business models and to derisk investment in sustainable technologies. At Marsh and Guy Carpenter, we are helping to develop innovative climate solutions to bridge protection gaps. 
We assist clients with stress testing models outline the impact of climate change and providing risk management and insurance services to protect against climate impacts. And Mercer's responsible investment business helps steward the fiduciaries of investment pools understand how a change in climate could impact investment returns in the future and anticipate them today. 
Overall, we are uniquely positioned to help our clients with their most pressing challenges. Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. The second quarter marks the 15th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 13% year-over-year versus 18% in the first quarter. The pace of price increases continue to moderate but still remains high, reflecting elevated loss activity and concerns about inflation and low interest rates. 
Global property insurance was up 12% and global financial and professional lines were up 34%, driven in part by steep cyber increases, while global casualty rates are up 6% on average and U.S. workers' compensation rates declined modestly in the quarter. 
Keep in mind, our index skews to large account business. However, U.S. small middle market insurance pricing continues to rise as well, although the magnitude of price increases is less than the large complex accounts. 
Turning to Reinsurance. Guy Carpenter's global property catastrophe rate online index increased 6% at midyear. In the second quarter, the market was more orderly and balanced than a year ago, reflecting adequate capital and an increased willingness to deploy capacity.  Measured and moderate single-digit rate increases were typical after 2 years of double-digit rate increases. However, programs that had significant losses saw higher increases and capacity remains constrained on certain lines of business, most notably, cyber. 
Concerns remain around inflation, losses in certain lines, extreme weather events and the beginning of a new hurricane season. It is in times like these where our expertise and capabilities shine. We are working hard to help our clients navigate the current environment. 
Now let me turn to our fantastic second quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.75, which is up 33% versus a year ago, driven by strong top line growth and continued low levels of T&E. Total revenue increased 20% versus a year ago and rose 13% on an underlying basis, the highest quarterly growth in 2 decades. 
Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 12% in consulting. Marsh grew 14% in the quarter on an underlying basis, the highest quarterly underlying growth in nearly 2 decades and benefited from stronger business and renewal growth. Guy Carpenter grew 12% on an underlying basis in the quarter, continuing its string of excellent results. 
Mercer underlying revenue grew 6% in the quarter, the highest in almost a decade. Oliver Wyman posted record reported underlying revenue growth of 28%. Overall, the second quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 24%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points year-over-year. As we look out for the rest of 2021, we are well positioned. With 9% underlying revenue growth year-to-date, our full year growth will be strong. We expect favorable market dynamics to persist for at least the remainder of the year, although the pace of growth could moderate versus the second quarter as year-over-year comparisons become more challenging. We also expect to generate margin expansion for the full year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results."

The U.S. and Canada region delivered another exceptional quarter with underlying revenue growth of 15%, the highest result since we began reporting this segment. 
In international, underlying growth was 13%, EMEA was up 16%, Asia Pacific was up 10% and Latin America grew 2%. For the first 6 months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $5 billion, with underlying growth of 11%. U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 12% and international was up 9%.

Career grew 15% on an underlying basis, reflecting the rebound in the economy and business confidence. Wealth increased 4% on an underlying basis, reflecting strong growth in investment management offset by a modest decline in defined benefit. Our assets under delegated management grew to $393 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 28% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, benefiting from net new inflows and market gains. 
Health underlying revenue growth was 4% in the quarter, driven by strength internationally. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $618 million, an increase of 28% on an underlying basis. The second quarter results represent a sharp rebound from the contraction we saw in the second quarter last year. For the first 6 months of the year, revenue at Oliver Widen was $1.2 billion, an increase of 19% on an underlying basis. Adjusted corporate expense was $62 million in the second quarter. 
Foreign exchange was a modest benefit to earnings in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to have a minimal impact on EPS for the remainder of the year. However, the net asset credit was $71 million in the quarter. For the remaining 2 quarters of the year, we expect our other net benefit credit will be mostly consistent with the level in the second quarter. Investment income was $19 million in the second quarter on a GAAP basis and $18 million on an adjusted basis and mainly reflects gains on our private equity portfolio. 
Interest expense in the second quarter was $110 million compared to $132 million in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting lower debt levels in the period. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $110 million of interest expense in the third quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.4% compared with 25% in the second quarter last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. 
Our GAAP tax rate was 31.6% in the second quarter, up from 26.2% in the second quarter of 2020. The increase reflects a $100 million impact from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities due to an increase in the U.K. statutory tax rate that goes into effect in 2023. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4% compared with 24% last year. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2021, excluding discrete items. 
As we currently look out for the balance of the year, we expect our top line growth to remain strong, reflecting the economic rebound and favorable environment. Keep in buying the second quarter faced the most favorable year-over-year comparison for revenue growth. As we progress through the rest of the year, this, combined with continued normalization of expenses will result in more challenging comparisons. However, our businesses have momentum, and we expect positive trends to continue, resulting in strong performance in the second half and a terrific full year. 
Turning to capital management, our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion of total debt. This reflects a repayment of $500 million of senior notes in April, which completed our JLT-related deleveraging. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in January of 2022 when $500 million of senior notes mature. 
We continue to expect to deploy approximately $3.5 billion and possibly more capital in 2021, of which at least $3 billion will be deployed across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. 
Last week, we raised our dividend 15%, which is the largest increase since the third quarter of 1998. We also repurchased 2.4 million shares of our stock for $322 million in the second quarter. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $888 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $993 million and included $241 million for dividends, $322 million for share repurchases and $430 million for acquisitions. 
For the first 6 months, uses of cash totaled $1.4 billion and included $478 million for dividend, $434 million for share repurchases and $473 million for acquisitions. Overall, we had an exceptional second quarter, positioning us well to deliver strong growth in both revenue and adjusted earnings in 2021. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

And so the impact -- economic impact won't be as severe as what we've seen even with continuing waves of COVID. I mean last quarter, Elyse, we said that 2021 growth would be at the high end of our 3% to 5% range and possibly higher. I think at 9% underlying growth through 6 months, it's safe to say that we're in the higher category. 
We feel very good about our position. We're going to have a very good year. And 2021 is just going to set a new base for us. we intend to grow revenues and earnings in 2022 as well. So this is not going to be a 1-year wonder."

Margins are an outcome of how we run the business. I mean we grow our revenue every year at a pace that's faster than how we grow our expenses. I think you may be overly optimistic about T&E really rolling back in the back half of this year, I think it's going to be very gradual and slow actually. And I think there's that companies, not just Marsh McLennan, will travel with more purpose, and we'll be more thoughtful about traveling. And I think clients will expect the same of providers like ours. 
And so we do expect and hope that over time, T&E gets back to kind of 2019 levels, but we may be quite away from that point in time. We were very pleased with our margin expansion in the quarter. And as you said, it was driven by our top line. By that's where it largely came from. And it helped us that strong top line helped us overcome a comparable, which was a minus 5% expense growth. I mean, look at RIS margins were up 30 bps but that's on top of 430 bps of margin expansion in the second quarter of last year. 
So we like where we are. We will grow margins for the year. It may not be every quarter. I don't know that right now. But ultimately, we feel good for the year."

I mean our uses of $470 million of dividends, $134 million of share repurchase and $473 million of acquisitions. So it is a balanced approach.

That  sets it up for us. And then it's really going to know each other over a long stretch of time in figuring out it's not us buying and it's not them selling. We're deciding to come together. We believe the outcome for our clients and our people will be better together than separate. And that's the approach. Pipeline remains strong for us at our businesses. 
In fact, last year, was the highest acquired revenue within Marsh & McLennan Agency, which as you know, has been more than a decade long in terms of strategy build. And so we feel very good about that. I mean obviously, there's a lot of capital in the world. So multiples are higher than what we would like, and we need to be very selective and very careful in our evaluation of pro forma results because most of the companies we look at are private. But our strategy for a long period of time has been more of a string of pearls, that's something where is 1 mega type of acquisition, but it's building the company's capabilities, geographic test broader and JLT was an anomaly in some ways and was perhaps our biggest acquisition in history. 
And we talk to have that acquisition because we have been cultivating a broad relationship for a long previous time. We were coming together because we thought the combination was going to be better or higher, and you're seeing a manifestation of that. Growth is better because all of our combination with JLT, particularly in our specialty operations. And so that's kind of where we are. But our thoughts on M&A has not changed."

Mercer on the other hand, Mercer is in terrific growth businesses: health, wealth, career. And Martine has done some great underpinning work. And if you go back to the end of 2019, 2% growth, 3% growth and 4% growth in sequential quarters and then 5% growth in the first quarter of 2020, and then got locked by the pandemic as expected in some ways. It held up very well with a minus 3% throughout last year.

While not without size of the Americas, growth in Europe and in the Asia Pacific region were also quite robust. And across our major industry groups, financial services, consumer, industrial, health care, all actually growing at remarkably similar rates. 
And while we do think the outsized growth in Q2 was an outlier, we see business confidence remaining high as global economic conditions improve, and we see some semblance of a return to normality in some of the places we operate. And there's also a tightness in the labor market for the skill set that our consultants possess. So we have a decent outlook for the business for the rest of the year."

I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations.  
I'd like to welcome Nick who became CEO of Oliver Wyman on July 1. Nick has led many of Oliver Wyman's major practices in his 23 years with the business and I look forward to seeing Oliver Wyman continue to grow and thrive under his leadership.  On behalf of the executive committee, I also want to thank Scott McDonald for his many contributions during his distinguished 26-year career at the firm.  
Marsh McLennan had an outstanding second quarter. We are well positioned in benefiting from the abundance of opportunities. We are stronger and have broader capabilities post the JLT acquisition. We are benefiting from what may be the strongest economic rebound in nearly 4 decades, led by our largest region, the U.S.  
There is high demand for our advice and solutions in this time of uncertainty and in the face of challenging market conditions. We are seeing a flight to quality and stability, which is contributing to high levels of new business growth and client retention and is helping us to attract talent. And there is a long runway for growth as we think about major protection gaps around the world, new emerging risks, digitization, workforce of the future and underpenetrated markets such as small commercial.  
We are focused on capitalizing on these opportunities, and I am proud of our execution in the quarter. We generated record second quarter revenue and earnings, the best underlying growth of any quarter in 2 decades, and we are poised for an excellent year. The strength of our results was broad-based with each of our businesses and virtually all of our major geographies seeing an acceleration in growth. Our adjusted EPS increased by an impressive 33%, and we generated margin expansion despite challenging expense comparisons.  
As we look ahead, the economic outlook for the U.S. and most of the major countries we operate in is encouraging. However, the pandemic is not over yet. Vaccine hesitancy creates risk and there are many parts of the world where vaccine availability is limited. As a result, much of the world is experiencing another wave of the pandemic with rising case counts due to the spread of variants. In addition, the shape of this economic recovery is very different from any we have seen before. Some industries are thriving, while others are being impacted by supply chain disruption, inventory issues and labor shortages.  
Navigating this dynamic landscape is challenging, even confounding for some businesses. The growth opportunity for Marsh McLennan is significant during this time of uncertainty and recovery. We are aiding and guiding our clients through the complexities of the new normal as well as helping them tackle issues like climate risk, cyber, diversity and inclusion, employee safety and well-being and workforce disruption.  
Our ability to provide differentiated high-quality solutions to our clients rest on our talent and expertise. Our colleagues are our #1 competitive advantage. And with the potential for industry consolidation, we see a meaningful opportunity to invest in hiring and deepen our world-class talent pool.  
We have strong momentum. And as we mentioned last quarter, our efforts are focused on resurgence and expansion. Let me provide some examples of how we are helping our clients address complex issues of the day, specifically 2 major challenges: cybersecurity and climate change.  
Cybersecurity is one of the greatest risks facing society. Supply chain and ransomware attacks continue to rise with a number of recent high-profile attacks affecting organizations across all sectors and segments from technology to critical infrastructure and health care. Marsh & McLennan is helping clients manage cyber risk. Increasingly, we are bringing our businesses together to leverage all of our expertise, data and relationships with public and private partners to help clients become more resilient. Our growth in participation in cyber extends well beyond the placement of insurance,  under the leadership of Tom Doyle, we are leveraging the collective capabilities of Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman to bring cyber solutions from across our enterprise to clients. Not only are we helping clients with risk transfer through our insurance businesses, but through our cyber risk assessment tools, we help clients measure and quantify their cyber risk exposure to better inform decisions about cybersecurity, risk mitigation and transfer strategies.  
We also  help clients with incident response before, during and after events as well as part of our broader efforts to help clients build resilience in the face of a constantly evolving threat landscape.  
A second defining challenge of our time is climate change. Climate and the broader topic of ESG are complex multidimensional challenges, virtually all companies face. The threats to the changing time may present obvious questions for companies touching everything from strategy to resilience to their workforce and how they communicate. Even if climate change is a long-term threat, the issue is proximate and has immediate consequences as firms deal with calls for action, strategies to respond and more input from various stakeholders.  
Led by Nick Studer, we are bringing together our businesses to help our clients anticipate climate risks and opportunities. For example, Oliver Wyman is working with our insurance businesses to support clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy and manage climate risk. We are assisting clients with the development of carbon-light business models and to derisk investment in sustainable technologies. At Marsh and Guy Carpenter, we are helping to develop innovative climate solutions to bridge protection gaps.  
We assist clients with stress testing models, outline the impact of climate change, and providing risk management and insurance services to protect against climate impacts. And Mercer's responsible investment business helps steward the fiduciaries of investment pools understand how a change in climate could impact investment returns in the future and anticipate them today.  
Overall, we are uniquely positioned to help our clients with their most pressing challenges. Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. The second quarter marks the 15th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 13% year-over-year versus 18% in the first quarter. The pace of price increases continue to moderate but still remains high, reflecting elevated loss activity and concerns about inflation and low interest rates.  
Global property insurance was up 12% and global financial and professional lines were up 34%, driven in part by steep cyber increases, while global casualty rates are up 6% on average and U.S. workers' compensation rates declined modestly in the quarter.  
Keep in mind, our index skews to large account business. However, U.S. small middle market insurance pricing continues to rise as well, although the magnitude of price increases is less with the large complex accounts.  
Turning to Reinsurance. Guy Carpenter's global property catastrophe rate online index increased 6% at midyear. In the second quarter, the market was more orderly and balanced than a year ago, reflecting adequate capital and an increased willingness to deploy capacity.  Measured and moderate single-digit rate increases were typical after 2 years of double-digit rate increases. However, programs that had significant losses saw higher increases and capacity remains constrained on certain lines of business, most notably, cyber.  
Concerns remain around inflation, losses in certain lines, extreme weather events and the beginning of a new hurricane season. It is in times like these where our expertise and capabilities shine. We are working hard to help our clients navigate the current environment.  
Now let me turn to our fantastic second quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.75, which is up 33% versus a year ago, driven by strong top line growth and continued low levels of T&E. Total revenue increased 20% versus a year ago and rose 13% on an underlying basis, the highest quarterly growth in 2 decades.  
Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 12% in consulting. Marsh grew 14% in the quarter on an underlying basis, the highest quarterly underlying growth in nearly 2 decades and benefited from stronger business and renewal growth. Guy Carpenter grew 12% on an underlying basis in the quarter, continuing its string of excellent results.  
Mercer underlying revenue grew 6% in the quarter, the highest in almost a decade. Oliver Wyman posted record reported underlying revenue growth of 28%. Overall, the second quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 24%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points year-over-year. As we look out for the rest of 2021, we are well positioned. With 9% underlying revenue growth year-to-date, our full year growth will be strong. We expect favorable market dynamics to persist for at least the remainder of the year. Although the pace of growth could moderate versus the second quarter as year-over-year comparisons become more challenging. We also expect to generate margin expansion for the full year and strong growth in adjusted EPS.  
With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results."
473342,1671821545,2349351,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our results were excellent with record second quarter revenue to earnings, the best quarterly underlying growth in 2 decades, meaningful margin expansion, and significant growth in adjusted earnings. Highlights from our s",1347,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our results were excellent with record second quarter revenue to earnings, the best quarterly underlying growth in 2 decades, meaningful margin expansion, and significant growth in adjusted earnings. Highlights from our second quarter performance included the strongest underlying growth at Marsh since the first quarter of 2003; the strongest at Guy Carpenter in 15 years; solid rebound at 6% at Mercer; and record reported underlying growth at Oliver Wyman. Second quarter growth in adjusted earnings per share was also impressive, rising at the fastest pace of any quarter in more than a decade.  
Consolidated revenue increased 20% in the second quarter to $5 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 13%. Operating income in the quarter was $1.2 billion, an increase of 39% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income increased 24% to $1.2 billion, and our adjusted operating margin increased 90 basis points to 26.4%.  GAAP EPS was $1.50 in the quarter and adjusted EPS increased 33% to $1.75.  
For the first 6 months of 2021, underlying revenue growth was 9%, and adjusted operating income grew 22% to $2.6 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points. Our adjusted EPS increased 26% to $3.74. Looking at Risk Insurance Services. Second quarter revenue was $3.1 billion, up 21% compared with a year ago or 13% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 37% to $950 million. Adjusted operating income increased 22% to $927 million, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 32.4%.   
For the first 6 months of the year, revenue was $6.4 billion, with underlying growth of 10%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year increased 19% to $2 billion with a margin of 34.5%, up 110 basis points from the same period a year ago.  
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 23% compared with a year ago, 14% on an underlying basis. 
Even excluding the impact of the revenue adjustment we reported a year ago, underlying revenue at Marsh was up 12%. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and was driven by robust new business growth and solid retention. The U.S. and Canada region delivered another exceptional quarter with underlying revenue growth of 15%, the highest result since we began reporting this segment.  
In international, underlying growth was 13%, EMEA was up 16%, Asia Pacific was up 10% and Latin America grew 2%. For the first 6 months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $5 billion, with underlying growth of 11%. U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 12% and international was up 9%. 
Guy Carpenter's second quarter revenue was $488 million, up 13% compared with a year ago or 12% on an underlying basis. Growth was broad-based across all geographies and specialties. Guy Partner has now achieved 7% or higher underlying growth in 6 of the last 8 quarters.  
For the first 6 months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.4 billion of revenue and 8% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 17% from a year ago or 12% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 35% to $344 million. Adjusted operating income increased 34% to $356 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded by 220 basis points to 19.5%. Consulting generated revenue of $3.8 billion for the first 6 months of 2021, representing underlying growth of 8%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year increased 31% to $726 million. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis, representing a meaningful acceleration from the first quarter. Career grew 15% on an underlying basis, reflecting the rebound in the economy and business confidence. Wealth increased 4% on an underlying basis, reflecting strong growth in investment management offset by a modest decline in defined benefit. Our assets under delegated management grew to $393 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 28% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, benefiting from net new inflows and market gains.  
Health underlying revenue growth was 4% in the quarter, driven by strength internationally. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $618 million, an increase of 28% on an underlying basis. The second quarter results represent a sharp rebound from the contraction we saw in the second quarter last year. For the first 6 months of the year, revenue at Oliver Widen was $1.2 billion, an increase of 19% on an underlying basis. Adjusted corporate expense was $62 million in the second quarter.  
Foreign exchange was a modest benefit to earnings in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to have a minimal impact on EPS for the remainder of the year. However, the net benefit credit was $71 million in the quarter. For the remaining 2 quarters of the year, we expect our other net benefit credit will be mostly consistent with the level in the second quarter. Investment income was $19 million in the second quarter on a GAAP basis and $18 million on an adjusted basis and mainly reflects gains on our private equity portfolio.  
Interest expense in the second quarter was $110 million compared to $132 million in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting lower debt levels in the period. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $110 million of interest expense in the third quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.4% compared with 25% in the second quarter last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%.  
Our GAAP tax rate was 31.6% in the second quarter, up from 26.2% in the second quarter of 2020. The increase reflects a $100 million impact from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities due to an increase in the U.K. statutory tax rate that goes into effect in 2023. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4% compared with 24% last year. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2021, excluding discrete items.  
As we currently look out for the balance of the year, we expect our top line growth to remain strong, reflecting the economic rebound and favorable environment. Keep in mind the second quarter faced the most favorable year-over-year comparison for revenue growth. As we progress through the rest of the year, this, combined with continued normalization of expenses will result in more challenging comparisons. However, our businesses have momentum, and we expect positive trends to continue, resulting in strong performance in the second half and a terrific full year.  
Turning to capital management, our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion of total debt. This reflects repayment of $500 million of senior notes in April, which completed our JLT-related deleveraging. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in January of 2022 when $500 million of senior notes mature.  
We continue to expect to deploy approximately $3.5 billion and possibly more capital in 2021, of which at least $3 billion will be deployed across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops.  
Last week, we raised our dividend 15%, which is the largest increase since the third quarter of 1998. We also repurchased 2.4 million shares of our stock for $322 million in the second quarter. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $888 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $993 million and included $241 million for dividends, $322 million for share repurchases and $430 million for acquisitions.  
For the first 6 months, uses of cash totaled $1.4 billion and included $478 million for dividend, $434 million for share repurchases and $473 million for acquisitions. Overall, we had an exceptional second quarter, positioning us well to deliver strong growth in both revenue and adjusted earnings in 2021. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

So what -- we obviously, as Mark was saying, we've got momentum, and we feel very good about how we're positioned. We're not that fearful about the economy, we are fearful about continuing waves of COVID. But the economies have adjusted somewhat in many parts of the world and are more resilient certainly, than they were in the spring of 2020. 
And so the impact -- economic impact won't be as severe as what we've seen even with continuing waves of COVID. I mean last quarter, Elyse, we said that 2021 growth would be at the high end of our 3% to 5% range and possibly higher. I think at 9% underlying growth through 6 months, it's safe to say that we're in the higher category. 
We feel very good about our position. We're going to have a very good year. And 2021 is just going to set a new base for us. we intend to grow revenues and earnings in 2022 as well. So this is not going to be a 1-year wonder."

Margins are an outcome of how we run the business. I mean we grow our revenue every year at a pace that's faster than how we grow our expenses. I think you may be overly optimistic about T&E really roaring back in the back half of this year, I think it's going to be very gradual and slow actually. And I think there's that companies, not just Marsh McLennan, will travel with more purpose, and we'll be more thoughtful about traveling. And I think clients will expect the same of providers like ours. 
And so we do expect and hope that over time, T&E gets back to kind of 2019 levels, but we may be quite away from that point in time. We were very pleased with our margin expansion in the quarter. And as you said, it was driven by our top line. By that's where it largely came from. And it helped us, that strong top line helped us overcome a comparable, which was a minus 5% expense growth. I mean, look at RIS margins were up 30 bps but that's on top of 430 bps of margin expansion in the second quarter of last year. 
So we like where we are. We will grow margins for the year. It may not be every quarter. I don't know that right now. But ultimately, we feel good for the year."

New business generation was terrific across the businesses, and our growth was broad-based.

So there are a lot of factors that are underpinning our revenue growth, and we feel very good about revenue growth into the future."

Not that we'll spend the same money in each of our 3 principal buckets of dividend and acquisition and share repurchase, but we don't have an approach that's weighted to one versus the other. And so share repurchase in large part is a function of what our acquisition activity looks like. And every year might not be perfectly balanced, but boy, the first half was pretty balanced. I mean our uses of $470 million of dividends, $434 million of share repurchase and $473 million of acquisitions. So it is a balanced approach. 
And I think you'll see that from us. I mean at the end, as Mark was saying, we have $3.5 billion or more to deploy. We are a cash generation type of company. So this is, again, not a 1-year wonder.

The biggest growth in our expenses, frankly, is compensation. And I think that's a good thing. Our variable comp is going up along with our growth. We're in the market, we're hiring. I mean our -- the first 6 months of this year, our headcount has grown nearly 2,000. Most of that is coming within Marsh, as they're capitalizing on the opportunities they see with their 2 biggest competitors having some element of distraction and uncertainties.

Dan and Mark both mentioned, we certainly benefited from the economic rebound relatively soft primary comp, I was proud of that growth in the second quarter last year during the pandemic. The pricing environment, Dan talked about it a little bit in his remarks earlier, about 50% of our revenue is sensitive to P&C pricing. And while rate increases have come down modestly compared to the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, they held really where we're sensitive to pricing to where we get commissioned. But it's probably a number of different areas. But I also want to emphasize that we executed really well in the quarter. 
Our team has been strong as it's ever been.  They're highly engaged to focus on delivering for our clients. And the market remains challenging. It's again, while rates aren't nearly as much as they were before, they are quite difficult. I do think there's been a bit of catch up in some markets, there's a fair amount of new, new business in our results, whether it's in transaction risk, in cyber or in construction, there are examples of where that is the case.

Our philosophy in M&A is basically, we like buying firms that are high quality where the leadership team generally remains in place, and have recurring revenue streams, high past generation, low capital requirements and a history of success. That sets it up for us. And then it's really going to know each other over a long stretch of time and figuring out it's not us buying and it's not them selling. We're deciding to come together. We believe the outcome for our clients and our people will be better together than separate. And that's the approach. Pipeline remains strong for us throughout our businesses. 
In fact, last year, was the highest acquired revenue within Marsh & McLennan Agency, which as you know, has been more than a decade long in terms of strategy build. And so we feel very good about that. I mean obviously, there's a lot of capital in the world. So multiples are higher than what we would like, and we need to be very selective and very careful in our evaluation of pro forma results because most of the companies we look at are private. But our strategy for a long period of time has been more of a string of pearls, that's something where its 1 mega type of acquisition, but it's building the company's capabilities, geographic task, broader, and JLT was an anomaly in some ways and was perhaps our biggest acquisition in history. 
And we are totally happy with that acquisition because we have been cultivating a broad relationship for a long period of time. We were coming together because we thought the combination was going to be better and higher, and you're seeing a manifestation of that. Growth is better because all of our combination with JLT, particularly in our specialty operations. And so that's kind of where we are. But our thoughts about M&A have not changed."

The Americas, particularly the U.S., has seen a very sharp rebound in client demand both through the economic conditions and business confidence rising materially. And if you take, for example, the transportation sector, which was the sector that suffered the greatest impact from the pandemic last year, springing back very strongly. While not without size of the Americas, growth in Europe and in the Asia Pacific region were also quite robust. And across our major industry groups, financial services, consumer, industrial, health care, all actually growing at remarkably similar rates. 
And while we do think the outsized growth in Q2 was an outlier, we see business confidence remaining high as global economic conditions improve, and we see some semblance of a return to normality in some of the places we operate. And there's also a tightness in the labor market for the skill set that our consultants possess. So we have a decent outlook for the business for the rest of the year."

So demands will be large, demands for skills and skill set, assessment, engagement, transformation as companies accelerate their forward into digital and newer technology.

And I want to spend another moment on our wealth business. I think a 4% growth in the quarter is we have not seen that since Q4 2017. Again, all some sub solutions in our wealth business did well. In particular, our OCIO business, which is the part of the business where we implement asset management for our clients. And you see the slight to strong governance there, deep manager research. And combined with questions and helping clients with ESG and DDI type of investment [indiscernible] a little bit. And lastly, on wealth, this is the year where the DB part of our portfolio, which we all know is in structural decline has been for some years, actually because at the same time it becomes smaller than investment management solutions that we have in the portfolio, and we can see that this should be providing some tailwinds as we go beyond 2021."

Marsh McLennan had another outstanding quarter. Our third quarter results reflect strong momentum across all of our businesses. Our continued strength represents a combination of the current environment as well as impressive day-to-day execution across the firm. Although there continues to be uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we are seeing solid demand for our differentiated advice and solutions.
We view climate as a significant opportunity, and we are well positioned to help clients with this critical issue. In October, Oliver Wyman launched the Climate Action Navigator drawing on insights from across the company. This product helps public and private sector leaders plot a path through climate science, identifying emissions at the industry and regional level and quantifying the effects of multiple different carbon reduction technologies and actions. We believe these tools will give business and government leaders vital insights to achieve their long-term climate goals and be a significant enabler of the transition to low carbon climate resilient investment in the corporate sector.
Mercer recently launched Skills Edge, an innovative platform, allowing employers to determine the most important skills for their future and design a talent strategy to assess, acquire and retain them. Skills Edge provides quantitative insight into the demand and value of skills. It supports both employees and organizations and rapidly reskilling for the future of work.
Cyber Risk Analytics Center. This brings together cyber risk data and analytics expertise across our firm and provides clients with a comprehensive assessment of their cyber threats, existing and future controls and the potential economic impact.
We are 1 enterprise, and these are just a few recent examples of how we bring together and leverage knowledge and capabilities across the firm to offer comprehensive solutions to our clients and address their most pressing concerns. We are a growth company as demonstrated by our track record. Growth doesn't just happen. It takes consistent vision, alignment, commitment and execution. Since closing our acquisition of JLT, we have grown our total consolidated revenue by 27%, our adjusted EPS by 34% and our colleague base by 22%.
Achieving and sustaining growth requires consistent reinvestment in the business. We always strive to balance delivering results in the short term while investing for the long term. In 2021, we generated year-to-date adjusted EPS growth that is higher than any annual period in over 3 decades, while at the same time, investing for the future and making a significant press on hiring. We grew our headcount year-to-date by nearly 5,000 and or around 7%, mostly organic ads with an emphasis on client-facing roles. We expect this influx of talent will drive growth add to our capabilities and enhance our ability to serve clients.
Now let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Many of the factors that drove the market to harden over the last few years continue, suggesting an inflection to a soft market is unlikely in the near term. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 15% year-over-year, consistent with the second quarter. This marks the 16th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace.
Looking at pricing by line, the Marsh market index showed global property insurance was up 9%, global financial and professional lines were up 32%, driven in part by a near doubling in cyber rates and global casualty rates were up high single digits on average. As a reminder, our index skews to large account business. However, small and middle market insurance rates continue to rise as well, although less than for large complex accounts.
Turning to reinsurance. Measured and moderate rate increases in global property catastrophe reinsurance witnessed in the first half of 2021 could persist throughout the remainder of the year, reflecting adequate capacity offset by elevated global catastrophes, concerns around real and social inflation and a continuation of large individual risk losses. 2021 marks another year of significant catastrophe losses.
Hurricane Ida generated material losses in both the Southeast and Northeast. This is in addition to a record level of flood losses in Europe, flooding in China and the continuation of wildfire losses in many parts of the world. Marsh & McLennan remains focused on helping our clients navigate these challenging market conditions and making a difference for them in the moments that matter.
Now let me turn to our terrific third quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.08, which is up 32% versus a year ago. driven by strong top line growth and continued low levels of T&E. Total revenue increased 16% versus a year ago and rose 13% on an underlying basis, the second consecutive quarter of record underlying growth in over 2 decades.
Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 12% in consulting. Marsh grew 13% in the quarter on an underlying basis and benefited from strong new business and renewal growth. Guy Carpenter grew 15% on an underlying basis in the quarter, continuing its string of excellent results. Mercer underlying revenue grew 7% in the quarter, the highest in over a decade. Oliver Wyman grew underlying revenue 25%, the second consecutive quarter in excess of 20%. Overall, the third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 19% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points year-over-year.
Given our excellent third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are on track for a terrific year. We expect to generate the best underlying revenue and adjusted EPS growth in over 2 decades and expand margins for the 14th consecutive year. Our entire organization is on its front foot, focused and aligned, and this is evident in our excellent results.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results."

At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion, up 17% compared with a year ago or 13% on an underlying basis. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and driven by nearly 40% new business growth and solid retention. U.S. and Canada delivered another exceptional quarter with underlying revenue growth of 16%. In international [indiscernible] growth was 9%. Latin America grew 12%, its best growth since the fourth quarter of 2015, Asia Pacific was up 9% and EMEA was up 8%.

Guy Carpenter's third quarter revenue was $314 million, up 15% compared with a year ago on both a GAAP and underlying basis. Growth was broad-based across geographies and specialties. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 7% or higher underlying growth in 7 of the last 9 quarters. For the first 9 months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.7 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth.
In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 13% from a year ago or 12% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 45% to $404 million.

Wealth increased 6% on an underlying basis, reflecting strong growth in investment management and modest growth and defined benefits.
Our assets under delegated management grew to nearly $400 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 24% year-over-year, benefiting from net new inflows and market gains. Health underlying revenue growth was 4% in the quarter, driven by growth outside the U.S.
Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $610 million, an increase of 25% on an underlying basis. This represents the second consecutive quarter of more than 20% growth as demand remains strong across most geographies and practices. For the first 9 months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.8 billion, an increase of 21% on an underlying basis.
Adjusted corporate expense was $60 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange had a negligible impact on earnings in Q3. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a modest headwind in the fourth quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $69 million in the quarter, and we expect it will remain at this level in the fourth quarter.
Investment income was $13 million in the quarter on a GAAP basis and $12 million on an adjusted basis and mainly reflects gains on our private equity portfolio. Interest expense in the third quarter was $107 million compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting lower debt levels in the period. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense in the fourth quarter to be similar to the amount in the third quarter.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 24.4% compared with 26.5% in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP tax rate was 24.2% in the third quarter, down from 30.3% in the third quarter of 2020, which was impacted by some unusual items. Through the first 9 months of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4% compared with 24.6% last year. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2021, excluding discrete items.
Given our year-to-date performance, we are on track for an outstanding year. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, keep in mind that comparisons become more challenging given the rebound in growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. We also continue to build for the long term by investing in hiring. While we are excited about the future benefits these investments will deliver, they come with upfront costs we absorb in the short term. That said, we've consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver exceptional results today while investing for the future and expect we will continue to do so.
Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $10.7 billion of total debt. Our next scheduled debt maturities in January of 2022 with $500 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy at least $3.5 billion of capital in 2021, of which at least $3 billion will be deployed across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops.
Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $665 million, and included $272 million for dividends, $93 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases. For the first 9 months, uses of cash totaled $2.6 billion and including $750 million for dividends, $566 million for acquisitions, $734 million for share repurchases and $500 million for debt repayment.
We had a remarkable third quarter, positioning us well to deliver strong growth in both revenue and adjusted earnings in 2021. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

And of course, the majority of the hiring that we've done is in client-facing roles. And so we may not be like other firms and that we generally hire to grow capability and talent rather than direct short-term revenue production.
But having said that, we are a people business. Our colleagues are our engine of growth. And undoubtedly, our increased hiring in 2021 will benefit next year and beyond. Sometimes, it takes a bit of time to get all the hires fully integrated into the firm and producing at levels in terms of their own capacity at an optimal level, but we're very comfortable with that.
And of course, there's a cost factor with that. We're not shy to say. Sophisticated talent is expensive. But it's worth it, and that's why we pursue it. And I don't want anyone to worry out there about our long-term expense base by all of this hiring. We know how to run the business. our comp and ben ratio, if I look at Q3 on a rolling 4-quarter basis and then go back 5 years and look at Q3 on a rolling 4-quarter basis is virtually identical. So over time, we're building the company. We're doing it through organic and we're doing it through acquisition."

Prices were up about 15% on average in the quarter, which was consistent with the second quarter. Property market was plus 9% versus plus 12% in the second quarter. It was obviously quite an active cat quarter. Flood and wind and wildfire related losses. But secondary apparels are getting a lot of attention from the underwriting community in the market.
Casualty was up about 6%, although up closer to double digits globally when you exclude the work comp market, I mean, the United States where things remained pretty competitive. The excess market can remain particularly challenging here in the United States, the underwriting community worried about loss cost inflation. Social inflation really is as courts reopen from being largely closed during the pandemic. The financial lines market, I think, on average, is the most difficult market for the moment for our clients. Although having said that, public D&O pricing, it is still up, but it's up about 10 points versus 15 points in the second quarter. And that price increase, that rate of increase is the lowest it's been in the last 10 quarters. So starting to see a little bit of settling in that market.
Without question, the market that is most challenging at the moment is the cyber market, where prices were up more than 90% on average, driven by material growth in ransomware claims that I'm sure you're familiar with, as well as concerns about systemic events. We've got a few events that may be modest compared to what potentially could happen, but underwriters remain concerned about that. You asked about clients they're certainly frustrated by it, for sure. And some are retaining more risk. We've been pretty active in creating new captives and there's a premium growth in the captives that we manage as well.
Some are also electing to retain more risk. And in some cases, of course, the market is forcing some of our clients to retain more risk. So it's client by client and exposure by exposure. As Dan said, we're aggressively working to help our clients navigate the market. I will add that although on average, the price was -- the average increase was the same globally. Most markets did see rate moderation. The United States was really the 1 exception when you look at it on a global basis."

Jimmy, a lot of my comments reflect from a reinsurance perspective, what John has said on an insurance perspective, you've got markets that are dealing with real and social inflation. They're dealing with low interest rate environment. And on top of that, we're facing something approaching $100 billion of global catastrophe losses in 2021. So I think it's safe to say the prospect of that will influence property reinsurance pricing at 1 1 22.
But you have to look at the market through various lenses because there's a property market that's been affected by $300 billion plus losses over the last 5 years of catastrophe losses. If you look to the casualty market, the significant underlying rate lift has stabilized and improved significantly, property casualty reinsurance contracts. And so I would say the casualty market has been more stable. As John says, and the same is true in reinsurance, if I would suggest to suggest there's one hard element of our market right now, it is cyber. I think reinsurers are looking at cyber capacity the same way they look at property catastrophe capacity, where they're going to allocate a certain amount of aggregate and once they hit that aggregate, that's it.
So I'd say, as you know, we don't opine on 1 1 pricing or any significant quarter pricing. We believe the market finds its own equilibrium. And as a result of that, we're preparing our clients based on exposure and experience for what they might expect at 1 1. But certainly, the property market, given the fact that this is now the fifth year that reinsurers have had losses is going to be challenging."

I think the days of 9 to 5 or 8 to 6, 5 days a week in the office are older for most companies. And so that will have an impact. It's a longer-term impact because in the short term, you've got your leases established, and we want some social distancing in the office, and we're not sure how this will develop over time. So we're going to be deliberate and flexible, and we're not going to move that quickly on it. I mean we've had efforts over many years to become more efficient in our use of space and we've accomplished that quite a bit. And that continues, but that certainly is our view.
We also think that T&E won't come back quickly and may not reach the level of 2019 for quite a while. I know in Marsh & McLennan, in our view is, yes, we look forward to a day where we're going to visit clients in markets in their location. But we will travel with more purpose, we'll probably travel with less people on various trips, and we'll be more deliberate about it. And I think that our clients will have that expectation as well. So that hop on a plane anytime, anywhere, culture probably takes quite a long time to come back, if ever. And so both of those things have expense implications for us that will be positive for shareholders in the long term.
And I would say, the other thing is we are constantly seeking efficiency gain. And we're working throughout the firm in order to drive efficiency gain and to become better at operations. So I want to -- why don't I turn it to John for a second, so we can talk a little bit because about some of our headcount growth was in OpEx in the effort to drive some efficiency within the Marsh operation. And it's in its early stages, but there was a pretty significant increase in headcount in that area. So John, do you want to talk about that in a second."

And I think we have enduring competitive advantages as well. I mean, as we were talking before, nothing happens here without our colleagues. I mean the quality of our organization, the talent that we have, the culture that we have, the broad capabilities, the global footprint are all enduring competitive advantages. We also continue to acquire talent in the market and acquire businesses, which improve us and improve our capabilities in particular, in middle market on the brokerage side. So there's a lot of growth opportunities. And just to touch as well on expansion opportunities. I mean we're still weighted into upper middle market and large accounts. We've gotten better in the mid middle market. We're going to continue to get better. We're going to continue to broaden into the lower middle market and small commercial, consumer you'll see us in all of those areas in the future.
Now it's not going to be from 1 year to the next, seeing some just massive change, but this is inevitable in terms of how we build out our business. We're leveraging the combined strengths of our organization as 1 enterprise like never before in areas of healthy societies, cyber protection gaps climate. I mean all of those areas we're going to market and addressing our clients' issues with them on a broad basis, not on a narrow basis.
And so our opportunities for revenue growth, in my view, are significant. I won't give you a number right now for 2020 [indiscernible] exciting times at Marsh & McLennan."

And so we are, in our view, an employer of choice in this space, and we are pressing our advantage at this moment in time.
The hiring spurt is not going to last forever. But ultimately, we saw an opportunity in the market through dislocation and other factors, and we really pressed on that level. At the end, our expenses are relatively high compared to historical type of expense growth for us, but our expense growth is essentially driven by sales -- by compensation and benefit. But at its very hard. Sales compensation due to much higher levels of new business, variable compensation due to much higher levels of profitability and hiring. So comp and ben is driving most of our sales, most of our expense growth in the quarter and will ease itself out, but it's matching well with current levels of revenue growth. So we feel that this was tremendously opportune time to build capabilities within the firm on an organic basis."

And so when you think about just what's going on in the world with regard to climate or D&I, responsible investing, et cetera. These are all new areas of growth for us. You think about things like climate, which was probably not even considered by us 10 years ago, and we think it's one of our major growth opportunities as a firm on a going-forward basis.
And so I would just say, we want to be a leader on ESG. And we look at the addressable market as ESG is being enormous. And right now, it's kind of the developed world public companies. It's going to be all companies everywhere. And so from that standpoint, the addressable market is going to be quite large, and we will be a significant player in it."

We like firms that have recurring revenue. We like firms that are advisory based with transactions. Doesn't mean that all of our acquisitions will fit that criteria, but that's a lot of them. And then we also like firms where we can see the business benefit, the financial benefit to us, even if it's a bit out there, we can see it.
And some of the things we look at, frankly, in the amount of liquidity and money that's being generated in the world and available. We just look at it. We can't -- we like the company, and it's interesting, but boy, we don't have 30 years to figure out whether it worked or not. And so we're a disciplined acquirer, and we want to acquire things that not only build our capabilities, but also help us financially as well, even if only on an incremental basis.
So I would say, we have a very broad sandbox but our level of execution has been relatively narrow over the last 5 or 10 years. And that probably continues on that basis. We look at a lot of things and we execute on things that we're really committed to."

Ultimately, we've said many times, you have to look about margin expansion over longer stretches of time.

Our margin is up 120 bps year-to-date, and that's on top of 120 bps in 2020 and 110 bps in 2019. So there's another role in our margins, and I would expect that our margins next year are going to be better than they are this year. And so that's the way we operate the business, but it's an outcome.
No, we don't sit around the table figuring out how we're going to drive margin. What we do is we figure out how we're going to drive underlying growth and earnings. That's the focus of the current -- of the firm and the outcome of margin expansion is how we run the firm where we think not every quarter, but certainly, every year, revenue growth needs to exceed expense growth, and that's what we do and we've done it consistently. And so we're thrilled about where we are.
What I mentioned earlier is that a lot of the expense growth right now is being driven by compensation around sales and around increased profitability. And so that's a really good place to be in. And our earnings growth is very strong, remarkably strong. And so I hope that answers your question."

Why don't I take that and then I'll hand to John and Martine to just say are you seeing inflation in any way in the conversations with clients and what we're hearing from markets. I mean, historically, we've done some work. And we tend to do as a company, better in inflationary periods. I mean, elements of our revenue base react to inflation, such as higher insured values, and we've proven that we can manage our expense base. And so sometimes the revenue runs a little bit because of of inflation, and we're still managing our expense base.
So when we look back to inflationary periods over the last 25 years, we've tended to outperform and do pretty well. And overall, I'll just mention on the economic environment, not just inflation. I mean there's a lot of positive features about the economic environment, particularly in the United States. I mean, sales are up, consumer spending is up, business confidence is positive, but there are a lot of potential risk. And inflation is probably the biggest one of them, but you also have the supply chain issues that we've all been reading about, the return to office that we're all going to be navigating over the coming months, concerns around COVID variant.
So it is a tremendously difficult time to look forward, say, 4 quarters or so and get a real beat on what the economic performance is, although I do note that most GDP forecast for next year in that kind of 4% and 5% range, so not bad. But starting with John, what are you hearing from markets and clients around inflation and then we'll go to Martine."

And Peter mentioned earlier that more than $100 billion worth of cat losses. Of course, we're typically accustomed to demand surge related kind of temporary inflation, if you will, around cat losses. But it's further -- those issues are further exacerbated by the supply chain challenges that we're seeing in markets.
So there's some level of concern there in terms of what it will mean ultimately to loss costs around cats. I mentioned earlier the impact of social inflation around liability claims, particularly here in the United States and a couple of other jurisdictions as quarter 3 open after the pandemic. And we're seeing some evidence of that, although broad-based evidence is really yet to show itself. Of course, payrolls and employment levels are important from a demand perspective around commercial insurance and work comp, in particular. And so there is concern about wage inflation from some of our clients and the impact on growing costs there.
And maybe with that, I'll hand it to Martine to talk maybe more about the benefits side of things."

The same thing on wage inflation, looking at accelerating transformation program with clients to address the procurement and the profile of their workforce.
And in terms of pension plans as well, I mean, we have to watch on that. As soon as there is pressures in the economy and system, governance spike up in terms of helping clients manage the asset side of their pension funds more tightly. And therefore, that's usually good for the OCIO business in our investment management solutions. And lastly, from a management of our business, most, if not all, of our multiyear assignments would have automatic adjustment to inflation. So we've seen that moving before some years ago."

From a wage inflation point of view in the market, what we're seeing is that there's more pressure at the lower end of the wage spectrum, where there is a lot of movement there to attract people to jobs that have been really hard hit during the pandemic. And the higher-end white collar, professional, what we're seeing is a little bit of a musical chair, I would say. So there's a great resignation, this kind of people have moved. People are looking for different careers. And we need to help our clients manage through these pressures and demand, but I think this element of it will be temporary and will settle itself over time.
I mean as clients look at, as I said earlier, transforming, focusing on the skills they need, rather in jobs and rolls. We see a very important trend there. Dan has spoken earlier about our Skills Edge platform to help clients migrate to that. These are all techniques that will help clients get through this change that we're seeing right now."

Every time we're seeking talent, we have numerous applicants. And so I think at the very heart of it, it is the work that we do. We're not an insurance business. We're a risk business. We're not a people business from an administrative standpoint. We are a strategic people business.
And so from that standpoint, the purpose of the organization of making a difference for companies in their moments that matter and those inflection points, I think it's very attractive. And so we're able to compete with the best firms in the world for high levels of talent. And when you have the broad base that we have, you can take some risk around, okay, so that person is not a subject matter expert, but boy, they've got a history of success and let's see how they do. And so we can go a little bit broader. So we see none of the constraints that some folks in, particularly in the insurance industry have in terms of inflow of talent."

Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. 
Marsh McLennan had another outstanding quarter. Our third quarter results reflect strong momentum across all of our businesses. Our continued strength represents a combination of the current environment as well as impressive day-to-day execution across the firm. Although there continues to be uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we are seeing solid demand for our differentiated advice and solutions. 
Even as COVID-19 continues to pose risk in many parts of the world, vaccine rollouts are having a positive impact. We are taking advantage of opportunities to add to our deep bench of world-class talent. At the core of our business is a focus on our colleagues, and we are dedicated to Marsh McLennan being in an exciting and dynamic place to work for outstanding people. And we continue to innovate and leverage the collective strengths of our organization to help clients address their most pressing concerns, including climate, diversity and inclusion, the future of work, cyber and digital strategies. 
As we have discussed, 2021 represents Marsh McLennan's 150th year, and success over such a long period of time requires constant innovation and investment to deliver sustained growth and profitability. I'd like to discuss just a few recent examples of how we are innovating to develop new, unique client solutions. Nick Studer leads our firm-wide climate initiative. We view climate as a significant opportunity, and we are well positioned to help clients with this critical issue. In October, Oliver Wyman launched the Climate Action Navigator drawing on insights from across the company. This product helps public and private sector leaders plot a path through climate science, identifying emissions at the industry and regional level and quantifying the effects of multiple different carbon reduction technologies and actions. We believe these tools will give business and government leaders vital insights to achieve their long-term climate goals and be a significant enabler of the transition to low-carbon climate-resilient investment in the corporate sector. 
Mercer recently launched Skills-Edge, an innovative platform, allowing employers to determine the most important skills for their future, and design a talent strategy to assess, acquire and retain them. Skills-Edge provides quantitative insight into the demand and value of skills. It supports both employees and organizations in rapidly reskilling for the future of work. 
And just last week, under the leadership of John Doyle, we launched our Cyber Risk Analytics Center. This brings together cyber risk data and analytics expertise across our firm and provides clients with a comprehensive assessment of their cyber threats, existing and future controls and the potential economic impact. 
We are 1 enterprise, and these are just a few recent examples of how we bring together and leverage knowledge and capabilities across the firm to offer comprehensive solutions to our clients and address their most pressing concerns. We are a growth company as demonstrated by our track record. Growth doesn't just happen. It takes consistent vision, alignment, commitment and execution. Since closing our acquisition of JLT, we have grown our total consolidated revenue by 27%, our adjusted EPS by 34% and our colleague base by 22%. 
Achieving and sustaining growth requires consistent reinvestment in the business. We always strive to balance delivering results in the short term while investing for the long term. In 2021, we generated year-to-date adjusted EPS growth that is higher than any annual period in over 3 decades, while at the same time, investing for the future and making a significant press on hiring. We grew our headcount year-to-date by nearly 5,000 or around 7%, mostly organic adds with an emphasis on client-facing roles. We expect this influx of talent will drive growth, add to our capabilities and enhance our ability to serve clients. 
Now let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Many of the factors that drove the market to harden over the last few years continue, suggesting an inflection to a soft market is unlikely in the near term. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 15% year-over-year, consistent with the second quarter. This marks the 16th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. Looking at pricing by line, the Marsh Market Index showed global property insurance was up 9%, global financial and professional lines were up 32% driven in part by a near doubling in cyber rates, and global casualty rates were up high single digits on average. As a reminder, our index skews to large account business. However, small and middle market insurance rates continue to rise as well, although less than for large complex accounts. 
Turning to reinsurance. Measured and moderate rate increases in global property catastrophe reinsurance witnessed in the first half of 2021 could persist throughout the remainder of the year, reflecting adequate capacity offset by elevated global catastrophes, concerns around real and social inflation and a continuation of large individual risk losses. 2021 marks another year of significant catastrophe losses. Hurricane Ida generated material losses in both the Southeast and the Northeast. This is in addition to a record level of flood losses in Europe, flooding in China and the continuation of wildfire losses in many parts of the world. Marsh & McLennan remains focused on helping our clients navigate these challenging market conditions and making a difference for them in the moments that matter. 
Now let me turn to our terrific third quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.08, which is up 32% versus a year ago, driven by strong top line growth and continued low levels of T&E. Total revenue increased 16% versus a year ago and rose 13% on an underlying basis, the second consecutive quarter of record underlying growth in over 2 decades. 
Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 12% in Consulting. Marsh grew 13% in the quarter on an underlying basis and benefited from strong new business and renewal growth. Guy Carpenter grew 15% on an underlying basis in the quarter, continuing its string of excellent results. Mercer underlying revenue grew 7% in the quarter, the highest in over a decade. Oliver Wyman grew underlying revenue 25%, the second consecutive quarter in excess of 20%. Overall, the third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 19% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points year-over-year. 
Given our excellent third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are on track for a terrific year. We expect to generate the best underlying revenue and adjusted EPS growth in over 2 decades and expand margins for the 14th consecutive year. Our entire organization is on its front foot, focused and aligned, and this is evident in our excellent results. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results."

Our results were outstanding with record third quarter revenue, second consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth, margin expansion and significant earnings growth. Highlights from our third quarter performance included the second straight quarter of 13% underlying growth in RIS, with 13% at Marsh and 15% at Guy Carpenter. And the second consecutive quarter of 12% underlying growth in Consulting with 7% at Mercer and 25% at Oliver Wyman. 
Growth in adjusted earnings per share exceeded 30% for the second quarter in a row. Consolidated revenue increased 16% in the third quarter to $4.6 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 13%. Operating income in the quarter was $740 million, an increase of 37%. Adjusted operating income increased 19% to $759 million, and our adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points to 18.5%. 
GAAP EPS was $1.05 in the quarter, and adjusted EPS increased 32% to $1.08. For the first 9 months of 2021, underlying revenue growth was 10%, our adjusted operating income grew 21% to $3.4 billion, our adjusted operating margin increased 120 basis points, and our adjusted EPS increased 28% to $4.82. 
Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $2.7 billion, up 17% compared with a year ago or 13% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 21% to $403 million. Adjusted operating income also increased 21% to $469 million, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 20.4%. For the first 9 months of the year, revenue was $9 billion with underlying growth of 11%. Adjusted operating income for the first 9 months of the year increased 20% to $2.5 billion, with a margin of 30.3%, up 80 basis points from the same period a year ago. 
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion, up 17% compared with a year ago or 13% on an underlying basis. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and driven by nearly 40% new business growth and solid retention. U.S. and Canada delivered another exceptional quarter with underlying revenue growth of 16%. In international, underlying growth was 9%. Latin America grew 12%, its best growth since the fourth quarter of 2015. Asia Pacific was up 9% and EMEA was up 8%. For the first 9 months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $7.3 billion with underlying growth of 12%. U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 14% and international was up 9%. 
Guy Carpenter's third quarter revenue was $314 million, up 15% compared with a year ago on both a GAAP and underlying basis. Growth was broad-based across geographies and specialties. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 7% or higher underlying growth in 7 of the last 9 quarters. For the first 9 months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.7 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth. 
In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 13% from a year ago or 12% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 45% to $404 million. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to $350 million. The adjusted operating margin was 18.9%, in line with the margin in the third quarter of 2020. 
Consulting generated revenue of $5.7 billion for the first 9 months in 2021, representing underlying growth of 9%. Adjusted operating income for the first 9 months of the year increased 25% to $1.1 billion, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 19.6%. 
Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 7% on an underlying basis, the highest result in over a decade. Career grew 13% on an underlying basis, reflecting the continuing rebound in the global economy and business confidence. Wealth increased 6% on an underlying basis, reflecting strong growth in investment management and modest growth in defined benefits. 
Our assets under delegated management grew to nearly $400 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 24% year-over-year, benefiting from net new inflows and market gains. Health underlying revenue growth was 4% in the quarter, driven by growth outside the U.S. 
Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $610 million, an increase of 25% on an underlying basis. This represents the second consecutive quarter of more than 20% growth as demand remains strong across most geographies and practices. For the first 9 months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.8 billion, an increase of 21% on an underlying basis. 
Adjusted corporate expense was $60 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange had a negligible impact on earnings in Q3. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a modest headwind in the fourth quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $69 million in the quarter, and we expect it will remain at this level in the fourth quarter. 
Investment income was $13 million in the quarter on a GAAP basis and $12 million on an adjusted basis, and mainly reflects gains on our private equity portfolio. Interest expense in the third quarter was $107 million compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting lower debt levels in the period. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense in the fourth quarter to be similar to the amount in the third quarter. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 24.4% compared with 26.5% in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP tax rate was 24.2% in the third quarter, down from 30.3% in the third quarter of 2020, which was impacted by some unusual items. Through the first 9 months of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4% compared with 24.6% last year. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2021, excluding discrete items. 
Given our year-to-date performance, we are on track for an outstanding year. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, keep in mind that comparisons become more challenging given the rebound in growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. We also continue to build for the long term by investing in hiring. While we are excited about the future benefits these investments will deliver, they come with upfront costs we absorb in the short term. That said, we've consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver exceptional results today while investing for the future and expect we will continue to do so. 
Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $10.7 billion of total debt. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in January of 2022 with $500 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy at least $3.5 billion of capital in 2021, of which at least $3 billion will be deployed across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $665 million, and included $272 million for dividends, $93 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases. 
For the first 9 months, uses of cash totaled $2.6 billion and including $750 million for dividends, $566 million for acquisitions, $734 million for share repurchases and $500 million for debt repayment. We had a remarkable third quarter, positioning us well to deliver strong growth in both revenue and adjusted earnings in 2021. 
And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

As we mentioned in the script, our headcount growth year-to-date is up nearly 5,000 across the firm. The highest percentage growth by far is in Marsh and Guy Carpenter. And of course, the majority of the hiring that we've done is in client-facing roles. And so we may not be like other firms and that we generally hire to grow capability and talent rather than direct short-term revenue production. But having said that, we are a people business. Our colleagues are our engine of growth. And undoubtedly, our increased hiring in 2021 will benefit next year and beyond. Sometimes, it takes a bit of time to get all the hires fully integrated into the firm and producing at levels in terms of their own capacity at an optimal level, but we're very comfortable with that. 
And of course, there's a cost factor with that. We're not shy to say sophisticated talent is expensive. But it's worth it, and that's why we pursue it. And I don't want anyone to worry out there about our long-term expense base by all of this hiring. We know how to run the business. Our comp and ben ratio, if I look at Q3 on a rolling 4 quarter basis and then go back 5 years and look at Q3 on a rolling 4-quarter basis is virtually identical.

Prices were up about 15% on average in the quarter, which was consistent with the second quarter. The property market was plus 9% versus plus 12% in the second quarter. It was obviously quite an active cat quarter. Flood and wind and wildfire related losses. But secondary apparels are getting a lot of attention from the underwriting community in the market. 
Casualty was up about 6%, although up closer to double digits globally when you exclude the work comp market, I mean, the United States where things remained pretty competitive. The access market can remain particularly challenging here in the United States, the underwriting community is worried about loss cost inflation. Social inflation really as courts reopen from being largely closed during the pandemic. The financial lines market, I think, on average, is the most difficult market for the moment for our clients. Although having said that, public D&O pricing, it is still up, it's up about 10 points versus 15 points in the second quarter. And that price increase, that rate of increase is the lowest it's been in the last 10 quarters. So starting to see a little bit of settling in that market. 
Without question, the market that is most challenging at the moment is the cyber market, where prices were up more than 90% on average, driven by material growth in ransomware claims that I'm sure you're familiar with, as well as concerns about systemic events. We've got a few events that may be modest compared to what potentially could happen, but underwriters remain concerned about that. 
You asked about clients. They're certainly frustrated by it, for sure. And some are retaining more risk. We've been pretty active in creating new captives and there's a premium growth in the captives that we manage as well. Some are also electing to retain more risk. And then in some cases, of course, the market is forcing some of our clients to retain more risk. So it's client by client and exposure by exposure. As Dan said, we're aggressively working to help our clients navigate the market. I will add that although on average, the price was -- the average increase was the same globally. Most markets did see rate moderation. The United States was really the 1 exception when you look at it on a global basis."

You've got markets that are dealing with real and social inflation. They're dealing with low interest rate environment. And on top of that, we're facing something approaching $100 billion of global catastrophe losses in 2021. So I think it's safe to say the prospect of that will influence property reinsurance pricing at [ 1/1/22 ]. 
But you have to look at the market through various lenses because there's a property market that's been affected by $300 billion plus losses over the last 5 years of catastrophe losses. If you look to the casualty market, the significant underlying rate lift has stabilized and improved significantly property casualty reinsurance contracts. And so I would say the casualty market has been more stable. As John said, and the same is true in reinsurance, if I would suggest to suggest there's one hard element of our market right now, it is cyber. 
I think reinsurers are looking at cyber capacity the same way they look at property catastrophe capacity, where they're going to allocate a certain amount of aggregate and once they hit that aggregate, that's it. So I'd say, as you know, we don't opine on 1/1 pricing or any significant quarter pricing. We believe the market finds its own equilibrium. And as a result of that, we're preparing our clients based on exposure and experience for what they might expect at 1/1. But certainly, the property market, given the fact that this is now the fifth year that reinsurers have had losses is going to be challenging."

I think the days of 9 to 5 or 8 to 6, 5 days a week in the office are over for most companies. And so that will have an impact. It's a longer-term impact because in the short term, you've got your leases established, and we want some social distancing in the office, and we're not sure how this will develop over time. So we're going to be deliberate and flexible, and we're not going to move that quickly on it. 
I mean we've had efforts over many years to become more efficient in our use of space and we've accomplished that quite a bit. And that continues, but that certainly is our view. We also think that T&E won't come back quickly and may not reach the level of 2019 for quite a while. I know in Marsh & McLennan, our view is, yes, we look forward to a day where we're going to visit clients in markets in their location. But we will travel with more purpose. We'll probably travel with less people on various trips, and we'll be more deliberate about it. And I think that our clients will have that expectation as well. So that hop on a plane anytime, anywhere, culture probably takes quite a long time to come back, if ever. 
And so both of those things have expense implications for us that will be positive for shareholders in the long term. And I would say, the other thing is we are constantly seeking efficiency gain. And we're working throughout the firm in order to drive efficiency gain and to become better at operations. So I want to -- why don't I turn it to John for a second, so we can talk a little bit about some of our headcount growth was in OpEx in the effort to drive some efficiency within the Marsh operation. And it's in its early stages, but there was a pretty significant increase in headcount in that area. So John, do you want to talk about that for a second?"

For the fourth quarter, the top line becomes a little bit more challenging, right? Because Marsh grew 4% in the fourth quarter of last year, Carpenter grew 5%, OW grew 4% and Mercer was down 3%. So across the piece, a little bit tougher, but we've got good momentum in the business, and we feel good about this year. We also feel good about next year and the year after. I mean we have been fundamentally improving the company over the last decade. 
We are getting stronger in our capabilities, our geographic breadth, our ability to serve. I mean all of those areas have really dramatically improved, and we believe we are in fundamental growth markets in the areas of risk, strategy and people. I don't care what organization you are and what size, whether you're a large account or a midsized account, you have to address those on a strategic basis and it is incredibly relevant to the C-suites of those companies and organizations to address broadly risk, strategy and people. 
And I think we have enduring competitive advantages as well. I mean, as we were talking before, nothing happens here without our colleagues. I mean the quality of our organization, the talent that we have, the culture that we have, the broad capabilities, the global footprint are all enduring competitive advantages. We also continue to acquire talent in the market and acquire businesses, which improve us and improve our capabilities in particular, in middle market on the brokerage side. So there's a lot of growth opportunities. And just to touch as well on expansion opportunities. I mean we're still weighted into upper middle market and large accounts. We've gotten better in the mid middle market. We're going to continue to get better. We're going to continue to broaden into the lower middle market and small commercial, consumer. You'll see us in all of those areas in the future. 
Now it's not going to be from 1 year to the next, seeing some just massive change, but this is inevitable in terms of how we build out our business. We're leveraging the combined strengths of our organization as 1 enterprise like never before in areas of healthy societies, cyber, protection gaps, climate. I mean all of those areas we're going to market and addressing our clients' issues with them on a broad basis, not on a narrow basis. 
And so our opportunities for revenue growth, in my view, are significant. I won't give you a number right now for 2022. But I think that having not only broken out of the 3% to 5%, but actually tremendously exceeded the 5% level. I think this company can be a real growth firm and that we'll prove that over time. We like to do and then say, rather than the opposite. So I think there will be exciting times at Marsh & McLennan."

The hiring spurt is not going to last forever. But ultimately, we saw an opportunity in the market through dislocation and other factors, and we really pressed on that level. At the end, our expenses are relatively high compared to historical type of expense growth for us, but our expense growth is essentially driven by sales -- by compensation and benefit. But at its very heart, sales compensation due to much higher levels of new business, variable compensation due to much higher levels of profitability and hiring. So comp advantage is driving most of our sales -- most of our expense growth in the quarter and will ease itself out, but it's matching well with current levels of revenue growth. So we feel that this was tremendously opportune time to build capabilities within the firm on an organic basis."

We've improved our margins for 14 consecutive years and the results are really remarkable from a basis point improvement.
Our margin is up 120 bps year-to-date, and that's on top of 120 bps in 2020 and 110 bps in 2019. So there's not a roll in our margins, and I would expect that our margins next year are going to be better than they are this year. And so that's the way we operate the business, but it's an outcome.
No, we don't sit around the table figuring out how we're going to drive margin. What we do is we figure out how we're going to drive underlying growth and earnings. That's the focus of the current -- of the firm and the outcome of margin expansion is how we run the firm where we think not every quarter, but certainly, every year, revenue growth needs to exceed expense growth. And that's what we do and we've done it consistently. And so we're thrilled about where we are.
What I mentioned earlier is that a lot of the expense growth right now is being driven by compensation around sales and around increased profitability. And so that's a really good place to be in. And our earnings growth is very strong, remarkably strong. And so I hope that answers your question."

There's a lot that can happen to cause volatility in a quarter with a cash flow statement, even across a year. But free cash flow growth for us has been a great story over a long period of time. If you go back over a decade, we've generated double-digit growth in free cash flow. And we're up -- if you look year-to-date this year, we're up 5%, and that's on top of 56% growth in free cash flow last year. So I think any growth above a big stair step up last year is pretty good. So I think overall, our cash generation this year is strong, and that's what's enabling us to deploy so much capital."

Why don't I take that and then I'll hand to John and Martine to just say are you seeing inflation in any way in the conversations with clients and what we're hearing from markets. I mean, historically, we've done some work. And we tend to do, as a company, better in inflationary periods. I mean, elements of our revenue base react to inflation, such as higher insured values, and we've proven that we can manage our expense base. And so sometimes the revenue runs a little bit because of  inflation, and we're still managing our expense base.
So when we look back to inflationary periods over the last 25 years, we've tended to outperform and do pretty well. And overall, I'll just mention on the economic environment, not just inflation. I mean there's a lot of positive features about the economic environment, particularly in the United States. I mean, sales are up, consumer spending is up, business confidence is positive, but there are a lot of potential risks. And inflation is probably the biggest one of them, but you also have the supply chain issues that we've all been reading about, the return to office that we're all going to be navigating over the coming months, concerns around COVID variant.
So it is a tremendously difficult time to look forward, say, 4 quarters or so and get a real beat on what the economic performance is, although I do note that most GDP forecast for next year is in that kind of 4% and 5% range, so not bad. But starting with John, what are you hearing from markets and clients around inflation? And then we'll go to Martine."

And Peter mentioned earlier that more than $100 billion worth of cat losses. Of course, we're typically accustomed to demand surge related kind of temporary inflation, if you will, around cat losses. But it's further -- those issues are further exacerbated by the supply chain challenges that we're seeing in markets.
So there's some level of concern there in terms of what it will mean ultimately to loss costs around cats. I mentioned earlier the impact of social inflation around liability claims, particularly here in the United States and a couple of other jurisdictions as quarter 3 opened after the pandemic. And we're seeing some evidence of that, although broad-based evidence is really yet to show itself. Of course, payrolls and employment levels are important from a demand perspective around commercial insurance and work comp, in particular. And so there is concern about wage inflation from some of our clients and the impact on growing costs there.
And maybe with that, I'll hand it to Martine to talk maybe more about the benefits side of things."

One, because our clients really need help in managing these increased costs. So how do they manage through medical inflation, which we believe is coming back now that regular care will resume, which has tended to keep premium a bit lower during COVID. The same thing on wage inflation, looking at accelerating transformation program with clients to address the procurement and the profile of their workforce.
And in terms of pension plans as well, I mean, we have to watch on that. As soon as there is pressures in the economy and system, governance spike up in terms of helping clients manage the asset side of their pension funds more tightly. And therefore, that's usually good for the OCIO business in our investment management solutions. And lastly, from a management of our business, most, if not all, of our multiyear assignments would have automatic adjustment to inflation. So we've seen that moving before some years ago."

And we need to help our clients manage through these pressures and demand, but I think this element of it will be temporary and will settle itself over time.
I mean as clients look at, as I said earlier, transforming, focusing on the skills they need, rather than jobs and roles, we see a very important trend there.
