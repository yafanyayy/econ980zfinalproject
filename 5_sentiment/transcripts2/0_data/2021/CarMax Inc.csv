Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We have a lot of exciting news to cover today. Our comments will focus on material fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 performance insights, updates on our digital enhancements and, of course, the Edmunds acquisition, which we announced this morning. Then we will open it up for your questions. 
For the quarter, total retail used unit sales were down less than 1% from last year's record sales and used unit comps were down 2.3% when compared with the same period a year ago. It's worth spending a moment on the events driving our results for the fourth quarter. As we discussed on our last call, entering the quarter, retail sales were pressured due to a surge in COVID-19 cases, which tightened occupancy restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. Sales began to accelerate towards the end of December and into January. By the beginning of February, we were trending towards mid-single-digit comp growth for the quarter, excluding the impact of Leap Day in the prior year. However, starting in the middle of February, retail sales were affected by the severe winter weather across a large portion of the U.S., closing more than 65 stores in 1 day. Sales were also impacted by delays in tax refunds relative to last year's timing and a lower inventory position due to COVID and weather-related production constraints. 
On a 2-year stack, total retail used unit sales for the fourth quarter of FY '21 were up 13.8% and used unit comps were up 8.7%. March sales were robust when compared with both COVID-impacted March last year and a record March in 2019. During the month, the initial distribution of tax refund and stimulus checks began, weather improved and customers continue to respond favorably to our ongoing digital enhancements and other strategic initiatives. In addition, the underlying metrics we track, including website visits, online progression and activity at our customer experience centers, or CECs, indicate continued healthy demand for used vehicles as we head into April. 
Full year market share data indicates that our share of 0- to 10-year old vehicles in our current comp markets fell from approximately 4.7% in 2019 to 4.3% in calendar 2020. We had strong momentum entering the year, and we're gaining significant market share up until the start of the pandemic, when 95% of the country was under shelter-in-place orders and approximately half of our locations were closed or under limited operations. As markets reopened and our omnichannel experience was launched nationwide, we began gaining market share again. During the last 5 months of 2020, we saw market share gains, and we expect those gains to accelerate in 2021. 
Atlanta, where we have been in operations since 1995 and our most mature omnichannel market, continues to outperform the company, maintaining its market share in 2020 despite pressure from COVID. During the last 5 months of the calendar year, our market share in Atlanta increased 13.8%. Over the past 2 years since we first introduced our omnichannel experience, our market share in Atlanta has increased 10.9%. 
Retail gross profit per used unit for the fourth quarter was $2,086 compared with $2,195 last year. This GPU is consistent with our expectations and commentary on the last quarter's call. It reflects the impact of the expanded pricing and marketing tests we rolled out in select markets in combination with our national multimedia marketing campaign and the improvements to our omnichannel experience. Early results for these tests were positive, so we expanded to more markets in the quarter. We're going to continue with testing while also monitoring macro factors. We expect to maintain attractive margins above $2,000 in the first quarter. Enrique will provide additional details around the profitability flow-through on different aspects of our business that are contributing to the success of these tests in just a moment. 
Our wholesale business delivered another good quarter when you consider the impact of 1 less auction day compared with the same period last year. For the fourth quarter, wholesale volume was down 1.2%. Wholesale gross profit per unit was comparable to the prior year at $990 per unit. We estimate the 1 less auction day in this quarter impacted the number of wholesale units sold by several percentage points. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique to provide more information on our fourth quarter financial performance; and then to Jon, who will provide additional detail around customer financing. Enrique?"
356805,699215253,2245869,"CarMax, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 01, 2021",2021-04-01,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, other gross profit decreased $4 million or 3.2%. This decrease was due to a $14 million reduction in service profits driven largely by our previously announced year-end thank you bonus for 22,00",989,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. 
For the quarter, other gross profit decreased $4 million or 3.2%. This decrease was due to a $14 million reduction in service profits driven largely by our previously announced year-end thank you bonus for 22,000 full and part-time associates across the company, many of whom work in our reconditioning and service functions, bonuses related to production glitches and company support pay related to COVID. Partially offsetting this was favorability in EPP and third-party finance fees. EPP grew $2.6 million year-over-year for the quarter, driven by a favorable reserve adjustment and an increase in profit sharing revenue. This was partially offset by lower sales volume and a slightly lower penetration rate in the quarter. Third-party finance fees improved by $7.7 million in the quarter primarily due to the renegotiated fees with our partners, which Jon will talk about shortly. 
For SG&A, expenses for the fourth quarter increased 14.7% or approximately $71 million to $556 million. SG&A per unit was $2,713, a year-over-year deleverage of $368 per unit on the quarter. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by an increase in stock-based compensation of $33 million or a deleverage of $160 per unit; an increase in advertising expense of $23 million or a deleverage of $115 per unit, which was in line with our previously communicated expectations as we focus on heavier support for our next brand campaign; and continued spending to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives. Our approach to SG&A and costs heading into next year remains consistent. We will continue to invest in our business at this inflection point in our industry, specifically in marketing and in our strategic initiatives. 
Regarding marketing. As we head into next fiscal year, we expect our spend to remain elevated with similar per unit trends experienced in the second half of fiscal 2021. Our advertising spend will continue to focus on clearly differentiating our brand and demonstrating the benefits of our omnichannel experience, in addition to ROI-based digital investments that are delivering strong results. Included within this spend is an increased focus on vehicle acquisition. We believe we are well positioned to aggressively grab market share through the promotion of our omnichannel experience and new product offerings such as Love Your Car Guarantee. 
We also remain focused on ensuring we are appropriately managing our spend, targeting specific areas of opportunity. This includes our CECs, which are maturing and becoming more efficient and effective through automation, data-driven algorithms and smart routing with the goal of ensuring customers get the right support. This past year, our CECs were more efficient than the prior year, and we expect this trend will accelerate in FY '22. 
Regarding our SG&A leverage point in FY '22. We would expect to require a 5% to 8% comp on a 2-year stacked basis in FY '22 to lever in FY '22. As previously communicated, in periods of investment like we are in now, we'll need to be at the higher end of the range to lever. This 2-year comp approach is reflective of the impacts of lapping over COVID and due to the continued investments in the business we made this past year. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the financial aspects of the pricing tests we ran in the fourth quarter. As Bill mentioned, we like what we have seen so far. While these tests confirm what we have historically seen regarding price elasticity, several factors have changed, resulting in a stronger flow-through from the increased sales and thereby, resulting in greater profitability. These factors include higher profitability levels of our CAF originations, our lower variable cost structure as we continue to leverage our centralized CECs and the favorable changes to our third-party lender fee structure. As mentioned earlier, we will continue to perform pricing tests in the first quarter while also monitoring macro factors. Our goal remains to maximize both unit sales and long-term profitability. 
Our unique and diversified business model still generated a significant amount of cash this past year, despite a challenging environment. From a capital allocation perspective, this positions us well to reinvest in the growth of our core business, fund new growth opportunities such as our announced acquisition of Edmunds, and return capital back to our shareholders. Regarding Edmunds, we expect to pay for the transaction with a combination of cash and equity. We anticipate this transaction will close in June and expect their financials to have an immaterial impact to CarMax's EPS in fiscal year '22. We are confident this transaction will provide significant shareholder value creation over the longer term. 
We continued executing our share repurchase program. And during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares for $66 million. We currently have $1.34 billion of authorizations remaining, and we are committed to returning capital back to our shareholders. For capital expenditures, we anticipate approximately $350 million in FY '22. As we've pivoted our business to be more technology-driven, the profile of our CapEx has followed suit. Approximately 1/3 of our capital spend in FY '22 will be focused on investments in technology, up from about 15% just 4 years ago. 
In FY '22, we plan to open 10 new locations, with the first grand opening expected later this month. As was the case with our more recent openings, these locations are predominantly cross-functional stores and have a smaller footprint and can leverage our scale and the presence of other locations in nearby markets. Our national footprint and nationwide logistics network continue to be a competitive advantage for CarMax, and we remain committed to an appropriate level of investment on these differentiated assets. 
We are confident that the foundational investments we are making in our omnichannel experience, our proprietary tech stack, and our highly recognizable and trusted brand set us up for accelerated market share gains in 2021. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon."
356805,699215253,2245869,"CarMax, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 01, 2021",2021-04-01,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. CarMax Auto Finance and our lending partners once again delivered solid results. For the fourth quarter, CAF's penetration, net of 3-day payoffs, was 43.5% compared with 43% a year ago. Tier 2 was up slightly",595,"Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. 
CarMax Auto Finance and our lending partners once again delivered solid results. For the fourth quarter, CAF's penetration, net of 3-day payoffs, was 43.5% compared with 43% a year ago. Tier 2 was up slightly to 21% of used unit sales compared with 20.5% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 9.5% compared with 10% a year ago. This distribution across the credit tiers is primarily reflective of the credit mix of applicants observed in the fourth quarter. 
Year-over-year, CAF's net loans originated were comparable to the prior year quarter at $1.8 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.5%, up from 7.9% a year ago and down slightly from 8.6% in the third quarter. Similar to the third quarter, this year-over-year difference in APR is attributed to the mix of CAF customers seen within the Tier 1 space rather than an increase in the rate charged to these customers. 
Regarding the portfolio, the overall interest margin increased to 6.4% versus 5.8% in the same period last year as we continue to realize significant benefit from lower funding costs. Our most recent securitization in January closed with a near record spread between the APR we charge to customers and the rate we pay to fund the receivables. Our ABS investors continue to recognize the consistency and performance of the CarMax origination channel, and we appreciate their support. 
CAF income was up 68% to $188 million in the quarter, reflecting a reduced loss provision plus an increase in interest margin. The provision for loan losses was $5 million, resulting in an ending reserve balance of $411 million for the fourth quarter. The total reserve is 2.97% of managed receivables, which is lower than the 3.17% at the end of the third quarter. Our reserve as a percentage of managed receivables has trended downward over the past 3 quarters, as our customers have exhibited a willingness to make payments even in these continued challenging times. We believe our current reserve is adequate and considers both the positive payment behavior recently observed as well as the future uncertainty of the macro environment. 
I would also like to provide an update on the arrangements we have with our third-party lenders that Enrique referenced earlier. Our agreements with our partners have resulted in CarMax historically receiving a $300 participation fee for each of the agreed-upon finance contracts purchased within the Tier 2 space. Within the more subprime Tier 3 space, where CAF keeps approximately 5% of the volume, CarMax has historically offered lending partners a $1,000 discount for providing financing to a customer that we believe would otherwise not be able to purchase a vehicle from CarMax. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, this Tier 2 participation fee increased to $400 and our Tier 3 discount was reduced to $750. If this structure had been in place for the entirety of FY '21 and penetration rates remain the same, it would have resulted in annual savings of approximately $30 million or $40 on a per unit basis. 
With regard to future changes in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 space, as of March 2021, CAF has begun to methodically increase its percent of Tier 3 volume beyond the 5% level, and we anticipate reaching and maintaining a 10% share in Tier 3 by May 31 this year. CarMax will continue to evaluate the lending environment and will consider future adjustments, if and when, we believe those changes are sustainable and in the best interest of our long-term business goals. Bill?"

Our 2021 fiscal year was one of the most challenging operating environments we've ever faced. But due to our ability to act quickly in rapidly changing circumstances, we delivered new customer experiences and continue to innovate while remaining financially strong. That financial strength has enabled us to continue to aggressively invest in our core business and pursue new growth opportunities. 
Some highlights from this year that will have a lasting impact are as follows: the completion of the national rollout of our omnichannel experience, giving us a common platform across all of CarMax that leverages our scale, nationwide footprint and infrastructure; the move of all wholesale auctions into a virtual environment; the national expansion of our new online instant appraisal offering on carmax.com and edmunds.com, strengthening our leadership as the largest buyer and positioning us to become the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers; and finally, the introduction of the Love Your Car Guarantee, an industry-leading signature customer experience. All of these were possible because of our exceptional associates. They came together to take care of each other and our customers while also innovating for the future. Customer response to our omnichannel offering is strong, and we are continuing to work to further improve and enhance the digital customer experience at every step of the sale. 
One critical advantage of our omnichannel model is the ability for the customer to choose how they progress their experience. As previously discussed, our initial rollout of our omnichannel platform enables customers to buy a vehicle online. The parts of the transaction may have required assistance from our CECs. In the fourth quarter, we made significant progress enabling self-service for all components of the sale. Exiting the quarter, approximately 25% of our customers were eligible to buy vehicle online independently if they chose, up significantly from the third quarter. We expect most of our customers to have visibility by the end of the second quarter. 
Additionally, in Q4, about 3/4 of our customers advanced their transaction digitally with approximately 5% buying the vehicle online. We consider an online purchase to be when all major activity leading up to the purchase is performed independent of our stores. We expect our online sales will grow robustly as we continue to enhance our marketing and digital capabilities. 
As a reminder, we will be hosting a virtual Analyst Day on May 6, where we will take a deeper dive into our online capabilities and our technology and data advantages. At that time, we will also discuss new metrics around online orders and how they are fulfilled as well as providing insight on our longer-term outlook and expectations. 
Now I'll take a moment to highlight some recent enhancements we have made to the customer experience. First is our online instant appraisal offer, which allows us to quickly give customers an offer on their vehicle. This offering was first introduced and tested on edmunds.com in June. In February, we completed the national rollout of this offering on carmax.com. Early response has been strong with online bias quickly exceeding our expectations, providing us with a clear pathway to become the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers. At the end of the fourth quarter, we launched the ability for customers to get penny perfect transactable financing offers in our online checkout process. With this enhancement, customers can apply and accept finance offers without needing the assistance of an associate to submit a credit application over the phone or in the store. We are rapidly expanding this feature to our overall customer base in the first quarter. 
We know our customer-centric approach is a differentiator for CarMax, and we will never stop innovating on behalf of our customers. In January, we introduced our new industry-leading signature customer experience, Love Your Car Guarantee. This gives customers the ability to take 24-hour test drives before committing to purchase and extends our 7-day money back guarantee to a 30-day money back guarantee, which is unmatched in the automotive industry. It's too early to identify trends, but preliminary results show these offerings are highly valued by our customers. 
As we continue enhancing our online experience and offerings, it's important to educate our customers on our omnichannel experience to differentiate and elevate the CarMax brand and our position in this evolving marketplace. In the fourth quarter, we introduced the next phase of our national multimedia marketing campaign that began last year to increase awareness of our core omnichannel capabilities, which was highly successful. We set records every week for web visits since being introduced, reaching more than 8 million weekly visits by the end of February. After the campaign launch, web traffic and Google query volumes were both up over 25% versus the prior months. We want to continue this momentum and ensure customers understand that CarMax offers the ultimate flexibility to shop and buy on their terms, their way. Accordingly, as Enrique mentioned earlier, we are planning on increasing our spend on both awareness and acquisition marketing in FY '22. 
We will continue to evolve our business as an omnichannel retailer by innovating at an accelerated pace, leveraging our scale across technology, data, talent and physical assets to unlock opportunities to compete across the used auto ecosystem. This is why we're excited to announce that we've signed a definitive agreement to acquire Edmunds, one of the most influential and popular automotive research sites in the world. Over the past years, our teams have had the opportunity to collaborate with Edmunds on a number of strategic initiatives, including our instant online appraisal offer and leveraging its proprietary content on carmax.com. We've been extremely impressed with its technology, content and online experience as well as its talented tech and creative teams. We believe we can both unlock additional value by working together to streamline the user experience across the entire car buying and selling journey, in addition to identifying other digitally focused opportunities. 
One thing that has become clear is that we share a commitment of delivering the highest quality online experience to our customers and dealers. Edmunds is a widely recognized and deeply trusted brand. It will continue to operate its core business independently and will remain focused on delivering confidence to consumers and excellent value to its dealer and OEM clients. We are confident this transaction will drive shareholder value as we are able to leverage our combined size, scale and extensive industry expertise for the benefit of both businesses. 
To sum up, we are very proud of our performance during this difficult year. We're even more excited about how our continued investments in our existing business and in Edmunds are positioning us to be further differentiated and even more competitive. We expect robust top line, bottom line and market share growth for the upcoming year that is a result of not only lapping COVID, but demonstrating the impact of the investments we've made and the experiences we are providing. 
At this point, we will be happy to take your questions. Carol?"

So you are right. At the end of the quarter, our salable inventory is low. But again, that is a function of the fact that we had some COVID and weather shutdowns. So in the rise in COVID, we had to shut down some production locations. We also had some production locations shut down because of the weather. And so that's really why we're a little bit behind on salable inventory. At the end of the quarter, I think we were down about 20% on salable inventory. 
I would just point out, though, that if you look at our overall inventory year-over-year, we're actually up a little bit. So we've got the inventory. It's just a matter of producing. In fact, I think we ended the quarter north of 155,000 units. So it's just a matter of of working through that, and we're confident. We have the capacity.

I think an important point to note here is, though, because of CECL regulation, we will have to -- as we book those loans, reserve for the full loss impact of that immediately.

I certainly want to continue to buy every single one that we can. If I think about the total addressable market, 40 million used cars exchange hands every year. And in that number, obviously, is person to person. So that's how I kind of think about the overall market. 
And as far as the online appraisal offer, yes, we're really excited about this. It's exceeding our expectations on carmax.com, we really got it up kind of middle of February, so we only have the partial month. And obviously, we've been testing, so we have seen some trends before that. But if I look at the quarter as a whole, the online buys were about 10% of the total appraisal lane buys that we made. And of that, just because we got the carmax.com up towards the end of the quarter, most of those buyers came through our relationship with Edmunds. But as I said, just the trajectory of where we see those things going, we think in very short order, we'll buy more than anyone else online from consumers."

I mean, obviously, the market itself is very tight right now without a lot of flow into the secondary market, the used market. But there's also a lot of dealers and maybe even some new competition that are there grabbing vehicles or buying vehicles as well to resale. And particularly with the new vehicle dealers, they're higher in the funnel and getting access to some trade homes, obviously, as people are selling new vehicles. So Bill, just curious, as you think about this going forward, how much of this tightness in supply that you can get for yourselves to retail is transitory? And how much of it is somewhat more of a secular shift than an increased focus by the dealers and maybe the other competition and is making it a little bit harder to get inventory? And then also, is this Edmunds purchase or acquisition, really, the key here is focused on sourcing vehicles online. Is that really what this is? Because I know it's a big lead generator for a lot of dealers. So there's a lot of other angles to what Edmunds delivers, but it is the key to you sourcing these vehicles directly from the consumer online?"

First of all, as we've been talking about for several quarters, vehicle acquisition is a strategic initiative that we've been focused on. And to your point, if you look at the supply out there, yes, the supply is probably going down a little bit versus prior years. The great thing for us is that we get such a large amount through the appraisal lane, it really helps to alleviate anything outside of CarMax. Our focus with the online is to continue to drive as much as we can of buying vehicles right from the consumers. And we see this as a potential to really increase our self-sufficiency, which we think is a huge competitive advantage. And again, it's one of the reasons why we've been focused on it and we'll continue to invest in here. 
Now as far as Edmunds goes, look, the online piece of Edmunds, that's only a small piece. It's only a small benefit of the whole transaction. That's not the reason that we have decided to acquire Edmund. It absolutely has been a successful partnership on that piece of it, and we think there's a lot of opportunity to still do on the acquisition. But there's other components, we've been working with the content, for example. There's other things that admins that we feel like having the 2 companies come together will take 2 great companies and strengthen both of them. So self-sufficiency and buying through the A lane, increasing that, whether it be through online or through the traditional A lane is absolutely a focus for us going forward."

We talked a little about, in John's question, while the supply has tightened up a little bit, you've got some things going on the new car side as far as new car availability. We've got tax refunds that are going that have been delayed and kind of pushing into March, you've got stimulus money out there. So there's a lot of different things kind of going on.

However, what we've seen is greater profitability flow-through, and there's really kind of 2 reasons why we've seen that greater flow-through. Number one is higher finance income so CAF originations, much more profitable in this environment as well as the renegotiated third-party finance fees. And the second is just lower variable costs as we migrate towards our CECs. And so we've been really pleased with the results. We've seen, again, increased sales and increased profitability.

I can't believe it's taking us like 5 or 6 questions for somebody to actually ask about the sales performance, but I appreciate you asking. Look, if I think about March, as I said in the opening remarks, it's robust. And actually, it's a great -- March has been a great month for us. It's been a record month for us. We've sold more than 100,000 cars in the month of March for the first time in the company's history. And I would tell you, it doesn't really make sense to think about comps this year versus last year just because of the COVID impact. The way I think about them is we should really be comparing them to March of 2019. So 2 years ago, March of 2019 was the old record of number of vehicles that we sold. And what I'm most encouraged about is if I compare our March performance this year to 2 years ago, we're seeing double-digit growth on top of that March, which just really speaks to a lot of the things that are going on. 
I mean, sure, some of what's going on in macro factors beyond our control. When you think about the pushing of the tax -- some of the tax refund money into March, you think about the stimulus, I absolutely get that, and that's helping drive some of that tailwind. But we're really excited about the tailwind beyond that. So we're -- as we said in our opening remarks, we're excited about 2021. I think the quarter -- I'm sorry, 2022 -- FY 2022. The quarter, unfortunately, it's just -- it's the ending of a very volatile year for us. I would just remind everyone, if you go back to FY '20, it was a great year, double-digit top line growth, high mid-single-digit comp growth. We continue that into the beginning of FY '21, up until the point we hit the pandemic. And then since the pandemic has been in place, it's obviously been a very volatile year. Looking at the fourth quarter, the pandemic also started -- caused some of the volatility at the beginning of the quarter with the December. And we talked about that in the last call, we had a big surge in COVID cases. And we had a bunch of markets that went back into lockdown mode. 
I'll give you one example. The state of California, which has been typically 1 of the most restrictive states, limiting occupancy to 20% and 25%, that went back into that mode of 20%, 25% in December. A market like that, what we saw is that occupancy restriction causes that market to perform on average north of 10% worse than the rest of the organization. So we had that headwind on the occupancy restrictions in December and in January. Both of those 2 months, we had more than 50 stores that were less than 50% occupancy. And that -- less than 50% is difficult for us. You get to 50% above, we can work through that. But just given the traffic that comes into our store, it's hard to manage that. But that being said, we started out December, negative 4, we're able to do better than that at the end of December. We were still negative. But then coming into January, and if I look at January, it was the most normal, if there is such thing, normal month. We didn't have tax refund delays. We didn't have bad weather. What we really had to contend with were these occupancy restrictions. And even with the occupancy restrictions, we were seeing comps north of 7% in January, which we feel great about. And I really do think that's continuing some of the trends that we saw in the prior year and our investments coming forward. Then we get into February, clipping along. And like I said in the opening remarks, we were looking -- even though we started out in the hall, we were looking at a mid-single-digit comp, excluding the impact of Leap Day. Now keep in mind, Leap Day last year was a Saturday. And our stores are at the busiest day of the week. So excluding that, we were a mid-single-digit comp, and then we hit the weather constraints and just the delay of the tax refunds. I think in February, returns were down about 30% year-over-year. So that's a little bit more color on that, let me pass it to Jon to talk about the other questions."

So all those things together, I just made it feel like it was the right time. I think some might want to drive home, though, as we think about fees or our entire platform, whether it be the fees and discounts, the partners that we have in the platform, where cap participates in the platform, the most important thing we're looking to deliver from our finance platform is highly competitive offers across the credit spectrum in all economic environments. And we want to do that such that we can scale that as CarMax scales. So we're always going to look at that platform and look to optimize it, felt the right time to make the fee changes now, but we were very careful and looked at what the impact of sales were there.

I think the other thing to remember is when we roll new things out. So for example, if you think about self-serve, the first market we put that in is Atlanta. Generally, we roll things there first.

So we take that part of how we manage our overall margin and at times, we'll take some of those synergies, and we'll obviously pass along in prices, which would be really hard for you guys to see. Other times, obviously, we have the option to manage our margin and get to the margin where we want to be.

So as far as the sales shift, really it's hard to quantify, especially break it down between the weather and the delay in tax refunds.

So as far as the sales shift, really it's hard to quantify, especially break it down between the weather and the delay in tax refunds. I think the best way to think about that is kind of how I talked about it earlier that coming into February, middle of February, we would have -- excluding the impact of the Leap Day, we would have been running about a mid-single-digit comp. And obviously, that's not where we ended up. So that's one way to think about. We ended up at negative 2, 3. That's one way to think about weather and the taxes combined. But it's really hard to parse out. And it's hard to know exactly, obviously, how much is impacted. 
So as far as the alternative delivery, just to remind everybody, alternative delivery is both home delivery, but it's also express pickup or curbside pickup. That's still -- we're seeing still -- it's under 10% of overall delivery. And again, that's a number, while we have reported out on it, it's one that -- it's not like we're trying to drive that. Again, this is all about giving the customer the experience they want. If they want home delivery, great. They want to pick it up in the store, great. So -- but to answer your question, it's about -- it's under 10% of the overall. 
I think the other thing, Rajat, is the thing that I introduced, which is the online sales. That's kind of a new way, a new metric that we're -- we talked about on this call. And obviously, in May, we'll have more on these on these metrics. But 5% of our customers essentially did the whole transaction online. And then to us, we don't care how they get it fulfilled, whether it's in the store or if it's at-home. And we expect that 5% to continue to go up."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We have a lot of exciting news to cover today. Our comments will focus on material fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 performance insights, updates on our digital enhancement and, of course, the Edmunds acquisition, which we announced this morning. Then we will open it up for your questions.  
For the quarter, total retail used unit sales were down less than 1% from last year's record sales, and used unit comps were down 2.3% when compared with the same period a year ago. It's worth spending a moment on the events driving our results for the fourth quarter. 
As we discussed on our last call, entering the quarter, retail sales were pressured due to a surge in COVID-19 cases, which tightened occupancy restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. Sales began to accelerate towards the end of December and into January. By the beginning of February, we were trending towards mid-single-digit comp growth for the quarter, excluding the impact of Leap Day in the prior year. 
However, starting in the middle of February, retail sales were affected by the severe winter weather across a large portion of the U.S., closing more than 65 stores in 1 day. Sales were also impacted by delays in tax refunds relative to last year's timing and a lower inventory position due to COVID and weather-related production constraints.  
On a 2-year stack, total retail used unit sales for the fourth quarter of FY '21 were up 13.8%, and used unit comps were up 8.7%. March sales were robust when compared with both COVID-impacted March last year and a record March in 2019. During the month, the initial distribution of tax refund and stimulus checks began, weather improved and customers continue to respond favorably to our ongoing digital enhancement and other strategic initiatives.  
In addition, the underlying metrics we track, including website visits, online progression and activity at our customer experience centers, or CECs, indicate continued healthy demand for used vehicles as we head into April.  
Full year market share data indicates that our share of 0- to 10-year old vehicles in our current comp markets fell from approximately 4.7% in 2019 to 4.3% in calendar 2020. We had strong momentum entering the year, and we're gaining significant market share up until the start of the pandemic, when 95% of the country was under shelter-in-place orders and approximately half of our locations were closed or under limited operations. 
As markets reopened and our omnichannel experience was launched nationwide, we began gaining market share again. During the last 5 months of 2020, we saw market share gains, and we expect those gains to accelerate in 2021.  
Atlanta, where we have been in operations since 1995, and our most mature omnichannel market, continues to outperform the company, maintaining its market share in 2020, despite pressure from COVID. During the last 5 months of the calendar year, our market share in Atlanta increased 13.8%. Over the past 2 years, since we first introduced our omnichannel experience, our market share in Atlanta has increased 10.9%.  
Retail gross profit per used unit for the fourth quarter was $2,086 compared with $2,195 last year. This GPU is consistent with our expectations and commentary on the last quarter's call. It reflects the impact of the expanded pricing and marketing test we rolled out in select markets, in combination with our national multimedia marketing campaign and the improvements to our omnichannel experience. 
Early results for these tests were positive, so we expanded to more markets in the quarter. We're going to continue with testing, while also monitoring macro factors. We expect to maintain attractive margins above $2,000 in the first quarter. Enrique will provide additional details around the profitability flow-through on different aspects of our business that are contributing to the success of these tests in just a moment.  
Our wholesale business delivered another good quarter when you consider the impact of one less auction day compared with the same period last year. For the fourth quarter, wholesale volume was down 1.2%. Wholesale gross profit per unit was comparable to the prior year at $990 per unit. We estimate the one less auction day in this quarter impacted the number of wholesale units sold by several percentage points.  
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique to provide more information on our fourth quarter financial performance; and then to Jon, who will provide additional detail around customer financing. Enrique?"

For the quarter, other gross profit decreased $4 million or 3.2%. This decrease was due to a $14 million reduction in service profits driven largely by our previously announced year-end thank you bonus for 22,0",990,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.  
For the quarter, other gross profit decreased $4 million or 3.2%. This decrease was due to a $14 million reduction in service profits driven largely by our previously announced year-end thank you bonus for 22,000 full and part-time associates across the company, many of whom work in our reconditioning and service functions, bonuses related to production glitches and company support pay related to COVID. 
Partially offsetting this was favorability in EPP and third-party finance fees. EPP grew $2.6 million year-over-year for the quarter driven by a favorable reserve adjustment and an increase in profit sharing revenue. This was partially offset by lower sales volume and a slightly lower penetration rate in the quarter. Third-party finance fees improved by $7.7 million in the quarter primarily due to the renegotiated fees with our partners, which Jon will talk about shortly.  
For SG&A, expenses for the fourth quarter increased 14.7% or approximately $71 million to $556 million. SG&A per unit was $2,713, a year-over-year deleverage of $368 per unit on the quarter. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by an increase in stock-based compensation of $33 million or a deleverage of $160 per unit; an increase in advertising expense of $23 million or a deleverage of $115 per unit, which was in line with our previously communicated expectations as we focus on heavier support for our next brand campaign; and continued spending to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives. 
Our approach to SG&A and costs heading into next year remains consistent. We will continue to invest in our business at this inflection point in our industry, specifically in marketing and in our strategic initiatives.  
Regarding marketing. As we head into next fiscal year, we expect our spend to remain elevated with similar per unit trends experienced in the second half of fiscal 2021. Our advertising spend will continue to focus on clearly differentiating our brand and demonstrating the benefits of our omnichannel experience, in addition to ROI-based digital investments that are delivering strong results. 
Included within this spend is an increased focus on vehicle acquisition. We believe we are well positioned to aggressively grab market share through the promotion of our omnichannel experience and new product offerings, such as Love Your Car Guarantee.  
We also remain focused on ensuring we are appropriately managing our spend, targeting specific areas of opportunity. This includes our CECs, which are maturing and becoming more efficient and effective through automation, data-driven algorithms and smart routing with the goal of ensuring customers get the right support. This past year, our CECs were more efficient than the prior year, and we expect this trend will accelerate in FY '22.  
Regarding our SG&A leverage point in FY '22. We would expect to require a 5% to 8% comp on a 2-year stacked basis in FY '22 to lever in FY '22. As previously communicated, in periods of investment like we are in now, we'll need to be at the higher end of the range to lever. This 2-year comp approach is reflective of the impacts of lapping over COVID and due to the continued investments in the business we made this past year.  
Now I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the financial aspects of the pricing tests we ran in the fourth quarter. As Bill mentioned, we like what we have seen so far. While these tests confirm what we have historically seen regarding price elasticity, several factors have changed, resulting in a stronger flow-through from the increased sales and, thereby, resulting in greater profitability. 
These factors include higher profitability levels of our CAF originations, our lower variable cost structure as we continue to leverage our centralized CECs and the favorable changes to our third-party lender fee structure. As mentioned earlier, we will continue to perform pricing tests in the first quarter, while also monitoring macro factors. Our goal remains to maximize both unit sales and long-term profitability.
Our unique and diversified business model still generated a significant amount of cash this past year, despite a challenging environment. From a capital allocation perspective, this positions us well to reinvest in the growth of our core business, fund new growth opportunities such as our announced acquisition of Edmunds, and return capital back to our shareholders. 
Regarding Edmunds, we expect to pay for the transaction with a combination of cash and equity. We anticipate this transaction will close in June and expect their financials to have an immaterial impact to CarMax's EPS in fiscal year '22. We are confident this transaction will provide significant shareholder value creation over the longer term.  
We continued executing our share repurchase program, and during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares for $66 million. We currently have $1.34 billion of authorizations remaining, and we are committed to returning capital back to our shareholders. 
For capital expenditures, we anticipate approximately $350 million in FY '22. As we've pivoted our business to be more technology driven, the profile of our CapEx has followed suit. Approximately 1/3 of our capital spend in FY '22 will be focused on investments in technology, up from about 15% just 4 years ago.  
In FY '22, we plan to open 10 new locations, with the first grand opening expected later this month. As was the case with our more recent openings, these locations are predominantly cross-functional stores and have a smaller footprint and can leverage our scale and the presence of other locations in nearby markets. Our national footprint and nationwide logistics network continue to be a competitive advantage for CarMax, and we remain committed to an appropriate level of investment on these differentiated assets.  
We are confident that the foundational investments we are making in our omnichannel experience, our proprietary tech stack and our highly recognizable and trusted brand set us up for accelerated market share gains in 2021.  
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon."
356805,699215253,2245916,"CarMax, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 01, 2021",2021-04-01,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone.  CarMax Auto Finance and our lending partners once again delivered solid results. For the fourth quarter, CAF's penetration, net of 3-day payoffs, was 43.5% compared with 43% a year ago. Tier 2 was up sligh",595,"Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone.  
CarMax Auto Finance and our lending partners once again delivered solid results. For the fourth quarter, CAF's penetration, net of 3-day payoffs, was 43.5% compared with 43% a year ago. 
Tier 2 was up slightly to 21% of used unit sales compared with 20.5% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 9.5% compared with 10% a year ago. This distribution across the credit tiers is primarily reflective of the credit mix of applicants observed in the fourth quarter.  
Year-over-year, CAF's net loans originated were comparable to the prior year quarter at $1.8 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.5%, up from 7.9% a year ago and down slightly from 8.6% in the third quarter. Similar to the third quarter, this year-over-year difference in APR is attributed to the mix of CAF customers seen within the Tier 1 space, rather than an increase in the rate charged to these customers.  
Regarding the portfolio. The overall interest margin increased to 6.4% versus 5.8% in the same period last year, as we continue to realize significant benefit from lower funding costs. Our most recent securitization in January closed with a near record spread between the APR we charge to customers and the rate we pay to fund the receivables. Our ABS investors continue to recognize the consistency and performance of the CarMax origination channel, and we appreciate their support.  
CAF income was up 68% to $188 million in the quarter, reflecting a reduced loss provision, plus an increase in interest margin. The provision for loan losses was $5 million, resulting in an ending reserve balance of $411 million for the fourth quarter. The total reserve is 2.97% of managed receivables, which is lower than the 3.17% at the end of the third quarter. 
Our reserve as a percentage of managed receivables has trended downward over the past 3 quarters, as our customers have exhibited a willingness to make payments, even in these continued challenging times. We believe our current reserve is adequate and considers both the positive payment behavior recently observed as well as the future uncertainty of the macro environment.  
I would also like to provide an update on the arrangements we have with our third-party lenders that Enrique referenced earlier. Our agreements with our partners have resulted in CarMax historically receiving a $300 participation fee for each of the agreed-upon finance contracts purchased within the Tier 2 space. Within the more subprime Tier 3 space, where CAF keeps approximately 5% of the volume, CarMax has historically offered lending partners a $1,000 discount for providing financing to a customer that we believe would otherwise not be able to purchase a vehicle from CarMax. 
At the beginning of the fourth quarter, this Tier 2 participation fee increased to $400, and our Tier 3 discount was reduced to $750. If this structure have been in place for the entirety of FY '21, and penetration rates remain the same, it would have resulted in annual savings of approximately $30 million or $40 on a per unit basis.  
With regard to future changes in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 space, as of March 2021, CAF has begun to methodically increase its percent of Tier 3 volume beyond the 5% level, and we anticipate reaching and maintaining a 10% share in Tier 3 by May 31 this year. 
CarMax will continue to evaluate the lending environment and will consider future adjustments, if and when, we believe those changes are sustainable and in the best interest of our long-term business goals. Bill?"

Our 2021 fiscal year was one of the most challenging operating environments we've ever faced.

Our 2021 fiscal year was one of the most challenging operating environments we've ever faced. But due to our ability to act quickly in rapidly changing circumstances, we delivered new customer experiences and continue to innovate, while remaining financially strong. That financial strength has enabled us to continue to aggressively invest in our core business and pursue new growth opportunities.  
Some highlights from this year that will have a lasting impact are as follows: the completion of the national rollout of our omnichannel experience, giving us a common platform across all of CarMax that leverages our scale, nationwide footprint and infrastructure; the move of all wholesale auctions into a virtual environment; the national expansion of our new online instant appraisal offering on carmax.com and edmunds.com, strengthening our leadership as the largest buyer and positioning us to become the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers; and finally, the introduction of the Love Your Car Guarantee, an industry-leading signature customer experience. 
All of these were possible because of our exceptional associates. They came together to take care of each other and our customers, while also innovating for the future. Customer response to our omnichannel offering is strong, and we are continuing to work to further improve and enhance the digital customer experience at every step of the sale.  
One critical advantage of our omnichannel model is the ability for the customer to choose how they progress their experience. As previously discussed, our initial rollout of our omnichannel platform enables customers to buy a vehicle online. The parts of the transaction may have required assistance from our CECs. 
In the fourth quarter, we made significant progress enabling self-service for all components of the sale. Exiting the quarter, approximately 25% of our customers were eligible to buy vehicle online independently if they chose, up significantly from the third quarter. We expect most of our customers to have visibility by the end of the second quarter.  
Additionally, in Q4, about 3/4 of our customers advanced their transaction digitally, with approximately 5% buying the vehicle online. We consider an online purchase to be when all major activity leading up to the purchase is performed independent of our stores. We expect our online sales will grow robustly, as we continue to enhance our marketing and digital capabilities.  
As a reminder, we will be hosting a Virtual Analyst Day on May 6, where we will take a deeper dive into our online capabilities and our technology and data advantages. At that time, we will also discuss new metrics around online orders and how they are fulfilled as well as providing insight on our longer-term outlook and expectations.  
Now I'll take a moment to highlight some recent enhancements we have made to the customer experience. First is our online instant appraisal offer, which allows us to quickly give customers an offer on their vehicle. This offering was first introduced and tested on edmunds.com in June. In February, we completed the national rollout of this offering on carmax.com. Early response has been strong, with online buys quickly exceeding our expectations, providing us with a clear pathway to become the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, we launched the ability for customers to get penny-perfect, transactable financing offers in our online checkout process. With these enhancements, customers can apply and accept finance offers without needing the assistance of an associate to submit a credit application over the phone or in the store. We are rapidly expanding this feature to our overall customer base in the first quarter.  
We know our customer-centric approach is a differentiator for CarMax, and we will never stop innovating on behalf of our customers. In January, we introduced our new industry-leading signature customer experience, Love Your Car Guarantee. This gives customers the ability to take 24-hour test drives before committing to purchase, and extends our 7-day money back guarantee to a 30-day money back guarantee, which is unmatched in the automotive industry. It's too early to identify trends, but preliminary results show these offerings are highly valued by our customers.  
As we continue enhancing our online experience and offerings, it's important to educate our customers on our omnichannel experience to differentiate and elevate the CarMax brand and our position in this evolving marketplace. 
In the fourth quarter, we introduced the next phase of our national multimedia marketing campaign that began last year to increase awareness of our core omnichannel capabilities, which was highly successful. We set records every week for web visits since being introduced, reaching more than 8 million weekly visits by the end of February. 
After the campaign launch, web traffic and Google query volumes were both up over 25% versus the prior months. We want to continue this momentum and ensure customers understand that CarMax offers the ultimate flexibility to shop and buy on their terms, their way. Accordingly, as Enrique mentioned earlier, we are planning on increasing our spend on both awareness and acquisition marketing in FY '22.  
We will continue to evolve our business as an omnichannel retailer by innovating at an accelerated pace, leveraging our scale across technology, data, talent and physical assets to unlock opportunities to compete across the used auto ecosystem. This is why we're excited to announce that we've signed a definitive agreement to acquire Edmunds, one of the most influential and popular automotive research sites in the world. 
Over the past years, our teams have had the opportunity to collaborate with Edmunds on a number of strategic initiatives, including our instant online appraisal offer and leveraging its proprietary content on carmax.com. We've been extremely impressed with its technology, content and online experience as well as its talented tech and creative teams. We believe we can both unlock additional value by working together to streamline the user experience across the entire car buying and selling journey, in addition to identifying other digitally focused opportunities. One thing that has become clear is that we share a commitment of delivering the highest quality online experience to our customers and dealers. 
Edmunds is a widely recognized and deeply trusted brand. It will continue to operate its core business independently and will remain focused on delivering confidence to consumers and excellent value to its dealer and OEM clients. We are confident this transaction will drive shareholder value as we are able to leverage our combined size, scale and extensive industry expertise for the benefit of both businesses.  
To sum up, we are very proud of our performance during this difficult year. We're even more excited about how our continued investments in our existing business and in Edmunds are positioning us to be further differentiated and even more competitive. We expect robust top line, bottom line and market share growth for the upcoming year that is a result of not only lapping COVID, but demonstrating the impact of the investments we've made and the experiences we are providing.  
At this point, we will be happy to take your questions. Carol?"

So you are right. At the end of the quarter, our saleable inventory is low. But again, that is a function of the fact that we had some COVID and weather shutdowns. 
So in the rise in COVID, we had to shut down some production locations. We also had some production locations shut down because of the weather. And so that's really why we're a little bit behind on saleable inventory. At the end of the quarter, I think we were down about 20% on saleable inventory.  
I would just point out, though, that if you look at our overall inventory year-over-year, we're actually up a little bit. So we've got the inventory. It's just a matter of producing. In fact, I think we ended the quarter north of 155,000 units.

I think an important point to note here is, though, because of CECL regulation, we will have to, as we book those loans, reserve for the full loss impact of that immediately. And so therefore, this will probably be a headwind for us in the upcoming year. But obviously, the lifetime profit will play itself out over time."

But if I look at the quarter as a whole, the online buys were about 10% of the total appraisal lane buys that we made. And of that, just because we got the carmax.com up towards the end of the quarter, most of those buys came through our relationship with Edmunds.

So Bill, just curious, as you think about this going forward, how much of this tightness in supply that you can get for yourselves to retail is transitory? And how much of it is somewhat more of a secular shift than an increased focus by the dealers and maybe the other competition and is making it a little bit harder to get inventory? 
And then also, is this Edmunds purchase or acquisition, really, the key here is focused on sourcing vehicles online? Is that really what this is? Because I know it's a big lead generator for a lot of dealers, so there's a lot of other angles to what Edmunds delivers.

Now as far as Edmunds goes, look, the online piece of Edmunds, that's only a small piece. It's only a small benefit of the whole transaction. That's not the reason that we have decided to acquire Edmund. It absolutely has been a successful partnership on that piece of it, and we think there's a lot of opportunity to still do on the acquisition. 
But there's other components. We've been working with the content, for example. There's other things that Edmunds that we feel like having the 2 companies come together will take 2 great companies and strengthen both of them. 
So self-sufficiency and buying through the A lane, increasing that, whether it be through online or through the traditional A lane is absolutely a focus for us going forward."

You've got some things going on, on the new car side as far as new car availability. You -- we've got tax refunds that are going that have been delayed and kind of pushing into March. You've got stimulus money out there. So there's a lot of different things kind of going on.

Number one is higher finance income, so CAF originations much more profitable in this environment as well as the renegotiated third-party finance fees. And the second is just lower variable costs as we migrate towards our CECs. 
And so we've been really pleased with the results. We've seen, again, increased sales and increased profitability. So we expect to continue to test and, as Bill mentioned, while also watching the macro environment."

I can't believe it's taking us like 5 or 6 questions for somebody to actually ask about the sales performance, but I appreciate you asking. 
Look, if I think about March, as I said in the opening remarks, it's robust. And actually, it's a great -- March has been a great month for us. It's been a record month for us. We've sold more than 100,000 cars in the month of March for the first time in the company's history. 
And I would tell you, it doesn't really make sense to think about comps this year versus last year just because of the COVID impact. The way I think about them is we should really be comparing them to March of 2019, so 2 years ago. 
March of 2019 was the old record of number of vehicles that we sold. And what I'm most encouraged about is if I compare our March performance this year to 2 years ago, we're seeing double-digit growth on top of that March, which just really speaks to a lot of the things that are going on.  
I mean, sure, some of what's going on are macro factors beyond our control. When you think about the pushing of the tax -- some of the tax refund money into March, you think about the stimulus, I absolutely get that, and that's helping drive some of that tailwind. 
But we're really excited about the tailwind beyond that. So we're -- as we said in our opening remarks, we're excited about 2021. I think the quarter -- I'm sorry, 2022 -- FY 2022. The quarter, unfortunately, it's just -- it's the ending of a very volatile year for us. 
I would just remind everyone. If you go back to FY '20, it was a great year, double-digit top line growth, high mid-single-digit comp growth. We continue that into the beginning of FY '21, up until the point we hit the pandemic. And then since the pandemic has been in place, it's obviously been a very volatile year. 
Looking at the fourth quarter, the pandemic also started -- caused some of the volatility at the beginning of the quarter with December. And we talked about that in the last call, we had a big surge in COVID cases. And we had a bunch of markets that went back into lockdown mode. 
I'll give you one example. The state of California, which has been typically one of the most restrictive states, limiting occupancy to 20% and 25%, that went back into that mode of 20%, 25% in December. A market like that, what we saw is that occupancy restriction causes that market to perform on average north of 10% worse than the rest of the organization. 
So we had that headwind on the occupancy restrictions in December and in January. Both of those 2 months, we had more than 50 stores that were less than 50% occupancy, and that -- less than 50% is difficult for us. You get to 50% above, we can work through that. But just given the traffic that comes into our store, it's hard to manage that. 
But that being said, we started out December, negative 4. We're able to do better than that at the end of December. We were still negative. But then coming into January, and if I look at January, it was the most normal, if there is such thing, normal month. 
We didn't have tax refund delays. We didn't have bad weather. What we really had to contend with were these occupancy restrictions. And even with the occupancy restrictions, we were seeing comps north of 7% in January, which we feel great about. And I really do think that's continuing some of the trends that we saw in the prior year and our investments coming forward. 
Then we get into February, clipping along, and like I said in the opening remarks, we were looking -- even though we started down the hall, we were looking at a mid-single-digit comp, excluding the impact of Leap Day. Now keep in mind, Leap Day last year was a Saturday, and our stores are at the busiest day of the week. 
So excluding that, we were at mid-single-digit comp, and then we hit the weather constraints and just the delay of the tax refunds. I think, in February, returns were down about 30% year-over-year. So that's a little bit more color on that. Let me pass it to Jon to talk about the other questions."

I think, really, 3 things I'd point to there versus I think it's just a very favorable lending environment right now. I think customers are performing well, and I think those finance companies and lenders are anxious to extend money out to customers that are performing well. 
It's absolutely a favorable funding environment. That's very clear. So those 2 things certainly made it easier. And I think all of our lenders in our platform are really excited about CarMax's growth. So they're excited about what's coming in the future. They love CarMax collateral. 
So all those things together, I just made it feel like it was the right time. I think some might want to drive home, though, as we think about fees or our entire platform, whether it be the fees and discounts, the partners that we have in the platform, where CAF participates in the platform, the most important thing we're looking to deliver from our finance platform is highly competitive offers across the credit spectrum in all economic environments. And we want to do that such that we can scale that as CarMax scales. 
So we're always going to look at that platform and look to optimize it. It felt the right time to make the fee changes now, but we were very careful and looked at what the impact of sales were there. And if we make any changes in the future, we will stay very focused on providing those strong credit offers. So that's the most important to us."

As far as different things, when we started doing the expanded pricing test and looking at the marketing, a lot of that was from the learnings that we had in Atlanta. So we're starting to -- obviously, we've started to put that out in other markets. 
I think the other thing to remember is when we roll new things out, so for example, if you think about self-serve, the first market we put that in is Atlanta. Generally, we roll things there first. So they're always getting things a little bit earlier than everyone else. So that would be the other -- the difference that I would point to as well.

Rajat, so as far as the sales shift, really, it's hard to quantify, especially break it down between the weather and the delay in tax refunds. I think the best way to think about that is kind of how I talked about it earlier that, coming into February, middle of February, we would have -- excluding the impact of the Leap Day, we would have been running about a mid-single-digit comp. And obviously, that's not where we ended up. So that's one way to think about. 
We ended up at negative 2, 3. That's one way to think about the weather and the taxes combined, but it's really hard to parse out. And it's hard to know exactly, obviously, how much is impacted. 
So as far as the alternative delivery, just to remind everybody, alternative delivery is both home delivery, but it's also express pickup or curbside pickup. That's still -- we're seeing still -- it's under 10% of overall delivery. And again, that's a number, while we have reported out on it, it's one that -- it's not like we're trying to drive that. 
Again, this is all about giving the customer the experience they want. If they want home delivery, great. If they want to pick it up in the store, great. So -- but to answer your question, it's about -- it's under 10% of the overall. 
I think the other thing, Rajat, is the thing that I introduced, which is the online sales. That's kind of a new way, a new metric that we're -- we talked about on this call. And obviously, in May, we'll have more on these  metrics. But 5% of our customers essentially did the whole transaction online. And then to us, we don't care how they get it fulfilled, whether it's in the store or if it's at-home. And we expect that 5% to continue to go up."

So we don't rely on the wholesale supply for all of our inventory, which -- I feel like there's plenty of supply out there.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered exceptional performance in the first quarter with record results across all aspects of our business, retail, wholesa",750,"Great. Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered exceptional performance in the first quarter with record results across all aspects of our business, retail, wholesale and auto finance and a solid flow-through to EPS. Our success reflects the continued progress we are making in our digital transformation and online experience, along with solid execution and our ongoing commitment to disciplined cost management. In addition, we benefited from the backdrop of a strong demand environment, enhanced by the impact of the most recent round of government stimulus payments. 
For the first quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered sales of $7.7 billion, up 138% compared with the first quarter of FY '21 and net earnings per diluted share of $2.63, up $2.60 from a year ago. This also represents increases of 43% and 65%, respectively, from the previous record set in the first quarter of FY '20. Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 452,000 cars, up 128% versus the first quarter last year and a 31% increase on a 2-year basis from the first quarter of FY '20. We also bought 236% more cars in the first quarter of this year versus last year and 77% more compared with 2 years ago. 
As many of you know, for the past several years, our priorities and investments have focused on building an unmatched experience with a leading e-commerce platform that integrates seamlessly with our best-in-class in-store experience. The result has been a massive organizational transformation that includes building a comprehensive set of digital and hybrid processes to accommodate our customers in whatever way they want to interact with us. Our progress in executing this strategy has given us a very solid start to FY '22 and we remain confident in our long-term targets announced at our recent Analyst Day of 2 million retail and wholesale combined units sold per year and $33 billion of revenue by FY '26.
In our retail business, total unit sales in the first quarter were up 101% and used unit comps were up 99% versus the first quarter last year. Compared with the first quarter of FY '20, total retail unit sales were up 21% and same-store comps were up 16%. In addition to strong unit sales, we reported $2,205 of retail gross profit per used unit for the quarter, up $268 versus a year ago and in line with the first quarter of FY '20. Given the strong demand environment for used autos and inventory constraints throughout the automotive industry, we pulled back on the expanded pricing test we introduced in the fourth quarter. We'll continue to monitor macro factors and pricing elasticity and we'll adjust our pricing accordingly to maximize unit sales and profitability. 
For wholesale, our units sold were up 187% compared with last year's first quarter and were up 50% when compared with the first quarter of FY '20. Wholesale gross profit per unit increased to $1,025 compared with $978 for the same period last year and was in line with the first quarter of FY '20. The strength in wholesale was primarily driven by the introduction of our instant online appraisal offering, which we rolled out nationwide on carmax.com in February after launching on Edmunds.com last year. We also benefited from significant appreciation of used autos in the broader market. 
CarMax Auto Finance, or CAF, continued to deliver solid results with income of $242 million. In addition, CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong conversion in all credit tiers. Jon will give you some more details on that coming up here shortly. 
Overall, we're extremely pleased with our performance, but we know there are opportunities to be even better. For example, on the operational front, inventory available for sale was below targeted levels throughout the entire first quarter. These lower levels are the result of recent demand and the temporary COVID and weather-impacted production slowdown we experienced in the fourth quarter. Remember, the fourth quarter is the time when we are ramping production ahead of the peak demand tax refund season. Our teams have done an amazing job producing inventory in the first quarter, and we expect inventory to continue to increase as we add additional production capacity at existing locations. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial performance, and then Jon will share additional detail around customer financing. So Enrique?"

Together with the strong gross profit growth in retail and wholesale Bill just discussed, other gross profit increased to $142 million, up $111 million from last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by EPP growth of $61 million or 83%, driven primarily by retail sales growth and a stable penetration rate above 60%; service growth of $42 million or 125%, driven by labor leverage due to our strong sales performance and prior year company support pay; and an improvement in third-party finance fees of $6 million or 57% due to our renegotiated fee structure and changes in tier penetration, partially offset by increased sales. Relative to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, other gross profit grew $22 million or 18%. This was primarily due to volume-related growth in EPP and  the benefit from our renegotiated third-party finance fees, partially offset by service deleverage. 
On the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter increased to $554 million, up 71% from our COVID-impacted quarter a year ago. Robust sales in the first quarter, along with disciplined cost management, delivered strong leverage with SG&A as a percent of gross profit of 59.9%, down from 91.7% in the prior year's first quarter. 
The increase in SG&A dollars over the last year was primarily driven by a $108 million increase in compensation and benefits, which was primarily the result of comping over COVID-related payroll reductions last year, along with an increase in variable costs due to higher volume and in headcount as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives. 
Compensation leveraged by 25.8 percentage points versus last year, a $38 million increase in advertising expense driven by our previously communicated investment in advertising spend to amplify the CarMax brand, build awareness of our omnichannel offerings and drive customer acquisition. This year's increase was also impacted by reductions in last year's spend due to the pandemic, marketing leverage by 1.9 percentage points versus last year and a $79 million increase in other overhead due to comparing against the $40 million Takata settlement benefit recognized in last year's quarter, our continued investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives and comping over pandemic-related reductions last year. 
SG&A as a percent of gross profit was comparable with the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. We remain committed to ensuring we are efficient in our spend, and we expect that targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver improvements over time. For example, our CDCs are a significant differentiator for us and an area of opportunity. In the first quarter, our CECs continued their year-over-year gains in efficiency and effectiveness through automation, data-driven algorithms and smart routing that ensures customers get the right support. 
We are very bullish about our future, given the strength and trajectory of our current business and the opportunities to expand into the broader used auto ecosystem. We recognize that we have an opportunity to capitalize on our leadership position to grow market share and deliver long-term shareholder value. Our approach to capital allocation is aligned with this belief and is supported by the significant amount of cash our diversified business model generates. 
First, we continue to focus on our core business by aggressively investing in the digital capabilities required to enhance our omnichannel experience, vehicle and customer acquisition and the strategic expansion of our store footprint. Of particular note this quarter was the very strong ROI we are experiencing in vehicle acquisition, primarily through our instant online appraisal offerings. 
Second, we will deploy capital to pursue new growth opportunities through investments, partnerships and acquisitions. On June 1, we completed our acquisition of Edmunds. We are confident this transaction will create significant shareholder value over time. Additionally, of note on the P&L this quarter, other income increased $29 million when compared with the same period last year primarily due to a $22 million unrealized gain on an investment. As we've noted in the past, we have a portfolio of relatively modest investments across the used auto ecosystem. 
Finally, we will continue to return excess capital back to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $125 million. We have $1.21 billion remaining in current authorizations. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon."

Once again, the finance business has delivered outstanding results. For the first quarter, CAF's penetration net of free-day payoffs was 43.7% compared with 36.1% a year ago. Tier 2 decreased to 22.8% of used",635,"Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everybody. Once again, the finance business has delivered outstanding results. For the first quarter, CAF's penetration net of free-day payoffs was 43.7% compared with 36.1% a year ago. Tier 2 decreased to 22.8% of used unit sales compared with 28.5% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 10% compared with 14.5% a year ago. 
You will recall in the first quarter of FY '21 at the beginning of the pandemic, we leveraged our long-term relationships and routed a portion of CAF's Tier 1 volume and all of the allocated Tier 3 volume to our Tier 2 and Tier 3 partners, which explains much of this year-over-year shift in tier mix. Note, this was done as a temporary measure, which limited CAF's origination volume while preserving the high quality of the portfolio. By the end of the second quarter last year, we've returned to our normal routing procedures. 
During this first quarter, CAF's net loans originated was $2.5 billion, marking the largest single origination quarter in CAF's history and the first quarter above $2 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 9%, up from 8.4% a year ago and 8.5% in the fourth quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, this year-over-year difference in APR is a result of the credit mix of customers rather than an increase in the rate charged. 
Regarding the portfolio, the overall interest margin increased to 6.9% versus 5.9% in the same period last year as the strength of our ABS program continues to yield significant benefits in the form of lower funding costs. CAF income for the quarter was $242 million, up from $51 million a year ago. This significant year-over-year increase comes as a result of a substantial improvement in the required provision for loan losses, stronger net interest margin and higher receivables. 
Total interest margin in the quarter increased by $47 million or 24%, driven by the growth in originations and lower cost of funds. With respect to our provision for loan losses, in the first quarter, we experienced $7.2 million in net credit loss or 21 basis points of average managed receivables. As a percentage of the portfolio, this is the lowest reported loss we have experienced in over 20 years. 
The resulting favorability versus our expectations, coupled with the corresponding adjustment in our outlook for future losses, resulted in $24 million of income related to the provision in the first quarter. This is compared to a $122 million provision expense in the same period last year. This release of reserves resulted in an ending reserve balance of $380 million for the first quarter or 2.62% of managed receivables, which is a decrease from the 2.97% and at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Our reserve as a percentage of managed receivables has continued to trend downward towards more historical levels as our customers remain persistent in their willingness and ability to make their auto payment despite the uncertain environment. We believe this current adjustment effectively captures the positive loss performance we have seen over the past 4 quarters and is appropriate for the current macroeconomic environment. 
Finally, as previously mentioned, CAF increased its percent of Tier 3 volume to 10% by the end of the first quarter. This adjustment had a minimal impact on the reserve within the quarter. But as the higher volume continues to flow into the portfolio over subsequent quarters, we expect income and the provision to increase accordingly. 
With regard to where CAF will participate in the credit spectrum in the future, as always, we will continue to evaluate the lending environment and will consider future adjustments if and when we believe those changes are sustainable and in the best interest of our long-term business goals. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

As I said at our Analyst Day in May, we are proud of the work our teams have done to put CarMax in the excellent position we're in today, and we are really excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Our mult",793,"Great. Thank you, Jon and Enrique. As I said at our Analyst Day in May, we are proud of the work our teams have done to put CarMax in the excellent position we're in today, and we are really excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Our multiyear investment in omnichannel experience has further enhanced our offering, which is the most customer-centric experience within the used auto industry. We are agnostic about how our customers shop and buy because we are positioned to give every customer a world-class buying experience regardless of how they shop with us. In turn, this gives us access to the largest addressable market within the states. 
In the first quarter, approximately 8% of our retail unit sales were online. As a reminder, when a customer completes all 4 of the major transactional activities remotely -- so that's reserving the vehicle; financing the vehicle, if that's needed; trading in or opting out of a trade-in; and creating a sales order. We consider this an online retail sale. Because all our wholesale auctions were made virtual this quarter, 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 18% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. As a result, total revenue coming from online transactions was 24% in the first quarter. 
Omni sales represented approximately 56% of retail unit sales, up from 51% last quarter. As a reminder, omni sales are retail sales where customers complete at least 1 of those major transactional activities remotely. While all of our customers can buy a car online with assistance, we have been focused on providing a 100% self-service experience. Today, 40% of our retail customers can independently complete an online sale, up from 25% at the end of the fourth quarter. We expect to have this capability available to most customers by the end of the second quarter. 
We continue to leverage digital innovations to drive growth with our online instant appraisal offerings where customers can receive an online offer on their car in less than 2 minutes and have payment in hand the same day. In the first quarter, we bought approximately 163,000 vehicles through these online offerings, which represents 48% of our total buys from consumers. And since rolling out nationwide at the end of last quarter, we believe we have become the largest online buyer of used autos from the consumers in the U.S. This is a significant competitive advantage that allows us to efficiently source vehicles, especially during periods of high demand, enabling us to remain competitively priced while producing attractive GPUs. 
On the retail side, we're making our online experience faster by improving our finance approval and flow process. We're making it easier by enabling customers to request card transfers and then manage and track them all online. And we're empowering our customers by providing them with financing information across our entire inventory as the first step in their shopping journey. This gives our customers greater confidence they can afford the vehicle they select. 
As we expand access and further enhance digital aspects of our experience, we need to reinforce awareness of CarMax's new capabilities and their values to customers. Since launching our new brand campaign and Love Your Car Guarantee offerings at the end of last year, we've seen strong growth in the awareness of our omnichannel experience with both web traffic and Google search volumes continuing to increase. 
As digital adoption by consumers and dealers continues to grow, we'll keep building on our investments in omni, our proprietary technology stack and our strong brand reputation to maximize growth in our core businesses. We're also pursuing additional growth opportunities in the broader trillion-dollar-plus used auto ecosystem that leverage our capabilities and strength in the industry. 
As Enrique mentioned, we recently completed the acquisition of Edmunds, one of the most well-established and trusted online guides for automotive information and a recognized leader in digital car shopping innovations. Edmunds brings us closer to a broader set of consumers and brings us closer to dealers. Our teams are super excited and are continuing to collaborate on new products that will support Edmunds dealers partners and consumers. We see tremendous opportunity and we'll provide updates as we launch new offerings more broadly. 
In summary, this was truly an exceptional quarter, and we are absolutely excited for the future. Our results reflect strong and disciplined execution across our diversified business model and further validate our strategies to enable sustainable growth and meaningful long-term shareholder value creation. We remain focused on enhancing our online capabilities to deliver the most customer-centric offering in the market. We will continue to accelerate our growth and market share gains while also laying the groundwork for future initiatives and growth opportunities. Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Shelby?"

And then also, if you think on the supply side, both from the consumer and then even at auctions, when do you think supply more naturally eases up? I mean there's crazy things going on like Davis and Hertz buying cars and auctions. And traditionally, they're sources and sellers, right?

I've talked about us putting investments in that area and I think what you're seeing is it really coming to fruition. I mean you think about it, more than 340,000 cars that we bought from consumers, it's up 236%. It's up 77% versus FY '20. It's just truly remarkable. A big piece of that, obviously, is just having easier access for consumers with our online offering. But we're also encouraged just by the traditional with customers coming in the store and doing appraisals that way. So we feel good about both of those. 
The supply piece is interesting. There's some abnormal things that you mentioned there. But I'll go back to what I said in the fourth quarter, supply has not been an issue for us. While our saleable inventory is certainly lower than where we want it to be right now, the supply, if you look at total inventory, we're very much in line with where we were in FY '20. It's really more a matter of production. And I think with the online offering in addition to the traditional appraisal lane, that also just diminishes our need for external supply going through those other sources. 
And more general to your question of how long -- absolutely, there's some supply constraints out there because you've got some different folks doing different things. You also have the demand for maybe some new car, customers moving into used cars. I think it will -- time will tell. I think the new car isn't going to work itself out in the next quarter or 2, I think we're probably looking more towards the latter part of the year. So I don't see a lot changing in supply over the next couple of quarters. But again, the supply is not an issue. There's still a lot of cars that are changing hands out there. You may -- if you're buying off site, you have to work a little bit harder. But we feel great about where we are from a total inventory standpoint."

If you look at the consumer price index and the difference between new cars and late-model used cars, that gap has definitely narrowed. While new cars are going up, they have not gone up at the pace of used cars. And that's fairly self-correct and get to a point where, okay, it's late model used cars is bumping up against the new car. And I think we are getting close to that inflection point.

So if you were to back that out, you can see that we really are in the operating range that we've previously stated. And we've trended downward nicely since that. I think it's a pretty substantial move we've made since the end of Q4 to now. And obviously, that's a reflection of the great performance that we saw in the quarter. So -- Going forward, we think 2.62% is a really solid number for us across both the Tier 1 and Tier 3 portfolio, and we'll see how the customer performs in the future."

We're committed to continuing to advertise in a thoughtful ROI way. I would tell you, looking at what we've been doing, we had a record hit. Our average number of hits to our website for this quarter was 34.5 million, which is up significantly from any prior record. We're seeing web visits up roughly 60% year-over-year, 40% if you compare back to FY '20. Google searches are up double digits. So we feel very, very good about the new programs that we're doing and how we're really kind of going out there and spreading the omnichannel experience to consumers. But I'll tell you, this isn't -- it's not a 1 quarter thing. We need to continue to be at this, and we're committed to  continue to spend.

We're looking at an increase of over 40% on a per unit basis in our advertising costs, which is consistent with what we've communicated.

I mean our inventory level right now, is I think -- obviously, we're below target the whole quarter, we're probably 40% lower than where we would like to be.

I don't think it was to the normal elasticity that you would see just given what was going on in the rest of the marketplace. But it really is about production. And we normally build ahead of time to get ready. We weren't able to do that. Our operations team is doing a phenomenal job. We're adding additional capacity in those existing facility. So I would expect that to continue to go up. 
One of the areas I've talked about from an efficiency standpoint in the past, as we look to take way side of the system, one of the areas that we've been focused on is our flow production. And we've actually now finished rolling out kind of the next version of that. And we would expect to get more throughput through existing facilities and resources. So we're excited about that, and that will continue to  help us. And then, of course, to meet our long-term goals, we'll be adding additional capacity as we go forward. But yes, I think it's absolutely fair to say that the inventory was a headwind for us. And it's not the supply side, it's more of the production side. And again, I can't give enough shout-out to our operations team because not only have they been meeting that demand, but they're building on it. And if you watch your inventory recently, you've seen that we're starting to ramp it back up."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered exceptional performance in the first quarter, with record results across all aspects of our business, retail, wholes",751,"Great. Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered exceptional performance in the first quarter, with record results across all aspects of our business, retail, wholesale and auto finance, and a solid flow-through to EPS. Our success reflects the continued progress we are making in our digital transformation and online experience, along with solid execution, and our ongoing commitment to disciplined cost management. In addition, we benefited from the backdrop of a strong demand environment, enhanced by the impact of the most recent round of government stimulus payments.
For the first quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered sales of $7.7 billion, up 138% compared with the first quarter of FY '21, and net earnings per diluted share of $2.63, up $2.60 from a year ago. This also represents increases of 43% and 65%, respectively, from the previous record set in the first quarter of FY '20.
Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 452,000 cars, up 128% versus the first quarter last year and a 31% increase on a 2-year basis from the first quarter of FY '20. We also bought 236% more cars in the first quarter of this year versus last year and 77% more compared with 2 years ago.
As many of you know, for the past several years, our priorities and investments have focused on building an unmatched experience, with a leading e-commerce platform that integrates seamlessly with our best-in-class in-store experience. The result has been a massive organizational transformation that includes building a comprehensive set of digital and hybrid processes to accommodate our customers in whatever way they want to interact with us. Our progress in executing this strategy has given us a very solid start to FY '22, and we remain confident in our long-term targets announced at our recent analyst day of 2 million retail and wholesale combined units sold per year and $33 billion of revenue by FY '26.
In our retail business, total unit sales in the first quarter were up 101%, and used unit comps were up 99% versus the first quarter last year. Compared with the first quarter of FY '20, total retail unit sales were up 21%, and same-store comps were up 16%. In addition to strong unit sales, we reported $2,205 of retail gross profit per used unit for the quarter, up $268 versus a year ago and in line with the first quarter of FY '20. Given the strong demand environment for used autos and inventory constraints throughout the automotive industry, we pulled back on the expanded pricing test we introduced in the fourth quarter. We'll continue to monitor macro factors and pricing elasticity, and we'll adjust our pricing accordingly to maximize unit sales and profitability.
For wholesale, our units sold were up 187% compared with last year's first quarter and were up 50% when compared with the first quarter of FY '20. Wholesale gross profit per unit increased to $1,025 compared with $978 for the same period last year and was in line with the first quarter of FY '20. -- The strength in wholesale was primarily driven by the introduction of our instant online appraisal offering, which we rolled out nationwide on carmax.com in February after launching on Edmunds.com last year. We also benefited from significant appreciation of used autos in the broader market.
CarMax Auto Finance, or CAF, continued to deliver solid results, with income of $242 million. In addition, CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong conversion in all credit tiers. Jon will give you some more details on that coming up here shortly.
Overall, we're extremely pleased with our performance, but we know there are opportunities to be even better. For example, on the operational front, inventory available for sale was below targeted levels throughout the entire first quarter. These lower levels are the result of recent demand and the temporary COVID and weather-impacted production slowdown we experienced in the fourth quarter. Remember, the fourth quarter is the time when we are ramping production ahead of the peak demand tax refund season. Our teams have done an amazing job producing inventory in the first quarter, and we expect inventory to continue to increase as we add additional production capacity at existing locations.
Now I'll turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial performance, and then Jon will share additional detail around customer financing. So Enrique?"
356805,710009589,2327834,"CarMax, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Jun 25, 2021",2021-06-25,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Together with the strong gross profit growth in retail and wholesale Bill just discussed, other gross profit increased to $142 million, up $111 million from last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by:",714,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Together with the strong gross profit growth in retail and wholesale Bill just discussed, other gross profit increased to $142 million, up $111 million from last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by: EPP growth of $61 million or 83%, driven primarily by retail sales growth and a stable penetration rate above 60%; service growth of $42 million or 125%, driven by labor leverage due to our strong sales performance and prior year company support pay; and an improvement in third-party finance fees of $6 million or 57% due to our renegotiated fee structure and changes in tier penetration, partially offset by increased sales.
Relative to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, other gross profit grew $22 million or 18%. This was primarily due to volume-related growth in EPP and  the benefit from our renegotiated third-party finance fees partially offset by service deleverage.
On the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter increased to $554 million, up 71% from our COVID-impacted quarter a year ago. Robust sales in the first quarter, along with disciplined cost management, delivered strong leverage, with SG&A as a percent of gross profit of 59.9%, down from 91.7% in the prior year's first quarter. The increase in SG&A dollars over the last year was primarily driven by a $108 million increase in compensation and benefits, which was primarily the result of comping over COVID-related payroll reductions last year, along with an increase in variable costs due to higher volume and in headcount as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives.
Compensation leveraged by 25.8 percentage points versus last year, a $38 million increase in advertising expense, driven by our previously communicated investment in advertising spend to amplify the CarMax brand, build awareness of our omnichannel offerings and drive customer acquisition. This year's increase was also impacted by reductions in last year's spend due to the pandemic, marketing leverage by 1.9 percentage points versus last year and a $79 million increase in other overhead due to comparing against the $40 million Takata settlement benefit recognized in last year's quarter, our continued investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives and comping over pandemic-related reductions last year. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was comparable with the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
We remain committed to ensuring we are efficient in our spend, and we expect that targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver improvements over time. For example, our CECs are a significant differentiator for us and an area of opportunity. In the first quarter, our CECs continued their year-over-year gains in efficiency and effectiveness through automation, data-driven algorithms and smart routing that ensures customers get the right support.
We are very bullish about our future, given the strength and trajectory of our current business and the opportunities to expand into the broader used auto ecosystem. We recognize that we have an opportunity to capitalize on our leadership position to grow market share and deliver long-term shareholder value.
Our approach to capital allocation is aligned with this belief and is supported by the significant amount of cash our diversified business model generates. First, we continue to focus on our core business by aggressively investing in the digital capabilities required to enhance our omnichannel experience, vehicle and customer acquisition, and the strategic expansion of our store footprint. Of particular note this quarter was the very strong ROI we are experiencing in vehicle acquisition primarily through our instant online appraisal offerings.
Second, we will deploy capital to pursue new growth opportunities through investments, partnerships and acquisitions. On June 1, we completed our acquisition of Edmunds. We are confident this transaction will create significant shareholder value over time.
Additionally, of note on the P&L this quarter, other income increased $29 million when compared with the same period last year, primarily due to a $22 million unrealized gain on an investment. As we've noted in the past, we have a portfolio of relatively modest investments across the used auto ecosystem.
Finally, we will continue to return excess capital back to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $125 million. We have $1.21 billion remaining in current authorizations. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon."
356805,710009589,2327834,"CarMax, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Jun 25, 2021",2021-06-25,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everybody. Once again, the finance business has delivered outstanding results. For the first quarter, CAF's penetration net of 3-day payoffs was 43.7% compared with 36.1% a year ago. Tier 2 decreased to 22.8% of used uni",636,"Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everybody. Once again, the finance business has delivered outstanding results. For the first quarter, CAF's penetration net of 3-day payoffs was 43.7% compared with 36.1% a year ago. Tier 2 decreased to 22.8% of used unit sales compared with 28.5% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 10% compared with 14.5% a year ago. 
You will recall in the first quarter of FY '21, at the beginning of the pandemic, we leveraged our long-term relationships and routed a portion of CAF's Tier 1 volume and all of the allocated Tier 3 volume to our Tier 2 and Tier 3 partners, which explains much of this year-over-year shift in tier mix. Note, this was done as a temporary measure, which limited CAF's origination volume while preserving the high quality of the portfolio. By the end of the second quarter last year, we've returned to our normal routing procedures.
During this first quarter, CAF's net loans originated was $2.5 billion, marking the largest single origination quarter in CAF's history and the first quarter above $2 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 9%, up from 8.4% a year ago and 8.5% in the fourth quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, this year-over-year difference in APR is a result of the credit mix of customers rather than an increase in the rate charged.
Regarding the portfolio, the overall interest margin increased to 6.9% versus 5.9% in the same period last year as the strength of our ABS program continues to yield significant benefits in the form of lower funding costs. CAF income for the quarter was $242 million, up from $51 million a year ago. This significant year-over-year increase comes as a result of a substantial improvement in the required provision for loan losses, stronger net interest margin and higher receivables.
Total interest margin in the quarter increased by $47 million or 24% driven by the growth in originations and lower cost of funds. With respect to our provision for loan losses, in the first quarter, we experienced $7.2 million in net credit loss or 21 basis points of average managed receivables. As a percentage of the portfolio, this is the lowest reported loss we have experienced in over 20 years.
The resulting favorability versus our expectations, coupled with the corresponding adjustment in our outlook for future losses, resulted in $24 million of income related to the provision in the first quarter. This is compared to a $122 million provision expense in the same period last year. This release of reserves resulted in an ending reserve balance of $380 million for the first quarter or 2.62% of managed receivables, which is a decrease from the 2.97% and at the end of the fourth quarter.
Our reserve as a percentage of managed receivables has continued to trend downward towards more historical levels as our customers remain persistent in their willingness and ability to make their auto payment despite the uncertain environment. We believe this current adjustment effectively captures the positive loss performance we have seen over the past 4 quarters and is appropriate for the current macroeconomic environment.
Finally, as previously mentioned, CAF increased as a percent of Tier 3 volume to 10% by the end of the first quarter. This adjustment had a minimal impact on the reserve within the quarter. But as the higher volume continues to flow into the portfolio over subsequent quarters, we expect income and the provision to increase accordingly.
With regard to where CAF will participate in the credit spectrum in the future, as always, we will continue to evaluate the lending environment and will consider future adjustments if and when we believe those changes are sustainable and in the best interest of our long-term business goals. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

As I said at our analyst day in May, we are proud of the work our teams have done to put CarMax in the excellent position we're in today, and we are really excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Our mult",792,"Great. Thank you, Jon and Enrique. As I said at our analyst day in May, we are proud of the work our teams have done to put CarMax in the excellent position we're in today, and we are really excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Our multiyear investment in omnichannel experience has further enhanced our offering, which is the most customer-centric experience within the used auto industry. We are agnostic about how our customers shop and buy because we are positioned to give every customer a world-class buying experience regardless of how they shop with us. In turn, this gives us access to the largest addressable market within the states.
In the first quarter, approximately 8% of our retail unit sales were online. As a reminder, when a customer completes all 4 of the major transactional activities remotely, so that's: reserving the vehicle; financing the vehicle, if that's needed; trading in or opting out of a trade-in; and creating a sales order, we consider this an online retail sale. Because all our wholesale auctions were made virtual this quarter, 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 18% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. As a result, total revenue coming from online transactions was 24% in the first quarter.
Omni sales represented approximately 56% of retail unit sales, up from 51% last quarter. As a reminder, omni sales are retail sales where customers complete at least one of those major transactional activities remotely. While all of our customers can buy a car online with assistance, we have been focused on providing a 100% self-service experience. Today, 40% of our retail customers can independently complete an online sale, up from 25% at the end of the fourth quarter. We expect to have this capability available to most customers by the end of the second quarter.
We continue to leverage digital innovations to drive growth with our online instant appraisal offerings where customers can receive an online offer on their car in less than 2 minutes and have payment in hand the same day. In the first quarter, we bought approximately 163,000 vehicles through these online offerings, which represents 48% of our total buys from consumers. And since rolling out nationwide at the end of last quarter, we believe we have become the largest online buyer of used autos from the consumers in the U.S. This is a significant competitive advantage that allows us to efficiently source vehicles, especially during periods of high demand, enabling us to remain competitively priced while producing attractive GPUs.
On the retail side, we're making our online experience faster by improving our finance approval and flow process. We're making it easier by enabling customers to request card transfers and then manage and track them all online. And we're empowering our customers by providing them with financing information across our entire inventory as the first step in their shopping journey. This gives our customers greater confidence they can afford the vehicle they select.
As we expand access and further enhance digital aspects of our experience, we need to reinforce awareness of CarMax' new capabilities and their values to customers. Since launching our new brand campaign and Love Your Car Guarantee offerings at the end of last year, we've seen strong growth in the awareness of our omnichannel experience, with both web traffic and Google search volumes continuing to increase.
As digital adoption by consumers and dealers continues to grow, we'll keep building on our investments in omni, our proprietary technology stack and our strong brand reputation to maximize growth in our core businesses. We're also pursuing additional growth opportunities in the broader trillion-dollar-plus used auto ecosystem that leverage our capabilities and strengths in the industry.
As Enrique mentioned, we recently completed the acquisition of Edmunds, one of the most well-established and trusted online guides for automotive information and a recognized leader in digital car shopping innovations. Edmunds brings us closer to a broader set of consumers and brings us closer to dealers. Our teams are super excited and are continuing to collaborate on new products that will support Edmunds dealers, partners and consumers. We see tremendous opportunity and will provide updates as we launch new offerings more broadly.
In summary, this was truly an exceptional quarter, and we are absolutely excited for the future. Our results reflect strong and disciplined execution across our diversified business model and further validate our strategies to enable sustainable growth and meaningful long-term shareholder value creation. We remain focused on enhancing our online capabilities to deliver the most customer-centric offering in the market. We will continue to accelerate our growth and market share gains while also laying the groundwork for future initiatives and growth opportunities. Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Shelby?"

It's just truly -- it's truly remarkable. A big piece of that, obviously, is just having easier access for consumers with our online offering. But we're also encouraged just by the traditional, with customers coming in the store and doing appraisals that way. So we feel good about both of those.
The supply piece is interesting. There's some abnormal things that you mentioned there. But I'll go back to what I said in the fourth quarter, supply has not been an issue for us. While our saleable inventory is certainly lower than where we want it to be right now, the supply, if you look at total inventory, we're very much in line with where we were in FY '20. It's really more a matter of production. And I think with the online offering, in addition to the traditional appraisal lane, that also just diminishes our need for external supply, going through those other sources.
And more general to your question of how long -- absolutely, there's some supply constraints out there because you've got some different folks doing different things. You also have the demand for maybe some new car customers moving into used cars. I think it will -- time will tell. I think the new car isn't going to work itself out in the next quarter or 2. I think we're probably looking more towards the latter part of the year. So I don't see a lot changing in supply over the next couple of quarters. But again, the supply is not an issue. There's still a lot of cars that are changing hands out there. You may -- if you're buying off-site, you have to work a little bit harder. But we feel great about where we are from a total inventory standpoint."

You've been following us long enough to know that this pricing environment has really -- it's really unprecedented. If you think about from January until now, the $5,000 to $6,000 worth of appreciation that we've seen, it's truly remarkable. Our average selling prices were up a couple of thousand dollars. From an acquisition standpoint, they're actually up a little bit more than that, but it was a little bit offset based off of mix and age.
I do think we're reaching an inflection point. If you look at the consumer price index and the difference between new cars and late-model used cars, that gap has definitely narrowed. While new cars are going up, they have not gone up at the pace of used cars. And that's fairly self-correcting. You get to a point where, okay, it's -- late-model used cars is bumping up against the new car. And I think we are getting close to that inflection point. And I think that's great because obviously, when the gap narrows, it's a headwind for used car purchases. When the gap widens, the gap between used and new, that's a great thing for used car sales. So I think that's a positive thing."

Normally, that pricing environment would be a headwind to just the used car industry in general. I think the difference this quarter was that because there was a lack of new car availability, I think it pushed customers down into the used car market, which helped to raise the price of used cars. So it's really -- it's hard to kind of pull that apart. It's -- there's a lot of different factors going on there because you got not only new customers coming in there. You have the stimulus that's out there that's driving up demand. So I think the normal -- what you would normally see from really high price increases on used cars, it's hard -- I don't think it was the same -- it had the same elasticity effect that you would normally see.
Now I think going forward, not having some of that stimulus out there, I think the normal elasticity in pricing, I think, will start to return. And I think back to Michael's point, if we've seen this inflection point starts to go down, I think that's a good thing."

I would tell you, looking at what we've been doing, we had a record hit. Our average number of hits to our website for this quarter was 34.5 million, which is up significantly from any prior record. We're seeing web visits up roughly 60% year-over-year, 40% if you compare back to FY '20. Google searches are up double digits.

I don't think it was to the normal elasticity that you would see just given what was going on in the rest of the marketplace.
But it really is about production. And we normally build ahead of time to get ready. We weren't able to do that. Our operations team is doing a phenomenal job. We're adding additional capacity in those existing facilities. So I would expect that to continue to go up.
One of the areas I've talked about from an efficiency standpoint in the past, as we look to take waste out of the system, one of the areas that we've been focused on is our flow production. And we've actually now finished rolling out kind of the next version of that. And we would expect to get more throughput through existing facilities and resources. So we're excited about that, and that will continue to help us. And then, of course, to meet our long-term goals, we'll be adding additional capacity as we go forward.
But yes, I think it's absolutely fair to say that the inventory was a headwind for us. And it's not the supply side, it's more of the production side. And again, I can't give enough shout-outs to our operations team because not only have they been meeting that demand, but they're drilling on it.

But we're also excited about the teams continuing to collaborate and progress on programs that help both companies. And a great example of that is the instant offers. We developed that with them, initially rolled it out on Edmunds, and then we have it on carmax.com. And we think there's a lot of opportunity there still, and we think there's a lot of opportunity on content.
So I think it's very important that we keep the company separate and we keep making sure that they're continuing to add value to their individual customers. And I think we can do both. And then as we continue to develop things jointly together that benefit both companies, we'll continue to highlight those in the future."

Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered exceptional performance in the first quarter, with record results across all aspects of our business, retail, wholesale and auto finance, and a solid flow-through to EPS. Our success reflects the continued progress we are making in our digital transformation and online experience, along with solid execution, and our ongoing commitment to disciplined cost management. In addition, we benefited from the backdrop of a strong demand environment, enhanced by the impact of the most recent round of government stimulus payments.
For the first quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered sales of $7.7 billion, up 138% compared with the first quarter of FY '21, and net earnings per diluted share of $2.63, up $2.60 from a year ago. This also represents increases of 43% and 65%, respectively, from the previous record set in the first quarter of FY '20.
Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 452,000 cars, up 128% versus the first quarter last year and a 31% increase on a 2-year basis from the first quarter of FY '20. We also bought 236% more cars in the first quarter of this year versus last year and 77% more compared with 2 years ago.
As many of you know, for the past several years, our priorities and investments have focused on building an unmatched experience, with a leading e-commerce platform that integrates seamlessly with our best-in-class in-store experience. The result has been a massive organizational transformation that includes building a comprehensive set of digital and hybrid processes to accommodate our customers in whatever way they want to interact with us. Our progress in executing this strategy has given us a very solid start to FY '22, and we remain confident in our long-term targets announced at our recent analyst day of 2 million retail and wholesale combined units sold per year and $33 billion of revenue by FY '26.
In our retail business, total unit sales in the first quarter were up 101%, and used unit comps were up 99% versus the first quarter last year. Compared with the first quarter of FY '20, total retail unit sales were up 21%, and same-store comps were up 16%. In addition to strong unit sales, we reported $2,205 of retail gross profit per used unit for the quarter, up $268 versus a year ago and in line with the first quarter of FY '20. Given the strong demand environment for used autos and inventory constraints throughout the automotive industry, we pulled back on the expanded pricing test we introduced in the fourth quarter. We'll continue to monitor macro factors and pricing elasticity, and we'll adjust our pricing accordingly to maximize unit sales and profitability.
For wholesale, our units sold were up 187% compared with last year's first quarter and were up 50% when compared with the first quarter of FY '20. Wholesale gross profit per unit increased to $1,025 compared with $978 for the same period last year and was in line with the first quarter of FY '20. -- The strength in wholesale was primarily driven by the introduction of our instant online appraisal offering, which we rolled out nationwide on carmax.com in February after launching on Edmunds.com last year. We also benefited from significant appreciation of used autos in the broader market.
CarMax Auto Finance, or CAF, continued to deliver solid results, with income of $242 million. In addition, CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong conversion in all credit tiers. Jon will give you some more details on that coming up here shortly.
Overall, we're extremely pleased with our performance, but we know there are opportunities to be even better. For example, on the operational front, inventory available for sale was below targeted levels throughout the entire first quarter. These lower levels are the result of recent demand and the temporary COVID and weather-impacted production slowdown we experienced in the fourth quarter. Remember, the fourth quarter is the time when we are ramping production ahead of the peak demand tax refund season. Our teams have done an amazing job producing inventory in the first quarter, and we expect inventory to continue to increase as we add additional production capacity at existing locations.
Now I'll turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial performance, and then Jon will share additional detail around customer financing. So Enrique?"
356805,710009589,2328071,"CarMax, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Jun 25, 2021",2021-06-25,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Together with the strong gross profit growth in retail and wholesale Bill just discussed, other gross profit increased to $142 million, up $111 million from last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by:",714,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Together with the strong gross profit growth in retail and wholesale Bill just discussed, other gross profit increased to $142 million, up $111 million from last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by: EPP growth of $61 million or 83%, driven primarily by retail sales growth and a stable penetration rate above 60%; service growth of $42 million or 125%, driven by labor leverage due to our strong sales performance and prior year company support pay; and an improvement in third-party finance fees of $6 million or 57% due to our renegotiated fee structure and changes in tier penetration, partially offset by increased sales.
Relative to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, other gross profit grew $22 million or 18%. This was primarily due to volume-related growth in EPP and  the benefit from our renegotiated third-party finance fees partially offset by service deleverage.
On the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter increased to $554 million, up 71% from our COVID-impacted quarter a year ago. Robust sales in the first quarter, along with disciplined cost management, delivered strong leverage, with SG&A as a percent of gross profit of 59.9%, down from 91.7% in the prior year's first quarter. The increase in SG&A dollars over the last year was primarily driven by a $108 million increase in compensation and benefits, which was primarily the result of comping over COVID-related payroll reductions last year, along with an increase in variable costs due to higher volume and in headcount as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives.
Compensation leveraged by 25.8 percentage points versus last year, a $38 million increase in advertising expense, driven by our previously communicated investment in advertising spend to amplify the CarMax brand, build awareness of our omnichannel offerings and drive customer acquisition. This year's increase was also impacted by reductions in last year's spend due to the pandemic, marketing leverage by 1.9 percentage points versus last year and a $79 million increase in other overhead due to comparing against the $40 million Takata settlement benefit recognized in last year's quarter, our continued investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives and comping over pandemic-related reductions last year. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was comparable with the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
We remain committed to ensuring we are efficient in our spend, and we expect that targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver improvements over time. For example, our CECs are a significant differentiator for us and an area of opportunity. In the first quarter, our CECs continued their year-over-year gains in efficiency and effectiveness through automation, data-driven algorithms and smart routing that ensures customers get the right support.
We are very bullish about our future, given the strength and trajectory of our current business and the opportunities to expand into the broader used auto ecosystem. We recognize that we have an opportunity to capitalize on our leadership position to grow market share and deliver long-term shareholder value.
Our approach to capital allocation is aligned with this belief and is supported by the significant amount of cash our diversified business model generates. First, we continue to focus on our core business by aggressively investing in the digital capabilities required to enhance our omnichannel experience, vehicle and customer acquisition, and the strategic expansion of our store footprint. Of particular note this quarter was the very strong ROI we are experiencing in vehicle acquisition primarily through our instant online appraisal offerings.
Second, we will deploy capital to pursue new growth opportunities through investments, partnerships and acquisitions. On June 1, we completed our acquisition of Edmunds. We are confident this transaction will create significant shareholder value over time.
Additionally, of note on the P&L this quarter, other income increased $29 million when compared with the same period last year, primarily due to a $22 million unrealized gain on an investment. As we've noted in the past, we have a portfolio of relatively modest investments across the used auto ecosystem.
Finally, we will continue to return excess capital back to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $125 million. We have $1.21 billion remaining in current authorizations. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon."
356805,710009589,2328071,"CarMax, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Jun 25, 2021",2021-06-25,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everybody.

For the first quarter, CAF's penetration net of 3-day payoffs was 43.7% compared with 36.1% a year ago. Tier 2 decreased to 22.8% of used unit sales compared with 28.5% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 10% compared with 14.5% a year ago. 
You will recall in the first quarter of FY '21, at the beginning of the pandemic, we leveraged our long-term relationships and routed a portion of CAF's Tier 1 volume and all of the allocated Tier 3 volume to our Tier 2 and Tier 3 partners, which explains much of this year-over-year shift in tier mix. Note, this was done as a temporary measure, which limited CAF's origination volume while preserving the high quality of the portfolio. By the end of the second quarter last year, we've returned to our normal routing procedures.
During this first quarter, CAF's net loans originated was $2.5 billion, marking the largest single origination quarter in CAF's history and the first quarter above $2 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 9%, up from 8.4% a year ago and 8.5% in the fourth quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter, this year-over-year difference in APR is a result of the credit mix of customers rather than an increase in the rate charged.
Regarding the portfolio, the overall interest margin increased to 6.9% versus 5.9% in the same period last year as the strength of our ABS program continues to yield significant benefits in the form of lower funding costs. CAF income for the quarter was $242 million, up from $51 million a year ago. This significant year-over-year increase comes as a result of a substantial improvement in the required provision for loan losses, stronger net interest margin and higher receivables.
Total interest margin in the quarter increased by $47 million or 24% driven by the growth in originations and lower cost of funds. With respect to our provision for loan losses, in the first quarter, we experienced $7.2 million in net credit loss or 21 basis points of average managed receivables. As a percentage of the portfolio, this is the lowest reported loss we have experienced in over 20 years.
The resulting favorability versus our expectations, coupled with the corresponding adjustment in our outlook for future losses, resulted in $24 million of income related to the provision in the first quarter. This is compared to a $122 million provision expense in the same period last year. This release of reserves resulted in an ending reserve balance of $380 million for the first quarter or 2.62% of managed receivables, which is a decrease from the 2.97% and at the end of the fourth quarter.
Our reserve as a percentage of managed receivables has continued to trend downward towards more historical levels as our customers remain persistent in their willingness and ability to make their auto payment despite the uncertain environment. We believe this current adjustment effectively captures the positive loss performance we have seen over the past 4 quarters and is appropriate for the current macroeconomic environment.
Finally, as previously mentioned, CAF increased as a percent of Tier 3 volume to 10% by the end of the first quarter. This adjustment had a minimal impact on the reserve within the quarter. But as the higher volume continues to flow into the portfolio over subsequent quarters, we expect income and the provision to increase accordingly.
With regard to where CAF will participate in the credit spectrum in the future, as always, we will continue to evaluate the lending environment and will consider future adjustments if and when we believe those changes are sustainable and in the best interest of our long-term business goals. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

As I said at our analyst day in May, we are proud of the work our teams have done to put CarMax in the excellent position we're in today, and we are really excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Our mult",792,"Great. Thank you, Jon and Enrique. As I said at our analyst day in May, we are proud of the work our teams have done to put CarMax in the excellent position we're in today, and we are really excited about the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Our multiyear investment in omnichannel experience has further enhanced our offering, which is the most customer-centric experience within the used auto industry. We are agnostic about how our customers shop and buy because we are positioned to give every customer a world-class buying experience regardless of how they shop with us. In turn, this gives us access to the largest addressable market within the states.
In the first quarter, approximately 8% of our retail unit sales were online. As a reminder, when a customer completes all 4 of the major transactional activities remotely, so that's: reserving the vehicle; financing the vehicle, if that's needed; trading in or opting out of a trade-in; and creating a sales order, we consider this an online retail sale. Because all our wholesale auctions were made virtual this quarter, 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 18% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. As a result, total revenue coming from online transactions was 24% in the first quarter.
Omni sales represented approximately 56% of retail unit sales, up from 51% last quarter. As a reminder, omni sales are retail sales where customers complete at least one of those major transactional activities remotely. While all of our customers can buy a car online with assistance, we have been focused on providing a 100% self-service experience. Today, 40% of our retail customers can independently complete an online sale, up from 25% at the end of the fourth quarter. We expect to have this capability available to most customers by the end of the second quarter.
We continue to leverage digital innovations to drive growth with our online instant appraisal offerings where customers can receive an online offer on their car in less than 2 minutes and have payment in hand the same day. In the first quarter, we bought approximately 163,000 vehicles through these online offerings, which represents 48% of our total buys from consumers. And since rolling out nationwide at the end of last quarter, we believe we have become the largest online buyer of used autos from the consumers in the U.S. This is a significant competitive advantage that allows us to efficiently source vehicles, especially during periods of high demand, enabling us to remain competitively priced while producing attractive GPUs.
On the retail side, we're making our online experience faster by improving our finance approval and flow process. We're making it easier by enabling customers to request card transfers and then manage and track them all online. And we're empowering our customers by providing them with financing information across our entire inventory as the first step in their shopping journey. This gives our customers greater confidence they can afford the vehicle they select.
As we expand access and further enhance digital aspects of our experience, we need to reinforce awareness of CarMax' new capabilities and their values to customers. Since launching our new brand campaign and Love Your Car Guarantee offerings at the end of last year, we've seen strong growth in the awareness of our omnichannel experience, with both web traffic and Google search volumes continuing to increase.
As digital adoption by consumers and dealers continues to grow, we'll keep building on our investments in omni, our proprietary technology stack and our strong brand reputation to maximize growth in our core businesses. We're also pursuing additional growth opportunities in the broader trillion-dollar-plus used auto ecosystem that leverage our capabilities and strengths in the industry.
As Enrique mentioned, we recently completed the acquisition of Edmunds, one of the most well-established and trusted online guides for automotive information and a recognized leader in digital car shopping innovations. Edmunds brings us closer to a broader set of consumers and brings us closer to dealers. Our teams are super excited and are continuing to collaborate on new products that will support Edmunds dealers, partners and consumers. We see tremendous opportunity and will provide updates as we launch new offerings more broadly.
In summary, this was truly an exceptional quarter, and we are absolutely excited for the future. Our results reflect strong and disciplined execution across our diversified business model and further validate our strategies to enable sustainable growth and meaningful long-term shareholder value creation. We remain focused on enhancing our online capabilities to deliver the most customer-centric offering in the market. We will continue to accelerate our growth and market share gains while also laying the groundwork for future initiatives and growth opportunities. Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Shelby?"

So I'm just curious, what's going on there on your ability to buy directly from the consumer?
And then also, if you think on the supply side, both from the consumer and then even at auctions, when do you think supply more naturally eases up? I mean there's crazy things going on like Avis and Hertz buying cars in auctions and traditionally, they're sources and sellers, right? So I mean there's some wacky stuff going on in the supply side. I mean how much wood can you chop on buying from consumers? How important is that going to be going forward? And then when does supply, which is totally wacky at the moment, normalize on the flow and supply?"

And I think what you're seeing is it really coming to fruition. I mean you think about it, more than 340,000 cars that we bought from consumers, it's up 236%. It's up 77% versus FY '20. It's just truly -- it's truly remarkable. A big piece of that, obviously, is just having easier access for consumers with our online offering. But we're also encouraged just by the traditional, with customers coming in the store and doing appraisals that way. So we feel good about both of those.
The supply piece is interesting. There's some abnormal things that you mentioned there. But I'll go back to what I said in the fourth quarter, supply has not been an issue for us. While our saleable inventory is certainly lower than where we want it to be right now, the supply, if you look at total inventory, we're very much in line with where we were in FY '20. It's really more a matter of production. And I think with the online offering, in addition to the traditional appraisal lane, that also just diminishes our need for external supply, going through those other sources.
And more general to your question of how long -- absolutely, there's some supply constraints out there because you've got some different folks doing different things. You also have the demand for maybe some new car customers moving into used cars. I think it will -- time will tell. I think the new car isn't going to work itself out in the next quarter or 2. I think we're probably looking more towards the latter part of the year. So I don't see a lot changing in supply over the next couple of quarters. But again, the supply is not an issue. There's still a lot of cars that are changing hands out there. You may -- if you're buying off-site, you have to work a little bit harder. But we feel great about where we are from a total inventory standpoint."

If you think about from January until now, the $5,000 to $6,000 worth of appreciation that we've seen, it's truly remarkable. Our average selling prices were up a couple of thousand dollars. From an acquisition standpoint, they're actually up a little bit more than that, but it was a little bit offset based off of mix and age.
I do think we're reaching an inflection point. If you look at the consumer price index and the difference between new cars and late-model used cars, that gap has definitely narrowed. While new cars are going up, they have not gone up at the pace of used cars. And that's fairly self-correcting. You get to a point where, okay, it's -- late-model used cars is bumping up against the new car. And I think we are getting close to that inflection point. And I think that's great because obviously, when the gap narrows, it's a headwind for used car purchases. When the gap widens, the gap between used and new, that's a great thing for used car sales.

Normally, that pricing environment would be a headwind to just the used car industry in general.

So it's really -- it's hard to kind of pull that apart. It's -- there's a lot of different factors going on there because you got not only new customers coming in there. You have the stimulus that's out there that's driving up demand. So I think the normal -- what you would normally see from really high price increases on used cars, it's hard -- I don't think it was the same -- it had the same elasticity effect that you would normally see.
Now I think going forward, not having some of that stimulus out there, I think the normal elasticity in pricing, I think, will start to return. And I think back to Michael's point, if we've seen this inflection point starts to go down, I think that's a good thing."

But it really is about production. And we normally build ahead of time to get ready. We weren't able to do that. Our operations team is doing a phenomenal job. We're adding additional capacity in those existing facilities. So I would expect that to continue to go up.
One of the areas I've talked about from an efficiency standpoint in the past, as we look to take waste out of the system, one of the areas that we've been focused on is our flow production.

Welcome to the call to everyone else. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. 
As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered a record level of used sales for the second quarter and an all-time record for wholesale vehicle sales as well as robust CarMax Auto Finance income growth. 
For the second quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $8 billion, up 49% compared with the second quarter of FY '21, driven by higher average selling prices and volume gains. 
Net earnings per diluted share was $1.72, down $0.07 from a year ago as we rolled over last year's pandemic-driven expense reductions and also continue to invest in our growth. 
Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 420,000 cards in total, up 20% versus the second quarter last year. For the 6 months of FY '22, we have sold approximately 872,000 retail and wholesale cars combined. We also bought 59% more cars from consumers in the second this year versus last year and achieved record self-sufficiency of approximately 70%.  
Our omnichannel platform, unique customer offerings, solid execution and macro factors are driving performance across our company. In our retail business, total unit sales in the second quarter were up 6.7% and used unit comps were up 6.2% versus the second quarter last year despite headwinds from inventory levels, staffing and overall used car valuations. 
Our teams made steady progress in our saleable inventory during the quarter, and we achieved sequential growth each month despite the strong retail demand that carried into the second quarter. While it remains below our targeted levels, we are on pace to grow our sale of inventory during the balance of the year. 
In addition to strong unit sales, we reported $2,185 of retail gross profit per used unit in line with our historical second quarter performance. For wholesale, units sold were up 41.4% from a record second quarter last year. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $1,005 compared with $1,086 for the same period last year. The strength in wholesale units was primarily driven by the ongoing success of our instant online appraisal offering that rolled out nationwide on carmax.com in February after launching on Edmunds.com last year. 
We also benefited from still elevated valuations of used autos in the broader market. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF continued to deliver solid results with income of $200 million. In addition, CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong offers in all credit tiers, though we did see a sequential decline in Tier 3 volume relative to the first quarter. 
Jon will provide more details on customer financing and CAF contribution shortly. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our second quarter financial performance, followed by John. After that, I'll update you on the progress against our strategic priorities and then open up the call to Q&A. Enrique?"

Total gross profit was $815 million, up 8% over last year's second quarter. This was driven by wholesale vehicle margin of $189 million, which was up 31% and used vehicle margin of $507 million, which was up 5% from last year's second quarter. Other gross profit was $120 million, down $7 million from last year's second quarter. 
Favorability in the quarter included $22 million of margin contribution from Edmunds since our June 1, 2021 acquisition. This was on revenues of $34.5 million, which is noted as advertising and subscription revenues in the earnings release. 
Other gross profit also benefited from an $18 million improvement in third-party finance fees with income of $3 million compared with $15 million in costs last year. This was driven by lower Tier 3 volume compared with last year and our renegotiated third-party finance fees. 
Offsetting this favorability, service was down $40 million, primarily the result of rolling over favorable items from the prior year's quarter and short-term headwinds during this year's quarter. Specifically, we comped over last year's COVID-related cost reductions. 
Additionally, we experienced higher 90-day warranty cost timing stemming from the significant increase in sales during the first quarter of fiscal year '22 compared to last year's first quarter. We also realized lower retail service margin as production capacity was focused on reconditioning retail cars. Also impacting other gross profit, EPP was down $6 million or 5.4%. 
While penetration was stable at above 60%, last year's second quarter included a benefit of approximately $8 million in profit sharing revenues that was not recognized this year due to a timing shift in the performance period for one of our providers. 
On the SG&A front, expenses for the second quarter increased to $574 million, up 30% from our COVID-impacted quarter a year ago and as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and growth. As a reminder, last year during the pandemic, we took aggressive cost containment actions, particularly during the first half of the year. 
SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 70.4% compared to 58.8% during the prior year's second quarter. The increase in SG&A dollars over last year was primarily driven by 3 main factors. First, a $55 million increase in total compensation and benefits driven by staffing and sales growth and by the inclusion of Edmond's payroll this quarter. 
Second, a $41 million increase in other overhead due to investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives. Third, a $35 million increase in advertising expense, as previously communicated, to amplify the CarMax brand build awareness in our -- of our omnichannel offerings and drive customer acquisition. 
We estimate that the COVID-related cost savings in SG&A in the prior year quarter was between $25 million to $30 million. For the first 6 months of FY '22, SG&A as a percent of gross profit is 64.8% leveraging 5 points over last year's first half rate of 69.3%. We remain committed to ensuring we are efficient in our spend and we expect that targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver improvements over time. 
We achieved an additional reduction year-over-year from our core CEC cost structure during the second quarter.  Additionally, our omnichannel capabilities will unlock new opportunity as we leverage automation to reduce expenses and streamline operations. 
For example, our online instant offer program is resulting in more efficient buying organization as we continue to leverage the power of automation, AI and data science. On capital allocation. Our ongoing focus is to deploy capital in our business to grow market share and deliver long-term shareholder value. That includes investing in digital capabilities to enhance all aspects of our omnichannel experience, such as online vehicle acquisition, which is already generating a strong ROI. 
We also continue to invest in the strategic expansion of our store footprint and look for additional paths to create incremental value. In regard to our share repurchase program, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders and repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares in the quarter for approximately $220 million. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John."

For the second quarter, CAF's penetration, net of 3-day payoffs, was 43% compared with 42.6% a year ago. Tier 2 decreased to 21.6% of used unit sales compared with 22.3% last year. 
Tier 3 accounted for 7.2% compared with 11.1% a year ago. As a reminder, last year, CAF decided to strategically route a portion of its Tier 1 volume and all of its allocated Tier 3 volume to partners to preserve the high quality of its portfolio during the start of the pandemic. 
These changes were rolled back by the end of Q2 last year. During the quarter, we observed strong offers from our Tier 2 partners as they competed for additional volume within the CarMax channel. We also saw a decrease in application volume and conversion to sale for applications in the lower portion of the credit spectrum. We believe these decreases are due in large part to the higher average selling prices seen across the industry. 
During this year's second quarter, on the strength of record used unit sales, CAF's net loans originated was nearly $2.4 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.5%, up from 8.2% a year ago, but down from 9% in the first quarter. 
Similar to the first quarter, this year-over-year difference in EPR is a result of the change in credit mix of customers rather than an increase in the rate charged. For our portfolio, overall interest margin increased to 7.2% versus 6% in the same period last year, resulting in a year-over-year increase of $65 million or 33%. 
This strong net interest margin highlights the strength of our ABS program and the favorable state of the capital markets. Given we recognize income over the life of our loans, we will benefit from this higher net interest margin across multiple years. Cash income for the quarter was $200 million, up from $147 million a year ago. This significant year-over-year increase comes as a result of the stronger net interest margin and higher receivables. Our expense related to the provision in the second quarter was $35 million and results in an ending reserve balance of $398 million for the second quarter or 2.66% of managed receivables. This is in line with the 2.62% at the end of the first quarter while also reflecting a modestly higher percentage of Tier 3 loans in the portfolio as a result of our decision to retain 10% of Tier 3 volume. 
We believe our future outlook on losses and corresponding reserve is appropriate given the current macroeconomic environment. With regard to our lending platform and specifically, where CAF participates across the credit spectrum, we are constantly evaluating the landscape and remain committed to making decisions that we believe are sustainable in the long term and in the best interest of our customers. 
During the second quarter, in coordination with our business partners, we began a small test of CAF originating in the Tier 2 space. Much like when CAF entered Tier 3, this test will remain in place at low volumes for an extended period as we take the time to understand both the Tier 2 customer and how cash participation in this space can best enhance the range of credit options improve the customer experience and drive profitability. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

We're excited about the incredible opportunity that lies ahead. We've intentionally built our omnichannel platform to give every customer the ability to progress to a sale or a buy regardless of how they shop with us. 
We found that most customers don't want to shop for a car in a way that is tied solely to an in-store or digital experience. While we provide the ability for customers buy a car of 100% in-store or 100% online,  our omnichannel capabilities really differentiate CarMax by enabling our customers to personalize their experience with a mix of digital and physical interactions to meet their needs. 
In the second quarter, approximately 9% of our retail unit sales were online, consistent with our first quarter and up from the prior year's quarter of 3%. As a reminder, we considered an online retail sale when a customer completes all 4 of the major transactional activity remotely. So that's reserving a car, financing the vehicle, if that's needed trading in or opting out of a trade-in and creating a sales order. 
Our wholesale auctions remain virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 21% of total revenue are considered online transactions. Total revenues resulting from online transactions was 28%. This is up from 24% in the first quarter and up from 18% in last year's second quarter. 
Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, flat to the first quarter and up from the prior year second quarter of 49%. Omni sales are those where customers complete at least one of those major transactional activities remotely. 
We've been focused on completing the rollout of our 100% self-service experience where customers can independently complete the entire car buying process online if they so choose. Currently, a little more than 50% of our customers have access to a complete end-to-end unaided online experience. 
And we are on track to bring this capability to all of our retail consumers by the end of the fiscal year. Remember, while rolling out access to these capabilities will enable more customers to complete a 100% self-service online experience, all customers currently can buy a car online with assistance from an associate. 
In the second quarter, we bought approximately 188,000 vehicles from customers through our online instant appraisal, which represents about half of our total buys from customers. That's a 15% increase from our record first quarter number. This growth supports our belief that we become and are further expanding our position as the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers in the U.S. 
We are continuously enhancing our e-commerce offerings to exceed customer expectations and to seamlessly integrate with our best-in-class store experience. Let me share a few examples. One of the areas we've enhanced is our digital capabilities or digital capabilities is our financing process. Nearly 65% of our finance customers start their loan process online with a preapproval application. And as of the second quarter, 100% of those customers now receive a digital decision that includes customized loan terms. 
A majority of those customers through no additional time or effort or provided digital access to their personal financing terms on every corner inventory, allowing them to shop with more confidence. In addition, what differentiates our experience is the ability to provide these inventory-wide credit offers using multiple finance partners, including CAF. This ensures we provide our customers with the most attractive rates and terms. 
We're excited about our progress on this crucial part of the car buying journey. We also continue to advance what we believe is industry-leading digital merchandising which is critical to providing customers an immersive experience with our inventory as they shop remotely. 
This quarter, we added 360-degree interior views from the driver side and the back seat of the vehicle and continue to advance vehicle hotspots, which are callouts to help the customer understand key vehicle features. We also continue to leverage artificial intelligence to ensure that our photos are consistently high quality to best represent our inventory. 
We're hearing very positive feedback on these advancements that help customers understand and fall in love with our vehicles as they shop online. In relation to our acquisition of Edmunds, we're very pleased with our progress as our teams have hit the ground running on new innovations. We will continue to invest in the Edmunds brand and work together to unlock opportunities to compete across the larger used auto ecosystem. 
We are really proud of the quarter and the significant progress we have made in advancing our omnichannel strategy. We are well positioned to deliver the most customer-centric experience in the used auto industry, which will enable sustainable growth and create meaningful long-term shareholder value. 
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. So Kevin?"

And I say that because you also have to put a little context around the environment. So we had several headwinds that we also faced during the quarter. First of all, inventory. 
Inventory is lower than where we want to be. It's probably about 30% off of -- at the end of the quarter, about 30% off of where we would normally target.  In addition to the inventory headwind, we were understaffed, and we still are understaffed, but not to the degree we were understaffed pretty much across the board. 
And that's important not only because it hinders our ability to hit our SLAs, but in some cases, we just weren't able to get back with customers, which is never a good thing. And so we're working on that. And then I think also just a broader macro thing, it's just the used car valuations. 
I mean year-over-year, acquisition prices are up about $6,000. And I think Enrique talked about in his opening remarks, or John talked about in his opening remarks about how that may push some used car customers just out of the market. And I think when you take the comps in that light with those headwinds. Those headwinds when you add them all together are material headwinds. 
So we feel great about the comps for the quarter, and we also feel great about the overall progress. On your second question, how we talk about using the wholesale? Yes, we do talk a little bit differently about that, but I think that really goes back to a little bit of what I talked about on Analyst Day, which is people always think about us is this used car retail. And that is, in fact, great, but we're much more than that. 
We're a great retailer. We're a great wholesaler. We're very financier. We've added Edmunds, we've got dealer services, and it really goes to this broader used auto ecosystem. So that's really kind of the change that as to why we talk about both."

I talked about opening remarks, it's just about the fact that we're approximately 70% self-sufficient. So it's definitely not the sourcing. As I talked about with Brian's question, it certainly has been a headwind. And it really all relates back to what happened in the fourth and the first quarter. In the fourth quarter typically is the time where we build our inventory up, we weren't able to do that because of COVID and some winter disruption productions. 
Then we had record sales in the first quarter. So we're still digging out of that hole. And like I told, Brian, we're about 30% light to target. We're about 15% year-over-year. If you look at last year's second quarter, where were this second quarter, we're about 15% light.  
We did make great progress sequentially every month. We grew our inventory. And look, we plan to continue to build inventory over the rest of the year. And I think the timing is really going to be -- when we get back to where we want to be, will really depend somewhat on the demand. 
As far as staffing, yes, during the quarter, although we were able to build inventory, we did have some headwinds even on the staffing side. But again, I think staffing in general, we're making great progress. We made great progress staffing across the board throughout the quarter, and we continue to make great progress in this quarter as well."

But let's say, in that $2,000 to $2,100 range if you're able to capture all the finance economics potentially, but there is higher risk there. 
So there's a funding aspect there. Now obviously, with our partners, we were able to renegotiate fees. We're currently paying  $750 to those Tier 3 loans that our partners pick up. And obviously, we mentioned beginning -- over the course of Q1, we started taking now 10% of the volume within the Tier 3 space.

We're constantly testing. A couple of quarters ago, we talked about doing some broader scale testing just because of some of the other factors, some of the other profit channels that were coming through the organization. 
And while those still exist, just like last quarter, we really wanted to make sure we -- you got to monitor the macro factors and doesn't make sense. You got to look at your inventory levels. You got to understand the elasticity, which, again, we're still getting the read on elasticity with the test that we always have going. 
You want to see what competitors are doing. And it just didn't make sense to deviate more from that historical trend that we have on margins.

So both are actually, as long as I've been doing this, those are the biggest jumps I can remember ever seeing. 
Now I think the fact that self-sufficiency is so high for us. I think that provides us a lot of opportunities as we go forward because that comes into play on not only your margin, but your your pricing structure. I think during the quarter, what we saw was we came out of the first quarter very high elevated prices. It hung in there for a little while. 
We then actually saw a little bit of depreciation take place. But surprisingly, it started to appreciate again. So -- and we went back, I think we finished the quarter probably at the high that we finished the first quarter. So it's a very interesting dynamic. 
And I can only speculate maybe because the chip shortage is -- looks like it's going to be longer than I think what people originally thought of for new cars, I think maybe there's some folks out there buying more used cars to replenish their lot since they're not going to have new cars.

So I'm just curious if you think any of these dynamics will be relieved until we get there. 
And then also, as you think about sort of the staffing levels, finding folks at reasonable prices is getting harder and harder so that cost inflation on the SG&A side and staffing up might be difficult as well. I mean I'm just trying to understand if you can change strategy, alter strategy or this changes your growth strategy as you fight through these 2 macro factors and when they'll be relieved because it's kind of masking all the good stuff you're doing, and it's muddling the story, but it's not it's not your fault and it's the macro issues that you're just going to have to fight through."

But it's also the reason why I'm so excited about the investments we've made in vehicle acquisition and things like our instant offer because that really helps to offset some of those headwinds and really gives us a lot of opportunity. 
And like I said earlier, I mean we're making strides continuing to get our inventory up. So we feel good about that. On the staffing, Look, we've always invested in our associates. I mean they are -- they're the reason of our success. And during this time period, you know, I mean, every employer is out there looking for staffing, and we're no different, and we continue to invest more in this quarter in our associates. We've made pay changes that we feel really great about. 
We also -- look, for 17 years in a row, we've been one of the best places to work, which is a great thing from an employer brand standpoint.

Well, in that kind of environment, it is a little harder to leverage, right? And our expectation is that our gross profit will continue to grow. It will grow robustly. And on the back of that gross profit growth, there are opportunities to leverage, specifically for this year, for the entire year, our expectation continues to be that we should be able to leverage for this year. 
It's hard to look quarter-to-quarter, you just can't look at quarter-to-quarter just because there's so many things that pop in and out of a quarter. But for the full year, we feel pretty good about that. And then moving forward, again, it's -- we are in growth mode and we're investing accordingly. And at the same time, and as I speak to every quarter, we do look at opportunities to get more efficient.

And then the second piece is similar to SG&A, we just had prior year kind of onetime COVID-related savings and support pay and the employee retention credit plan as well that are more kind of shorter term in nature. So the material amount of that is really shorter term.

Welcome to the call to everyone else. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.

Welcome to the call to everyone else. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we delivered a record level of used sales for the second quarter and an all-time record for wholesale vehicle sales as well as robust CarMax auto finance income growth.
For the second quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $8 billion, up 49% compared with the second quarter of FY '21, driven by higher average selling prices and volume gains.  
Net earnings per diluted share was $1.72, down $0.07 from a year ago as we rolled over last year's pandemic-driven expense reductions and also continue to invest in our growth.  
Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 420,000 cards in total, up 20% versus the second quarter last year. For the 6 months of FY '22, we have sold approximately 872,000 retail and wholesale cars combined. We also bought 59% more cars from consumers in the second quarter this year versus last year and achieved record self-sufficiency of approximately 70%.   
Our omnichannel platform, unique customer offerings, solid execution and macro factors are driving performance across our company. In our retail business, total unit sales in the second quarter were up 6.7% and used unit comps were up 6.2% versus the second quarter last year despite headwinds from inventory levels, staffing and overall used car valuations.  
Our teams made steady progress in building our saleable inventory during the quarter, and we achieved sequential growth each month despite the strong retail demand that carried into the second quarter. While it remains below our targeted levels, we are on pace to grow our saleable inventory during the balance of the year.  
In addition to strong unit sales, we reported $2,185 of retail gross profit per used unit in line with our historical second quarter performance. For wholesale, units sold were up 41.4% from a record second quarter last year. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $1,005 compared with $1,086 for the same period last year. The strength in wholesale units was primarily driven by the ongoing success of our instant online appraisal offering that rolled out nationwide on carmax.com in February after launching on Edmunds.com last year.  
We also benefited from still elevated valuations of used autos in the broader market. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF continued to deliver solid results with income of $200 million. In addition, CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong offers in all credit tiers, though we did see a sequential decline in Tier 3 volume relative to the first quarter.  
Jon will provide more details on customer financing and CAF contribution shortly. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our second quarter financial performance, followed by Jon. After that, I'll update you on the progress against our strategic priorities and then open up the call to Q&A. Enrique?"
356805,1671940304,2403233,"CarMax, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Sep 30, 2021",2021-09-30,"Earnings Calls","CarMax, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Total gross profit was $815 million, up 8% over last year's second quarter. This was driven by wholesale vehicle margin of $189 million, which was up 31% and used vehicle margin of $507 million, which was up 5% fr",688,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Total gross profit was $815 million, up 8% over last year's second quarter. This was driven by wholesale vehicle margin of $189 million, which was up 31% and used vehicle margin of $507 million, which was up 5% from last year's second quarter. Other gross profit was $120 million, down $7 million from last year's second quarter.  
Favorability in the quarter included $22 million of margin contribution from Edmunds since our June 1, 2021 acquisition. This was on revenues of $34.5 million, which is noted as advertising and subscription revenues in the earnings release.  
Other gross profit also benefited from an $18 million improvement in third-party finance fees with income of $3 million compared with $15 million in costs last year. This was driven by lower Tier 3 volume compared with last year and our renegotiated third-party finance fees.  
Offsetting this favorability, service was down $40 million, primarily the result of rolling over favorable items from the prior year's quarter and short-term headwinds during this year's quarter. Specifically, we comped over last year's COVID-related cost reductions.  
Additionally, we experienced higher 90-day warranty cost timing stemming from the significant increase in sales during the first quarter of fiscal year '22 compared to last year's first quarter. We also realized lower retail service margin as production capacity was focused on reconditioning retail cars. Also impacting other gross profit, EPP was down $6 million or 5.4%.  
While penetration was stable at above 60%, last year's second quarter included a benefit of approximately $8 million in profit sharing revenues that was not recognized this year due to a timing shift in the performance period for one of our providers.  
On the SG&A front, expenses for the second quarter increased to $574 million, up 30% from our COVID-impacted quarter a year ago and as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and growth. As a reminder, last year during the pandemic, we took aggressive cost containment actions, particularly during the first half of the year.  
SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 70.4% compared to 58.8% during the prior year's second quarter. The increase in SG&A dollars over last year was primarily driven by 3 main factors. First, a $55 million increase in total compensation and benefits driven by staffing and sales growth and by the inclusion of Edmond's payroll this quarter.  
Second, a $41 million increase in other overhead due to investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives. Third, a $35 million increase in advertising expense, as previously communicated, to amplify the CarMax brand, build awareness in our -- of our omnichannel offerings and drive customer acquisition.  
We estimate that the COVID-related cost savings in SG&A in the prior year quarter was between $25 million to $30 million. For the first 6 months of FY '22, SG&A as a percent of gross profit is 64.8% leveraging 5 points over last year's first half rate of 69.3%. We remain committed to ensuring we are efficient in our spend and we expect that targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver improvements over time.  
We achieved an additional reduction year-over-year from our core CEC cost structure during the second quarter.  Additionally, our omnichannel capabilities will unlock new opportunities as we leverage automation to reduce expenses and streamline operations.
For example, our online instant offer program is resulting in more efficient buying organization as we continue to leverage the power of automation, AI and data science. On capital allocation. Our ongoing focus is to deploy capital in our business to grow market share and deliver long-term shareholder value. That includes investing in digital capabilities to enhance all aspects of our omnichannel experience, such as online vehicle acquisition, which is already generating a strong ROI.   
We also continue to invest in the strategic expansion of our store footprint and look for additional paths to create incremental value. In regard to our share repurchase program, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders and repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares in the quarter for approximately $220 million. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon."

For the second quarter, CAF's penetration, net of 3-day payoffs, was 43% compared with 42.6% a year ago. Tier 2 decreased to 21.6% of used unit sales compared with 22.3% last year.  
Tier 3 accounted for 7.2% compared with 11.1% a year ago. As a reminder, last year, CAF decided to strategically route a portion of its Tier 1 volume and all of its allocated Tier 3 volume to partners to preserve the high quality of its portfolio during the start of the pandemic.  
These changes were rolled back by the end of Q2 last year. During the quarter, we observed strong offers from our Tier 2 partners as they competed for additional volume within the CarMax channel. We also saw a decrease in application volume and conversion to sale for applications in the lower portion of the credit spectrum. We believe these decreases are due in large part to the higher average selling prices seen across the industry.  
During this year's second quarter, on the strength of record used unit sales, CAF's net loans originated was nearly $2.4 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.5%, up from 8.2% a year ago, but down from 9% in the first quarter.  
Similar to the first quarter, this year-over-year difference in EPR is a result of the change in credit mix of customers rather than an increase in the rate charged. For our portfolio, overall interest margin increased to 7.2% versus 6% in the same period last year, resulting in a year-over-year increase of $65 million or 33%.  
This strong net interest margin highlights the strength of our ABS program and the favorable state of the capital markets. Given we recognize income over the life of our loans, we will benefit from this higher net interest margin across multiple years. 
CAF income for the quarter was $200 million, up from $147 million a year ago. This significant year-over-year increase comes as a result of the stronger net interest margin and higher receivables. Our expense related to the provision in the second quarter was $35 million and results in an ending reserve balance of $398 million for the second quarter or 2.66% of managed receivables. This is in line with the 2.62% at the end of the first quarter while also reflecting a modestly higher percentage of Tier 3 loans in the portfolio as a result of our decision to retain 10% of Tier 3 volume.  
We believe our future outlook on losses and corresponding reserve is appropriate given the current macroeconomic environment. With regard to our lending platform and specifically, where CAF participates across the credit spectrum, we are constantly evaluating the landscape and remain committed to making decisions that we believe are sustainable in the long term and in the best interest of our customers.  
During the second quarter, in coordination with our business partners, we began a small test of CAF originating in the Tier 2 space. Much like when CAF entered Tier 3, this test will remain in place at low volumes for an extended period as we take the time to understand both the Tier 2 customer and how CAF's participation in this space can best enhance the range of credit options, improve the customer experience, and drive profitability.  
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

We're excited about the incredible opportunity that lies ahead. We've intentionally built our omnichannel platform to give every customer the ability to progress to a sale or a buy regardless of how they shop with us.  
We found that most customers don't want to shop for a car in a way that is tied solely to an in-store or digital experience. While we provide the ability for customers to buy a car 100% in-store or 100% online,  our omnichannel capabilities really differentiate CarMax by enabling our customers to personalize their experience with a mix of digital and physical interactions to meet their needs.  
In the second quarter, approximately 9% of our retail unit sales were online, consistent with our first quarter and up from the prior year's quarter of 3%. As a reminder, we considered an online retail sale when a customer completes all 4 of the major transactional activity remotely. So that's reserving a car, financing the vehicle, if that's needed trading in or opting out of a trade-in and creating a sales order.  
Our wholesale auctions remain virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 21% of total revenue are considered online transactions. Total revenues resulting from online transactions was 28%. This is up from 24% in the first quarter and up from 18% in last year's second quarter.  
Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, flat to the first quarter and up from the prior year second quarter of 49%. Omni sales are those where customers complete at least one of those major transactional activities remotely.  
We've been focused on completing the rollout of our 100% self-service experience where customers can independently complete the entire car buying process online if they so choose. Currently, a little more than 50% of our customers have access to a complete end-to-end unaided online experience.  
And we are on track to bring this capability to all of our retail consumers by the end of the fiscal year. Remember, while rolling out access to these capabilities will enable more customers to complete a 100% self-service online experience, all customers currently can buy a car online with assistance from an associate.  
In the second quarter, we bought approximately 188,000 vehicles from customers through our online instant appraisal, which represents about half of our total buys from customers. That's a 15% increase from our record first quarter number. This growth supports our belief that we become and are further expanding our position as the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers in the U.S.  
We are continuously enhancing our e-commerce offerings to exceed customer expectations and to seamlessly integrate with our best-in-class store experience. Let me share a few examples. One of the areas we've enhanced is our digital capabilities -- our digital capabilities is our financing process. Nearly 65% of our finance customers start their loan process online with a preapproval application. And as of the second quarter, 100% of those customers now receive a digital decision that includes customized loan terms.  
A majority of those customers through no additional time or effort are provided digital access to their personal financing terms on every car on inventory, allowing them to shop with more confidence. In addition, what differentiates our experience is the ability to provide these inventory-wide credit offers using multiple finance partners, including CAF. This ensures we provide our customers with the most attractive rates and terms.  
We're excited about our progress on this crucial part of the car buying journey. We also continue to advance what we believe is industry-leading digital merchandising which is critical to providing customers an immersive experience with our inventory as they shop remotely.  
This quarter, we added 360-degree interior views from the driver side and the back seat of the vehicle and continue to advance vehicle hotspots, which are call-outs to help the customer understand key vehicle features. We also continue to leverage artificial intelligence to ensure that our photos are consistently high quality to best represent our inventory.  
We're hearing very positive feedback on these advancements that help customers understand and fall in love with our vehicles as they shop online. In relation to our acquisition of Edmunds, we're very pleased with our progress as our teams have hit the ground running on new innovations. We will continue to invest in the Edmunds brand and work together to unlock opportunities to compete across the larger used auto ecosystem.  
We are really proud of the quarter and the significant progress we have made in advancing our omnichannel strategy. We are well positioned to deliver the most customer-centric experience in the used auto industry, which will enable sustainable growth and create meaningful long-term shareholder value.  
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. So Kevin?"

And I say that because you also have to put little context around the environment. So we had several headwinds that we also faced during the quarter. First of all, inventory.  
Inventory is lower than where we want to be. It's probably about 30% off of -- at the end of the quarter probably about 30% off of where we would normally target.  In addition to the inventory headwind, we were understaffed, and we still are understaffed, but not to the degree, we were understaffed pretty much across the board.  
And that's important not only because it hinders our ability to hit our SLAs, but in some cases, we just weren't able to get back with customers, which is never a good thing. And so we're working on that. And then I think also just a broader macro thing, it's just the used car valuations.  
I mean year-over-year, acquisition prices are up about $6,000. And I think Enrique talked about in his opening remarks or Jon talked about in his opening remarks about how that may push some used car customers just out of the market. And I think when you take the comps in that light with those headwinds, those headwinds when you add them all together are material headwinds.  
So we feel great about the comps for the quarter, and we also feel great about the overall progress. On your second question, how we talk about using the wholesale? Yes, we do talk a little bit differently about that, but I think that really goes back to a little bit of what I talked about on Analyst Day, which is people always think about us as this used car retail. And that is, in fact, great, but we're much more than that.  
We're a great retailer, a great wholesaler, a great financier. We've added Edmunds, we're getting dealer services, and it really goes to this broader used auto ecosystem. So that's really kind of the change that as to why we talk about both."

As I talked about with Brian's question, it certainly has been a headwind.
And it really all relates back to what happened in the fourth and the first quarter. In the fourth quarter typically is the time where we build our inventory up, we weren't able to do that because of COVID and some winter disruption productions. 
Then we had record sales in the first quarter. So we're still digging out of that hole. And like I told, Brian, we're about 30% light to target. We're about 15% year-over-year. If you look at last year's second quarter, where were this second quarter, we're about 15% light.  
We did make great progress sequentially every month. We grew our inventory. And look, we plan to continue to build inventory over the rest of the year. And I think the timing is really going to be -- when we get back to where we want to be, will really depend somewhat on the demand. 
As far as staffing, yes, during the quarter, although we were able to build inventory, we did have some headwinds even on the staffing side.

So with regard to a Tier 3 unit, a Tier 3 sale from a finance perspective, obviously, there's generally a higher cost of fund. There's a higher-risk customer there. But it's going to be just a little south of maybe a more prime -- a prime loan, if you will. So in that -- depending on the funding environment and obviously, the APR we can charge. But let's say, in that $2,000 to $2,100 range if you're able to capture all the finance economics potentially, but there is higher risk there. 
So there's a funding aspect there. Now obviously, with our partners, we were able to renegotiate fees. We're currently paying $750 to those Tier 3 loans that our partners pick up. And obviously, we mentioned beginning -- over the course of Q1, we started taking now 10% of the volume within the Tier 3 space. And we're happy with that volume, and we appreciate it, and we'll continue to assess the mix that we should have. 
But ultimately, for us, we want to make sure that whether we take more Tier 3, our partners take more Tier 3, we want to make sure that we are able to provide great credit offers to those customers. And in our current credit platform construct, we feel we do that. So those are the economics simply that answers your question. But again, we love the way it's constructed today, and we provide great offers to those customers."

Again, but we are on track by the end of this year to offer up to all of our retail customers 100% self-sufficiency online, our self-service online. We're going to continue to invest in the acquisition of customers by marketing. The investment in marketing is something that we had communicated last year that we were going to step up our marketing, advertising and other channels as well. 
Again, we believe we have a superior platform. We want to make sure that we're communicating that in an effective way to our consumers. But at the same time, there's also a very targeted ROI opportunities in advertising as well that we're investing in. 
And then lastly, we're going to continue to invest in the acquisition of vehicles in the Instant Offer program that we launched that has had tremendous success is just an example of one of those investments that just provided an outstanding ROI.
But we're going to continue to invest now. That being said, we do expect to lever over the longer term because at the same time that we're investing, we also have cost efficiency plays, whether it's the CTCs or whether it's the buying organization or whether it's other panels as well, we have opportunities to get more efficient in how we work.

As far as the second part of your question, the GPU, it's a great question. So I kind of think about -- we're in a very similar situation today than we were last quarter when we talked about this. We're constantly testing. A couple of quarters ago, we talked about doing some broader scale testing just because of some of the other factors, some of the other profit channels that were coming through the organization. 
And while those still exist, just like last quarter, we really wanted to make sure we -- you got to monitor the macro factors and does it make sense. You got to look at your inventory levels. You got to understand the elasticity, which, again, we're still getting the read on elasticity with the test that we always have going. 
You want to see what competitors are doing. And it just didn't make sense to deviate more from that historical trend that we have on margins. And we -- at the end of the day, we want to have very, very competitively priced inventory, I think, with the self-sufficiency, that certainly helps.

Now I think the fact that self-sufficiency is so high for us. I think that provides us a lot of opportunities as we go forward because that comes into play on not only your margin, but your pricing structure. I think during the quarter, what we saw was we came out of the first quarter very high elevated prices. It hung in there for a little while. 
We then actually saw a little bit of depreciation take place. But surprisingly, it started to appreciate again. So -- and we went back, I think we finished the quarter probably at the high that we finished the first quarter. So it's a very interesting dynamic. 
And I can only speculate maybe because the chip shortage is -- looks like it's going to be longer than I think what people originally thought of for new cars, I think maybe there's some folks out there buying more used cars to replenish their lot since they're not going to have new cars.

And like I said earlier, I mean we're making strides in continuing to get our inventory up. So we feel good about that. On the staffing, look, we've always invested in our associates.

And on the back of that gross profit growth, there are opportunities to leverage, specifically for this year, for the entire year, our expectation continues to be that we should be able to leverage for this year. 
It's hard to look quarter-to-quarter, you just can't look at quarter-to-quarter just because there's so many things that pop in and out of a quarter. But for the full year, we feel pretty good about that. And then moving forward, again, it's -- we are in growth mode and we're investing accordingly. 
And at the same time, and as I speak to every quarter, we do look at opportunities to get more efficient. There are investments we're making to drive the top line, there are investments we're making to help pull out costs as well. And we always have a sharp eye to that. So we'll continue to do our best on that. And at the same time, we are focused on market share growth and the opportunities that lay ahead of us, and we're really excited about them."

But I would also go back to the fact that, look, we have some major headwinds that when you add them all up together, they were hard to overcome, which I've already talked about, the inventory, just the pricing, the staffing. So those are headwinds over the self-sufficiency. 
I think what we're most excited about is this self-sufficient and the opportunity that, that gives us as we continue to move forward."

We delivered record levels of used and wholesale sales as well as EPS for the third quarter. We also delivered all-time high margins in both used and wholesale.
For the third quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $8.5 billion, up 64% compared with the third quarter of FY '21, driven by both higher average selling prices and volume gains. Net earnings per diluted share was $1.63, up 15% from a year ago. Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 415,000 cars in total, up 29% versus third quarter last year. For the first 9 months of FY '22, we sold approximately 1.3 million retail and wholesale cars combined as we set new records in each month.
We continue to be the largest buyer of vehicles from consumers. We bought approximately 383,000 cars from consumers in the third quarter, which is up 91% versus last year and again, we achieved self-sufficiency above 70%. Our customer-centric omnichannel strategy, solid execution and macro factors are driving performance across our company. In our retail business, total unit sales in the third quarter were up 16.9%, and used unit comps were up 15.8% versus the third quarter last year. We experienced robust demand as we ramp staffing levels and built inventory. CAF and our credit partners also supported our sales by continuing to deliver strong credit offers even as our average sales price grew by over 30% year-over-year.
We achieved sequential growth in saleable inventory each month within the quarter. While inventory and staffing remain below our targets, we are pleased with our momentum and are confident that we have access to the resources we need to build inventory ahead of tax season though retail demand will determine the pace. In addition to strong unit sales, we reported record retail gross profit per used unit of $2,235 up $84 per unit versus the third quarter last year. With used car prices at all-time highs, we chose to pass along the majority of our self-sufficiency driven acquisition cost savings to consumers via lower prices. We believe we struck the right balance between increasing our margins and supporting our customers in a time of elevated industry prices.
Wholesale units were up 48.5% from the third quarter last year, and gross profit per unit achieved an all-time record of $1,131 compared with $906 a year ago. The strength in wholesale units was primarily driven by the ongoing success of our instant online appraisal offering. We also benefited from still elevated valuations of used autos in the broader market. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $166 million, down from $176 million during the same period last year. CAF margins remained strong. Year-over-year financial results were impacted by a $68 million headwind in reserve adjustments. As a reminder, last year's quarter benefited from a reduced provision coming out of the pandemic, and this year's quarter reflects a more normalized provision.
CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong offers in all credit tiers. In a few moments, Jon will provide more detail on customer financing and CAF contributions as well as on the impact of the auto loan receivable systems conversion.
Right now, I'd like to turn it over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our third quarter financial performance. Enrique?"

Total gross profit was $837 million, up 32% from last year's record third quarter. This was driven by wholesale vehicle margin of $212 million, which was up 85% and used vehicle margin of $508 million, which was up 21% from last year's third quarter.
Other gross profit was $116 million, up 18% from last year's third quarter. Favorability in the quarter included $20 million of margin contribution from Edmunds. Other gross profit also benefited from a $12 million improvement in third-party finance fees with income of $1.6 million compared to a $10.6 million cost last year. This was driven by renegotiated third-party finance fees and lower Tier 3 volume compared with last year. Also positively impacting other gross profit, EPP was up $5 million or 4.8%. While penetration was stable at approximately 60%, this year's third quarter reflects a $6 million unfavorable return reserve adjustment compared to a $3 million favorable return reserve adjustment during the prior year's quarter.
Partially offsetting gross profit favorability, service was down $21 million from the prior year's quarter. This was driven by pressure primarily related to our efforts to grow technician staffing as well as a shift in some retail service capacity to instead support used car reconditioning. Service gross profit versus the prior year period improved in each month during the quarter, and we anticipate that results will continue to improve into the fourth quarter.
On the SG&A front, expenses for the third quarter increased to $576 million, up 34% from the prior year's quarter due to costs related to unit volume growth and continued investment in our strategic initiatives. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was roughly flat at 68.8% compared to 68.2% during the third quarter last year. The increase in SG&A dollars over last year was primarily driven by 3 main factors: first, a $100 million increase in total compensation and benefits, driven by a strong ramp in staffing; a $23 million increase in stock-based compensation; unit volume-related commissions and the inclusion of Edmond's payroll this quarter versus a year ago. Second, a $22 million increase in other overhead, which includes our receipt of a $23 million settlement from a class action lawsuit. The remainder of the change primarily reflects investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives and the impact of COVID-related cost savings in the prior year quarter. And third, a $17 million increase in advertising expense as previously communicated to drive customer acquisition and to amplify the CarMax brand by continuing to build awareness of our omnichannel offerings.
For the first 9 months of fiscal year '22, SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 66.1% and leveraging approximately 3 points over last year's 9-month percentage of 68.9%. We remain committed to ensuring that we are efficient and effective in our spend, and we expect that our targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver results over time. During the third quarter, from an efficiency and effectiveness perspective, we saw solid improvements in the service levels of our CECs and their conversion of web leads. This was despite the record level of volume that our CECs handled in the third quarter. This improvement was due to a combination of successful staffing ramps and ongoing utilization of our AI and machine learning processes that drive the right work to the right associates.
We also continue to see efficiency gains in our buying organization. The combination of our instant offer program along with the investments we've made in data science, automation and AI continue to materially drive down our costs per buy. From a capital structure perspective, we ended the quarter with an adjusted debt to capital ratio in the middle of our targeted range of 35% to 45%. During the quarter, we entered into a $700 million term loan agreement primarily to support the growth of our total inventory dollars. In regard to our share repurchase program, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders and repurchased approximately 850,000 shares in the quarter for approximately $115 million.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon."

Once again, our finance business has delivered solid results. For the third quarter, CAF penetration net of 3-day payoffs was 42.2% compared with 45.7% observed last year. Tier 2 increased to 22.2% of used unit",717,"Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. Once again, our finance business has delivered solid results. For the third quarter, CAF penetration net of 3-day payoffs was 42.2% compared with 45.7% observed last year. Tier 2 increased to 22.2% of used unit sales compared with 19.5% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 6.5% of sales compared with 9.7% a year ago. The year-over-year change in CAF penetration was driven by a larger percentage of customers leveraging cash or outside financing for the purchase of their vehicle, so as CAF comping over a historically high penetration in Q3 of FY '21.
We continue to observe strong credit offers from our Tier 2 partners as they compete for additional volume within the CarMax channel. These offers, along with a decrease in application volume and the lower portion of the credit spectrum contributed to the swap in volume between Tiers 2 and 3. CarMax continues to provide outstanding access to financing for our customers across the credit spectrum. Our approval rates this quarter remained over 95% despite financing amounts that are approximately 25% above the same period in 2020. This ability to maintain such a strong credit offering speaks to the value of our multi-lender credit platform supported by CAF and our long-term finance partners.
During this year's third quarter, on the strength of record used unit sales, CAF's net loans originated was nearly $2.4 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.3%, down from 8.6% a year ago and 8.5% in the second quarter. The difference in APR is primarily a result of the change in the credit mix of customers, along with rate testing that CAF executed within the quarter. CAF income for the quarter was $166 million, down $10 million from the same period last year. This included a more normalized loan loss provision of $76 million as compared to the significantly reduced provision of only $8 million in the same quarter last year that was driven by the continued reduction of the reserve that was established at the start of the COVID pandemic.
Almost fully offsetting the provision headwind was a year-over-year increase in total interest margin of $65 million or 7.2% of managed receivables. This year-over-year margin increase highlights the strength of our ABS program, the favorable state of the capital markets and our continued growth in receivables. The current quarter's provision of $76 million results in an ending reserve balance of $427 million or 2.75% of managed receivables. This is up from 2.66% at the end of the second quarter and includes a 6 basis point adjustment for the added Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume CAF is now originating. The adjustment was primarily driven by the implementation of our Tier 2 origination test. Remember, contribution from CAF originations is recognized over the life of the receivables, while the loss reserve is recognized at the time of origination. Note also that the core portion of the reserve allocated to Tier 1 loan losses remains well within our historical range of 2% to 2.5%.
During the third quarter, we transitioned from CAF's legacy auto loan receivable servicing systems to brand new systems. The new platform went live in October and included a period of planned downtime in a number of operational areas, including collections and customer service. This required pause in our business resulted in an increase in delinquencies and losses that we expect to normalize over the coming months as both our systems and processes stabilize. This had an immaterial impact to the loan loss provision in the quarter. Additionally, CAF absorbed roughly $5 million in deployment expense in the third quarter related to items such as temporary contractor support, proactive customer communication regarding the systems change and added staffing to handle the elevated call volume once back online.
We are extremely excited about this new platform that will not only provide CAF, a modernized foundation for growth and efficiency, but will also allow us to enhance our customer experience and self-service capabilities.

This quarter continues this year's strong top line performance trend. We're benefiting from our investments and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We provide the ability for customers to buy a car 100%",533,"Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Enrique. This quarter continues this year's strong top line performance trend. We're benefiting from our investments and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We provide the ability for customers to buy a car 100% in-store or 100% online, and our omnichannel capabilities allow our customers to personalize their experience with a mix of digital and physical interactions to meet their needs.
As our omnichannel and online sales continue to grow, we have observed that the vast majority of our customers who buy digitally still elect to take delivery in our stores. This is another proof point that our ability to offer seamless integration across digital and physical transaction is providing value to our customers and is a key differentiator for us.
In the third quarter, a little more than 9% of retail unit sales were online, up from the prior year's quarter of 5%. Our wholesale auctions remain virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 23% of total revenue are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 30%. This is up from 20% in last year's third quarter. Approximately 57% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 49% in the prior year's quarters. We've been focused on completing the rollout of our 100% self-service experience where customers, if they choose to, can independently complete the entire car buying process online. Currently, more than 2/3 of our customers have access to complete end-to-end unaided online experience, an increase from a little over 50% from our last call. This expansion reflects customers' ability to incorporate trade-ins without leans to their online orders. The remaining 2 used cases that we will be working through during the fourth quarter are paid transfers and trade-ins with lean.
In the third quarter, we bought approximately 194,000 vehicles from customers through our online instant appraisal, which represents about half of our total buys from customers. That's a new record, a 4% increase from our second quarter number and a 19% increase compared to the first quarter. This growth supports our belief that we remain the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers in the U.S. We are continuously enhancing our e-commerce offerings to exceed customer expectations and to seamlessly integrate with our best-in-class store experience.
In the third quarter, we continued to make progress on our online finance experience by expanding our finance-based shopping or FBS capability. FBS enables our customers to see personalized finance terms from multiple lenders across the full inventory of vehicles on our website, which is a key differentiator in the retail marketplace. Roughly 75% of our customers are able to enjoy this experience today. And going forward, we are working towards adding the remaining customers and integrating additional lenders to this experience. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we will be launching a more sophisticated version of the tool and increasing the speed of digital decisions.
Again, we're proud of our strong results for this quarter and year-to-date. By delivering the most customer-centric experience in the industry, we will enable sustainable growth and create meaningful long-term shareholder value.
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Jerome?"

So we're investing across the board. So if you take a look at SG&A as a percent of gross profit, that's kind of how we manage the business. And year-to-date, we've leveraged that by 300 basis points.

So any time price valuation goes up, that's a good thing for organizations that are buying cars and certainly is a good thing for us. As I think about the wholesale growth or just our growth in self-sufficiency in totality, I would still go back to that, we believe that the majority of that growth is really a result of some of the innovations, things like instant appraisal the instant offer that we have on -- for appraisals. I think that's driving the majority of the growth because even if I go back to the first quarter where we didn't see -- it was prior to kind of this continued ramp up in valuations, we saw a huge increase in and wholesale and just overall buy. So while it is hard, to your point, to disaggregate the 2, I think we believe that the majority of the increase is driven by things that we're doing internally."

And we added that more to the latter part of the quarter last year. And I think the -- what we're really seeing is we're giving customers options to do different things. So while they may think, okay, I'm going to do an online sale. As I said in my opening remarks, some people are still -- they're coming in and wanting to deliver in the store. They want to do a couple of things in the store. So I think a big driver is just options. We give consumers options. And so they may think they're going to do one thing and they actually take a different path, which -- that's what we're all about. We don't care which way a consumer wants to buy or how they want it delivered. We just want to make sure that we're giving them the most personalized experience. I'd expect to see this percent continue to go up. But again, it's going to be more driven by the customers' behaviors than us forcing anybody to go one way or the other."

So we're really trying to make the vehicles as affordable as possible. We'll continue this quarter, just like we did last quarter. We continue to look at inventory levels, test elasticity, check competitors' inventory. So there's a lot of things that go into this. But I do think we struck the right balance, both from a margin standpoint kind of coming in historically high if you look at the recent margin ranges for the last few years, I think we came in high on that.

Yes, if we think about the combination of the reserve and the provision, exactly as you stated, our reserve right now, metrically uses the 2.75% reserve to receivables. Remember in there is, as you stated, Tier 1, but also Tier 2, Tier 3 volume and then some expense for recovery there. If you back out that Tier 1, as I mentioned, we feel like we're at our normal range of 2% to 2.5% for that Tier 1 business. Also, if you look at what we originated in the quarter, $2.4 billion, again, recognizing that there's Tier 1, a higher loss of Tier 2 and Tier 3 in that originations as well as the recovery expense. But $76 million feels very much close to normal for that size of origination. So I think you're right on the mark here. It's something we feel like we're at a normal percentage from a loss rate perspective, but I would think about that going forward. And one thing I'll point out as a reminder, again, the provision was substantial at the height of the pandemic, $122 million done back in quarter one of FY '21. And as we saw performance improve really fantastic performance from our consumers, we were able to reduce that provision over time. So the fact that we comped over last year's quarter 3 is fantastic. So I realize we've still got that comping to do. But yes, agree, we're in a normal environment right now."

Just timing feels a little bit unusual to be experimented with cutting rates when we're actually seeing the inverse happening where the market is raising rates now in terms of the tier rates. So I guess like first question is, with that backdrop, have you found customers historically become more rate sensitive when rates rise? And is that the motivation for testing? And then like just using some kind of historical precedent, how should we think about the impact on rates to customers in periods where funding costs go up?

But most importantly for CAF is as the sole Tier 1 lender, we want to be highly competitive for our customers, provide the best possible offer as we can. So it made sense. We just wanted to get the pulse of the market. We did some rate testing, and we're watching that very carefully. As you mentioned, certainly, the Fed did come out and signal that there's going to be rate increases in the future. Again, we will manage that as we always do. We'll look at what the peers do, how the market reacts often in a rising rate environment. To your point, you will see a lag there. It won't get passed along to the customer right away. We're not looking to get out in front of that. We'll, one, again, remain highly competitive in our rates, and we will test we will test as we always do accordingly. We will watch how the market is moving, what those take rates are. And then if it makes sense to pass along to the customers, we will.

Some of the customers are just really shopping for their value, and they're not really interested in selling or even buying a car. So we're making a couple of million offers a year. As I think about the conversion of those, really, the way we've talked about it in the past is if the customers show up at our store, are there to get their vehicle praised, whether they haven't had it appraised online or whether they have had it appraised online. We look at the buy rate from that standpoint. So if I look at the traditional appraisal lane, where a customer hasn't had it appraised online. We're really seeing mid-30 buy rate, which is great. On the online side, as you can imagine, they've already had their vehicle valued online and they're showing up at the store then that certainly is going to be a higher buy rate. So it pulls the overall buy rate up. But I think it's -- I don't think we should look at it necessarily as of the ones that have offers, how many of them actually sold.

We delivered record levels of used and wholesale sales as well as EPS for the third quarter. We also delivered all-time high margins in both used and wholesale.
For the third quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $8.5 billion, up 64% compared with the third quarter of FY '21, driven by both higher average selling prices and volume gains. Net earnings per diluted share was $1.63, up 15% from a year ago. Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 415,000 cars in total, up 29% versus third quarter last year. For the first 9 months of FY '22, we sold approximately 1.3 million retail and wholesale cars combined as we set new records in each month.
We continue to be the largest buyer of vehicles from consumers. We bought approximately 383,000 cars from consumers in the third quarter, which is up 91% versus last year and again, we achieved self-sufficiency above 70%. Our customer-centric omnichannel strategy, solid execution and macro factors are driving performance across our company. In our retail business, total unit sales in the third quarter were up 16.9%, and used unit comps were up 15.8% versus the third quarter last year. We experienced robust demand as we ramp staffing levels and built inventory. CAF and our credit partners also supported our sales by continuing to deliver strong credit offers even as our average sales price grew by over 30% year-over-year.
We achieved sequential growth in saleable inventory each month within the quarter. While inventory and staffing remain below our targets, we are pleased with our momentum and are confident that we have access to the resources we need to build inventory ahead of tax season though retail demand will determine the pace. In addition to strong unit sales, we reported record retail gross profit per used unit of $2,235 up $84 per unit versus the third quarter last year. With used car prices at all-time highs, we chose to pass along the majority of our self-sufficiency driven acquisition cost savings to consumers via lower prices. We believe we struck the right balance between increasing our margins and supporting our customers in a time of elevated industry prices.
Wholesale units were up 48.5% from the third quarter last year, and gross profit per unit achieved an all-time record of $1,131 compared with $906 a year ago. The strength in wholesale units was primarily driven by the ongoing success of our instant online appraisal offering. We also benefited from still elevated valuations of used autos in the broader market. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $166 million, down from $176 million during the same period last year. CAF margins remained strong. Year-over-year financial results were impacted by a $68 million headwind in reserve adjustments. As a reminder, last year's quarter benefited from a reduced provision coming out of the pandemic, and this year's quarter reflects a more normalized provision.
CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong offers in all credit tiers. In a few moments, Jon will provide more detail on customer financing and CAF contributions as well as on the impact of the auto loan receivable systems conversion.
Right now, I'd like to turn it over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our third quarter financial performance. Enrique?"

Total gross profit was $837 million, up 32% from last year's record third quarter. This was driven by wholesale vehicle margin of $212 million, which was up 85% and used vehicle margin of $508 million, which was up 21% from last year's third quarter.
Other gross profit was $116 million, up 18% from last year's third quarter. Favorability in the quarter included $20 million of margin contribution from Edmunds. Other gross profit also benefited from a $12 million improvement in third-party finance fees with income of $1.6 million compared to a $10.6 million cost last year. This was driven by renegotiated third-party finance fees and lower Tier 3 volume compared with last year. Also positively impacting other gross profit, EPP was up $5 million or 4.8%. While penetration was stable at approximately 60%, this year's third quarter reflects a $6 million unfavorable return reserve adjustment compared to a $3 million favorable return reserve adjustment during the prior year's quarter.
Partially offsetting gross profit favorability, service was down $21 million from the prior year's quarter. This was driven by pressure primarily related to our efforts to grow technician staffing as well as a shift in some retail service capacity to instead support used car reconditioning. Service gross profit versus the prior year period improved in each month during the quarter, and we anticipate that results will continue to improve into the fourth quarter.
On the SG&A front, expenses for the third quarter increased to $576 million, up 34% from the prior year's quarter due to costs related to unit volume growth and continued investment in our strategic initiatives. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was roughly flat at 68.8% compared to 68.2% during the third quarter last year. The increase in SG&A dollars over last year was primarily driven by 3 main factors: first, a $100 million increase in total compensation and benefits, driven by a strong ramp in staffing; a $23 million increase in stock-based compensation; unit volume-related commissions and the inclusion of Edmond's payroll this quarter versus a year ago. 
Second, a $22 million increase in other overhead, which includes our receipt of a $23 million settlement from a class action lawsuit. The remainder of the change primarily reflects investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives and the impact of COVID-related cost savings in the prior year quarter. And third, a $17 million increase in advertising expense as previously communicated to drive customer acquisition and to amplify the CarMax brand by continuing to build awareness of our omnichannel offerings.
For the first 9 months of fiscal year '22, SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 66.1% leveraging approximately 3 points over last year's 9-month percentage of 68.9%. We remain committed to ensuring that we are efficient and effective in our spend, and we expect that our targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver results over time. During the third quarter, from an efficiency and effectiveness perspective, we saw solid improvements in the service levels of our CECs and their conversion of web leads. This was despite the record level of volume that our CECs handled in the third quarter. This improvement was due to a combination of successful staffing ramps and ongoing utilization of our AI and machine learning processes that drive the right work to the right associates.
We also continue to see efficiency gains in our buying organization. The combination of our instant offer program along with the investments we've made in data science, automation and AI continue to materially drive down our costs per buy. From a capital structure perspective, we ended the quarter with an adjusted debt to capital ratio in the middle of our targeted range of 35% to 45%. During the quarter, we entered into a $700 million term loan agreement primarily to support the growth of our total inventory dollars. In regard to our share repurchase program, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders and repurchased approximately 850,000 shares in the quarter for approximately $115 million.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon."

Once again, our finance business has delivered solid results. For the third quarter, CAF penetration net of 3-day payoffs was 42.2% compared with 45.7% observed last year. Tier 2 increased to 22.2% of used unit",719,"Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. Once again, our finance business has delivered solid results. For the third quarter, CAF penetration net of 3-day payoffs was 42.2% compared with 45.7% observed last year. Tier 2 increased to 22.2% of used unit sales compared with 19.5% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 6.5% of sales compared with 9.7% a year ago. The year-over-year change in CAF penetration was driven by a larger percentage of customers leveraging cash or outside financing for the purchase of their vehicle, so as well as CAF comping over a historically high penetration in Q3 of FY '21.
We continue to observe strong credit offers from our Tier 2 partners as they compete for additional volume within the CarMax channel. These offers, along with a decrease in application volume and the lower portion of the credit spectrum contributed to the swap in volume between Tiers 2 and 3. CarMax continues to provide outstanding access to financing for our customers across the credit spectrum. Our approval rates this quarter remained over 95% despite financing amounts that are approximately 25% above the same period in 2020. This ability to maintain such a strong credit offering speaks to the value of our multi-lender credit platform supported by CAF and our long-term finance partners.
During this year's third quarter, on the strength of record used unit sales, CAF's net loans originated was nearly $2.4 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.3%, down from 8.6% a year ago and 8.5% in the second quarter. The difference in APR is primarily a result of the change in the credit mix of customers, along with rate testing that CAF executed within the quarter. CAF income for the quarter was $166 million, down $10 million from the same period last year. This included a more normalized loan loss provision of $76 million as compared to the significantly reduced provision of only $8 million in the same quarter last year that was driven by the continued reduction of the reserve that was established at the start of the COVID pandemic.
Almost fully offsetting the provision headwind was a year-over-year increase in total interest margin of $65 million or 7.2% of managed receivables. This year-over-year margin increase highlights the strength of our ABS program, the favorable state of the capital markets and our continued growth in receivables. The current quarter's provision of $76 million results in an ending reserve balance of $427 million or 2.75% of managed receivables. This is up from 2.66% at the end of the second quarter and includes a 6 basis point adjustment for the added Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume CAF is now originating. The adjustment was primarily driven by the implementation of our Tier 2 origination test. Remember, contribution from CAF originations is recognized over the life of the receivables, while the loss reserve is recognized at the time of origination. Note also that the core portion of the reserve allocated to Tier 1 loan losses remains well within our historical range of 2% to 2.5%.
During the third quarter, we transitioned from CAF's legacy auto loan receivable servicing systems to brand new systems. The new platform went live in October and included a period of planned downtime in a number of operational areas, including collections and customer service. This required pause in our business resulted in an increase in delinquencies and losses that we expect to normalize over the coming months as both our systems and processes stabilize. This had an immaterial impact to the loan loss provision on the quarter. Additionally, CAF absorbed roughly $5 million in deployment expense in the third quarter related to items such as temporary contractor support, proactive customer communication regarding the systems change and added staffing to handle the elevated call volume once back online.
We are extremely excited about this new platform that will not only provide CAF a modernized foundation for growth and efficiency, but will also allow us to enhance our customer experience and self-service capabilities. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the CAF organization, along with the corresponding project teams who have worked so tirelessly to build them and implement such a transformative solution for both our associates and our customers.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

We're benefiting from our investments and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We provide the ability for customers to buy a car 100% in-store or 100% online, and our omnichannel capabilities allow our customers to personalize their experience with a mix of digital and physical interactions to meet their needs.
As our omnichannel and online sales continue to grow, we have observed that the vast majority of our customers who buy digitally still elect to take delivery in our stores. This is another proof point that our ability to offer seamless integration across digital and physical transaction is providing value to our customers and is a key differentiator for us.
In the third quarter, a little more than 9% of retail unit sales were online, up from the prior year's quarter of 5%. Our wholesale auctions remain virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 23% of total revenue are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 30%. This is up from 20% in last year's third quarter. Approximately 57% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 49% in the prior year's quarters. We've been focused on completing the rollout of our 100% self-service experience where customers, if they choose to, can independently complete the entire car buying process online. Currently, more than 2/3 of our customers have access to complete end-to-end unaided online experience, an increase from a little over 50% from our last call. This expansion reflects customers' ability to incorporate trade-ins without liens to their online orders. The remaining 2 use cases that we will be working through during the fourth quarter are paid transfers and trade-ins with liens.
In the third quarter, we bought approximately 194,000 vehicles from customers through our online instant appraisal, which represents about half of our total buys from customers. That's a new record, a 4% increase from our second quarter number and a 19% increase compared to the first quarter. This growth supports our belief that we remain the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers in the U.S. We are continuously enhancing our e-commerce offerings to exceed customer expectations and to seamlessly integrate with our best-in-class store experience.
In the third quarter, we continued to make progress on our online finance experience by expanding our finance-based shopping or FBS capability. FBS enables our customers to see personalized finance terms from multiple lenders across the full inventory of vehicles on our website, which is a key differentiator in the retail marketplace. Roughly 75% of our customers are able to enjoy this experience today. And going forward, we are working towards adding the remaining customers and integrating additional lenders to this experience. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we will be launching a more sophisticated version of the tool and increasing the speed of digital decisions.
Again, we're proud of our strong results for this quarter and year-to-date. By delivering the most customer-centric experience in the industry, we will enable sustainable growth and create meaningful long-term shareholder value.

So any time price valuation goes up, that's a good thing for organizations that are buying cars and certainly is a good thing for us. As I think about the wholesale growth or just our growth in self-sufficiency in totality, I would still go back to that we believe that the majority of that growth is really a result of some of the innovations, things like instant appraisal or the instant offer that we have on -- for appraisals. I think that's driving the majority of the growth because even if I go back to the first quarter where we didn't see -- it was prior to kind of this continued ramp up in valuations, we saw a huge increase in and wholesale and just overall buy. So while it is hard, to your point, to disaggregate the 2, I think we believe that the majority of the increase is driven by things that we're doing internally."

So while they may think, okay, I'm going to do an online sale. As I said in my opening remarks, some people are still -- they're coming in and wanting to deliver in the store. They want to do a couple of things in the store. So I think a big driver is just options. We give consumers options. And so they may think they're going to do one thing and they actually take a different path, which -- that's what we're all about. We don't care which way a consumer wants to buy or how they want it delivered. We just want to make sure that we're giving them the most personalized experience.

We did mention that there was less volume down in the lower kind of subprime space. So that will take volume from Tier 3. But I think also very important of note is the credit offers from our Tier 2 lenders has been spectacular, and they're probably pulling some volume up out of Tier 3, which is positive, obviously, from a participation standpoint, so that's strong. Obviously, you did recognize that CAF is in the Tier 2 space as well. So we're taking some volume there.

Like I did say, I think the fact that we have been light in inventory, especially in the second quarter and how we've continued to work through that. I think that's a big factor. 
I think the staffing is another big factor because we're understaffed in the stores and our customer experience centers. We continue to make enhancements on our omnichannel experience. If I think about just year-over-year, online and omnichannel, this year was roughly, let's call it, 66% of sales. A year ago, it was 50, 53% of the sales. I think passing along efficiencies in pricing last quarter was really the first quarter that we had seen self-sufficiency above 70%, and we saw that continue through this quarter and being able to pass those savings along I think were also a good thing. So I think there's a lot that's playing into it, and it's really hard to say, okay, well, this piece of it or that piece. We felt great about the quarter. It was strong every month in the quarter.

Remember in there is, as you stated, Tier 1, but also Tier 2, Tier 3 volume and then some expense for recovery there. If you back out that Tier 1, as I mentioned, we feel like we're at our normal range of 2% to 2.5% for that Tier 1 business. Also, if you look at what we originated in the quarter, $2.4 billion, again, recognizing that there's Tier 1, a higher loss of Tier 2 and Tier 3 in that originations as well as the recovery expense. But $76 million feels very much close to normal for that size of origination. 
So I think you're right on the mark here. It's something we feel like we're at a normal percentage from a loss rate perspective, but I would think about that going forward. And one thing I'll point out as a reminder, again, the provision was substantial at the height of the pandemic, $122 million done back in quarter one of FY '21. And as we saw performance improve really fantastic performance from our consumers, we were able to reduce that provision over time. So the fact that we comped over last year's quarter 3 is fantastic.

Can you elaborate more on the lower rates on new loans this quarter compared to last quarter? And you mentioned kind of rate testing. Your peer made a -- a large online peer made a similar comment last quarter. Just timing feels a little bit unusual to be experimented with cutting rates when we're actually seeing the inverse happening where the market is raising rates now in terms of the tier rates. So I guess first question is, with that backdrop, have you found customers historically become more rate sensitive when rates rise? And is that the motivation for testing? And then just using some kind of historical precedent, how should we think about the impact on rates to customers in periods where funding costs go up? Like how big of a lag is there between passing those rate increases through?"

We're always trying to keep an eye on what the market is doing. We can look at a number of metrics internally, again, our capture rate or our booking rate, which results in our penetration, 3-day payoffs, a number of metrics we can keep an eye on. But most importantly for CAF is as the sole Tier 1 lender, we want to be highly competitive for our customers, provide the best possible offer as we can. So it made sense. We just wanted to get the pulse of the market. We did some rate testing, and we're watching that very carefully. As you mentioned, certainly, the Fed did come out and signal that there's going to be rate increases in the future. Again, we will manage that as we always do. We'll look at what the peers do, how the market reacts often in a rising rate environment. 
To your point, you will see a lag there. It won't get passed along to the customer right away. We're not looking to get out in front of that. We'll, one, again, remain highly competitive in our rates, and we will test. We will test as we always do accordingly. We will watch how the market is moving, what those take rates are. And then if it makes sense to pass along to the customers, we will. But if it impacts sales to cars or the experience or our CAF's capture rate, then we may not. So the testing will drive what we do."

Some of the customers are just really shopping for their value, and they're not really interested in selling or even buying a car. So we're making a couple of million offers a year. As I think about the conversion of those, really, the way we've talked about it in the past is if the customers show up at our store, they are to get their vehicle praised, whether they haven't had it appraised online or whether they have had it appraised online. We look at the buy rate from that standpoint. So if I look at the traditional appraisal lane, where a customer hasn't had it appraised online. We're really seeing mid-30 buy rate, which is great. 
On the online side, as you can imagine, they've already had their vehicle valued online and they're showing up at the store then that certainly is going to be a higher buy rate. So it pulls the overall buy rate up. But I think it's -- I don't think we should look at it necessarily as of the ones that have offers, how many of them actually sold. We do see some good improvement there, but that's not really how we think about the business."

So as more chips are available and more new cars are available, you'll start to see the impact on used vehicle prices. I think any time sales prices are up 30% year-over-year, I think there is a risk down the road, there could be some more negative equity out there. But I can tell you, we've been in this business a long time. We've been through a lot of cycles up and down, and we've proven that we can work through any such factors, whether it be negative equity, whether it be depreciation in the marketplace.

We delivered record levels of used and wholesale sales as well as EPS for the third quarter. We also delivered all-time high margins in both used and wholesale.
For the third quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $8.5 billion, up 64% compared with the third quarter of FY '21, driven by both higher average selling prices and volume gains. Net earnings per diluted share was $1.63, up 15% from a year ago. Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 415,000 cars in total, up 29% versus third quarter last year. For the first 9 months of FY '22, we sold approximately 1.3 million retail and wholesale cars combined as we set new records in each month.
We continue to be the largest buyer of vehicles from consumers. We bought approximately 383,000 cars from consumers in the third quarter, which is up 91% versus last year and, again, we achieved self-sufficiency above 70%.
Our customer-centric omnichannel strategy, solid execution and macro factors are driving performance across our company. In our retail business, total unit sales in the third quarter were up 16.9%, and used unit comps were up 15.8% versus the third quarter last year. We experienced robust demand as we ramped staffing levels and built inventory. CAF and our credit partners also supported our sales by continuing to deliver strong credit offers even as our average sales price grew by over 30% year-over-year.
We achieved sequential growth in saleable inventory each month within the quarter. While inventory and staffing remained below our targets, we are pleased with our momentum and are confident that we have access to the resources we need to build inventory ahead of tax season though retail demand will determine the pace. In addition to strong unit sales, we reported record retail gross profit per used unit of $2,235, up $84 per unit versus the third quarter last year. With used car prices at all-time highs, we chose to pass along the majority of our self-sufficiency-driven acquisition cost savings to consumers via lower prices. We believe we struck the right balance between increasing our margins and supporting our customers in a time of elevated industry prices.
Wholesale units were up 48.5% from the third quarter last year, and gross profit per unit achieved an all-time record of $1,131 compared with $906 a year ago. The strength in wholesale units was primarily driven by the ongoing success of our instant online appraisal offering. We also benefited from still elevated valuations of used autos in the broader market.
CarMax Auto Finance, or CAF, delivered income of $166 million, down from $176 million during the same period last year. CAF margins remained strong. Year-over-year financial results were impacted by a $68 million headwind in reserve adjustments. As a reminder, last year's quarter benefited from a reduced provision coming out of the pandemic, and this year's quarter reflects a more normalized provision.
CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong offers in all credit tiers. In a few moments, Jon will provide more detail on customer financing and CAF contributions as well as on the impact of the auto loan receivable systems conversion.
Right now, I'd like to turn it over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our third quarter financial performance. Enrique?"

Total gross profit was $837 million, up 32% from last year's record third quarter. This was driven by wholesale vehicle margin of $212 million, which was up 85%, and used vehicle margin of $508 million, which was up 21% from last year's third quarter.
Other gross profit was $116 million, up 18% from last year's third quarter. Favorability in the quarter included $20 million of margin contribution from Edmunds. Other gross profit also benefited from a $12 million improvement in third-party finance fees with income of $1.6 million compared to a $10.6 million cost last year. This was driven by renegotiated third-party finance fees and lower Tier 3 volume compared with last year. Also positively impacting other gross profit, EPP was up $5 million or 4.8%. While penetration was stable at approximately 60%, this year's third quarter reflects a $6 million unfavorable return reserve adjustment compared to a $3 million favorable return reserve adjustment during the prior year's quarter.
Partially offsetting gross profit favorability, service was down $21 million from the prior year's quarter. This was driven by pressure primarily related to our efforts to grow technician staffing as well as a shift in some retail service capacity to instead support used car reconditioning. Service gross profit versus the prior year period improved in each month during the quarter, and we anticipate that results will continue to improve into the fourth quarter.
On the SG&A front, expenses for the third quarter increased to $576 million, up 34% from the prior year's quarter due to costs related to unit volume growth and continued investment in our strategic initiatives. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was roughly flat at 68.8% compared to 68.2% during the third quarter last year. The increase in SG&A dollars over last year was primarily driven by 3 main factors. First, a $100 million increase in total compensation and benefits, driven by a strong ramp in staffing, a $23 million increase in stock-based compensation, unit volume-related commissions and the inclusion of Edmunds' payroll this quarter versus a year ago.
Second, a $22 million increase in other overhead, which includes our receipt of a $23 million settlement from a class action lawsuit. The remainder of the change primarily reflects investments to advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives and the impact of COVID-related cost savings in the prior year quarter. And third, a $17 million increase in advertising expense, as previously communicated, to drive customer acquisition and to amplify the CarMax brand by continuing to build awareness of our omnichannel offerings.
For the first 9 months of fiscal year '22, SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 66.1%, leveraging approximately 3 points over last year's 9-month percentage of 68.9%. We remain committed to ensuring that we are efficient and effective in our spend, and we expect that our targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver results over time. During the third quarter, from an efficiency and effectiveness perspective, we saw solid improvements in the service levels of our CECs and their conversion of web leads. This was despite the record level of volume that our CECs handled in the third quarter. This improvement was due to a combination of successful staffing ramps and ongoing utilization of our AI and machine learning processes that drive the right work to the right associates.
We also continue to see efficiency gains in our buying organization. The combination of our instant offer program, along with the investments we've made in data science, automation and AI, continue to materially drive down our costs per buy. From a capital structure perspective, we ended the quarter with an adjusted debt to capital ratio in the middle of our targeted range of 35% to 45%. During the quarter, we entered into a $700 million term loan agreement primarily to support the growth of our total inventory dollars. In regard to our share repurchase program, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders and repurchased approximately 850,000 shares in the quarter for approximately $115 million.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon."

For the third quarter, CAF's penetration, net of 3-day payoffs, was 42.2% compared with 45.7% observed last year. Tier 2 increased to 22.2% of used unit sales compared with 19.5% last year. Tier 3 accounted for 6.5% of sales compared with 9.7% a year ago. The year-over-year change in CAF penetration was driven by a larger percentage of customers leveraging cash or outside financing for the purchase of their vehicle as well as CAF comping over a historically high penetration in Q3 of FY '21.
We continued to observe strong credit offers from our Tier 2 partners as they compete for additional volume within the CarMax channel. These offers, along with a decrease in application volume and the lower portion of the credit spectrum, contributed to the swap in volume between Tiers 2 and 3. CarMax continues to provide outstanding access to financing for our customers across the credit spectrum. Our approval rates this quarter remained over 95% despite financing amounts that are approximately 25% above the same period in 2020. This ability to maintain such a strong credit offering speaks to the value of our multi-lender credit platform supported by CAF and our long-term finance partners.
During this year's third quarter, on the strength of record used unit sales, CAF's net loans originated was nearly $2.4 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.3%, down from 8.6% a year ago and 8.5% in the second quarter. The difference in APR is primarily a result of the change in the credit mix of customers, along with rate testing that CAF executed within the quarter. CAF income for the quarter was $166 million, down $10 million from the same period last year. This included a more normalized loan loss provision of $76 million as compared to the significantly reduced provision of only $8 million in the same quarter last year that was driven by the continued reduction of the reserve that was established at the start of the COVID pandemic.
Almost fully offsetting the provision headwind was a year-over-year increase in total interest margin of $65 million or 7.2% of managed receivables. This year-over-year margin increase highlights the strength of our ABS program, the favorable state of the capital markets and our continued growth in receivables. The current quarter's provision of $76 million results in an ending reserve balance of $427 million or 2.75% of managed receivables. This is up from 2.66% at the end of the second quarter and includes a 6 basis point adjustment for the added Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume CAF is now originating. The adjustment was primarily driven by the implementation of our Tier 2 origination test. Remember, contribution from CAF originations is recognized over the life of the receivables, while the loss reserve is recognized at the time of origination. Note also that the core portion of the reserve allocated to Tier 1 loan losses remains well within our historical range of 2% to 2.5%.
During the third quarter, we transitioned from CAF's legacy auto loan receivable servicing systems to brand new systems. The new platform went live in October and included a period of planned downtime in a number of operational areas, including collections and customer service. This required pause in our business resulted in an increase in delinquencies and losses that we expect to normalize over the coming months as both our systems and processes stabilize. This had an immaterial impact to the loan loss provision on the quarter. Additionally, CAF absorbed roughly $5 million in deployment expense in the third quarter related to items such as temporary contractor support, proactive customer communication regarding the systems change and added staffing to handle the elevated call volume once back online.
We are extremely excited about this new platform that will not only provide CAF, a modernized foundation for growth and efficiency, but will also allow us to enhance our customer experience and self-service capabilities. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the CAF organization, along with the corresponding project teams who have worked so tirelessly to build them and implement such a transformative solution for both our associates and our customers.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

This quarter continues this year's strong top line performance trend. We're benefiting from our investments and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We provide the ability for customers to buy a car 100%",533,"Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Enrique. This quarter continues this year's strong top line performance trend. We're benefiting from our investments and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We provide the ability for customers to buy a car 100% in-store or 100% online, and our omnichannel capabilities allow our customers to personalize their experience with a mix of digital and physical interactions to meet their needs.
As our omnichannel and online sales continue to grow, we have observed that the vast majority of our customers who buy digitally still elect to take delivery in our stores. This is another proof point that our ability to offer seamless integration across digital and physical transaction is providing value to our customers and is a key differentiator for us.
In the third quarter, a little more than 9% of retail unit sales were online, up from the prior year's quarter of 5%. Our wholesale auctions remain virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 23% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. Total revenue resulting from online transactions was approximately 30%. This is up from 20% in last year's third quarter. Approximately 57% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, up from 49% in the prior year's quarters.
We've been focused on completing the rollout of our 100% self-service experience where customers, if they choose to, can independently complete the entire car buying process online. Currently, more than 2/3 of our customers have access to complete end-to-end unaided online experience, an increase from a little over 50% from our last call. This expansion reflects customers' ability to incorporate trade-ins without liens to their online orders. The remaining 2 use cases that we will be working through during the fourth quarter are paid transfers and trade-ins with liens.
In the third quarter, we bought approximately 194,000 vehicles from customers through our online instant appraisal, which represents about half of our total buys from customers. That's a new record, a 4% increase from our second quarter number and a 19% increase compared to the first quarter. This growth supports our belief that we remain the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers in the U.S.
We are continuously enhancing our e-commerce offerings to exceed customer expectations and to seamlessly integrate with our best-in-class store experience. In the third quarter, we continued to make progress on our online finance experience by expanding our finance-based shopping, or FBS, capability. FBS enables our customers to see personalized finance terms from multiple lenders across the full inventory of vehicles on our website, which is a key differentiator in the retail marketplace. Roughly 75% of our customers are able to enjoy this experience today. And going forward, we are working towards adding the remaining customers and integrating additional lenders to this experience. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we will be launching a more sophisticated version of the tool and increasing the speed of digital decisions.
Again, we're proud of our strong results for this quarter and year-to-date. By delivering the most customer-centric experience in the industry, we will enable sustainable growth and create meaningful long-term shareholder value.
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Jerome?"

So we're investing across the board. So if you take a look at SG&A as a percent of gross profit, that's kind of how we manage the business. And year-to-date, we've leveraged that by 300 basis points.

So any time used price valuation goes up, that's a good thing for organizations that are buying cars and certainly is a good thing for us. As I think about the wholesale growth or just our growth in self-sufficiency in totality, I would still go back to that we believe that the majority of that growth is really a result of some of the innovations, things like instant appraisal or the instant offer that we have on -- for appraisals. I think that's driving the majority of the growth because even if I go back to the first quarter where we didn't see -- it was prior to kind of this continued ramp-up in valuations, we saw a huge increase in wholesale and just overall buys. So while it is hard, to your point, to disaggregate the 2, I think we believe that the majority of the increase is driven by things that we're doing internally."

So while they may think, okay, I'm going to do an online sale, as I said in my opening remarks, some people are still -- they're coming in and wanting to deliver in the store. They want to do a couple of things in the store. So I think a big driver is just options. We give consumers options. And so they may think they're going to do one thing and they actually take a different path, which -- that's what we're all about. We don't care which way a consumer wants to buy or how they want it delivered. We just want to make sure that we're giving them the most personalized experience.

Like I did say, I think the fact that we have been light in inventory, especially in the second quarter and how we've continued to work through that, I think that's a big factor. 
I think the staffing is another big factor because we're understaffed in the stores and our customer experience centers. We continue to make enhancements on our omnichannel experience. If I think about just year-over-year, online and omnichannel, this year was roughly, let's call it, 66% of sales. A year ago, it was 53% of the sales. I think passing along efficiencies in pricing, last quarter was really the first quarter that we had seen self-sufficiency above 70%, and we saw that continue through this quarter and being able to pass those savings along, I think, were also a good thing.

But like I said earlier, I think we have the resources, and we're on the right path to make sure that we'll be able to get our inventory to where it needs to be in time for any type of tax time sales. And I'll tell you, the other thing is if I look over the next year, we're also -- as part of our planned growth, we have roughly, let's call it, 10 new production centers opening up. Some of them are part of geo, some of them are part of expansion plans that we'd already started. So we've got the resources we need, and we're on a good trajectory, but those are our, I think, shorter-term focuses for us, certainly."

Yes, if we think about the combination of the reserve and the provision, exactly as you stated, our reserve right now metrically uses the 2.75% reserve to receivables. Remember in there is, as you stated, Tier 1, but also Tier 2, Tier 3 volume and then some expense for recovery there. If you back out that Tier 1, as I mentioned, we feel like we're hitting our normal range of 2% to 2.5% for that Tier 1 business. Also, if you look at what we originated in the quarter, $2.4 billion, again, recognizing that there's Tier 1, a higher loss of Tier 2 and Tier 3 in that originations as well as the recovery expense. But $76 million feels very much close to normal for that size of origination.
So I think you're right on the mark here. It's something -- we feel like we're at a normal percentage from a loss rate perspective, but I would think about that going forward. And one thing I'll point out as a reminder, again, the provision was substantial at the height of the pandemic. $122 million done back in quarter 1 of FY '21. And as we saw performance improve, really fantastic performance from our consumers, we were able to reduce that provision over time. So the fact that we comped over last year's quarter 3 is fantastic. So I realize we've still got that comping to do. But yes, agree, we're in a normal environment right now."

But most importantly for CAF is, as the sole Tier 1 lender, we want to be highly competitive for our customers, provide the best possible offer as we can. So it made sense. We just wanted to get the pulse of the market. We did some rate testing, and we're watching that very carefully. As you mentioned, certainly, the Fed did come out and signal that there's going to be rate increases in the future. Again, we will manage that as we always do. We'll look at what the peers do, how the market reacts often in a rising rate environment.
To your point, you will see a lag there. It won't get passed along to the customer right away. We're not looking to get out in front of that. We'll, one, again, remain highly competitive in our rates, and we will test. We will test as we always do, accordingly. We will watch how the market is moving, what those take rates are.

Some of the customers are just really shopping for their value, and they're not really interested in selling or even buying a car. So we're making a couple of million offers a year. As I think about the conversion of those, really, the way we've talked about it in the past is if the customers show up at our store, they are to get their vehicle appraised, whether they haven't had it appraised online or whether they have had it appraised online. We look at the buy rate from that standpoint. So if I look at the traditional appraisal lane, where a customer hasn't had it appraised online, we're really seeing mid-30 buy rate, which is great.
On the online side, as you can imagine, they've already had their vehicle valued online and they're showing up at the store, then that certainly is going to be a higher buy rate. So it pulls the overall buy rate up. But I think it's -- I don't think we should look at it necessarily as of the ones that have offers, how many of them actually sold.
