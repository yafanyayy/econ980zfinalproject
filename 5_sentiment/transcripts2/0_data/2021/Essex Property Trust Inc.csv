I'm very pleased to acknowledge the promotions of Angela Kleiman and Barb Pack to their new roles at Essex. And greatly appreciate their contributions for many years of dedicated service. Both Angela and Barb",1436,"Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm very pleased to acknowledge the promotions of Angela Kleiman and Barb Pack to their new roles at Essex. And greatly appreciate their contributions for many years of dedicated service. Both Angela and Barb will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A. 
At the end of last year, we announced John Burkart Retirement, and we thank John for his tireless efforts and numerous contributions to the company's success over nearly 3 decades. As we reported last night, our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in lower same-property revenue and core FFO per share for both the quarter and the full year. Similar to the last few quarters, pandemic-related regulations have had 2 primary consequences. First, shelter-in-placement related orders have resulted in unprecedented job losses; and second, anti indiction and related laws prevent us from maximizing property performance. 
Government mandates are constantly changing and they intensified during the fourth quarter given surging COVID-19 cases. Navigating the pandemic involves extraordinary efforts, and I thank the Essex team for their tireless dedication amid these challenges. 
Overall, our fourth quarter results reflect stability in sequential net effective rents beginning in October and as discussed during our third quarter earnings call. Sequential revenues improved 30 basis points in the quarter, with market rents mostly flat in the cities and modestly positive in suburban locations. Therefore, we are cautiously optimistic that we have or will soon reach the bottom in market rent declines. 
As of December 2020, preliminary 3-month trailing job losses in the Essex markets were 7.9% year-over-year, a 150 basis point improvement compared to minus 9.4% for September 2020 and outperforming the nation, which had a 100 basis point improvement from September to December. Even with the recovery of jobs in Q3 and Q4, the nation had 9.2 million fewer jobs year-over-year for the month of December, roughly equal to the number of jobs lost at the worst point of the financial crisis. 
Our data analytics team prepared S17 to the supplemental, which is our base case scenario underlying our expectation that net effective rents will decline 1.9% in 2021. The range of potential outcomes is extraordinarily wide for 2021, given many unknowns that relate to the pandemic, including the pace of vaccine deployment and changes in regulation. 
Our modeling further assumes 4% GDP growth, which should lead to positive momentum in the second half of 2021. Apartment supply will continue to be a challenge, especially in the downtown locations of Los Angeles and Seattle. Our data and analytics team expects approximately 34,000 apartment deliveries in 2021, a modest increase compared to last year. 
Also similar to 2020, we don't expect much for-sale housing production going forward. It's our experience that affordable for-sale housing competes directly with rentals, once rents rise to a level that approximates the monthly payment of an entry-level for-sale home, and there is little risk of that occurring in the Essex markets anytime soon. 
Page S-17.1 of the supplemental highlights 13 recent multibillion-dollar tech initial public offerings for companies headquartered in the Essex markets. Overall, 2020 was a great year for IPOs, with 147 tech sector offerings completed during the year. It's our view that the IPO market is essential to recharge the tech ecosystem, providing growth capital to early-stage investors and to generate liquidity for reinvestment. 
Page S-17.1 also illustrates the reacceleration in job openings for the top 10 tech companies, which has increased 38% since the August trough. Our analysis indicates that nearly 60% of the total job postings are located in California or Washington, with the next largest state, Texas, accounting for just 7%. The Page S-17.2 of the supplemental package demonstrates that venture capital investments continued on a record pace in 2020 with approximately $130 billion invested in the U.S. with the Essex markets continuing to receive the dominant share of VC investment. Success in the knowledge-based economy requires a critical mass of highly skilled workers, creating a network effect that draws companies to the Bay Area and Seattle. While only a limited number of venture-backed companies will go public, some will experience extraordinarily -- extraordinary growth similar to Snowflake, DoorDash, Airbnb, and resulting in thousands of high-paying jobs. 
The environment today has many similarities to the previous recessionary periods, including the financial crisis and the bursting of the Dot-com bubble. In both cases, migration out of California was often front page news. In 2020, we experienced higher out migration than normal, especially in our West Coast urban centers. In our experience, people make different housing choices during recessions and it's not surprising to see many in the large baby boomer cohort monetized the value of an expensive California home to move to less expensive areas as part of the retirement plan. 
This recession is unique with respect to the extraordinary loss of jobs that involve lower paid service workers, jobs that are concentrated in the city centers and effective employees often had only 2 choices: move immediately to find work or stay in their home shielded by eviction forbearance laws. As with previous recessions, we expect most of these trends to reverse. We expect that the demand for restaurants, services and travel will recover swiftly as vaccines are administered, bringing back related service jobs. Workers in the Essex markets earn more than in most parts of the country and the draw of higher-paying jobs, combined with lower recent rent levels rental housing down the West Coast, the most affordable it has been since 2013. 
Our recent McKinsey study estimates that only 22% of the American workforce can work from home without any productivity loss. We have been tracking many companies that have adopted work from home models during the pandemic, and we remain confident that the vast majority of companies will ask employees to return to the office when it is safe to do so, likely with increased work from home flexibility going forward. Google, Netflix and Apple are among the largest companies who have expressed their desire to return to the office, many others will follow. 
Turning to the regulatory environment, a third wave of COVID-19 cases beginning in November and related concerns about hospital availability led to the imposition of severe stay-at-home orders in all of our California markets. Some of these restrictions were eased last week, but all of the Essex markets remain in California's most restrictive category. 
Recently, with the passage of SB 91 last week, the state of California has extended COVID-19 related eviction protection from January 31 to June 30, 2021, including pushing back the requirement to pay at least 25% of pandemic-related rent. In addition, the law established a state rental assistance program to allocate $2.6 billion in Federal Stimulus Funds using income levels to prioritize payments and accepting related applications in March. As with similar laws, there are many related requirements and complexities, which we are evaluating. 
Turning to the apartment investment markets. During 2020, we sold 4 properties with a total of 670 apartment homes for $343 million, all of which were placed under contract subsequent to the implementation of shelter-in-place orders in March. Given the wide discount in valuation for public REITs compared to the private real estate markets, property sales remain our preferred source of funds for investment. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, a relatively small number of apartment sales support our belief that property values have not changed materially since the onset of the pandemic. However, extraordinary changes in rent increasing in the case of both suburban markets and decreasing sharply in some urban locations, makes it difficult to draw conclusions about cap rates. 
In the suburbs, where rents are generally at or above pre-pandemic levels, property values have modestly increased and cap rates are somewhat lower compared to the pre-pandemic period. Given lower rents and significant concessions in hard hit cities, recent price talk around possible sales indicate about a 5% reduction in value versus the pre-COVID period, resulting in cap rates for high-quality properties below 4%. 
As with previous recessions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to provide very attractive financing with 7-year fixed rate financing in the mid-2% range, potentially supporting lower cap rates. Vaccine distribution should remove uncertainty with respect to apartment operations and property values. As a result, we believe transaction volumes will begin to accelerate. As we've indicated before, improved cash flow from positive leverage in apartments has historically led to a robust transaction market. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela."

First, I would like to express my appreciation to the Essex operations team for their diligent efforts to serve our customers amidst a challenging environment caused by the COVID pandemic. Thank you for all your hard work. 
As for my comments, I will begin by discussing our 2020 results, followed by our outlook for 2021. The overall, our market performed as we expected, despite the headwinds of new cohort related closures and seasonal decline in demand. Currently, the urban core, particularly in tech-centric markets continue to remain more impacted by COVID-19 related job losses and office disclosures. In addition, the change in quality of life, resulting from the closures of restaurants and public amenities has driven a temporary shift in consumer preferences. High-rise buildings or communities located in the area with high walk scores have been the most impacted by this shift in demand. Conversely, communities with private outdoor space or more affordable residences outside the urban core continue to experience greater demand, which benefited many of our properties in Ventura, San Diego, Orange County and the East Bay in Northern California. This temporary shift in demand continued in the fourth quarter, where we experienced a 7.6% and 9.9% year-over-year increase in quarterly turnover in CBD, Seattle and San Francisco compared to the portfolio average turnover of only 1.3%. Furthermore, our CBD locations also had a greater concentration of of apartment supply deliveries typically accompanied by very high concession levels. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued our leasing strategy of leveraging concessions on stabilized communities and building occupancy. There have been encouraging indicators from a sequential perspective in that more than half of our same-property portfolio grew revenues sequentially, driven in part by increases in occupancy and decreases in concessions. We have provided year-over-year net effect rent changes for our portfolio on Page S-16 of our supplemental. New lease rates were down 8.9% in the fourth quarter, stable in January, an improvement from the negative   12.2%   achieved in the third quarter. 
Concessions on same-property approval improved from approximately $18 million in the third quarter to $13 million in the fourth quarter. This reduction in concessions is noteworthy, considering the fourth quarter has seasonally lower demand and historically, concessions increased during this period rather than decrease. Key highlights of the same-property performance of our major markets in the fourth quarter are as follows: in Seattle, 4.9% year-over-year revenue decline was primarily driven by Seattle CBD, which declined by 13%, while the remaining submarkets averaged a 3.2% decline. 
Year-over-year job growth in Seattle declined by 7.3% in the fourth quarter. In Northern California, the 10.4% year-over-year revenue decline was led by CBD, San Francisco and Oakland, averaging an 18% decline, contrasted with a 4.2% decline in Contra Costa County, while Santa Clara County performed in line with the regional average of a 10% decline. 
Year-over-year job growth in Northern California declined by 8% with San Jose far better at a 6.4% decline. In Southern California, the 7.2% year-over-year decline was primarily driven by LACBD and West L.A. submarkets, averaging a 17% decline, offset by an average decline of 2.4% in our suburban markets of Ventura, Orange County and San Diego. Fourth quarter year-over-year job growth in Southern California declined by 8%. 
Moving on to our 2021 outlook. As indicated on S-17 of the supplemental. Multifamily supply as a percentage of stock remained low at 0.9% for our portfolio. While we expect a percentage of the year-over-year growth to remain flat, new completions will once again be concentrated in the CBDs and urban submarkets where supply is projected to increase by 2.1% compared to just 0.7% across the rest of the portfolio. The confluence of minimal supply and extraordinary job losses remain a significant headwind in our urban markets. 
In Seattle, we expect multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to increase in 2021 by 1.6%, driven by 2.9% in the CBD, offset by a 1% increase in the suburbs, where we have the majority of our units. We have also seen positive office activities by major tech companies as they continue to push forward on expansion projects. 
In Seattle, Amazon received approval for a 1.1 million square foot project in Bellevue, Microsoft has continued with their campus expansion, and in                , Google acquired a 10-acre site for a large campus. In Northern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock in 2021 to decrease by 10 basis points, although Oakland and San Jose CBD are expected to increase by 1.8% and 3%, respectively. Despite the impact of COVID, tech expansion plans have continued in the area. Amazon purchased a 6-acre site near downtown San Francisco. Facebook last month submitted an updated plan for its 1.25 million square foot campus expansion in Menlo Park, and Google continued to work with the city of San Jose for its major new campus at Diridon Station. 
In addition, the biotech sector continued to to be a strong source of office demand, highlighted by the recently approved expansion of Genentech's headquarter in South San Francisco, which would add up to 4.3 million square foot of new office space. 
In Southern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to remain flat. The most notable increase is 4% L.A. CBD and deliveries in West L.A. will remain elevated once again this year. While many uncertainties remain as to legislation and the timing of the vaccine, based on current market conditions, we assume our scheduled rent for the same-property portfolio will trough in the second quarter this year. Because leases are typically 1 year in duration, our year-over-year revenue growth will be negative in the first half and positive in the second half, leading to our same-store full year guidance of 2.5% revenue decline at the midpoint. 
Lastly, our current same-store physical occupancy is 96.4%. Our availability 30 days out is 4.7%. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call to Barb Pak."
332646,701108155,2194547,"Essex Property Trust, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our fourth quarter results, followed by key assumptions in our 2021 guidance, and finally, an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. As expected, the fourth quarter was a",880,"Thank you, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our fourth quarter results, followed by key assumptions in our 2021 guidance, and finally, an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. As expected, the fourth quarter was a challenging period with core FFO declining 12.5% compared to 1 year ago. This was primarily driven by an 8% decline in same property revenues as a result of higher concessions and delinquencies. As we noted last quarter, we report concessions on a cash basis in our same-property results because we believe this is more indicative of true market conditions. However, we are required by GAAP to treat concessions on a straight-line basis in calculating consolidated revenue and FFO. 
As Angela mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we provided $5 million fewer concessions than the third quarter, which helped improve same-property revenue sequentially. However, core FFO declined by 4% or $0.13 per share compared to the third quarter, of which, $0.16 is attributable to lower straight-line rent concessions. We expect this line item to continue to be a headwind to core FFO growth in 2021, which I will discuss in a minute. Please note on Page S-8 of the supplemental, we have detailed the quarterly impact of noncash straight-line rents. 
Turning to delinquencies. We continue to take a conservative approach to reserving against uncollected rents, especially given the surge in COVID-19 cases in the fourth quarter, which resulted in extended lockdowns in our markets throughout much of the quarter. As such, we reserved against the entire net delinquency balance during this quarter. Our receivable balance currently stands at approximately $7 million, including joint ventures at pro rata share. Based on past collections, we feel this receivable balance is consistent with our ongoing conservative approach. We will continue to assess our delinquency reserve and our net receivable balance each quarter based on collection history and market conditions. 
Turning to our 2021 guidance. Key assumptions are available on Page 5 of the earnings release and S-14 of the supplemental. We've provided a wider than normal range for same-property revenues and core FFO, given the significant uncertainties that remain surrounding COVID and the recovery ahead, including vaccine distribution and eviction moratoriums that are outside our control but could swing guidance in a variety of ways. That said, we felt it was important to outline our key assumptions based on information we have today. 
For the full year, we expect core FFO per diluted share to decline by 5.1% at the midpoint. The key drivers of the decrease are primarily related to the following 2 items. First, we expect same-property revenues and NOI to decline by 2.5% and 4.6%, respectively, at the midpoint. While current operating fundamentals remain steady in our markets as compared to several months ago, we will continue to feel the negative effects of the 2020 rent declines throughout most of 2021. 
In addition, due to the eviction moratoriums and regulations that remain outside our control, we expect delinquencies will remain elevated in 2021 and will be a drag to core FFO by an estimated $0.45 per share at the midpoint. The company has a long history of excellent rent collections, and we expect this temporary delinquency headwind to become a tailwind to FFO growth once the various COVID-related restrictions are lifted. Second, we also faced significant headwinds from straight-line concessions. We expect this noncash item will result in $0.41 to $0.56 per share decline in core FFO, representing about a 4% reduction in growth on a year-over-year basis. As it relates to concessions, we expect they will remain high in the first half of the year before moderating in the second half of the year as the economic recovery takes hold. As such, we expect the impact from straight-line rent concessions to be minimal in the first half of the year, with most of the negative impact we forecasted to fall in the last 2 quarters of 2021. 
Lastly, on the capital markets activities and the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we closed $206 million of new preferred equity investments and bought back $46 million of common stock at a significant discount to NAV. These investments are being funded with 3 asset sales totaling approximately $275 million that are under contract and expected to close in the first quarter. This is consistent with our guiding principles of match funding investments on a leverage-neutral basis. 
For the year, we were able to arbitrage the difference between public and private market pricing by selling $343 million of assets at prices generally consistent with pre-COVID levels and buying back 269 million of stock at an average price of   $225   per share, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and creating value for our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong with minimal near-term funding needs and sound financial metrics. While our net debt-to-EBITDA has increased this year, this is primarily the result of the significant decline in EBITDA caused by the pandemic. 
As the economic recovery takes hold and the West Coast economies continue to reopen, we expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will improve. With ample liquidity and a well covered dividend, our balance sheet remains a source of strength. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions."

We think that there will be more work from home flexibility but at the same time, we think that employees will be tethered at some level to the office. As I think about the 3 other very capable people here today, knowing them and trusting them and all these things are a great team effort and teams are better when you really know the people and can trust the people. So I'd say that is key factor that I think, and as noted in the prepared remarks, we'll keep employees relatively close to their jobs. 
So having said that, I would think the winners in this scenario will ultimately be the high-quality cities that are near the jobs, but also offer maybe a little bit more affordable housing and good schools, low crime rates, et cetera. So I think that, that will play itself out. 
And I think those areas, we have a lot of cities that are among the major metros that qualify for that. So -- and some of them have been pretty hard hit. So I would -- I guess I would add to that, some of the cities that are high-quality cities, their rents have been highly impacted by COVID. Certainly, when I think about Northern California and the tech markets, the Peninsula, San Mateo, even suburban parts of of San Jose would be major beneficiaries of that because I -- we view that technology is going to continue to be a very strong economic driver. And the tech ecosystem in the Bay Area is incredibly unique. And therefore, we think it will do well. 
Does that answers the question?"

That will be predicated on percentages of median income, average median income, so it will provide the greatest benefit to those that are lower income levels.

So if we look at net effective rents, for the fourth quarter, sequentially, they were down under 1%. So net debt, that's all the markets. Now there's pretty significant variation between market to market. And part of that is, even though we have high occupancy overall, there are parts of our portfolio that have occupancy. For example, San Francisco is still at 92.5%. Seattle Downtown is at about the same level. And so there are areas that we're very highly occupied that are offsetting areas that are -- that don't have the same occupancy and actually below the average occupancy level. 
And most of that, as Angela alluded to, is related to the supply level. As you can imagine, if you've got negative job equivalent to right now, still as of December, equivalent to the worst part of the great financial crisis, it is not not a great time to be delivering apartment units. And therefore, and the cities are getting the bulk of the supply delivery. So you have this confluence that Angela spoke about, which is negative demand growth and supply and the cities are understandably hit from that. Offsetting that is, we do have markets that are doing very well. For example, Ventura, where rents are up almost 10% year-over-year on a market basis. And so we're doing pretty well in a lot of these suburbs. 
Now that leads to this issue that I talked about many times, which is rent-to-income. And it's interesting that Ventura with its -- I think it's more like 8.5% -- 8.5% to 10% rent increase is now about 17% above its long-term historical average of this ratio of rent-to-income, which is incredibly important to us. Whereas in Northern California were 7% below the long-term average of rent to income. So everyone looks at this like, hey, the suburbs is going to do a lot better. But when rents go up a long ways, I would question that. 
And conversely, when the rents are essentially hammered in the cities, it changes the consumer's view of where the opportunity is. And so our view is long -- a little bit longer-term that you're going to see a very significant movement back towards the areas where rents serve high-quality cities where rents are pretty affordable."

One of the things that struck us is that you guys did a really good job early on evaluating occupancy over rent. And I think that's one of the reasons that you're really starting to see some sequential growth. And you've alluded to this a little bit. But I do want to maybe drill down a little bit more on the leases that are coming due in what's historically the peak leasing season and how you think you're going to manage through that? I recognize that you said 1Q is going to be tough, 2Q is going to be challenging as well. But how do you think through that? How do you think your occupancy sets you up to manage through the leases coming due, when demand is still not going to be back to where it is?"

Well, I don't think I want to go through our playbook in detail. I would just say that we focus on maximizing revenue, and we do so by optimizing occupancy whenever possible, and we meet the market. And so given where we are, you're right on point that we did in the third quarter focused on occupancy, which allowed us the fourth quarter to pull back on concessions as we see the market stabilize. And so as we continue to see the how the market performs, we will continue to use that strategy. 
And the goal at this point is really to try to pull back on concessions whenever possible. And of course, keep in mind, that's subject to, of course, the supply, which I mentioned in the CBDs will continue to be pretty heavy. And assuming a recovery in the back half of the year. So all those come into play."

And there's a lot to that question, so I'll try to unpack it as best I can. Every recession is a little bit different. And normally, we view Southern California as our more typical of the U.S. average, and therefore, it's less volatile. In this recession, it has been incredibly volatile in a certain sector, and that is the Motion Picture sector. We didn't talk about it this time, we have on prior calls. And it's effectively shut down. And this is like the big wealth generator in Southern California. And so Southern California is probably the biggest surprise relative to prior recessions. 
For example, in the financial crisis, market rents went down in Southern California about 10% versus about 15% for the Essex portfolio in total. So this time, Southern California looks a lot like Northern California. And I think it's because of the 2 key parts of it, again, the filming and entertainment business plus all of these low jobs. When you look at the sectors of jobs that have been demolished, it's all the lower income segments of the job base, mainly it's hospitality and restaurants and other services those jobs are down. On the metros, somewhere in the 20% range, which means in the cities which are even higher concentrated, they're even more impacted. 
So as Angela said, you've got more supply coming into the cities. You also have worse job growth. Again, when we give you the averages, these are averages that more concentrated in the cities. So -- and then when you go north into the tech markets, I think that you have 2 things that are happening. You have all those service jobs in Seattle and the Bay Area. But you also have, I would say, greater work from home flexibility that is that on the margin has allowed the areas that would generally be that are suburban in nature, most of San Jose and suburban has small downtown up peninsula through Mountain View, where Facebook is located and Google right in that area. Those areas have been greater -- much greater impacted. And I think a lot of that is the work from home phenomena. 
So I think that the -- so I think the recovery looks like a couple of things because -- there's nothing fundamentally wrong with any of these businesses. The Motion Picture business is still a high demand. The technology companies, as noted in the prepared remarks, a lot of venture capital money being invested, lots of investments being made by the big tech companies into locations and buildings. And so everything, I think in terms of the broader economy looks fine, we need those companies to come back to the office to some extent. 
We also need -- there's always people that are retiring and again, selling their expensive California home going somewhere else and then backfilling comes from college graduates coming to take high-paying jobs. So I think that there's a mismatch there, I think that that are leaving the low-income can't afford to stay, they either have left or are -- stay in put given. And then -- but we haven't seen the backfill yet. And I think you're going to see the back starting in the next relatively soon, and I think that they will start to solidify it because we're 90-something percent occupied. It doesn't take that many jobs to sort of fill things up, tighten things up and then concession abating pretty quickly. So that's how we see it. Hopefully, that helps."

And again, similar to prior recessions, where everyone focuses on the very short term, which is recessions happen about every 10 years, about every 10 years, I was 50, now I am 60. I make a different decision when I'm 60 when I was 50 about where I live and how hard I want to work in various things. And so that's part of it. 
And so lots of people make changes in their life based on what they're doing and how close they are to retirement and a variety of other things. So I would say a lot of what you're seeing is just the first leg of what always happens about every 10 years and typically around a recessionary period. But in terms of inflow, outflows, it's a little bit different by market. We still -- the migration into our markets is still dominated by New York and Boston and even some other California metros. So there's quite a few people moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, maybe for better weather or whatever. 
In L.A., the outflow is really Las Vegas, Phoenix and other California cities. And in San Francisco, it's Seattle, Austin, Sacramento, and Seattle is Phoenix, Boise, Austin in terms of outflow. And again, all 3 benefiting from highly scaled workers probably in a lot of the eastern metros and from some California cities. So hopefully, that helps. That's LinkedIn data. And -- but our experience is pretty consistent with that."

But I don't think there's any winners in this current situation. So we are trying to turn the battle ship toward a better day, but it's not quite here yet. Obviously, apartments, we look ugly when it's getting better. We lag when your leases cause us to lag. And the all-time high in terms of our achieved leases will hit in Q1 and Q2, which is why the year-over-year will look so ugly.

And so say, there's one in the Bay Area, I'll just use as an example. It's in a heavily concessioned Bay Area market. And the way we're underwriting it, as you can imagine, it's kind of tough to peg cap rates given where current net effective rents are. So we're underwriting it based a couple of different ways. One is on kind of pre-COVID in place rents and then looking at current net effective today. 
On current net effective, that deal, again, this is heavily concession Bay Area market. It's in the low 3s, so call it,   3 2  , something like that. And on pre coven numbers, that's about a   3 8   or so. And so that's the spread, and that was underwritten in the fourth quarter. So concessions have varied before that and since, but that's the ballpark. 
And there still is -- there's enough of a transaction market out there where market has been set. The buyers are a little different than during your typical cycle, but there continue to be deals that go down."

The -- back in when AB3088, which again, was supplemented by this SB-91, 3088 was passed in August and required residents to pay -- COVID affected residents to pay at least 25% of their rent by January 31. And then SB-91 ruled that January 31 date to June. So the 25% is getting larger, and that -- it definitely will add pressure to that whole situation. And I'm definitely not smart enough to figure out how that's all going to play out. 
We're all hoping that this federal stimulus money, we have mostly a B type of portfolio. And so we don't have any quantification of it whatsoever, but that would certainly help a lot because that would potentially pay 80% of the unpaid rent, and we would have to walk away from the 20%, but that's a whole lot better than what we've assumed in terms of our delinquencies. 
So yes, I think we're recovered in terms of the normal to kind of probably slightly conservative case scenario. And maybe there's a little bit of upside here given SB-91. So that's how I'd answered. But you're absolutely right. I don't know -- I don't for sure know the answer to it."

I mean, I think that as I said in the opening script and the reason why I put it in there is, hey, this -- we're still at a point where the nation has lost as many jobs as it lost in the financial crisis. And in the financial crisis, our average market rents were down 15%. Seattle was a little worse, about 20%, and Southern California did a little better. 
So I think we are kind of where we are, where we would expect to be given the extraordinary number of jobs lost. Now it's not the same as the financial crisis in that you've lost these low end service jobs, and they're mostly in the city servicing at various levels, very wealthy clientele with lots of money. So it's different. But mostly the same. 
I would say, I'm not surprised about where rents have gone in general. And I hope for a robust recovery with vaccine distribution and all that stuff because it seems like a lot of this is really focused on COVID direct outcomes, losing service jobs just because of COVID because those service jobs just aren't there, they're shutdown by the government. 
So I think come back pretty quickly because I think people do want to go out to eat dinner and that type of stuff. And so I think it's going to come back, and I hope soon, obviously."

Does this impact anything? Does it not?

We take succession planning super seriously I'm really pleased that I have 3 very, very capable executives around me. And I think as I look even beyond them, we have a pretty deep bench. And you're right, I was somewhat surprised when John contacted me late third quarter, early fourth quarter, about sort of a change of plans involving him. And I asked him to reconsider. And we all need to live our lives and make decisions. And so we decided on the course, and it probably took too long to come to agreement about what his role was going to be going forward. We ended up with the press release after Christmas, it could have been much earlier, just took time to finalize what that was going to look like. So apologize for the optics of it. 
Having said that, John is always in our minds and our hearts, and he's forever a part of the company. And certainly, we wish him well. He's done a tremendous amount of good the company. So as we think about succession planning, the basic philosophy is the doors to or the pass to the CEO job are always open. And the historical path has been mostly through finance. I came through finance and then ran ops and then up. And -- but we want other paths to be open too, including maybe through operations or through investment. 
So wherever we see talented people, it's one of my primary jobs to keep those pads open and don't let them be blocked by people that are -- that don't have interest in being CEO. That's kind of the key to the whole thing. And then backing off of that down looking at the people below and making sure that they have diverse experiences in moved around the organization. And in the case of Barb, Angela, John, all of them were of rive hats on their way to up the organization. So we expect to continue to do that. And I think that's the way it has to be in order to have a proper succession process."

However, you guys have sold out of the urban areas and been more suburban. So does this make you want to switch and now sell more suburban, get back into the urban?

And we've done that for a variety of reasons, and that dates back to -- we sold Eteno and downtown L.A., sold Masso in San Francisco prior to COVID. And those pricing on those deals was significantly above what our in-place NAV was at the time. And so we felt at the time the right decision to make from an arbitrage standpoint was sell those and reinvest in either our existing portfolio, buy back stock or in other assets in suburban locations. The really heavily impacted CBD locations. Quality of life, especially, say, in downtown L.A. in Soma in San Francisco has been challenging and will likely continue to be challenging here for the foreseeable future. 
Many of the, what we consider, what we call suburbs are very densely populated suburbs, and that's where we see opportunity, and that's where we see much of the market coming back sooner rather than later. 
So like I said, we're constantly assessing where we are. And if there are opportunities in CBD, where we can buy at a good basis, and we see significant rent growth, we'll do that. But yes, I mean, like I said, we've been net sellers here, and we've sold -- all the deals that we've sold last year and then into this year have been within a 2% of our pre-COVID NAV, some above, some slightly below. So that's been the right philosophy and the right strategy, and we'll assess as we go along. Mike?"

The walk score issue is pretty interesting to me because the areas with the best rent growth have the worst walk score.

And my view is it will. And it will be nuanced, and it may not be the highest walk score gives you the best rents. But I just haven't believe having a nice location, low crime, pleasant surroundings, lots of entertainment and food options, et cetera, is going to continue to be important.

And I would say that what I see relative to that is even close. During the dot-com bubble period rent surged about 40% in 2 years. It set our all-time high in terms of rent to income level. So rents being at a very high percentage of income level. And contrast that to what I said earlier, which is rents appear very affordable. San Francisco real rents down somewhere around 20%. Well, Northern California, in general, is about 7% below our long-term average of rent to income in terms of affordability. And if I compare -- if I take a look at that number and compare it to the financial crisis, I think we got to about 90% of the long-term average. So in Northern California, we're at 93%. So starting to feel pretty affordable. Again, these are areas that support high income, high jobs, high-paying jobs, et cetera, and the rent levels are now at a point where I doubt that the tech companies are going to at and all that much at the cost of living because affordability has changed pretty dramatically overnight. 
Now I can change back. It doesn't take that many apartment -- new apartment units of demand to come in and take 96% occupancy to 97%, and then it's a whole different game. But that's the way that we look at it, we've said the band between the rental income, the band between 90% and 110% is kind of the green zone that we do well in. And in the markets that have been hardest hit, we are closer to the 90% of the long-term historical average. And again, in Ventura, we're above the 110. So it's -- it will change the choices that renters make, I believe."

So a little under 3 years of that kind of growth will be needed to get back to a level commensurate with pre-COVID. So just based on those things, Mike, how do you guys see that sort of ""recovery""?

Plenty of people will say",362,"Yes. I -- that's a great question. For example, based on the job losses in San Francisco, we should be a lot lower occupied than we really are. And so what happens during the recession is people move closer into the better areas. Plenty of people will say, ""Hey, I would live in San Francisco, but the rents are too high"". And so they live within the proximity around San Francisco and commute in. And then once this happens, they make a different choice, and they say, ""Hey, with those rents, there's a backfilling approach"". And so I would agree with you. What happens, the natural consequence of that is, and then obviously, there's another way beyond that and another way beyond that. And somewhere out there on the hinter lands and the very periphery with the Bay Area, you have areas that are not 95% occupied, that be 80% occupied because people make different choices based on pricing. 
And again, this has been one of the absolutes in my career and why we harp on this rent to income ratio is being so important. So the people -- the number of people that moved out of San Francisco versus has been backfilled, but largely by people that have moved in from, let's say, Oakland or further out and want to live in the city. And then backfill process is ongoing. So here we are at 96%, having lost all those jobs that you just mentioned. So the question is when those jobs come back, how does this how does this reverse itself? 
And some of these people will be happy to live in the city for a year and then maybe it will be priced out of the city and will be moved into one of these secondary markets. So you're absolutely right. But -- and again, we price it -- this is part of why we price things to keep occupancy high because if we keep occupancy high, we'll draw people out of the, let's say, the less desirable suburbs and you wait for demand to come back, and that is our way of maximizing revenue during the recessionary periods."

And I can't tell you how quickly, and I can't tell you how many jobs it's going to take in order for that to happen. But I can tell you that that is typically what happens that concessions as quickly as they can. They can go away just as quickly. We're going to have the overhang from the straight-line rent issue, which is a different factor. But our hope is that we get demand. Those tech companies continue to hire people bring -- they decide to live somewhere close to the major urban centers or where most of the job locations are. 
And again, it just doesn't take that much. But how long will it take to get back to where we were? I mean it's a battleship, and it's going to take a year or 2, at least to get back there, is what I would guess. I mean, the trajectory, as you pointed out, we lost a whole lot of jobs in the nation, and we've gotten some of them back, but we're still going to have a shortfall, and we're delivering some apartment units. I'd argue that the single-family component is so muted and a lot of markets have a lot more single-family as a percentage of total stock, housing stock than we do. And that is around -- I think it was like 0.3% production level will help a lot. 
And so I think -- I would guess that as the restaurants open up. We're going to see a surge of people coming back into the cities in these service jobs, and concessions are going to abate pretty quickly. That's what I think would happen. And we'll be updating as quarters go by, but it's hard to tell exactly when this is all going to happen."

But a lot of contract workers that left amid COVID and connected with both the entertainment industry and the tech industry. How many of those come back remains a question too. So I view it as when uncertainty unfolds, everyone kind of pulls in the companies become less aggressive at hiring. We saw that. We saw the drop-off of tech jobs by the top 10 employers there. And all the contract workers go home if there's a little bit of a bright spot here, the Trump administration was pretty negative on H-1B visas. That will probably open up a bit, and immigration might open up a bit here, which I think will help somewhat. But we don't try to get more granular other than to look at the supply demand ratio really represented by drop in jobs, that's probably 80% of the total picture or something like that."

So as we progress and if the economy continues to improve, and reopen, we -- that's why we talked about second quarter -- I'm sorry, second half of the year being better.

And I apologize, I know we all asked the same questions differently, but I just want to sort of understand how you guys look at this problem. 2020 wasn't a normal year for leasing. The cadence actually changed. Most of your occupancy gains happened in   Q3  . And in Q3, I thought looking at the month-to-month stuff, July was the peak year sort of occupancy burst and then a little bit sort of 50%, 50% split in August, September. You also offered more concessions in the Labor Day kind of time frame. So I guess if everything -- the concession side, vaccine aside, everything is sort of -- if you look at it from a normal lease expiration schedule perspective, things are weighted towards the Q3. How does that sort of reset the more normal kind of cadence of turnover and leasing unless you invite in shorter leases? Or I'm just inquisitive on that."

I think you're asking about the cadence of our leasing season, and if that's the case, if that is your question, we would expect that cadence itself for 2021 to be somewhat similar to prior years. And so we would expect, depending on our markets, for the most part, they kind of they start peaking, say, around June and sale peaks later, say closer to July. And that's -- during those times, we tend to have the least amount of concessions, but because our leases also more leases turned during that time, we may -- we would probably end up with slightly lower occupancy just by the way the number work. 
So that kind of gives you the trajectory in terms of our business. But the reason we're talking about when things trough and the year-over-year comparables because that does impact what happens for the whole year and that behaves differently because of COVID last year. Because second half of 2020 -- I'm sorry, first half was 2020 was much better than second half. And so you kind of have that flip in terms of year-over-year growth for first half of 2021 will be much harder and second half will be easier."

And in terms of like when we look at your macroeconomic forecast, kudos to Mr. Paul Morgan and team. I guess, it appears that Northern California has the highest job growth at 3.4%, but the lowest rent growth at minus 3.6%. So there's a lag. I assume that the lag is related to the hyper concession activity we saw in 2021 and 2020. And so you're sort of building back from there. But I'm also wondering whether you guys have any sort of factors or discounts for jobs that are created by companies domiciled in California, but have been offered the employees the flexibility to work from anywhere. So is that factor in into your kind of negative 1.9% rent growth forecast, effective rent forecast?"

So what that represents is each month, year-over-year, what the market that effective rent differential is year-over-year. So again, if you look at January of this year, the prior year rents were going up, and obviously, we've had a big decline in current rent. So you start with a large big number in January year-over-year. And then as you go through the year, those lines are going to cross because we're going to end up with a lot easier comps in the second half of the year. And so it really is the trajectory of rents year-over-year. So it's going to start with a big negative in January, and then it's going to go to a mid single-digit positive by the end of the year and averaging all that out. So January, over January, February over February, projected market rents. Average all that out to minus 1.9. So it's not intended to be because of concessions. It's really because we've had -- we start the year -- again, the prior year rents were all-time highs. Rents have rolled down a lot. So we start in a hole for the first half of this year. And then we start hitting much easier comps as we get into July, August, September. And then our year-over-year would be positive. When you average all that together, month by month, you get minus 1.9%.  Does that make sense?"

But again, our base case is that people will have greater flexibility working from home. But again, as a CEO of a company, being able to have this team dynamic, what we're trying to accomplish. There are so many pieces of this organization that all have to act in unison. You've got to know the people. And so that's what really makes us believe that this hybrid model where greater flexibility work from home, but people that are going to be in proximity, unlikely to be far, far away from the office because they're going to have to report from time to time, let's say, 2, 3 times a week. We think that, that is probably what's going to happen for a lot of workers. 
Again, and I'm excluding all the workers that have to sure, which I think was estimated at about 60%, including, for example, all of our property teams, anyone that works in a restaurant, et cetera. There was a lot of jobs. There's no work from home flexibility. There is no such thing. And I think that the -- as you read a lot of these reports and news clippings on this subject, they kind of forget about those people. 
And so I think it's going to -- again, we will have more work from home flexibility. And so baby, the city centers are a little bit less desirable. Even though that's where the great restaurants are going to continue to be, and that's where the tourism is going and all other things.

As we reported last night, our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in lower same-property revenue and core FFO per share for both the quarter and the full year. Similar to the last few quarters, pandemic-related regulations have had 2 primary consequences. First, shelter-in-placement and related orders have resulted in unprecedented job losses; and second, anti-eviction and related laws prevent us from maximizing property performance.
Government mandates are constantly changing and they intensified during the fourth quarter given surging COVID-19 cases. Navigating the pandemic involves extraordinary efforts, and I thank the Essex team for their tireless dedication amid these challenges.
Overall, our fourth quarter results reflect stability in sequential net effective rents beginning in October and as discussed during our third quarter earnings call. Sequential revenues improved 30 basis points in the quarter, with market rents mostly flat in the cities and modestly positive in suburban locations. Therefore, we are cautiously optimistic that we have or will soon reach the bottom in market rent declines.  
As of December 2020, preliminary 3-month trailing job losses in the Essex markets were 7.9% year-over-year, a 150 basis point improvement compared to minus 9.4% for September 2020 and outperforming the nation, which had a 100 basis point improvement from September to December. Even with the recovery of jobs in Q3 and Q4, the nation had 9.2 million fewer jobs year-over-year for the month of December, roughly equal to the number of jobs lost at the worst point of the financial crisis.
Our data and analytics team prepared S-17 to the supplemental, which is our base case scenario underlying our expectation that net effective rents will decline 1.9% in 2021. The range of potential outcomes is extraordinarily wide for 2021, given many unknowns that relate to the pandemic, including the pace of vaccine deployment and changes in regulation.
Our modeling further assumes 4% GDP growth, which should lead to positive momentum in the second half of 2021. Apartment supply will continue to be a challenge, especially in the downtown locations of Los Angeles and Seattle. Our data and analytics team expects approximately 34,000 apartment deliveries in 2021, a modest increase compared to last year.
Also similar to 2020, we don't expect much for-sale housing production going forward. It's our experience that affordable for-sale housing competes directly with rentals, once rents rise to a level that approximates the monthly payment of an entry-level for-sale home, and there is little risk of that occurring in the Essex markets anytime soon.
Page S-17.1 of the supplemental highlights 13 recent multibillion-dollar tech initial public offerings for companies headquartered in the Essex markets. Overall, 2020 was a great year for IPOs, with 147 tech sector offerings completed during the year. It's our view that the IPO market is essential to recharge the tech ecosystem, providing growth capital to early-stage investors and to generate liquidity for reinvestment.
Page S-17.1 also illustrates the reacceleration in job openings for the top 10 tech companies, which has increased 38% since the August trough. Our analysis indicates that nearly 60% of the total job postings are located in California or Washington, with the next largest state, Texas, accounting for just 7%.
The Page S-17.2 of the supplemental package demonstrates that venture capital investments continued on a record pace in 2020 with approximately $130 billion invested in the U.S. with the Essex markets continuing to receive the dominant share of VC investment. Success in the knowledge-based economy requires a critical mass of highly skilled workers, creating a network effect that draws companies to the Bay Area and Seattle. While only a limited number of venture-backed companies will go public, some will experience extraordinarily -- extraordinary growth similar to Snowflake, DoorDash, Airbnb, and resulting in thousands of high-paying jobs.
The environment today has many similarities to the previous recessionary periods, including the financial crisis and the bursting of the dot-com bubble. In both cases, migration out of California was often front page news. In 2020, we experienced higher out migration than normal, especially in our West Coast urban centers. In our experience, people make different housing choices during recessions and it's not surprising to see many in the large baby boomer cohort monetize the value of an expensive California home to move to less expensive areas as part of a retirement plan.
This recession is unique with respect to the extraordinary loss of jobs that involve lower paid service workers, jobs that are concentrated in the city centers and effective employees often had only 2 choices: move immediately to find work or stay in their home shielded by eviction forbearance laws. As with previous recessions, we expect most of these trends to reverse. We expect that the demand for restaurants, services and travel will recover swiftly as vaccines are administered, bringing back related service jobs. 
Workers in the Essex markets earn more than in most parts of the country and the draw of higher-paying jobs, combined with lower recent rent levels makes rental housing down the West Coast, the most affordable it has been since 2013.
Our recent McKinsey study estimates that only 22% of the American workforce can work from home without any productivity loss. We have been tracking many companies that have adopted work-from-home models during the pandemic, and we remain confident that the vast majority of companies will ask employees to return to the office when it is safe to do so, likely with increased work from home flexibility going forward. Google, Netflix and Apple are among the largest companies who have expressed their desire to return to the office, many others will follow.
Turning to the regulatory environment, a third wave of COVID-19 cases beginning in November and related concerns about hospital availability led to the imposition of severe stay-at-home orders in all of our California markets. Some of these restrictions were eased last week, but all of the Essex markets remain in California's most restrictive category.
Recently, with the passage of SB 91 last week, the state of California has extended COVID-19-related eviction protection from January 31 to June 30, 2021, including pushing back the requirement to pay at least 25% of pandemic-related rent. In addition, the law established a state rental assistance program to allocate $2.6 billion in Federal Stimulus Funds using income levels to prioritize payments and accepting related applications in March. As with similar laws, there are many related requirements and complexities, which we are evaluating.
Turning to the apartment investment markets. During 2020, we sold 4 properties with a total of 670 apartment homes for $343 million, all of which were placed under contract subsequent to the implementation of shelter-in-place orders in March. Given the wide discount in valuation for public REITs compared to the private real estate markets, property sales remain our preferred source of funds for investment.
Since the onset of the pandemic, a relatively small number of apartment sales support our belief that property values have not changed materially since the onset of the pandemic. However, extraordinary changes in rent increasing in the case of both suburban markets and decreasing sharply in some urban locations, makes it difficult to draw conclusions about cap rates.
In the suburbs, where rents are generally at or above pre-pandemic levels, property values have modestly increased and cap rates are somewhat lower compared to the pre-pandemic period. Given lower rents and significant concessions in hard hit cities, recent price talk around possible sales indicate about a 5% reduction in value versus the pre-COVID period, resulting in cap rates for high-quality properties below 4%.
As with previous recessions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to provide very attractive financing with 7-year fixed rate financing in the mid-2% range, potentially supporting lower cap rates. Vaccine distribution should remove uncertainty with respect to apartment operations and property values. As a result, we believe transaction volumes will begin to accelerate. As we've indicated before, improved cash flow from positive leverage in apartments has historically led to a robust transaction market.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela."

First, I would like to express my appreciation to the Essex operations team for their diligent efforts to serve our customers amidst a challenging environment caused by the COVID pandemic. Thank you for all your hard work.
As for my comments, I will begin by discussing our 2020 results, followed by our outlook for 2021. Overall, our market performed as we expected, despite the headwinds of new COVID-related closures and seasonal decline in demand. Currently, the urban core, particularly in tech-centric markets, continue to remain more impacted by COVID-19-related job losses and office closures. 
In addition, the change in quality of life, resulting from the closures of restaurants and public amenities has driven a temporary shift in consumer preferences. High-rise buildings or communities located in areas with high Walk Scores have been the most impacted by this shift in demand. Conversely, communities with private outdoor space or more affordable residences outside the urban core continue to experience greater demand, which benefited many of our properties in Ventura, San Diego, Orange County and the East Bay in Northern California. 
This temporary shift in demand continued in the fourth quarter, where we experienced a 7.6% and 9.9% year-over-year increase in quarterly turnover in CBD, Seattle and San Francisco, compared to the portfolio average turnover of only 1.3%. Furthermore, our CBD locations also had a greater concentration of apartment supply deliveries typically accompanied by very high concession levels. During the fourth quarter, we continued our leasing strategy of leveraging concessions on stabilized communities and building occupancy. 
There have been encouraging indicators from a sequential perspective in that more than half of our same-property portfolio grew revenues sequentially, driven in part by increases in occupancy and decreases in concessions. We have provided year-over-year net effect rent changes for our portfolio on Page S-16 of our supplemental. New lease rates were down 8.9% in the fourth quarter, stable in January, an improvement from the negative [ 2.2% ] achieved in the third quarter.
Concessions on same-property approval improved from approximately $18 million in the third quarter to $13 million in the fourth quarter. This reduction in concessions is noteworthy, considering the fourth quarter has seasonally lower demand and historically, concessions increased during this period rather than decrease. Key highlights of the same-property performance of our major markets in the fourth quarter are as follows: in Seattle, 4.9% year-over-year revenue decline was primarily driven by Seattle CBD, which declined by 13%, while the remaining submarkets averaged a 3.2% decline. Year-over-year job growth in Seattle declined by 7.3% in the fourth quarter. 
In Northern California, the 10.4% year-over-year revenue decline was led by CBD, San Francisco and Oakland, averaging an 18% decline, contrasted with a 4.2% decline in Contra Costa County, while Santa Clara County performed in line with the regional average of a 10% decline. Year-over-year job growth in Northern California declined by, 8% with San Jose still better at a 6.4% decline. 
In Southern California, the 7.2% year-over-year decline was primarily driven by L.A. CBD and West L.A. submarkets, averaging a 17% decline, offset by an average decline of 2.4% in our suburban markets of Ventura, Orange County and San Diego. Fourth quarter year-over-year job growth in Southern California declined by 8%.
Moving on to our 2021 outlook. As indicated on S-17 of the supplemental, multifamily supply as a percentage of stock remained low at 0.9% for our portfolio. While we expect a percentage of the year-over-year growth to remain flat, new completions will once again be concentrated in the CBDs and urban submarkets where supply is projected to increase by 2.1% compared to just 0.7% across the rest of the portfolio. The confluence of minimal supply and extraordinary job losses remain a significant headwind in our urban markets.
In Seattle, we expect multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to increase in 2021 by 1.6%, driven by 2.9% in the CBD, offset by a 1% increase in the suburbs, where we have the majority of our units. We have also seen positive office activities by major tech companies as they continue to push forward on expansion projects.
In Seattle, Amazon received approval for a 1.1 million square foot project. In Bellevue, Microsoft has continued with their campus expansion. And in Kirkland, Google acquired a 10-acre site for a large campus. In Northern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock in 2021 to decrease by 10 basis points, although Oakland and San Jose CBD are expected to increase by 1.8% and 3%, respectively. 
Despite the impact of COVID, tech expansion plans have continued in the Bay Area. Amazon purchased a 6-acre site near downtown San Francisco. Facebook, last month, submitted an updated plan for its 1.25 million square foot campus expansion in Menlo Park, and Google continued to work with the city of San Jose for its major new campus at Diridon Station.
In addition, the biotech sector continued to be a strong source of office demand, highlighted by the recently approved expansion of Genentech's headquarter in South San Francisco, which would add up to 4.3 million square foot of new office space.
In Southern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to remain flat. The most notable increase is 4% L.A. CBD and deliveries in West L.A. will remain elevated once again this year.
While many uncertainties remain as to legislation and the timing of the vaccine, based on current market conditions, we assume our scheduled rent for the same-property portfolio will trough in the second quarter of this year. Because leases are typically 1 year in duration, our year-over-year revenue growth will be negative in the first half and positive in the second half, leading to our same-store full year guidance of 2.5% revenue decline at the midpoint.
Lastly, our current same-store physical occupancy is 96.4%. Our availability 30 day out is 4.7%.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call to Barb Pak."
332646,701108155,2195028,"Essex Property Trust, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our fourth quarter results, followed by key assumptions in our 2021 guidance, and finally, an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. As expected, the fourth quarter was a",876,"Thank you, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our fourth quarter results, followed by key assumptions in our 2021 guidance, and finally, an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. As expected, the fourth quarter was a challenging period with core FFO declining 12.5% compared to 1 year ago. This was primarily driven by an 8% decline in same-property revenues as a result of higher concessions and delinquencies. As we noted last quarter, we report concessions on a cash basis in our same-property results because we believe this is more indicative of true market conditions. However, we are required by GAAP to treat concessions on a straight-line basis in calculating consolidated revenue and FFO.
As Angela mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we provided $5 million fewer concessions than the third quarter, which helped improve same-property revenue sequentially. However, core FFO declined by 4% or $0.13 per share compared to the third quarter, of which, $0.16 is attributable to lower straight-line rent concessions. We expect this line item to continue to be a headwind to core FFO growth in 2021, which I will discuss in a minute.  
Please note on Page S-8 of the supplemental, we have detailed the quarterly impact of noncash straight-line rents.
Turning to delinquencies. We continue to take a conservative approach to reserving against uncollected rents, especially given the surge in COVID-19 cases in the fourth quarter, which resulted in extended lockdowns in our markets throughout much of the quarter. As such, we reserved against the entire net delinquency balance during this quarter. Our receivable balance currently stands at approximately $7 million, including joint ventures at pro rata share. Based on past collections, we feel this receivable balance is consistent with our ongoing conservative approach. We will continue to assess our delinquency reserve and our net receivable balance each quarter based on collection history and market conditions.
Turning to our 2021 guidance. Key assumptions are available on Page 5 of the earnings release and S-14 of the supplemental. We've provided a wider-than-normal range for same-property revenues and core FFO, given the significant uncertainties that remain surrounding COVID and the recovery ahead, including vaccine distribution and eviction moratoriums that are outside our control but could swing guidance in a variety of ways. That said, we felt it was important to outline our key assumptions based on information we have today.
For the full year, we expect core FFO per diluted share to decline by 5.1% at the midpoint. The key drivers of the decrease are primarily related to the following 2 items. First, we expect same-property revenues and NOI to decline by 2.5% and 4.6%, respectively, at the midpoint. While current operating fundamentals remain steady in our markets as compared to several months ago, we will continue to feel the negative effects of the 2020 rent declines throughout most of 2021.
In addition, due to the eviction moratoriums and regulations that remain outside our control, we expect delinquencies will remain elevated in 2021 and will be a drag to core FFO by an estimated $0.45 per share at the midpoint. The company has a long history of excellent rent collections, and we expect this temporary delinquency headwind to become a tailwind to FFO growth once the various COVID-related restrictions are lifted. 
Second, we also faced significant headwinds from straight-line concessions. We expect this noncash item will result in $0.41 to $0.56 per share decline in core FFO, representing about a 4% reduction in growth on a year-over-year basis. As it relates to concessions, we expect they will remain high in the first half of the year before moderating in the second half of the year as the economic recovery takes hold. As such, we expect the impact from straight-line rent concessions to be minimal in the first half of the year, with most of the negative impact we forecasted to fall in the last 2 quarters of 2021.
Lastly, on the capital markets activities and the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we closed $206 million of new preferred equity investments and bought back $46 million of common stock at a significant discount to NAV. These investments are being funded with 3 asset sales totaling approximately $275 million that are under contract and expected to close in the first quarter. This is consistent with our guiding principles of match funding investments on a leverage-neutral basis.
For the year, we were able to arbitrage the difference between public and private market pricing by selling $343 million of assets at prices generally consistent with pre-COVID levels and buying back $269 million of stock at an average price of $225 per share, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and creating value for our shareholders. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with minimal near-term funding needs and sound financial metrics. While our net debt-to-EBITDA has increased this year, this is primarily the result of the significant decline in EBITDA caused by the pandemic.
As the economic recovery takes hold and the West Coast economies continue to reopen, we expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will improve. With ample liquidity and a well-covered dividend, our balance sheet remains a source of strength.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions."

We think that there will be more work from home flexibility but at the same time, we think that employees will be tethered at some level to the office. As I think about the 3 other very capable people here today, knowing them and trusting them and all these things are a great team effort and teams are better when you really know the people and can trust the people. So I'd say that is key factor that I think, and as noted in the prepared remarks, we'll keep employees relatively close to their jobs.
So having said that, I would think the winners in this scenario will ultimately be the high-quality cities that are near the jobs, but also offer maybe a little bit more affordable housing and good schools, low crime rates, et cetera. So I think that, that will play itself out.
And I think those areas, we have a lot of cities that are among the major metros that qualify for that. So -- and some of them have been pretty hard hit. So I would -- I guess I would add to that, some of the cities that are high-quality cities, their rents have been highly impacted by COVID. Certainly, when I think about Northern California and the tech markets, the Peninsula, San Mateo, even suburban parts of San Jose would be major beneficiaries of that because I -- we view that technology is going to continue to be a very strong economic driver. And the tech ecosystem in the Bay Area is incredibly unique. And therefore, we think it will do well.
That answered the question?"

And the way it would work is the landlord would be required to forgive 20%. And so the reimbursement from these programs could be 80%. That will be predicated on percentages of median income, average median income. So it will provide the greatest benefit to those that are at lower income levels. And it's hard to tell exactly what that means. We just haven't had enough time to evaluate that program. So I'm guessing that we will have a pretty significant positive impact from it.

So if we look at net effective rents, for the fourth quarter, sequentially, they were down under 1%. So net debt, that's all the markets. Now there's pretty significant variation between market to market. And part of that is, even though we have high occupancy overall, there are parts of our portfolio that have lower occupancy. For example, San Francisco is still at 92.5%. Seattle Downtown is at about the same level. And so there are areas that we're very highly occupied that are offsetting areas that are -- that don't have the same occupancy and actually below the average occupancy level.
And most of that, as Angela alluded to, is related to the supply level. As you can imagine, if you've got negative job equivalent to -- right now, still as of December, equivalent to the worst part of the great financial crisis, it is not a great time to be delivering apartment units. And therefore -- and the cities are getting the bulk of the supply delivery. So you have this confluence that Angela spoke about, which is negative demand growth and supply and the cities are understandably hit from that. Offsetting that is, we do have markets that are doing very well. For example, Ventura, where rents are up almost 10% year-over-year on a market basis. And so we're doing pretty well in a lot of these suburbs.
Now that leads to this issue that I talked about many times, which is rent-to-income. And it's interesting that Ventura with its -- I think it's more like 8.5% to 10% rent increase is now about 17% above its long-term historical average of this ratio of rent-to-income, which is incredibly important to us. Whereas in Northern California were 7% below the long-term average of rent to income. So everyone looks at this like, hey, the suburbs is going to do a lot better. But when rents go up a long ways, I would question that. 
And conversely, when the rents are essentially hammered in the cities, it changes the consumer's view of where the opportunity is. And so our view is long -- a little bit longer-term that you're going to see a very significant movement back towards the areas where rents are -- high-quality cities where rents are pretty affordable."

Well, I don't think I want to go through our playbook in detail. I would just say that we focus on maximizing revenue, and we do so by optimizing occupancy whenever possible, and we meet the market. And so given where we are, you're right on point that we did in the third quarter focus on occupancy, which allowed us in the fourth quarter to pull back on concessions as we see the market stabilize. And so as we continue to see the -- how the market performs, we will continue to use that strategy.
And the goal at this point is really to try to pull back on concessions whenever possible. And of course, keep in mind that, that's subject to, of course, the supply, which I mentioned. And the CBDs will continue to be pretty heavy. And assuming a recovery in the back half of the year, so all those come into play."

One of the things that, believe it or not, I think, is misunderstood about your portfolio, is your Class A/B mix in urban versus suburban. I'm not sure that's always appreciated by the investor base. So when you think about job growth, can you maybe break down those job growth views relative to white collar, high class, high-paying jobs in urban markets versus maybe the type of renters that would rent Class B in the suburban markets?"

And there's a lot to that question, so I'll try to unpack it as best I can. Every recession is a little bit different. And normally, we view Southern California as our more typical of the U.S. average, and therefore, it's less volatile. In this recession, it has been incredibly volatile in a certain sector, and that is the Motion Picture sector. We didn't talk about it this time, we have on prior calls. And it's effectively shut down. And this is like the big wealth generator in Southern California. And so Southern California is probably the biggest surprise relative to prior recessions.
For example, in the financial crisis, market rents went down in Southern California about 10% versus about 15% for the Essex portfolio in total. So this time, Southern California looks a lot like Northern California. And I think it's because of the 2 key parts of it, again, the filming and entertainment business plus all of these low jobs. When you look at the sectors of jobs that have been demolished, it's all the lower income segments of the job base, mainly it's hospitality and restaurants and other services those jobs are down. On the metros, somewhere in the 20% range, which means in the cities which are even higher concentrated, they're even more impacted.
So as Angela said, you've got more supply coming into the cities. You also have worse job growth. Again -- but we give you the averages, these are averages that more concentrated in the cities. So -- and then when you go north into the tech markets, I think that you have 2 things that are happening. You have all those service jobs in Seattle and the Bay Area. But you also have, I would say, greater work from home flexibility that is that on the margin has allowed the areas that would generally be -- that are suburban in nature, most of San Jose is suburban, it has small downtown up Peninsula through Mountain View, where Facebook is located and Google, right in that area. Those areas have been greater -- much greater impacted. And I think a lot of that is the work-from-home phenomena.
So I think that the -- so I think the recovery looks like a couple of things because -- there's nothing fundamentally wrong with any of these businesses. The Motion Picture business is still a high demand. The technology companies, as noted in the prepared remarks, a lot of venture capital money being invested, lots of investments being made by the big tech companies into locations and buildings. And so everything, we feel, I think, in terms of the broader economy looks fine, we need those companies to come back to the office to some extent.
We also need -- there's always people that are retiring and again, selling their expensive California home, going somewhere else and then backfilling comes from college graduates coming to take high-paying jobs. So I think that there's a mismatch there, I think that the people that are leaving have left. The low-income can't afford to stay, they either have left or are staying put, given anti-eviction laws. And then -- but we haven't seen the backfill yet. And I think you're going to see the back starting in the next relatively soon, and I think that they will start to solidify it because we're 90-something percent occupied. It doesn't take that many jobs to sort of fill things up, tighten things up and then concessions start abating pretty quickly. So that's how we see it. Hopefully, that helps."

And again, similar to prior recessions, where everyone focuses on the very short term, which is -- recessions happen about every 10 years, about every 10 years, I was 50, now I am 60. I make a different decision when I'm 60 than when I was 50 about where I live and how hard I want to work and various things. And so that's part of it.
And so lots of people make changes in their life based on what they're doing and how close they are to retirement and a variety of other things. So I would say a lot of what you're seeing is just the first leg of what always happens, about every 10 years and typically around a recessionary period. But in terms of inflow, outflows, it's a little bit different by market. We still -- the migration into our markets is still dominated by New York and Boston and even some other California metros. So there's quite a few people moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, maybe for better weather or whatever.
In L.A., the outflow is really Las Vegas, Phoenix and other California cities. And in San Francisco, it's Seattle, Austin, Sacramento. And Seattle is Phoenix, Boise, Austin in terms of outflow. And again, all 3 benefiting from highly skilled workers probably in a lot of the eastern metros and from some California cities. 
So hopefully, that helps. That's LinkedIn data. And -- but our experience is pretty consistent with that."

But I don't think there's any winners in this current situation. So we are trying to turn the battle ship toward a better day, but it's not quite here yet.

And so say, there's one in the Bay Area, I'll just use as an example. It's in a heavily concessioned Bay Area market. And the way we're underwriting it, as you can imagine, it's kind of tough to peg cap rates given where current net effective rents are. So we're underwriting it based a couple of different ways. One is on kind of pre-COVID in-place rents and then looking at current net effective today.
On current net effective, that deal, again, this is heavily concession Bay Area market. It's in the low 3s, so call it, 3.2, or something like that. And on pre-COVID numbers, that's about a 3.8 or so. And so that's the spread net, and that was underwritten in the fourth quarter. So  concessions have varied before that and since, but that's the ballpark.
And there still is -- there's enough of a transaction market out there where market has been set. The buyers are a little different than during your typical cycle, but there continue to be deals that go down."

The -- back in -- when AB-3088, which again, was supplemented by this SB-91, 3088 was passed in August and required residents to pay -- COVID-affected residents to pay at least 25% of their rent by January 31. And then SB-91 ruled that January 31 date to June. So the 25% is getting larger, and it definitely will add pressure to that whole situation. And definitely I'm not smart enough to figure out how that's all going to play out.
We're all hoping that this federal stimulus money -- we have mostly a B type of portfolio. And so we don't have any quantification of it whatsoever, but that would certainly help a lot because that would potentially pay 80% of the unpaid rent, and we would have to walk away from the 20%, but that's a whole lot better than what we've assumed in terms of our delinquencies.
So yes, I think that we're recovered in terms of the normal to kind of probably slightly conservative case scenario. And maybe there's a little bit upside here given SB-91. So that's how I'd answer. But you're absolutely right. I don't know -- I don't for sure know the answer to it."

But perhaps maybe it's that very characteristic of your portfolio, again, sort of B quality, not necessarily downtown locations that gives you the feeling to say something like cautious optimism?

But I wouldn't say that. I mean, I think that as I said in the opening script and the reason why I put it in there is, hey, this -- we're still at a point where the nation has lost as many jobs as it lost in the financial crisis. And in the financial crisis, our average market rents were down 15%. Seattle was a little worse, about 20%, and Southern California did a little better.
So I think we are kind of where we are or where we would expect to be given the extraordinary number of jobs lost. Now it's not the same as the financial crisis in that you've lost these low end service jobs, and they're mostly in the city servicing at various levels, very wealthy clientele with lots of money. So it's different, but mostly the same.
I would say, I'm not surprised about where rents have gone in general. And I hope for a robust recovery with vaccine distribution and all that stuff because it seems like a lot of this is really focused on COVID direct outcomes, losing service jobs just because of COVID because those service jobs just aren't there, they're shutdown by the government.
So I think we'll be able to come back pretty quickly because I think people do want to go out to eat dinner and that type of stuff. And so I think it's going to come back, and I hope soon, obviously."

And we'll reassess in Q1 and see where things are at as that goes.
And then the $0.45 that I alluded to in my script, that's really compared to our historical run rate. So for the foreseeable future, we do expect delinquency to remain elevated. This eviction protection moratorium, SB-91 goes until June. And then we don't know what's going to happen after that. 
So we have assumed that we don't make a lot of progress on the delinquency. It's not because we can't collect, it's a combination of both, people not paying and collections kind of are getting us to that mid-2% range of scheduled rent."

I'm really pleased that I have 3 very, very capable executives around me. And I think as I look even beyond them, we have a pretty deep bench. And you're right, I was somewhat surprised when John contacted me late third quarter, early fourth quarter, about sort of a change of plans involving him. And I asked him to reconsider. And we all need to live our lives and make decisions. And so we decided on the course, and it probably took too long to come to agreement about what his role was going to be going forward. We ended up with the press release after Christmas, it could have been much earlier, just took time to finalize what that was going to look like. So apologize for the optics of it.
Having said that, John is always in our minds, in our hearts, and he's forever a part of the company. And certainly, we wish him well. He's done a tremendous amount of good for the company. So as we think about succession planning, the basic philosophy is the doors to or the pass to the CEO job are always open. And the historical path has been mostly through finance. I came through finance and then ran ops and then up. And -- but we want other paths to be open too, including maybe through operations or through investments.
So wherever we see talented people, it's one of my primary jobs to keep those pass open and don't let them be blocked by people that are -- that don't have interest in being CEO. That's kind of the key to the whole thing. And then backing off of that down looking at the people below and making sure that they have diverse experiences and have moved around the organization. And in the case of Barb, Angela, John, all of them wore [indiscernible] hats on their way to -- up the organization. So we expect to continue to do that. And I think that's the way it has to be in order to have a proper succession process."

And Mike, you mentioned something interesting that in the suburbs, the rent affordability index was at perhaps an all-time high or definitely elevated, whereas the urban areas are below the average, more affordable. However, you guys have sold out of the urban areas and been more suburban. 
So does this make you want to switch and now sell more suburban, get back into the urban? Or are there other dynamics at work where with this pricing affordability imbalance, you wouldn't do what maybe you would have historically done prior to the pandemic?"

We're always -- we're looking at all of our markets at all times. And so during this recent -- kind of recent -- during COVID period, we've been primarily sellers. And most of those we sold in the CBDs. And we've done that for a variety of reasons, and that dates back to -- we sold 8th & Hope in Downtown, L.A., sold Masso in San Francisco prior to COVID. And those -- pricing on those deals was significantly above what our in-place NAV was at the time. 
And so we felt at the time the right decision to make from an arbitrage standpoint was sell those and reinvest in either our existing portfolio, buy back stock or in other assets in suburban locations. The really heavily impacted CBD locations. Quality of life, especially, say, in Downtown, L.A., in SoMa, in San Francisco has been challenging and will likely continue to be challenging here for the foreseeable future.
Many of the, what we consider or what we call, suburbs are very densely populated suburbs, and that's where we see opportunity, and that's where we see much of the market coming back sooner rather than later. So like I said, we're constantly assessing where we are. And if there are opportunities in CBD, where we can buy at a good basis, and we see significant rent growth, we'll do that. 
But yes, I mean, like I said, we've been net sellers here, and we've sold -- all the deals that we've sold last year and then into this year have been within  2% of our pre-COVID NAV, some above, some slightly below. So that's been the right philosophy and the right strategy, and we'll assess as we go on. Mike?"

And my view is, it will. And it will be nuanced, and it may not be the highest Walk Score gives you the best rents. But I just have a belief that having a nice location, low crime, pleasant surroundings, lots of entertainment and food options, et cetera, is going to continue to be important.

And I would say that what I see relative to that is even close. During the dot-com bubble period rent surged about 40% in 2 years. It set our all-time high in terms of rent to income level. So rents being at a very high percentage of income level. And contrast that to what I said earlier, which is rents appear very affordable. San Francisco real rents down somewhere around 20%. 
Well, Northern California, in general, is about 7% below our long-term average of rent to income in terms of affordability. And if I compare -- if I take a look at that number and compare it to the financial crisis, I think we got to about 90% of the long-term average. So in Northern California, we're at 93%. So it's starting to feel pretty affordable. 
Again, these are areas that support high income, high jobs, high-paying jobs, et cetera, and the rent levels are now at a point where I doubt that the tech companies are going bat an eye all that much at the cost of living because affordability has changed pretty dramatically overnight. Now I can change back. It doesn't take that many apartment -- new apartment units of demand to come in and take 96% occupancy to 97%, and then it's a whole different game. 
But that's the way that we look at it. We've said, the band between the rental income, the band between 90% and 110% is kind of the green zone that we do well in. And in the markets that have been hardest hit, we are closer to the 90% of the long-term historical average. And again, in Ventura, we're above the 110%. So it's -- it will change the choices that renters make, I believe."

I ask because you look at your main Essex markets, about 1.1 million jobs have been lost in 2020. And you're assuming like 3.4% or around 400,000 jobs. So a little under 3 years of that kind of growth will be needed to get back to a level commensurate with pre-COVID. 
So just based on those things, Mike, how do you guys see that sort of ""recovery""? I understand the comps in the second half of this year are going to be very easy. But after that, what do you guys kind of think about when it were at, again, like pre-COVID type pricing?"

Plenty of people will say, ""he",361,"Yes. That's a great question. For example, based on the job losses in San Francisco, we should be a lot lower occupied than we really are. And so what happens during the recession is people move closer into the better areas. Plenty of people will say, ""hey, I would live in San Francisco, but the rents are too high"". And so they live within the proximity around San Francisco and commute in. And then once this happens, they make a different choice, and they say, ""hey, with those rents, there's a backfilling approach"". 
And so I would agree with you. What happens, the natural consequence of that is, and then obviously, there's another way beyond that and another way beyond that. And somewhere out there on the hinterlands and the very periphery with the Bay Area, you have areas that are not 95% occupied, they might be 80% occupied because people make different choices based on pricing. And again, this has been one of the absolutes in my career and why we harp on this rent-to-income ratio as being so important. 
So the people -- the number of people that moved out of San Francisco versus -- it has been backfilled, but largely by people that have moved in from, let's say, Oakland or further out and want to live in the city. And then this backfilling process is ongoing. So here we are at 96%, having lost all those jobs that you just mentioned. And so the question is when those jobs come back, how does this how does this reverse itself?
And some of these people will be happy to live in the city for a year and then maybe it will be priced out of the city and will be moved into one of these secondary markets. So you're absolutely right. But -- and again, we price it -- this is part of why we price things to keep occupancy high because if we keep occupancy high, we'll draw people out of the, let's say, the less desirable suburbs and wait for demand to come back, and that is our way of maximizing revenue during the recessionary periods."

And I can't tell you how quickly, and I can't tell you how many jobs it's going to take in order for that to happen. But I can tell you that, that is typically what happens that concessions as quickly as they came, they can go away just as quickly. We're going to have the overhang from the straight-line rent issue, which is a different factor. But our hope is that we get enough demand. Those tech companies continue to hire people, bring -- they decide to live somewhere close to the major urban centers or where most of the job locations are.
And again, it just doesn't take that much. But how long will it take to get back to where we were? I mean it's a battleship, and it's going to take a year or 2, at least to get back there, it is what I would guess. I mean, the trajectory, as you pointed out, we lost a whole lot of jobs in the nation, and we've gotten some of them back, but we're still going to have a shortfall, and we're delivering some apartment units. 
I'd argue that the single-family component is so muted and a lot of markets have a lot more single-family as a percentage of total stock, housing stock than we do. And that is around -- I think it was like 0.3% production level will help a lot.
And so I think -- I would guess that as the restaurants open up. We're going to see a surge of people coming back into the cities in these service jobs, and concessions are going to abate pretty quickly. That's what I think would happen. And we'll be updating as quarters go by, but it's hard to tell exactly when this is all going to happen."

But a lot of contract workers that left amid COVID and connected with both the entertainment industry and the tech industry. How many of those come back remains a question too. So I view it as when uncertainty unfolds, everyone kind of pulls in, companies become less aggressive at hiring. We saw that. We saw the drop-off of tech jobs by the top 10 employers there. And all the contract workers go home. If there's a little bit of a bright spot here, the Trump administration was pretty negative on H-1B visas. That will probably open up a bit, and immigration might open up a bit here, which I think will help somewhat. 
But we don't try to get more granular other than to look at the supply-demand ratio really represented by drop in jobs, that's probably 80% of the total picture or something like that."

And so there's a couple of different factors, which may be a little confusing. 
So as far as pricing is concerned, we currently do see -- what we reported in January to hold. Keep in mind, this is also towards a lower peaking season. So as we progress and if the economy continues to improve, and reopen, we -- that's why we talked about second quarter -- I'm sorry, second half of the year being better. But it's hard to talk about it kind of month-to-month. I think right now, we're in good position because we had employed the strategy of higher occupancy and which allows us to reduce our concession.

I think you're asking about the cadence of our leasing season, and if that's the case, if that is your question, we would expect that cadence itself for 2021 to be somewhat similar to prior years. And so we would expect, depending on our markets, but for the most part, that they kind of they start peaking, say, around June and [ sale ] peaks later, say closer to July. And that's -- during those times, we tend to have the least amount of concessions, but because our leases -- also more leases turn during that time, we may -- we would probably end up with slightly lower occupancy just by the way the number work.
So that kind of gives you the trajectory in terms of our business. But the reason we're talking about when things trough and the year-over-year comparables because that does impact what happens for the whole year and that behaves differently because of COVID last year. Because second half of 2020 -- I'm sorry, first half was 2020 was much better than second half. And so you kind of have that flip in terms of year-over-year growth were -- first half of 2021 will be much harder and second half will be easier."

And in terms of like when we look at your macroeconomic forecast, kudos to Mr. Paul Morgan and team, I guess. It appears that Northern California has the highest job growth at 3.4%, but the lowest rent growth at minus 3.6%. So there's a lag. I assume that the lag is related to the hyper-concession activity we saw in 2021 and 2020. And so we're sort of building back from there. 
But I'm also wondering whether you guys have any sort of factors or discounts for jobs that are created by companies domiciled in California, but have been -- offered the employees the flexibility to work from anywhere. So is that factoring into your kind of negative 1.9% rent growth forecast, effective rent growth forecast?"

So what that represents is each month, year-over-year, what the market -- or that effective rent differential is year-over-year. So again, if you look at January of this year, the prior year rents were going up, and obviously, we've had a big decline in current rent. So you start with a large negative number in January year-over-year. And then as you go through the year, those lines are going to cross because we're going to end up with a lot easier comps in the second half of the year. And so it really is the trajectory of rents year-over-year. 
So it's going to start with a big negative in January, and then it's going to go to a mid-single-digit positive by the end of the year and averaging all that out. So January over January, February over February, projected market rents. Average all that out to minus 1.9%. So it's not intended to be because of concessions. It's really because we've had -- we start the year -- again, the prior year rents were all-time highs. 
Rents have rolled down a lot. So we start in a hole for the first half of this year. And then we start hitting much easier comps as we get into July, August, September. And then our year-over-year would be positive. When you average all that together, month by month, you get minus 1.9%. Does that make sense?"

But again, our base case scenario is that people will have greater flexibility working from home. But again, as a CEO of a company, being able to have this team dynamic, what we're trying to accomplish. There are so many pieces of this organization that all have to act in unison. You've got to know the people. And so that's what really makes us believe that this hybrid model where greater flexibility work from home, but people that are going to be in proximity, unlikely to be far, far away from the office because they're going to have to report from time to time, let's say, 2, 3 times a week. We think that, that is probably what's going to happen for a lot of workers.
Again -- and I'm excluding all the workers that have to show up, which I think was estimated at about 60%, including, for example, all of our property teams, anyone that works at a restaurant, et cetera. There was a lot of jobs. There's no work from home flexibility. There is no such thing. And I think that the -- as you read a lot of these reports and news clippings on this subject, they kind of forget about those people. 
And so I think it's going to -- again, we will have more work from home flexibility. And so may be, the city centers are a little bit less desirable. Even though that's where the great restaurants are going to continue to be, and that's where the tourism is going and all those other things.

Both Angela and Barb will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A.
At the end of last year, we announced John Burkart's retirement, and we thank John for his tireless efforts and numerous contributions to the company's success over nearly 3 decades. As we reported last night, our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in lower same-property revenue and core FFO per share for both the quarter and the full year. Similar to the last few quarters, pandemic-related regulations have had 2 primary consequences. First, shelter-in-placement and related orders have resulted in unprecedented job losses; and second, anti-eviction and related laws prevent us from maximizing property performance.
Government mandates are constantly changing and they intensified during the fourth quarter given surging COVID-19 cases. Navigating the pandemic involves extraordinary efforts, and I thank the Essex team for their tireless dedication amid these challenges.
Overall, our fourth quarter results reflect stability in sequential net effective rents beginning in October and as discussed during our third quarter earnings call. Sequential revenues improved 30 basis points in the quarter, with market rents mostly flat in the cities and modestly positive in suburban locations. Therefore, we are cautiously optimistic that we have or will soon reach the bottom in market rent declines.  
As of December 2020, preliminary 3-month trailing job losses in the Essex markets were 7.9% year-over-year, a 150 basis point improvement compared to minus 9.4% for September 2020 and outperforming the nation, which had a 100 basis point improvement from September to December. Even with the recovery of jobs in Q3 and Q4, the nation had 9.2 million fewer jobs year-over-year for the month of December, roughly equal to the number of jobs lost at the worst point of the financial crisis.
Our data and analytics team prepared S-17 to the supplemental, which is our base case scenario underlying our expectation that net effective rents will decline 1.9% in 2021. The range of potential outcomes is extraordinarily wide for 2021, given many unknowns that relate to the pandemic, including the pace of vaccine deployment and changes in regulation.
Our modeling further assumes 4% GDP growth, which should lead to positive momentum in the second half of 2021. Apartment supply will continue to be a challenge, especially in the downtown locations of Los Angeles and Seattle. Our data and analytics team expects approximately 34,000 apartment deliveries in 2021, a modest increase compared to last year.
Also similar to 2020, we don't expect much for-sale housing production going forward. It's our experience that affordable for-sale housing competes directly with rentals, once rents rise to a level that approximates the monthly payment of an entry-level for-sale home, and there is little risk of that occurring in the Essex markets anytime soon.
Page S-17.1 of the supplemental highlights 13 recent multibillion-dollar tech initial public offerings for companies headquartered in the Essex markets. Overall, 2020 was a great year for IPOs, with 147 tech sector offerings completed during the year. It's our view that the IPO market is essential to recharge the tech ecosystem, providing growth capital to early-stage investors and to generate liquidity for reinvestment.
Page S-17.1 also illustrates the reacceleration in job openings for the top 10 tech companies, which has increased 38% since the August trough. Our analysis indicates that nearly 60% of the total job postings are located in California or Washington, with the next largest state, Texas, accounting for just 7%.
The Page S-17.2 of the supplemental package demonstrates that venture capital investments continued on a record pace in 2020 with approximately $130 billion invested in the U.S. with the Essex markets continuing to receive the dominant share of VC investment. Success in the knowledge-based economy requires a critical mass of highly skilled workers, creating a network effect that draws companies to the Bay Area and Seattle. While only a limited number of venture-backed companies will go public, some will experience extraordinarily -- extraordinary growth similar to Snowflake, DoorDash, Airbnb, and resulting in thousands of high-paying jobs.
The environment today has many similarities to the previous recessionary periods, including the financial crisis and the bursting of the dot-com bubble. In both cases, migration out of California was often front page news. In 2020, we experienced higher out migration than normal, especially in our West Coast urban centers. In our experience, people make different housing choices during recessions and it's not surprising to see many in the large baby boomer cohort monetize the value of an expensive California home to move to less expensive areas as part of a retirement plan.
This recession is unique with respect to the extraordinary loss of jobs that involve lower paid service workers, jobs that are concentrated in the city centers and effective employees often had only 2 choices: move immediately to find work or stay in their home shielded by eviction forbearance laws. As with previous recessions, we expect most of these trends to reverse. We expect that the demand for restaurants, services and travel will recover swiftly as vaccines are administered, bringing back related service jobs. 
Workers in the Essex markets earn more than in most parts of the country and the draw of higher-paying jobs, combined with lower recent rent levels makes rental housing down the West Coast, the most affordable it has been since 2013.
Our recent McKinsey study estimates that only 22% of the American workforce can work from home without any productivity loss. We have been tracking many companies that have adopted work-from-home models during the pandemic, and we remain confident that the vast majority of companies will ask employees to return to the office when it is safe to do so, likely with increased work from home flexibility going forward. Google, Netflix and Apple are among the largest companies who have expressed their desire to return to the office, many others will follow.
Turning to the regulatory environment, a third wave of COVID-19 cases beginning in November and related concerns about hospital availability led to the imposition of severe stay-at-home orders in all of our California markets. Some of these restrictions were eased last week, but all of the Essex markets remain in California's most restrictive category.
Recently, with the passage of SB 91 last week, the state of California has extended COVID-19-related eviction protection from January 31 to June 30, 2021, including pushing back the requirement to pay at least 25% of pandemic-related rent. In addition, the law established a state rental assistance program to allocate $2.6 billion in Federal Stimulus Funds using income levels to prioritize payments and accepting related applications in March. As with similar laws, there are many related requirements and complexities, which we are evaluating.
Turning to the apartment investment markets. During 2020, we sold 4 properties with a total of 670 apartment homes for $343 million, all of which were placed under contract subsequent to the implementation of shelter-in-place orders in March. Given the wide discount in valuation for public REITs compared to the private real estate markets, property sales remain our preferred source of funds for investment.
Since the onset of the pandemic, a relatively small number of apartment sales support our belief that property values have not changed materially since the onset of the pandemic. However, extraordinary changes in rent increasing in the case of both suburban markets and decreasing sharply in some urban locations, makes it difficult to draw conclusions about cap rates.
In the suburbs, where rents are generally at or above pre-pandemic levels, property values have modestly increased and cap rates are somewhat lower compared to the pre-pandemic period. Given lower rents and significant concessions in hard hit cities, recent price talk around possible sales indicate about a 5% reduction in value versus the pre-COVID period, resulting in cap rates for high-quality properties below 4%.
As with previous recessions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to provide very attractive financing with 7-year fixed rate financing in the mid-2% range, potentially supporting lower cap rates. Vaccine distribution should remove uncertainty with respect to apartment operations and property values. As a result, we believe transaction volumes will begin to accelerate. As we've indicated before, improved cash flow from positive leverage in apartments has historically led to a robust transaction market.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela."

First, I would like to express my appreciation to the Essex operations team for their diligent efforts to serve our customers amidst a challenging environment caused by the COVID pandemic. Thank you for all your hard work.
As for my comments, I will begin by discussing our 2020 results, followed by our outlook for 2021. Overall, our market performed as we expected, despite the headwinds of new COVID-related closures and seasonal decline in demand. Currently, the urban core, particularly in tech-centric markets, continue to remain more impacted by COVID-19-related job losses and office closures. 
In addition, the change in quality of life, resulting from the closures of restaurants and public amenities has driven a temporary shift in consumer preferences. High-rise buildings or communities located in areas with high Walk Scores have been the most impacted by this shift in demand. Conversely, communities with private outdoor space or more affordable residences outside the urban core continue to experience greater demand, which benefited many of our properties in Ventura, San Diego, Orange County and the East Bay in Northern California. 
This temporary shift in demand continued in the fourth quarter, where we experienced a 7.6% and 9.9% year-over-year increase in quarterly turnover in CBD, Seattle and San Francisco, compared to the portfolio average turnover of only 1.3%. Furthermore, our CBD locations also had a greater concentration of apartment supply deliveries typically accompanied by very high concession levels. During the fourth quarter, we continued our leasing strategy of leveraging concessions on stabilized communities and building occupancy. 
There have been encouraging indicators from a sequential perspective in that more than half of our same-property portfolio grew revenues sequentially, driven in part by increases in occupancy and decreases in concessions. We have provided year-over-year net effect rent changes for our portfolio on Page S-16 of our supplemental. New lease rates were down 8.9% in the fourth quarter, stable in January, an improvement from the negative [ 2.2% ] achieved in the third quarter.
Concessions on same-property approval improved from approximately $18 million in the third quarter to $13 million in the fourth quarter. This reduction in concessions is noteworthy, considering the fourth quarter has seasonally lower demand and historically, concessions increased during this period rather than decrease. Key highlights of the same-property performance of our major markets in the fourth quarter are as follows: in Seattle, 4.9% year-over-year revenue decline was primarily driven by Seattle CBD, which declined by 13%, while the remaining submarkets averaged a 3.2% decline. Year-over-year job growth in Seattle declined by 7.3% in the fourth quarter. 
In Northern California, the 10.4% year-over-year revenue decline was led by CBD, San Francisco and Oakland, averaging an 18% decline, contrasted with a 4.2% decline in Contra Costa County, while Santa Clara County performed in line with the regional average of a 10% decline. Year-over-year job growth in Northern California declined by, 8% with San Jose still better at a 6.4% decline. 
In Southern California, the 7.2% year-over-year decline was primarily driven by L.A. CBD and West L.A. submarkets, averaging a 17% decline, offset by an average decline of 2.4% in our suburban markets of Ventura, Orange County and San Diego. Fourth quarter year-over-year job growth in Southern California declined by 8%.
Moving on to our 2021 outlook. As indicated on S-17 of the supplemental, multifamily supply as a percentage of stock remained low at 0.9% for our portfolio. While we expect a percentage of the year-over-year growth to remain flat, new completions will once again be concentrated in the CBDs and urban submarkets where supply is projected to increase by 2.1% compared to just 0.7% across the rest of the portfolio. The confluence of minimal supply and extraordinary job losses remain a significant headwind in our urban markets.
In Seattle, we expect multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to increase in 2021 by 1.6%, driven by 2.9% in the CBD, offset by a 1% increase in the suburbs, where we have the majority of our units. We have also seen positive office activities by major tech companies as they continue to push forward on expansion projects.
In Seattle, Amazon received approval for a 1.1 million square foot project. In Bellevue, Microsoft has continued with their campus expansion. And in Kirkland, Google acquired a 10-acre site for a large campus. In Northern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock in 2021 to decrease by 10 basis points, although Oakland and San Jose CBD are expected to increase by 1.8% and 3%, respectively. 
Despite the impact of COVID, tech expansion plans have continued in the Bay Area. Amazon purchased a 6-acre site near downtown San Francisco. Facebook, last month, submitted an updated plan for its 1.25 million square foot campus expansion in Menlo Park, and Google continued to work with the city of San Jose for its major new campus at Diridon Station.
In addition, the biotech sector continued to be a strong source of office demand, highlighted by the recently approved expansion of Genentech's headquarter in South San Francisco, which would add up to 4.3 million square foot of new office space.
In Southern California, we project overall multifamily supply as a percentage of stock to remain flat. The most notable increase is 4% L.A. CBD and deliveries in West L.A. will remain elevated once again this year.
While many uncertainties remain as to legislation and the timing of the vaccine, based on current market conditions, we assume our scheduled rent for the same-property portfolio will trough in the second quarter of this year. Because leases are typically 1 year in duration, our year-over-year revenue growth will be negative in the first half and positive in the second half, leading to our same-store full year guidance of 2.5% revenue decline at the midpoint.
Lastly, our current same-store physical occupancy is 96.4%. Our availability 30 day out is 4.7%.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call to Barb Pak."
332646,701108155,2195220,"Essex Property Trust, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our fourth quarter results, followed by key assumptions in our 2021 guidance, and finally, an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. As expected, the fourth quarter was a",876,"Thank you, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our fourth quarter results, followed by key assumptions in our 2021 guidance, and finally, an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. As expected, the fourth quarter was a challenging period with core FFO declining 12.5% compared to 1 year ago. This was primarily driven by an 8% decline in same-property revenues as a result of higher concessions and delinquencies. As we noted last quarter, we report concessions on a cash basis in our same-property results because we believe this is more indicative of true market conditions. However, we are required by GAAP to treat concessions on a straight-line basis in calculating consolidated revenue and FFO.
As Angela mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we provided $5 million fewer concessions than the third quarter, which helped improve same-property revenue sequentially. However, core FFO declined by 4% or $0.13 per share compared to the third quarter, of which, $0.16 is attributable to lower straight-line rent concessions. We expect this line item to continue to be a headwind to core FFO growth in 2021, which I will discuss in a minute.  
Please note on Page S-8 of the supplemental, we have detailed the quarterly impact of noncash straight-line rents.
Turning to delinquencies. We continue to take a conservative approach to reserving against uncollected rents, especially given the surge in COVID-19 cases in the fourth quarter, which resulted in extended lockdowns in our markets throughout much of the quarter. As such, we reserved against the entire net delinquency balance during this quarter. Our receivable balance currently stands at approximately $7 million, including joint ventures at pro rata share. Based on past collections, we feel this receivable balance is consistent with our ongoing conservative approach. We will continue to assess our delinquency reserve and our net receivable balance each quarter based on collection history and market conditions.
Turning to our 2021 guidance. Key assumptions are available on Page 5 of the earnings release and S-14 of the supplemental. We've provided a wider-than-normal range for same-property revenues and core FFO, given the significant uncertainties that remain surrounding COVID and the recovery ahead, including vaccine distribution and eviction moratoriums that are outside our control but could swing guidance in a variety of ways. That said, we felt it was important to outline our key assumptions based on information we have today.
For the full year, we expect core FFO per diluted share to decline by 5.1% at the midpoint. The key drivers of the decrease are primarily related to the following 2 items. First, we expect same-property revenues and NOI to decline by 2.5% and 4.6%, respectively, at the midpoint. While current operating fundamentals remain steady in our markets as compared to several months ago, we will continue to feel the negative effects of the 2020 rent declines throughout most of 2021.
In addition, due to the eviction moratoriums and regulations that remain outside our control, we expect delinquencies will remain elevated in 2021 and will be a drag to core FFO by an estimated $0.45 per share at the midpoint. The company has a long history of excellent rent collections, and we expect this temporary delinquency headwind to become a tailwind to FFO growth once the various COVID-related restrictions are lifted. 
Second, we also faced significant headwinds from straight-line concessions. We expect this noncash item will result in $0.41 to $0.56 per share decline in core FFO, representing about a 4% reduction in growth on a year-over-year basis. As it relates to concessions, we expect they will remain high in the first half of the year before moderating in the second half of the year as the economic recovery takes hold. As such, we expect the impact from straight-line rent concessions to be minimal in the first half of the year, with most of the negative impact we forecasted to fall in the last 2 quarters of 2021.
Lastly, on the capital markets activities and the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we closed $206 million of new preferred equity investments and bought back $46 million of common stock at a significant discount to NAV. These investments are being funded with 3 asset sales totaling approximately $275 million that are under contract and expected to close in the first quarter. This is consistent with our guiding principles of match funding investments on a leverage-neutral basis.
For the year, we were able to arbitrage the difference between public and private market pricing by selling $343 million of assets at prices generally consistent with pre-COVID levels and buying back $269 million of stock at an average price of $225 per share, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and creating value for our shareholders. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with minimal near-term funding needs and sound financial metrics. While our net debt-to-EBITDA has increased this year, this is primarily the result of the significant decline in EBITDA caused by the pandemic.
As the economic recovery takes hold and the West Coast economies continue to reopen, we expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will improve. With ample liquidity and a well-covered dividend, our balance sheet remains a source of strength.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions."

We think that there will be more work from home flexibility but at the same time, we think that employees will be tethered at some level to the office. As I think about the 3 other very capable people here today, knowing them and trusting them and all these things are a great team effort and teams are better when you really know the people and can trust the people. So I'd say that is key factor that I think, and as noted in the prepared remarks, we'll keep employees relatively close to their jobs.
So having said that, I would think the winners in this scenario will ultimately be the high-quality cities that are near the jobs, but also offer maybe a little bit more affordable housing and good schools, low crime rates, et cetera. So I think that, that will play itself out.
And I think those areas, we have a lot of cities that are among the major metros that qualify for that. So -- and some of them have been pretty hard hit. So I would -- I guess I would add to that, some of the cities that are high-quality cities, their rents have been highly impacted by COVID. Certainly, when I think about Northern California and the tech markets, the Peninsula, San Mateo, even suburban parts of San Jose would be major beneficiaries of that because I -- we view that technology is going to continue to be a very strong economic driver. And the tech ecosystem in the Bay Area is incredibly unique. And therefore, we think it will do well.
That answered the question?"

And the way it would work is the landlord would be required to forgive 20%. And so the reimbursement from these programs could be 80%. That will be predicated on percentages of median income, average median income. So it will provide the greatest benefit to those that are at lower income levels. And it's hard to tell exactly what that means. We just haven't had enough time to evaluate that program. So I'm guessing that we will have a pretty significant positive impact from it.

So if we look at net effective rents, for the fourth quarter, sequentially, they were down under 1%. So net debt, that's all the markets. Now there's pretty significant variation between market to market. And part of that is, even though we have high occupancy overall, there are parts of our portfolio that have lower occupancy. For example, San Francisco is still at 92.5%. Seattle Downtown is at about the same level. And so there are areas that we're very highly occupied that are offsetting areas that are -- that don't have the same occupancy and actually below the average occupancy level.
And most of that, as Angela alluded to, is related to the supply level. As you can imagine, if you've got negative job equivalent to -- right now, still as of December, equivalent to the worst part of the great financial crisis, it is not a great time to be delivering apartment units. And therefore -- and the cities are getting the bulk of the supply delivery. So you have this confluence that Angela spoke about, which is negative demand growth and supply and the cities are understandably hit from that. Offsetting that is, we do have markets that are doing very well. For example, Ventura, where rents are up almost 10% year-over-year on a market basis. And so we're doing pretty well in a lot of these suburbs.
Now that leads to this issue that I talked about many times, which is rent-to-income. And it's interesting that Ventura with its -- I think it's more like 8.5% to 10% rent increase is now about 17% above its long-term historical average of this ratio of rent-to-income, which is incredibly important to us. Whereas in Northern California were 7% below the long-term average of rent to income. So everyone looks at this like, hey, the suburbs is going to do a lot better. But when rents go up a long ways, I would question that. 
And conversely, when the rents are essentially hammered in the cities, it changes the consumer's view of where the opportunity is. And so our view is long -- a little bit longer-term that you're going to see a very significant movement back towards the areas where rents are -- high-quality cities where rents are pretty affordable."

And so given where we are, you're right on point that we did in the third quarter focus on occupancy, which allowed us in the fourth quarter to pull back on concessions as we see the market stabilize. And so as we continue to see the -- how the market performs, we will continue to use that strategy.
And the goal at this point is really to try to pull back on concessions whenever possible. And of course, keep in mind that, that's subject to, of course, the supply, which I mentioned. And the CBDs will continue to be pretty heavy. And assuming a recovery in the back half of the year, so all those come into play."

I would love for you too, but I appreciate why you might not want to. I wanted to -- on the other side of the equation, just the job growth. One of the things that, believe it or not, I think, is misunderstood about your portfolio, is your Class A/B mix in urban versus suburban. I'm not sure that's always appreciated by the investor base. So when you think about job growth, can you maybe break down those job growth views relative to white collar, high class, high-paying jobs in urban markets versus maybe the type of renters that would rent Class B in the suburban markets?"

And there's a lot to that question, so I'll try to unpack it as best I can. Every recession is a little bit different. And normally, we view Southern California as our more typical of the U.S. average, and therefore, it's less volatile. In this recession, it has been incredibly volatile in a certain sector, and that is the Motion Picture sector. We didn't talk about it this time, we have on prior calls. And it's effectively shut down. And this is like the big wealth generator in Southern California. And so Southern California is probably the biggest surprise relative to prior recessions.
For example, in the financial crisis, market rents went down in Southern California about 10% versus about 15% for the Essex portfolio in total. So this time, Southern California looks a lot like Northern California. And I think it's because of the 2 key parts of it, again, the filming and entertainment business plus all of these low jobs. When you look at the sectors of jobs that have been demolished, it's all the lower income segments of the job base, mainly it's hospitality and restaurants and other services those jobs are down. On the metros, somewhere in the 20% range, which means in the cities which are even higher concentrated, they're even more impacted.
So as Angela said, you've got more supply coming into the cities. You also have worse job growth. Again -- but we give you the averages, these are averages that more concentrated in the cities. So -- and then when you go north into the tech markets, I think that you have 2 things that are happening. You have all those service jobs in Seattle and the Bay Area. But you also have, I would say, greater work from home flexibility that is that on the margin has allowed the areas that would generally be -- that are suburban in nature, most of San Jose is suburban, it has small downtown up Peninsula through Mountain View, where Facebook is located and Google, right in that area. Those areas have been greater -- much greater impacted. And I think a lot of that is the work-from-home phenomena.
So I think that the -- so I think the recovery looks like a couple of things because -- there's nothing fundamentally wrong with any of these businesses. The Motion Picture business is still a high demand. The technology companies, as noted in the prepared remarks, a lot of venture capital money being invested, lots of investments being made by the big tech companies into locations and buildings. And so everything, we feel, I think, in terms of the broader economy looks fine, we need those companies to come back to the office to some extent.
We also need -- there's always people that are retiring and again, selling their expensive California home, going somewhere else and then backfilling comes from college graduates coming to take high-paying jobs. So I think that there's a mismatch there, I think that the people that are leaving have left. The low-income can't afford to stay, they either have left or are staying put, given anti-eviction laws. And then -- but we haven't seen the backfill yet. And I think you're going to see the back starting in the next relatively soon, and I think that they will start to solidify it because we're 90-something percent occupied. It doesn't take that many jobs to sort of fill things up, tighten things up and then concessions start abating pretty quickly. So that's how we see it. Hopefully, that helps."

And again, similar to prior recessions, where everyone focuses on the very short term, which is -- recessions happen about every 10 years, about every 10 years, I was 50, now I am 60. I make a different decision when I'm 60 than when I was 50 about where I live and how hard I want to work and various things. And so that's part of it.
And so lots of people make changes in their life based on what they're doing and how close they are to retirement and a variety of other things. So I would say a lot of what you're seeing is just the first leg of what always happens, about every 10 years and typically around a recessionary period. But in terms of inflow, outflows, it's a little bit different by market. We still -- the migration into our markets is still dominated by New York and Boston and even some other California metros. So there's quite a few people moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, maybe for better weather or whatever.
In L.A., the outflow is really Las Vegas, Phoenix and other California cities. And in San Francisco, it's Seattle, Austin, Sacramento. And Seattle is Phoenix, Boise, Austin in terms of outflow. And again, all 3 benefiting from highly skilled workers probably in a lot of the eastern metros and from some California cities. 
So hopefully, that helps. That's LinkedIn data. And -- but our experience is pretty consistent with that."

But I don't think there's any winners in this current situation. So we are trying to turn the battle ship toward a better day, but it's not quite here yet.

And so say, there's one in the Bay Area, I'll just use as an example. It's in a heavily concessioned Bay Area market. And the way we're underwriting it, as you can imagine, it's kind of tough to peg cap rates given where current net effective rents are. So we're underwriting it based a couple of different ways. One is on kind of pre-COVID in-place rents and then looking at current net effective today.
On current net effective, that deal, again, this is heavily concession Bay Area market. It's in the low 3s, so call it, 3.2, or something like that. And on pre-COVID numbers, that's about a 3.8 or so. And so that's the spread net, and that was underwritten in the fourth quarter. So  concessions have varied before that and since, but that's the ballpark.
And there still is -- there's enough of a transaction market out there where market has been set. The buyers are a little different than during your typical cycle, but there continue to be deals that go down."

The -- back in -- when AB-3088, which again, was supplemented by this SB-91, 3088 was passed in August and required residents to pay -- COVID-affected residents to pay at least 25% of their rent by January 31. And then SB-91 ruled that January 31 date to June. So the 25% is getting larger, and it definitely will add pressure to that whole situation. And definitely I'm not smart enough to figure out how that's all going to play out.
We're all hoping that this federal stimulus money -- we have mostly a B type of portfolio. And so we don't have any quantification of it whatsoever, but that would certainly help a lot because that would potentially pay 80% of the unpaid rent, and we would have to walk away from the 20%, but that's a whole lot better than what we've assumed in terms of our delinquencies.
So yes, I think that we're recovered in terms of the normal to kind of probably slightly conservative case scenario. And maybe there's a little bit upside here given SB-91. So that's how I'd answer. But you're absolutely right. I don't know -- I don't for sure know the answer to it."

But I wouldn't say that. I mean, I think that as I said in the opening script and the reason why I put it in there is, hey, this -- we're still at a point where the nation has lost as many jobs as it lost in the financial crisis. And in the financial crisis, our average market rents were down 15%. Seattle was a little worse, about 20%, and Southern California did a little better.
So I think we are kind of where we are or where we would expect to be given the extraordinary number of jobs lost. Now it's not the same as the financial crisis in that you've lost these low end service jobs, and they're mostly in the city servicing at various levels, very wealthy clientele with lots of money. So it's different, but mostly the same.
I would say, I'm not surprised about where rents have gone in general. And I hope for a robust recovery with vaccine distribution and all that stuff because it seems like a lot of this is really focused on COVID direct outcomes, losing service jobs just because of COVID because those service jobs just aren't there, they're shutdown by the government.
So I think we'll be able to come back pretty quickly because I think people do want to go out to eat dinner and that type of stuff. And so I think it's going to come back, and I hope soon, obviously."

And we'll reassess in Q1 and see where things are at as that goes.
And then the $0.45 that I alluded to in my script, that's really compared to our historical run rate. So for the foreseeable future, we do expect delinquency to remain elevated. This eviction protection moratorium, SB-91 goes until June. And then we don't know what's going to happen after that. 
So we have assumed that we don't make a lot of progress on the delinquency. It's not because we can't collect, it's a combination of both, people not paying and collections kind of are getting us to that mid-2% range of scheduled rent."

And we all need to live our lives and make decisions. And so we decided on the course, and it probably took too long to come to agreement about what his role was going to be going forward. We ended up with the press release after Christmas, it could have been much earlier, just took time to finalize what that was going to look like. So apologize for the optics of it.
Having said that, John is always in our minds, in our hearts, and he's forever a part of the company. And certainly, we wish him well. He's done a tremendous amount of good for the company. So as we think about succession planning, the basic philosophy is the doors to or the pass to the CEO job are always open. And the historical path has been mostly through finance. I came through finance and then ran ops and then up. And -- but we want other paths to be open too, including maybe through operations or through investments.
So wherever we see talented people, it's one of my primary jobs to keep those pass open and don't let them be blocked by people that are -- that don't have interest in being CEO. That's kind of the key to the whole thing. And then backing off of that down looking at the people below and making sure that they have diverse experiences and have moved around the organization. And in the case of Barb, Angela, John, all of them wore a variety of hats on their way to -- up the organization. So we expect to continue to do that. And I think that's the way it has to be in order to have a proper succession process."

And then the second question is, one of the hallmarks of Essex has been investing when there's abnormalities in the market. And Mike, you mentioned something interesting that in the suburbs, the rent affordability index was at perhaps an all-time high or definitely elevated, whereas the urban areas are below the average, more affordable. However, you guys have sold out of the urban areas and been more suburban. 
So does this make you want to switch and now sell more suburban, get back into the urban? Or are there other dynamics at work where with this pricing affordability imbalance, you wouldn't do what maybe you would have historically done prior to the pandemic?"

And most of those we sold in the CBDs. And we've done that for a variety of reasons, and that dates back to -- we sold 8th & Hope in Downtown, L.A., sold Masso in San Francisco prior to COVID. And those -- pricing on those deals was significantly above what our in-place NAV was at the time. 
And so we felt at the time the right decision to make from an arbitrage standpoint was sell those and reinvest in either our existing portfolio, buy back stock or in other assets in suburban locations. The really heavily impacted CBD locations. Quality of life, especially, say, in Downtown, L.A., in SoMa, in San Francisco has been challenging and will likely continue to be challenging here for the foreseeable future.
Many of the, what we consider or what we call, suburbs are very densely populated suburbs, and that's where we see opportunity, and that's where we see much of the market coming back sooner rather than later. So like I said, we're constantly assessing where we are. And if there are opportunities in CBD, where we can buy at a good basis, and we see significant rent growth, we'll do that. 
But yes, I mean, like I said, we've been net sellers here, and we've sold -- all the deals that we've sold last year and then into this year have been within  2% of our pre-COVID NAV, some above, some slightly below. So that's been the right philosophy and the right strategy, and we'll assess as we go on. Mike?"

But I just have a belief that having a nice location, low crime, pleasant surroundings, lots of entertainment and food options, et cetera, is going to continue to be important.

And I would say that what I see relative to that is even close. During the dot-com bubble period rent surged about 40% in 2 years. It set our all-time high in terms of rent to income level. So rents being at a very high percentage of income level. And contrast that to what I said earlier, which is rents appear very affordable. San Francisco real rents down somewhere around 20%. 
Well, Northern California, in general, is about 7% below our long-term average of rent to income in terms of affordability. And if I compare -- if I take a look at that number and compare it to the financial crisis, I think we got to about 90% of the long-term average. So in Northern California, we're at 93%. So it's starting to feel pretty affordable. 
Again, these are areas that support high income, high jobs, high-paying jobs, et cetera, and the rent levels are now at a point where I doubt that the tech companies are going bat an eye all that much at the cost of living because affordability has changed pretty dramatically overnight. Now I can change back. It doesn't take that many apartment -- new apartment units of demand to come in and take 96% occupancy to 97%, and then it's a whole different game. 
But that's the way that we look at it. We've said, the band between the rental income, the band between 90% and 110% is kind of the green zone that we do well in. And in the markets that have been hardest hit, we are closer to the 90% of the long-term historical average. And again, in Ventura, we're above the 110%. So it's -- it will change the choices that renters make, I believe."

I ask because you look at your main Essex markets, about 1.1 million jobs have been lost in 2020. And you're assuming like 3.4% or around 400,000 jobs. So a little under 3 years of that kind of growth will be needed to get back to a level commensurate with pre-COVID. 
So just based on those things, Mike, how do you guys see that sort of ""recovery""? I understand the comps in the second half of this year are going to be very easy. But after that, what do you guys kind of think about when it were at, again, like pre-COVID type pricing?"

And so what happens during the recession is people move closer into the better areas. Plenty of people will say, ""hey, I would live in San Francisco, but the rents are too high"". And so they live within the proximity around San Francisco and commute in. And then once this happens, they make a different choice, and they say, ""hey, with those rents, there's a backfilling approach"". 
And so I would agree with you. What happens, the natural consequence of that is, and then obviously, there's another way beyond that and another way beyond that. And somewhere out there on the hinterlands and the very periphery with the Bay Area, you have areas that are not 95% occupied, they might be 80% occupied because people make different choices based on pricing. And again, this has been one of the absolutes in my career and why we harp on this rent-to-income ratio as being so important. 
So the people -- the number of people that moved out of San Francisco versus -- it has been backfilled, but largely by people that have moved in from, let's say, Oakland or further out and want to live in the city. And then this backfilling process is ongoing. So here we are at 96%, having lost all those jobs that you just mentioned. And so the question is when those jobs come back, how does this how does this reverse itself?
And some of these people will be happy to live in the city for a year and then maybe it will be priced out of the city and will be moved into one of these secondary markets. So you're absolutely right. But -- and again, we price it -- this is part of why we price things to keep occupancy high because if we keep occupancy high, we'll draw people out of the, let's say, the less desirable suburbs and wait for demand to come back, and that is our way of maximizing revenue during the recessionary periods."

And I can't tell you how quickly, and I can't tell you how many jobs it's going to take in order for that to happen. But I can tell you that, that is typically what happens that concessions as quickly as they came, they can go away just as quickly. We're going to have the overhang from the straight-line rent issue, which is a different factor. But our hope is that we get enough demand. Those tech companies continue to hire people, bring -- they decide to live somewhere close to the major urban centers or where most of the job locations are.
And again, it just doesn't take that much. But how long will it take to get back to where we were? I mean it's a battleship, and it's going to take a year or 2, at least to get back there, it is what I would guess. I mean, the trajectory, as you pointed out, we lost a whole lot of jobs in the nation, and we've gotten some of them back, but we're still going to have a shortfall, and we're delivering some apartment units. 
I'd argue that the single-family component is so muted and a lot of markets have a lot more single-family as a percentage of total stock, housing stock than we do. And that is around -- I think it was like 0.3% production level will help a lot.
And so I think -- I would guess that as the restaurants open up. We're going to see a surge of people coming back into the cities in these service jobs, and concessions are going to abate pretty quickly. That's what I think would happen. And we'll be updating as quarters go by, but it's hard to tell exactly when this is all going to happen."

But a lot of contract workers that left amid COVID and connected with both the entertainment industry and the tech industry. How many of those come back remains a question too. So I view it as when uncertainty unfolds, everyone kind of pulls in, companies become less aggressive at hiring. We saw that. We saw the drop-off of tech jobs by the top 10 employers there. And all the contract workers go home. If there's a little bit of a bright spot here, the Trump administration was pretty negative on H-1B visas. That will probably open up a bit, and immigration might open up a bit here, which I think will help somewhat. 
But we don't try to get more granular other than to look at the supply-demand ratio really represented by drop in jobs, that's probably 80% of the total picture or something like that."

And so there's a couple of different factors, which may be a little confusing. 
So as far as pricing is concerned, we currently do see -- what we reported in January to hold. Keep in mind, this is also towards a lower peaking season. So as we progress and if the economy continues to improve, and reopen, we -- that's why we talked about second quarter -- I'm sorry, second half of the year being better. But it's hard to talk about it kind of month-to-month. I think right now, we're in good position because we had employed the strategy of higher occupancy and which allows us to reduce our concession.

You also offered more concessions in the Labor Day kind of time frame. 
So I guess if everything -- the concessions side, vaccine aside, everything is sort of -- if you look at it from a normal lease expiration schedule perspective, things are weighted towards the Q3. How does that sort of reset to a more normal kind of cadence of turnover and leasing unless you invite in shorter leases? Or I'm just inquisitive on that."

So that kind of gives you the trajectory in terms of our business. But the reason we're talking about when things trough and the year-over-year comparables because that does impact what happens for the whole year and that behaves differently because of COVID last year. Because second half of 2020 -- I'm sorry, first half was 2020 was much better than second half. And so you kind of have that flip in terms of year-over-year growth were -- first half of 2021 will be much harder and second half will be easier."

And in terms of like when we look at your macroeconomic forecast, kudos to Mr. Paul Morgan and team, I guess. It appears that Northern California has the highest job growth at 3.4%, but the lowest rent growth at minus 3.6%. So there's a lag. I assume that the lag is related to the hyper-concession activity we saw in 2021 and 2020. And so we're sort of building back from there. 
But I'm also wondering whether you guys have any sort of factors or discounts for jobs that are created by companies domiciled in California, but have been -- offered the employees the flexibility to work from anywhere. So is that factoring into your kind of negative 1.9% rent growth forecast, effective rent growth forecast?"

So what that represents is each month, year-over-year, what the market -- or that effective rent differential is year-over-year. So again, if you look at January of this year, the prior year rents were going up, and obviously, we've had a big decline in current rent. So you start with a large negative number in January year-over-year. And then as you go through the year, those lines are going to cross because we're going to end up with a lot easier comps in the second half of the year. And so it really is the trajectory of rents year-over-year. 
So it's going to start with a big negative in January, and then it's going to go to a mid-single-digit positive by the end of the year and averaging all that out. So January over January, February over February, projected market rents. Average all that out to minus 1.9%. So it's not intended to be because of concessions. It's really because we've had -- we start the year -- again, the prior year rents were all-time highs. 
Rents have rolled down a lot. So we start in a hole for the first half of this year. And then we start hitting much easier comps as we get into July, August, September. And then our year-over-year would be positive. When you average all that together, month by month, you get minus 1.9%. Does that make sense?"

But again, our base case scenario is that people will have greater flexibility working from home. But again, as a CEO of a company, being able to have this team dynamic, what we're trying to accomplish. There are so many pieces of this organization that all have to act in unison. You've got to know the people. And so that's what really makes us believe that this hybrid model where greater flexibility work from home, but people that are going to be in proximity, unlikely to be far, far away from the office because they're going to have to report from time to time, let's say, 2, 3 times a week. We think that, that is probably what's going to happen for a lot of workers.
Again -- and I'm excluding all the workers that have to show up, which I think was estimated at about 60%, including, for example, all of our property teams, anyone that works at a restaurant, et cetera. There was a lot of jobs. There's no work from home flexibility. There is no such thing. And I think that the -- as you read a lot of these reports and news clippings on this subject, they kind of forget about those people. 
And so I think it's going to -- again, we will have more work from home flexibility. And so may be, the city centers are a little bit less desirable. Even though that's where the great restaurants are going to continue to be, and that's where the tourism is going and all those other things. So -- but maybe the suburbs do a little bit better in that scenario."

But I would expect the Biden administration -- I think I saw something recently. I don't have anything that I pulled for the call. But I think I said something recently that they will open up in addition to not building any more walls, et cetera, that they will open up the immigration process to foreign workers, which would mean -- a lot of workers went home because they're their spouse couldn't work or they didn't have another occupation.

Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A.

Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A. I'll start today with our first quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year, including factors that lead us to believe that 2021 will be a year of recovery from the pandemic and then conclude with an overview of the transaction market. I am pleased to note that Essex was founded 50 years ago in 1971 by our Chairman, George Marcus, and we are very proud of all the company has accomplished. George remains keenly focused on the company's mission, strategy and business plan execution. I also want to recognize the extraordinary effort of the Essex team, which has allowed us to emerge from the pandemic in a position of strength and ready to seek opportunity that often comes from associated uncertainty. The Board and senior leadership team greatly appreciate this collaborative effort. 
Finally, the company's commitment to the balance sheet strength and a growing dividend was reaffirmed with our recent announcement of our 27th consecutive annual dividend increase. Turning to our first quarter results. Severe lockdowns in California and Washington remained a headwind in the quarter after intensifying last November amid a surge in COVID cases and hospitalizations that has only recently abated. Our very strong results in the first quarter of 2020 and a plethora of pandemic-related regulations and associated job loss were significant impediments to the company's performance this past year. As reflected in this quarter's results, with same-property revenues and core FFO down 8.1% and 11.8%, respectively, compared to a year ago. On a sequential basis, same-property revenues improved by 10 basis points, driven by growth in several suburban areas and particularly in San Diego, Orange and Ventura counties of Southern California. 
As noted in our earnings release, we reaffirmed our full year 2021 guidance ranges, and we continue to expect improvements in same-property revenue growth, driven by job growth and easier year-over-year comparisons. Apartment demand continues to be strongest in properties farthest from the urban centers and weakest in the cities, both being a function of new apartment supply and pandemic-related job losses. On a trailing 3-month basis as of March 2021, year-over-year job losses were 9.2% and 5.4%, respectively, for the Essex markets and the nation, marking significant progress compared to the 14% decline we saw in the Essex market shortly after the onset of the pandemic. And also suggesting that our markets remain early in the recovery process. 
Fortunately, the recovery of jobs appears to be accelerating as reflected in preliminary job losses for the month of March 2021, which were down 7.9% for the Essex markets and 4.4% for the nation. On a sequential basis, California and Washington outpaced the nation in March, gaining nearly 150,000 jobs, representing over 16% of the U.S. job growth with less than 13% of the employment base. 
As we suggested several quarters ago, we expect rents to recover on the West Coast as we recapture pandemic-related job losses that were directly impacted by shelter in place orders, including hospitality and service sectors, entertainment and filming and video production and tech jobs that were displaced to remote locations. Hospitality and service jobs were disproportionately concentrated in the urban areas in wealthy suburbs. For the nation, jobs in hospitality and other services have recovered about 2/3 of their post COVID job losses. By comparison, to date, Essex metros have recovered less than 1/3 of these losses. Given the widespread recent reopening of California cities, these service sectors are again growing and their potential upside represents a promising differentiator for Essex markets over the next several quarters. 
Film and video production was disrupted, once again by the COVID shutdowns over the winter months, followed more recently by a surge in film permit applications. Overall, production activity remains below normal for this time of year. However, data released last week from FilmLA highlighted a 45% month-over-month increase in film permit applications for March. As the industry benefited from the recent relaxation of stay at home measures in Los Angeles County. We expect the rebound in production to continue this year due to pent-up demand for content that has been disrupted due to COVID-19. This recovery should provide a positive tailwind for the industry and for rental demand in the LA market. 
We are also pleased that many of the top tech companies have announced returned to office plans supporting our belief that the hybrid model for offices will prevail with most employees spending a significant amount of time in the office for key building, collaboration, career advancement and related necessities. The largest tech employers in our markets had significantly reduced their hiring plans early in the pandemic, while also allowing many of their employees to work from home. With the cities largely shut down, many tech workers move to suburban or rural locations or back home with their parents. This trend began to reverse late last year, and we expect to see further momentum in the coming quarters as more tech employers reopen their offices. 
As before, we track the announcements of the largest tech companies, and we have provided a time line of planned office reopenings based on public disclosures on Slide S17.1 of our supplemental. 
We also provide a graph indicating the strong recovery in job postings for the top 10 tech companies with open positions in the Essex markets now above pre COVID levels. We also track the job locations for open positions, noting that about 57% of their U.S. job posting [indiscernible] or Washington as the office location. As of last week, California and Washington have dispensed at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to approximately 47% and 45% of their adult populations, respectively. Overall, accelerating vaccine deployment and pent-up demand for services gives us confidence that we are now on a solid path to recovery. California's counties have begun to remove restrictions on commerce. And Governor, Newsom, recently announced that California is expected to effectively reopen on June 15, and including key indoor and outdoor activities, such as conventions and sporting events. These plans are subject to several protective measures tied to continued low hospitalization rates and sufficient vaccine supplies. On the supply outlook, total housing permits, both single and multifamily and our West Coast markets have declined 9.2% on a trailing 12-month basis compared to the national average increase of 6.4%. The national increase in permits is being driven by a 13.9% increase in single-family housing permits mostly in markets with low barriers to entry and rising home prices. 
In California, the median price of the single-family home increased 12.4% year-over-year as of February, normally, one would assume that higher home values would lead to increased production. However, single-family permits in the Essex markets are down 7.7%, which we attribute to a challenging regulatory environment and limited land availability, ultimately leading to fewer deliveries in late '22 and 2023. With large increases in for-sale housing prices, down payments have increased and the transition from a renter to homeownership has become more challenging. At the same time, the combination of lower rents from the pandemic and higher average incomes in the Essex markets has improved apartment rental affordability. We have seen these forces in previous recoveries, and they often result in periods of higher-than-average rent growth. 
Turning to the transaction market. We successfully sold 3 apartment communities in the first quarter for $275 million at values that were similar to the pre COVID period when our consensus NAV was almost $300 per share. As a result, we use property sales proceeds to fund preferred equity investments and repurchase common stock, both accretive to per share core FFO and offsetting a portion of COVID-related NOI declines. The strong rebound in REIT valuations over the past 6 months makes stock buybacks less attractive today, and we are now looking for undervalued or mismanaged property in our core markets to grow externally. There were relatively few property sales during the pandemic, and most were completed by highly motivated buyers using 1031 exchange proceeds and other sources of attractively priced capital. Several of our suburban markets have rent levels that have increased on a year-over-year basis, and recent transactions have priced in the high 3% cap rate range. In the hard hit cities, buyers appear to be looking beyond the COVID impacts with apartments selling near a 4% cap rate using pre COVID rents and NOI, roughly equivalent to a cap rate in the low 3% range based on current rents. 
Strong apartment values have led to a greater level of redemptions in our preferred equity portfolio, the impact of which Barb will discuss in a moment. As conditions normalize, we are starting to see more properties being listed for sale. The unprecedented changes and uncertainty experienced during the pandemic will likely lead to a robust apartment transaction market as property owners adjust their strategies going forward.  
I will now turn the call over to our COO, Angela Kleiman."

First, a special recognition to the Essex operating team for their continued focus on delivering solid results under these extraordinary conditions. Thank you for your efforts. As for my comments, I will focus the discussion on our first qua",803,"Thanks, Mike. First, a special recognition to the Essex operating team for their continued focus on delivering solid results under these extraordinary conditions. Thank you for your efforts. As for my comments, I will focus the discussion on our first quarter results and current market dynamics. In general, our markets continue to improve as the economy gradually reopens with the vaccine rollouts, easing of cohort restrictions and the recent announcements for a phased or partial office reopening by the major employers which has contributed to job growth. Our goal amidst the pandemic was to focus on maintaining occupancy and managing scheduled rent, which will position us favorably for revenue growth in the future. 
Accordingly, we adjusted our concession strategy to match the improvements in demand, which has enabled our same-property revenues to perform slightly better than our expectations. We have been successful with this strategy. And as a result, we maintained occupancy with scheduled rents decline, representing only 3.2% of the 8.1% total revenue decline for the quarter. You may recall the underlying fundamentals in the first quarter of last year consisted of a strong economic backdrop prior to the COVID pandemic. In fast, our first quarter year-over-year same-property revenue growth back then was 3.2%, with revenue levels at historical highs throughout the entire portfolio. The strength of first quarter last year created a more difficult year-over-year comparable, which is also the reason why our new lease rates declined by 9.7% in the first quarter, as shown on the S-16, compared to the fourth quarter where the new lease rate declined by 8.9%. Consistent with the discussion on our last earnings call, the year-over-year decline in our major markets was primarily attributed to a combination of job losses from the pandemic, particularly impacting urban CBDs, which also had a greater concentration of supply deliveries. 
Here are a few key highlights of the first quarter year-over-year performance by market. In Seattle, the 7% revenue decline was primarily driven by Seattle CBD, down 15.7%, whereas the remaining submarkets averaged a 5.2% decline. In Northern California, the 10.9% revenue decline was led by CBD, San Francisco and Oakland and San Mateo, averaging a 15.9% decline, contrasted with a 5% decline in Contra Costa County. 
In Southern California, the 5.8% revenue decline continues to be primarily driven by L.A. CBD and West L.A., which were down by an average of 13% and while our suburban Southern California submarkets of Intra, Orange County and San Diego averaged a 2.1% decline. 
As you can see, our suburban portfolio continues to significantly outperform the urban markets. On the other hand, there are signs of improvement in our tech centric urban markets. For example, first quarter sequential financial occupancies in San Francisco and Seattle CBD increased by 2.7% and 4.2%, respectively. In addition, the sequential quarterly turnover rates declined at an average of 5.4% in these markets. We continue to anticipate that the urban CBD markets, particularly in Downtown Seattle, Oakland and L.A., will remain impacted by greater concentration of supply deliveries. Resulting in elevated level of concessions, which will moderate the recovery. Although we typically do not place significant focus on sequential performance, because of the seasonality embedded in our business under normal market conditions, as we emerge from the pandemic, we view the sequential trend as a better indicator of our recovery progress. From this perspective, we have delivered 2 consecutive quarters of modest total same-property revenue growth, supported by comparable periods of job growth in our markets, which began in the fourth quarter of last year. And has continued through the first quarter of this year. More notable is the 110 basis points in sequential improvement of our average net effective market rent per unit, with Southern California continues to lead our portfolio growth. 
On average, new lease concessions improved from low over 2 weeks in the fourth quarter to about 1.5 weeks in the first quarter. While the magnitude may vary, this trend is in line with our forecast, where we had expected that market rents in our portfolio, on average, with trough between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. 
Lastly, although office rental market has softened, major tech employers are continuing to expand in our markets. Google recently procured the rights to build an additional 1.3 million square feet of space in Montview and Amazon in Bellevue began construction on a brand-new office tower as well as signing new lease and a development for an additional 600,000 square feet. 
With our economy approaching 50% reopening, we remain mindful of the market and legislative uncertainties as we continue on the path to recovery. 
In conclusion, our portfolio is stable with current same-store portfolio occupancy at 96.7% our availability 30-day out is at 4.4%. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak."
332646,710500245,2261093,"Essex Property Trust, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our first quarter results, followed by an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet.

I'll start with a few comments on our first quarter results, followed by an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04 per share, of which $0.02 consolidated operations and the other $0.02 relate to the joint venture portfolio and lower interest expense. Of the $0.02 beat on operations, $0.01 relates to higher same-property revenues and the other $0.01 is from lower operating expenses, which is timing related. For the second quarter, we expect core FFO to be $2.92 at the midpoint, a $0.15 per share decline sequentially. Half of the decline is attributable to the loss of income on the early redemption of $110 million preferred equity investment, which occurred at the end of March and that $276 million of dispositions that closed at the end of February. There is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use of a portion of the proceeds. And as such, this is causing a $0.07 decline sequentially. 
In addition, we expect commercial income to be $0.02 lower as we had onetime benefits related to better delinquency collections in the first quarter that we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. The remaining decline relates to lower same-property NOI due to higher expected operating expenses and delinquency and higher G&A. For the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for same-property revenue, expense and NOI growth and core FFO per share. 
Turning to investments. During the quarter, we received $120 million for the redemption of 2 preferred equity investments. One of the investments totaling $110 million was redeemed early as the developer was able to sell the property for a price that exceeded our pre COVID valuation. We estimate the cap rate at 3.6% on pre COVID rents and 3.25% on current net effective rents. As a result of the early redemption, the company received $3.5 million in prepayment penalties or $0.05 per share, which compensates us for the lost income on the portion of the investment that was made in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, for FFO purposes, we booked this income as a noncore item. Given the strong demand to invest in apartments and financing alternatives currently available, we may experience additional early redemptions of preferred equity investments in 2021. 
Moving to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $450 million of unsecured bonds with a 7-year term at -- [ and ] an effective yield of 1.8%. The proceeds were used to refinance most of our unsecured term loans that matured over the next 2 years, allowing us to extend our maturity profile with no impact to interest expense. We now have less than $200 million of debt maturing between now and the end of 2022. 
Since the beginning of 2020, we have refinanced nearly 30% of our debt, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and reducing our weighted average interest rate by 60 basis points to 3.2%. This is leading to a significant reduction in interest expense in 2021 and can be seen in the first quarter results via the $4 million reduction to interest expense compared to the prior year. 
During the quarter, we raised our common dividend by 60 basis points to $8.36 per share on an annual basis, our 27th consecutive dividend increase. This is a sign of our strong balance sheet and cash flow coverage despite the effects of the pandemic. With approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity and minimal near-term funding needs, our balance sheet remains strong, and we will remain disciplined as we look for ways to invest accretively to create shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions."

And 1 of the ways that we're looking at this now is take our portfolio divided into 3 categories: the large cities, let's say, the midsize cities and suburban -- most suburban markets.

For example, our best suburban market is [ torrance ], which sequentially is up 4.3%. and when you look into the midsized cities, we see improvement. I'd say, it's pretty clear that the improvement in our markets is starting in Suburbia and moving towards the cities. And unfortunately, hasn't really benefited the city's [indiscernible] extend at this point in time. So best-performing clearly is all the suburban markets. And it doesn't matter whether they're suburban Seattle or suburban Los Angeles. And then the midsized cities are sort of second best in terms of recovery trajectory. And then the large cities are lagging pretty substantially. And again, large hampered by supply, which is greater in the cities, along with these job levers, which improved pretty significantly for the 3-month trailing average job growth was minus 9.2%. And March was minus 7.9%. So there was actually a lot of improvement in the quarter, but we need that to continue. We feel like California got a bit of a late start. Coming out of in this reopening process. And so maybe from that perspective, we're a step behind where we thought we were, but we're making up ground and things are looking better.

But beyond making money, which is awesome, what is the practical impact as far as operations or the way you guys interact with smart rent, et cetera?"
332646,710500245,2261093,"Essex Property Trust, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Yes, thanks for that question. I'd say SmartRent was 1 of the first investments that was made by this consortium of companies that were started by the 3 REITs that are equal partners plus other owners of apartments aggregating -- I think we started w",482,"Yes. Yes, thanks for that question. I'd say SmartRent was 1 of the first investments that was made by this consortium of companies that were started by the 3 REITs that are equal partners plus other owners of apartments aggregating -- I think we started with 1 million owners of 1 million units of apartments. And now I think it's [ fund 2 ] is up to like 2 million units of apartments. So some pretty substantial ownership. And again, the original concept was to create technology improvements in the industry, operating improvements using technology and rolling them out through the portfolio of apartments that the ownership group together controlled. So that's worked out great. And it's interesting because SmartRent is 1 of the first investments that we made. And as you noted, the Wall Street Journal announced that smart rent is entered into an agreement with a sPac to merge for $2.2 billion, less about $500 million in working capital, which would value the company on a net basis of about $1.65 billion we believe. But there are many steps you noted to complete that process. sPacs have been pretty volatile in the recent past. And so there's no assurance that this is going to -- this will go through. But it seems like the sponsorship of the spec is pretty well aligned and very motivated for this to happen. So I feel, ultimately, pretty good about that. And so there will be some financial benefits. We were -- our ET ventures was an early investor seed round investor and then invested all the way through the B and C rounds of SmartRent, so it's a substantial owner. I don't want to get into all the details, but there will be pretty significant potential gain there. But I guess, maybe more fundamentally in terms of the impact. It goes back to the vision of of Ret ventures in the beginning, which is to try to bring technologies, better technology into these companies to improve efficiency and the way we interact with our customer. And SmartRent is an example of that, but there are many other investments. I think there are 12 additional investments in addition to smart rent that were made by fund I and we're on Fund II currently and we're utilizing a number of those. So I'll give you an example of one, which is a it's the customer relationship management function, and we're currently piloting, for example, and we've done several hundred leases in a product that essentially allows you to do the entire lease process from your smartphone and/or from a computer. So we are pretty far into the testing of that. We're also continuing our rollout of smart rent, which we think is a long-term benefit to both the company and the industry. And so from a technology perspective, we're very excited about what's happening recently."

I mean, what are your thoughts? And if you disagree, I guess, what's the big negative? Is it regulatory issues today? I mean, what's the negative?"

Let me hold that negative for a second here. And each of these crash and recovery periods is a little bit different. The thing that was unique about the Internet boom and then the bust period that followed was in Northern California, we had roughly 4",594,"Yes. Let me hold that negative for a second here. And each of these crash and recovery periods is a little bit different. The thing that was unique about the Internet boom and then the bust period that followed was in Northern California, we had roughly 40% growth in market rents. Before the bus. So you have this huge surge of market rents because these small tech companies, many of which didn't even have a product identified let alone revenue we're bringing people to the West Coast, and there were no -- we couldn't produce apartments fast enough to keep up with that demand, and [ we had ] spiked 40%. Well, we gave all of that back plus entomb in the ensuing few years after that period ended in the bust period. And I would never that period very well because we started pulling Northern California and buying Southern California, which Southern California had no discernible benefit from that Internet boom. And so assets appear to be really cheap in Southern California, really expensive in Northern California. So -- and then it took a long time for markets to recover from that period. I think that set back from the essentially, the lack of real businesses that went public was a dramatic setback. I think the IPO markets, it's 20 years later, and I think the IPO markets are only -- only started to recover a year or 2 ago from all of that. So it's taken a long time. 
Fast forward to today, it appears that this pandemic I'd say the response to it has been much different. The governmental response in terms of pumping money and liquidity into the markets and making sure that a pandemic doesn't morph into a credit or financial crisis. And so I give the governmental entities a lot of credit for that. So it feels like we're through the worst of this and we're coming out the other side, and there's a lot of money chasing deals and asset values are increasing. And so I'd say all of that's a good thing. I'd say maybe if there is a negative, it goes back to what do you do now with the new knowledge and with what you have? Basically, you're worse markets historically in terms of growth rates over the last 20 years and now your best markets. Does that continue on? Or what does it mean for your portfolio? And we all spend a lot of time on that. And Adam is in the middle of transacting around it. So but for us, I think that means that we sell some of our lesser properties, some of the properties that, for whatever reason, we think will underperform. Notably, last quarter, we sold Hidden Valley, which is a property that has 25% very low BMR units, which makes it very difficult to grow. The property is great. It's in a great location, but if you have 25% very low BMR units, the growth rate just can't keep up. So we sell that property, and then we will look for an ability to repurpose those funds into something that has a good long-term growth rate is in a better area. So that process is ongoing. And as noted, as Barb note, there's a little bit of FFO dilution in Q2 as a result of those transactions occurring before we reinvest those proceeds, there's a little bit of drag. And so I'd say that is perhaps a downside. I think however, the long-term benefits will be very apparent."

But keep in mind, concessions is really more of a function of the competitive supply and what the economy is doing. So it's not so much the lease duration itself. And so right now, our markets are only at approximately 50% of the open compared to the rest of the country, that is mostly reopened. And so that's more of a factor. And of course, in certain CBD locations like L.A. and Seattle, where there are still going to be continued supply pressure, we're going to see more because that will be in a more concessionary environment regardless of the lease term."

I would say that what happens is people make different choices when rents increase or decrease. And this goes back to kind of our theories as it relates to rent to income and other things. So when rents decline in the cities as much as they have, people come and fill those units now where do we exactly come from? I would suspect that a lot of them come from areas that are generally considered less good the canal people can move into the cities and because rents are pretty dramatically different than lower than they were before. So they were priced out previously and now that they can move in. And so that presumes that if you're in the markets, this theory -- port folio theory for a long time, if you're in the markets that have good schools, safety, quality of life, et cetera. Those will be the beneficiaries because people will move there as long as they can afford it. And then people that can't afford it will be pushed out to the very periphery of these markets. So -- and I know that this seems contra -- everything about what we're saying about Suburbia doing so well. But there are select really good suburban markets, the beach cities, for example, in Southern California or even Northern California that are doing really well that are still pretty high-quality areas. They're just farther from the market. So we're not necessarily talking about them. We're talking about cities that are less quality cities. And people moving out of those cities in order to move into a good location because you would have to say, well, how can you be 97% occupied almost with all those jobs lost. And the answer is people move based on a better value, rental value or a better life situation in the better quality assets. So -- and I think that's the key is we are not almost 97% occupied. And given that there's not that many vacant units within our portfolio. And as people come back, it's not going to take hundreds of thousands of jobs in order to get to the point where we're eliminating concessions and we have more pricing power. Because our base is strong. So that's in the practical world, how it works. So it's not just jobs. It's the consumer choice, given changes in rev levels. Makes sense?"

But you're also impacted by your surrounding properties and owners, et cetera. So there's obviously a big, I guess, you call it, storm coming in terms of the amount of people who have 6-plus months of back rent that is has to be paid back eventually. I have my doubts about that in California, but how do you guys see that playing out when that check needs to be written or the sort of the protections abate? And again, not really a big deal in your specific assets, but a lot of people, I'm sure, operators that you compete against have maybe a lot of that, I guess, do you guys think that's going to have a big impact on vacancy? Could that bring more people to the market for selling their assets? Any commentary there would be great."

And it's a complicated 1 because there's quite a few different moving pieces, right, because this involves legislation involves behavior and, of course, people's view about their jobs and prospects. And so -- but in terms of -- if you look at the first quarter delinquency, we actually published January and February, and that was about 2.6%. And so March came in significantly better to the point that allowed the first quarter average to be down -- that went down to 2.1%. So April pops back up to 2.7%, which is more of the normalized run rate. And that is why, while we don't obviously have the exact reason for the sudden improvement in Q1. That is why we can pretty safely point to March, which is when the stimulus was distributed. And so it's not a perfect science, but it's pretty darn good correlation from that perspective. And where we're at is we don't think it's going to deteriorate further. But at the same time, before looking at -- people are asking us, say, Q1 sequential to Q2 sequential gross revenue, where is that headed? You have to factor into the delinquency, which is a 2.1%, just going back to the more normalized level of 2.7%. That's 1 piece of it. And as far as the delinquency, Mike talked about SB 91, and we have a team that has really put forth a robust effort to work with our tenants and actively engaging with them to help them apply for this relief. And so while we are going through that, and we're seeing -- we're being able to -- we're able to help our tenants and with their eligibility. The question is the timing, when will we get the reimbursement from the government. And that is every city has a different time line. Every city has a different process and every city approaches the reimbursement differently. And so for us, our view is not so much that it's a huge [indiscernible] when. And so you back that into, well, what does that mean for guidance? That's going to be lumpy. It's going to be variable. And therefore, we just felt that it was prudent to give it a few more months and see what numbers come in. Does that make sense?"

Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A.

Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks; and Adam Berry, our Chief Investment Officer, is here for Q&A. I'll start today with our first quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year, including factors that lead us to believe that 2021 will be a year of recovery from the pandemic and then conclude with an overview of the transaction market. 
I am pleased to note that Essex was founded 50 years ago in 1971 by our Chairman, George Marcus, and we are very proud of all the company has accomplished. George remains keenly focused on the company's mission, strategy and business plan execution. I also want to recognize the extraordinary effort of the Essex team, which has allowed us to emerge from the pandemic in a position of strength and ready to seek opportunity that often comes from associated uncertainty. The Board and senior leadership team greatly appreciate this collaborative effort. Finally, the company's commitment to the balance sheet strength and a growing dividend was reaffirmed with our recent announcement of our 27th consecutive annual dividend increase. 
Turning to our first quarter results. Severe lockdowns in California and Washington remained a headwind in the quarter after intensifying last November amid a surge in COVID cases and hospitalizations that has only recently abated. Our very strong results in the first quarter of 2020 and a plethora of pandemic-related regulations and associated job loss were significant impediments to the company's performance this past year, as reflected in this quarter's results, with same-property revenues and core FFO down 8.1% and 11.8%, respectively, compared to a year ago. On a sequential basis, same-property revenues improved by 10 basis points, driven by growth in several suburban areas and particularly in San Diego, Orange and Ventura counties of Southern California. 
As noted in our earnings release, we reaffirmed our full year 2021 guidance ranges, and we continue to expect improvements in same-property revenue growth, driven by job growth and easier year-over-year comparisons. Apartment demand continues to be strongest in properties farthest from the urban centers and weakest in the cities, both being a function of new apartment supply and pandemic-related job losses. On a trailing 3-month basis as of March 2021, year-over-year job losses were 9.2% and 5.4%, respectively, for the Essex markets and the nation, marking significant progress compared to the 14% decline we saw in the Essex market shortly after the onset of the pandemic and also suggesting that our markets remain early in the recovery process. 
Fortunately, the recovery of jobs appears to be accelerating as reflected in preliminary job losses for the month of March 2021, which were down 7.9% for the Essex markets and 4.4% for the nation. On a sequential basis, California and Washington outpaced the nation in March, gaining nearly 150,000 jobs, representing over 16% of the U.S. job growth with less than 13% of the employment base. As we suggested several quarters ago, we expect rents to recover on the West Coast as we recapture pandemic-related job losses that were directly impacted by shelter-in-place orders, including hospitality and service sectors, entertainment and filming and video production and tech jobs that were displaced to remote locations. 
Hospitality and service jobs were disproportionately concentrated in the urban areas and wealthy suburbs. For the nation, jobs in hospitality and other services have recovered about 2/3 of their post COVID job losses. By comparison, to date, Essex metros have recovered less than 1/3 of these losses. Given the widespread recent reopening of California cities, these service sectors are again growing and their potential upside represents a promising differentiator for Essex markets over the next several quarters. 
Film and video production was disrupted, once again by the COVID shutdowns over the winter months, followed more recently by a surge in film permit applications. Overall, production activity remains below normal for this time of year. However, data released last week from FilmLA highlighted a 45% month-over-month increase in film permit applications for March, as the industry benefited from the recent relaxation of stay at home measures in Los Angeles County. We expect the rebound in production to continue this year due to pent-up demand for content that has been disrupted due to COVID-19. This recovery should provide a positive tailwind for the industry and for rental demand in the LA market. 
We are also pleased that many of the top tech companies have announced return to office plans supporting our belief that the hybrid model for offices will prevail with most employees spending a significant amount of time in the office for team building, collaboration, career advancement and related necessities. The largest tech employers in our markets had significantly reduced their hiring plans early in the pandemic, while also allowing many of their employees to work from home. With the cities largely shut down, many tech workers moved to suburban or rural locations or back home with their parents. This trend began to reverse late last year, and we expect to see further momentum in the coming quarters as more tech employers reopen their offices. 
As before, we track the announcements of the largest tech companies, and we have provided a time line of planned office reopenings based on public disclosures on Slide S-17.1 of our supplemental. We also provide a graph indicating the strong recovery in job postings for the top 10 tech companies with open positions in the Essex markets now above pre-COVID levels. We also track the job locations for open positions, noting that about 57% of their U.S. job postings was California or Washington as the office location. As of last week, California and Washington have dispensed at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to approximately 47% and 45% of their adult populations, respectively. 
Overall, accelerating vaccine deployment and pent-up demand for services gives us confidence that we are now on a solid path to recovery. California's counties have begun to remove restrictions on commerce. And Governor Newsom recently announced that California is expected to effectively reopen on June 15, including key indoor and outdoor activities such as conventions and sporting events. These plans are subject to several protective measures tied to continued low hospitalization rates and sufficient vaccine supplies. 
On the supply outlook, total housing permits, both single and multifamily, in our West Coast markets have declined 9.2% on a trailing 12-month basis compared to the national average increase of 6.4%. The national increase in permits is being driven by a 13.9% increase in single-family housing permits, mostly in markets with low barriers to entry and rising home prices. In California, the median price of a single-family home increased 12.4% year-over-year as of February. Normally, one would assume that higher home values would lead to increased production. 
However, single-family permits in the Essex markets are down 7.7%, which we attribute to a challenging regulatory environment and limited land availability, ultimately leading to fewer deliveries in late '22 and 2023. With large increases in for-sale housing prices, down payments have increased and the transition from a renter to homeownership has become more challenging. At the same time, the combination of lower rents from the pandemic and higher average incomes in the Essex markets has improved apartment rental affordability. We have seen these forces in previous recoveries, and they often result in periods of higher-than-average rent growth. 
Turning to the transaction market. We successfully sold 3 apartment communities in the first quarter for $275 million at values that were similar to the pre-COVID period when our consensus NAV was almost $300 per share. As a result, we use property sales proceeds to fund preferred equity investments and repurchase common stock, both accretive to per share core FFO and offsetting a portion of COVID-related NOI declines. The strong rebound in REIT valuations over the past 6 months makes stock buybacks less attractive today, and we are now looking for undervalued or mismanaged property in our core markets to grow externally. 
There were relatively few property sales during the pandemic, and most were completed by highly motivated buyers using 1031 exchange proceeds and other sources of attractively priced capital. Several of our suburban markets have rent levels that have increased on a year-over-year basis, and recent transactions have priced in the high 3% cap rate range. In the hard hit cities, buyers appear to be looking beyond the COVID impacts with apartments selling near a 4% cap rate using pre-COVID rents and NOI, roughly equivalent to a cap rate in the low 3% range based on current rents. 
Strong apartment values have led to a greater level of redemptions in our preferred equity portfolio, the impact of which Barb will discuss in a moment. As conditions normalize, we are starting to see more properties being listed for sale. The unprecedented changes and uncertainty experienced during the pandemic will likely lead to a robust apartment transaction market as property owners adjust their strategies going forward.  
I will now turn the call over to our COO, Angela Kleiman."

First, a special recognition to the Essex operating team for their continued focus on delivering solid results under these extraordinary conditions. Thank you for your efforts. As for my comments, I will focus the discussion on our first qua",803,"Thanks, Mike. First, a special recognition to the Essex operating team for their continued focus on delivering solid results under these extraordinary conditions. Thank you for your efforts. As for my comments, I will focus the discussion on our first quarter results and current market dynamics. In general, our markets continue to improve as the economy gradually reopens with the vaccine rollouts, easing of COVID restrictions and the recent announcements for a phased or partial office reopening by the major employers, which has contributed to job growth. 
Our goal amidst the pandemic was to focus on maintaining occupancy and managing scheduled rent, which will position us favorably for revenue growth in the future. Accordingly, we adjusted our concession strategy to match the improvements in demand, which has enabled our same-property revenues to perform slightly better than our expectations. We have been successful with this strategy. And as a result, we maintained occupancy with scheduled rents decline, representing only 3.2% of the 8.1% total revenue decline for the quarter. 
You may recall the underlying fundamentals in the first quarter of last year consisted of a strong economic backdrop prior to the COVID pandemic. In fact, our first quarter year-over-year same-property revenue growth back then was 3.2%, with revenue levels at historical highs throughout the entire portfolio. The strength of first quarter last year created a more difficult year-over-year comparable, which is also the reason why our new lease rates declined by 9.7% in the first quarter, as shown on the S-16, compared to the fourth quarter where the new lease rate declined by 8.9%. Consistent with the discussion on our last earnings call, the year-over-year decline in our major markets was primarily attributed to a combination of job losses from the pandemic, particularly impacting urban CBDs, which also had a greater concentration of supply deliveries. 
Here are a few key highlights of the first quarter year-over-year performance by markets. In Seattle, the 7% revenue decline was primarily driven by Seattle CBD, down 15.7%, whereas the remaining submarkets averaged a 5.2% decline. In Northern California, the 10.9% revenue decline was led by CBD, San Francisco and Oakland and San Mateo, averaging a 15.9% decline, contrasted with a 5% decline in Contra Costa County. In Southern California, the 5.8% revenue decline continues to be primarily driven by L.A. CBD and West L.A., which were down by an average of 13%, while our suburban Southern California submarkets of Ventura, Orange County and San Diego averaged a 2.1% decline. 
As you can see, our suburban portfolio continues to significantly outperform the urban markets. On the other hand, there are signs of improvement in our tech-centric urban markets. For example, first quarter sequential financial occupancies in San Francisco and Seattle CBD increased by 2.7% and 4.2%, respectively. In addition, the sequential quarterly turnover rates declined at an average of 5.4% in these markets. We continue to anticipate that the urban CBD markets, particularly in downtown Seattle, Oakland and L.A., will remain impacted by greater concentration of supply deliveries, resulting in elevated level of concessions, which will moderate the recovery. 
Although we typically do not place significant focus on sequential performance, because of the seasonality embedded in our business under normal market conditions, as we emerge from the pandemic, we view the sequential cost trend as a better indicator of our recovery progress. From this perspective, we have delivered 2 consecutive quarters of modest total same-property revenue growth, supported by comparable periods of job growth in our markets, which began in the fourth quarter of last year and has continued through the first quarter of this year. 
More notable is the 110 basis points in sequential improvement of our average net effective market rent per unit, with Southern California continue to lead our portfolio growth. On average, new lease concessions improved from low over 2 weeks in the fourth quarter to about 1.5 weeks in the first quarter. While the magnitude may vary, this trend is in line with our forecast, where we had expected that market rents in our portfolio, on average, would trough between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Lastly, although office rental market has softened, major tech employers are continuing to expand in our markets. 
Google recently procured the rights to build an additional 1.3 million square feet of space in Mountain View and Amazon in Bellevue began construction on a brand-new office tower as well as signing new lease and a development for an additional 600,000 square feet. With our economy approaching 50% reopening, we remain mindful of the market and legislative uncertainties as we continue on the path to recovery. In conclusion, our portfolio is stable with current same-store portfolio occupancy at 96.7%. Our availability 30-day out is at 4.4%. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak."
332646,710500245,2261478,"Essex Property Trust, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our first quarter results, followed by an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance r",630,"Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our first quarter results, followed by an update on our recent capital markets activities and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04 per share, of which $0.02 is from consolidated operations and the other $0.02 relate to the joint venture portfolio and lower interest expense. Of the $0.02 beat on operations, $0.01 relates to higher same-property revenues and the other $0.01 is from lower operating expenses, which is timing related. 
For the second quarter, we expect core FFO to be $2.92 at the midpoint, a $0.15 per share decline sequentially. Half of the decline is attributable to the loss of income on the early redemption of $110 million preferred equity investment, which occurred at the end of March and the $276 million of dispositions that closed at the end of February. There is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use of a portion of the proceeds. And as such, this is causing a $0.07 decline sequentially. 
In addition, we expect commercial income to be $0.02 lower as we had onetime benefits related to better delinquency collections in the first quarter that we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. The remaining decline relates to lower same-property NOI due to higher expected operating expenses and delinquency and higher G&A. For the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for same-property revenue, expense and NOI growth and core FFO per share. 
Turning to investments. During the quarter, we received $120 million for the redemption of 2 preferred equity investments. One of the investments totaling $110 million was redeemed early as the developer was able to sell the property for a price that exceeded our pre-COVID valuation. We estimate the cap rate at 3.6% on pre-COVID rents and 3.25% on current net effective rents. As a result of the early redemption, the company received $3.5 million in prepayment penalties or $0.05 per share, which compensates us for the lost income on the portion of the investment that was made in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, for FFO purposes, we book this income as a noncore item. Given the strong demand to invest in apartments and cheap financing alternatives currently available, we may experience additional early redemptions of preferred equity investments in 2021. 
Moving to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $450 million of unsecured bonds with a 7-year term at an effective yield of 1.8%. The proceeds were used to refinance most of our unsecured term loans that matured over the next 2 years, allowing us to extend our maturity profile with no impact to interest expense. We now have less than $200 million of debt maturing between now and the end of 2022. Since the beginning of 2020, we have refinanced nearly 30% of our debt, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and reducing our weighted average interest rate by 60 basis points to 3.2%. This is leading to a significant reduction in interest expense in 2021 and can be seen in the first quarter results via the $4 million reduction to interest expense compared to the prior year. 
During the quarter, we raised our common dividend by 60 basis points to $8.36 per share on an annual basis, our 27th consecutive dividend increase. This is a sign of our strong balance sheet and cash flow coverage despite the effects of the pandemic. With approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity and minimum near-term funding needs, our balance sheet remains strong, and we will remain disciplined as we look for ways to invest accretively to create shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions."

And 1 of the ways that we're looking at this now is take our portfolio and divide it into 3 categories: the large cities; let's say, the midsize cities; and suburban -- most suburban markets. And clearly, the most suburban markets have outperformed the cities and -- both on actually a year-over-year basis and on a sequential basis. For example, our best suburban market is Torrance, which sequentially is up 4.3%. And when you look into the midsized cities, we see improvement. I'd say, it's pretty clear that the improvement in our markets is starting in suburbia and moving towards the cities and unfortunately hasn't really benefited the cities to any great extent at this point in time. 
So best-performing clearly is all the suburban markets. And it doesn't matter whether they're suburban Seattle or suburban Los Angeles. And then the midsized cities are sort of second best in terms of recovery trajectory. And then the large cities are lagging pretty substantially. And again, large city hampered by supply, which is greater in the cities, along with these job levers, which improved pretty significantly for the -- the 3-month trailing average job growth was minus 9.2%. And March was minus 7.9%. So there was actually a lot of improvement in the quarter, but we need that to continue. We feel like California got a bit of a late start coming out of in this reopening process. And so maybe from that perspective, we're a step behind where we thought we were, but we're making up ground and things are looking better. Hope that makes sense."

Yes. Thanks for that question. I'd say SmartRent was 1 of the first investments that was made by this consortium of companies that were started by the 3 REITs that are equal partners plus other owners of apartments aggregating -- I think we started with 1 million -- owners of 1 million units of apartments. And now I think it's -- Fund II is up to like 2 million units of apartments. So some pretty substantial ownership. And again, the original concept was to create technology improvements in the industry, operating improvements using technology and rolling them out through the portfolio of apartments that the ownership group together controlled. So that's worked out great. And it's interesting because SmartRent is 1 of the first investments that we made. 
And as you noted, The Wall Street Journal announced that SmartRent has entered into an agreement with a SPAC to merge for $2.2 billion, less about $500 million in working capital, which would value the company on a net basis at about $1.65 billion we believe. But there are many steps you noted to complete that process. SPACs have been pretty volatile in the recent past. And so there's no assurance that this is going to -- this will go through. But it seems like the sponsorship of the SPAC is pretty well aligned and very motivated for this to happen. So I feel, ultimately, pretty good about that. 
And so there will be some financial benefits. We were -- RET Ventures was an early investor -- seed round investor and then invested all the way through the B and C rounds of SmartRent, so it's a substantial owner. I don't want to get into all the details, but there will be pretty significant potential gain there. But I guess, maybe more fundamentally in terms of the impact, it goes back to the vision of RET Ventures in the beginning, which is to try to bring technologies -- better technology into these companies to improve efficiency and the way we interact with our customer. And SmartRent is an example of that, but there are many other investments. 
I think there are 12 additional investments in addition to SmartRent that were made by Fund I and we're on Fund II currently, and we're utilizing a number of those. So I'll give you an example of one, which is a -- it's a -- the customer relationship management function. And we're currently piloting, for example, and we've done several hundred leases in a product that essentially allows you to do the entire lease process from your smartphone and/or from a computer. So we are pretty far into the testing of that. We're also continuing our rollout of SmartRent, which we think is a long-term benefit to both the company and the industry. And so from a technology perspective, we're very excited about what's happening recently."

Just listening to the comments on the call, and again, the sequential improvements you're seeing, Mike, it feels like from at least where I'm sitting compared to coming out of the tech crash, early 2000s, that there's a pretty good backdrop here. And I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I do remember, I don't know how long it took after the tech crash, but at a pretty nice boom. What are your thoughts? And if you disagree, I guess, what's the big negative regulatory issues today? I mean, what's the negative?"
332646,710500245,2261478,"Essex Property Trust, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Let me hold that negative for a second here. And each of these crash and recovery periods is a little bit different. The thing that was unique about the Internet boom and then the bust period that followed was in Northern California we had roughly 40",599,"Yes. Let me hold that negative for a second here. And each of these crash and recovery periods is a little bit different. The thing that was unique about the Internet boom and then the bust period that followed was in Northern California we had roughly 40% growth in market rents before the bust. So you had this huge surge of market rents because these small tech companies, many of which didn't even have a product identified, let alone revenue, were bringing people to the West Coast. And there were no -- we couldn't produce apartments fast enough to keep up with that demand, and we had spiked 40%. Well, we gave all of that back plus then some in the ensuing few years after that period ended in the bust period. And I remember that period very well because we started selling Northern California and buying Southern California, which Southern California had no discernible benefit from that Internet boom and so assets appeared to be really cheap in Southern California, really expensive in Northern California. 
So -- and then it took a long time for markets to recover from that period. I think that set back from the -- from -- essentially the lack of real businesses that went public was a dramatic setback. I think the IPO markets -- it's 20 years later, and I think the IPO markets are only started to recover a year or 2 ago from all of that. So it's taken a long time. Fast forward to today, it appears that this pandemic -- I'd say the response to it has been much different. The governmental response in terms of pumping money into -- and liquidity into the markets and making sure that a pandemic doesn't morph into a credit or financial crisis. And so I give the governmental entities a lot of credit for that. 
So it feels like we're through the worst of this and we're coming out the other side, and there's a lot of money chasing deals and asset values are increasing. And so I'd say all of that's a good thing. I'd say maybe if there is a negative, it goes back to what do you do now with the new knowledge and with what you have? Basically you're worse markets historically in terms of growth rates over the last 20 years and now you're best markets. Does that continue on? Or what does it mean for your portfolio? And we all spend a lot of time on that. And Adam is in the middle of transacting around it. So -- but for us, I think that means that we sell some of our lesser properties, some of the properties that, for whatever reason, we think will underperform. 
Notably, last quarter, we sold Hidden Valley, which is a property that has 25% very low BMR units, which makes it very difficult to grow. The property is great. It's in a great location, but if you have 25% very low BMR units, the growth rate just can't keep up. So we sell that property, and then we will look for an ability to repurpose those funds into something that has a good long-term growth rate, is in a better area. So that process is ongoing. And as noted -- as Barb noted, there's a little bit of FFO dilution in Q2 as a result of those transactions occurring before we reinvest those proceeds. There's a little bit of drag. And so I'd say that is perhaps a downside, I think. However, the long-term benefits will be very apparent."

As we go through our renewals and releases and heading into the peak leasing season, what we're seeing is a more normalized behavior relative to pre-COVID. So when I look at numbers like our turns and applications and so that does not lead us to think that concessions itself will be significantly challenging. But keep in mind, concessions is really more of a function of the competitive supply and what the economy is doing. So it's not so much the lease duration itself. And so right now, our markets are only at approximately 50% of the open compared to the rest of the country that is mostly reopened. And so that's more of a factor. And of course, in certain CBD locations like the L.A. and Seattle, where there are still going to be continued supply pressure, we're going to see more because that will be in a more concessionary environment regardless of the lease term."

So I'm trying to figure out, is it really driven by one-timers that you included in your bridge, that's making you a little bit more conservative?

That remains a big question mark in terms of what its impact is going to be going forward. And we have no way to -- no historical precedent or even way to anticipate that. 
So I think that we've always been a little bit conservative and wait to see what happens and let the events occur and then report them as opposed to trying to build them into our guidance.

And with respect to delinquencies, specifically, I think it's just hard to predict what's going to happen, not that we think anything bad is going to happen.

I would say that what happens is people make different choices when rents increase or decrease. And this goes back to kind of our theories as it relates to rent to income and other things. So when rents decline in the cities as much as they have, people come and fill those units. Now where does it exactly come from? I would suspect that a lot of them come from areas that are generally considered less good. I think now people can move into the cities and because rents are pretty dramatically different than -- lower than they were before. So they were priced out previously and now that they can move in. 
And so that presumes that if you're in the markets, this is our theory -- portfolio theory for a long time. If you're in the markets that have good schools, safety, quality of life, et cetera, those will be the beneficiaries because people will move there as long as they can afford it. And then people that can't afford it will be pushed out to the very periphery of these markets. So -- and I know that this seems contra -- everything about what we're saying about suburbia doing so well. But there are select really good suburban markets, the beach cities, for example, in Southern California or even Northern California that are doing really well that are still pretty high-quality areas. 
They're just farther from the market. So we're not necessarily talking about them. We're talking about cities that are less quality cities. And people moving out of those cities in order to move into a good location because you would have to say, well, how can you be 97% occupied almost with all those jobs lost? And the answer is people move based on a better value -- rental value or a better life situation in the better quality assets. So -- and I think that's the key is we are not almost 97% occupied. And given that there's not that many vacant units within our portfolio and as people come back, it's not going to take hundreds of thousands of jobs in order to get to the point where we're eliminating concessions and we have more pricing power, because our base is strong. So that's, in the practical world, how it works. So it's not just jobs. It's the consumer choice, given changes in rev levels. Makes sense?"

But you're also impacted by your surrounding properties and owners, et cetera. So there's obviously a big, I guess, you call it, storm coming in terms of the amount of people who have 6-plus months of back rent that ""has to be paid back eventually."" 
I have my doubts about that in California, but how do you guys see that playing out when that check needs to be written or the sort of the protection abate? And again, not really a big deal in your specific assets, but a lot of people, I'm sure, operators that you compete against have maybe a lot of that. I guess, do you guys think that's going to have a big impact on vacancy? Could that bring more people to the market for selling their assets? Any commentary there would be great."

And it's a complicated 1 because there's quite a few different moving pieces, right, because this involves legislation, involves behavior and, of course, people's view about their jobs and prospects. And so -- but in terms of -- if you look at the first quarter delinquency, we actually published January and February, and that was about 2.6%. And so March came in significantly better to the point that allowed the first quarter average to be down -- that went down to 2.1%. So April pops back up to 2.7%, which is more of the normalized run rate. And that is why -- while we don't obviously have the exact reason for the sudden improvement in Q1, that is why we can pretty safely point to March, which is when the stimulus was distributed. 
And so it's not a perfect science, but it's pretty darn good correlation from that perspective. And where we're at is we don't think it's going to deteriorate further. But at the same time, before looking at -- people are asking us, say, Q1 sequential to Q2 sequential gross revenue is where is that headed. You have to factor into the delinquency, which is a 2.1%, just going back to the more normalized level of 2.7%. So that's 1 piece of it. And as far as the delinquency, Mike talked about SB 91, and we have a team that has really put forth a robust effort to work with our tenants and actively engaging with them to help them apply for this relief. 
And so while we are going through that and we're seeing -- we're being able to -- we're able to help our tenants and with their eligibility, the question is the timing, when will we get the reimbursement from the government? And that is -- every city has a different time line. Every city has a different process, and every city approaches the reimbursement differently. And so for us, our view is not so much that it's a huge [Technical Difficulty] is when. And so you back that into, well, what does that mean for guidance? That's going to be lumpy. It's going to be variable. And therefore, we just felt that it was prudent to give it a few more months and see what numbers come in. Does that make sense?"

Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A.

Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. 
On today's call, I'll start with our second quarter results, which were driven by a strengthening economy and positive fundamentals that underlie a robust recovery on the West Coast. I'll also discuss the status of reopening the West Coast economies and related factors, concluding with an overview of the West Coast apartment transaction markets and investments. 
Our second quarter results were ahead of our initial expectations entering the year as the economic recovery from the pandemic occurred faster than we expected. With a strong economy and high vaccination rates, we are now confident that the worst of the pandemic-related impacts are behind us. As noted on previous calls, our strategy during the pandemic was to maintain high occupancy and scheduled rent, both necessary for a rapid recovery. To that end, active rents surged during the second quarter, along with year-over-year improvement in occupancy, other income and delinquency. The recovery in net effective rents continued unabated in July, and we are now pleased to announce that July net effective rents for the Essex portfolio have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels with our suburban markets leading the way, while the downtowns are improving but still generally below pre-pandemic levels. Obviously, these higher rents will be converted into revenue as leases turn, and Angela will provide additional details in a moment. 
Having past the midpoint of 2021 and looking forward, we made a second set of positive revisions to our West Coast market forecast, which can be found on Page S-17 of the supplemental. Driving the changes is an increase in 2021 GDP and job growth estimates to 7% and 5%, up from 4.3% and 3.2%, respectively, from our initial forecast. As a result, we now expect our average 2021 net effective rent growth to improve to minus 0.9% and from minus 1.9% from the beginning of the year. To put this into perspective, consider that our net effective rents were down about 9% year-over-year in Q1 2021. Given our current expectation of minus 0.9% rent growth for the year, year-over-year net effective market rents are now forecasted to increase about 6% in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
Cash delinquencies were up modestly on a sequential basis at 2.6% of scheduled rent for the quarter and well above our 30-year average delinquency rate of 30 to 40 basis points. The American Rescue Plan of 2021 provides funding for emergency rental assistance, which was allocated to the states for distribution to [indiscernible] pandemic-related delinquencies. During the second quarter, collections of delinquent rents from the American Rescue Plan were negligible as the pace of processing reimbursements has been slow since the program launched in March. We expect that to improve in the coming months. We expect delinquency rates to return to normal levels over time as more workers enter the workforce and eviction protections laps on September 30 in both California and Washington. At this point, only about $7 million of the $55 million in delinquent rent shown on Page S-16 of the supplemental has been recorded as revenue. Given uncertainty about the timing of collections, no additional revenues are contemplated in our financial guidance. 
Even with the approved job and economic outlook,  the reopening process was gradual through the second quarter with full reopening declared in mid and late June for California and Washington, respectively. The unemployment rate was still 6.5% in the Essex markets as of May 2021, underperforming the nation. Through Q2, we have regained about half of the jobs lost in the early months of the pandemic. Employment in the Essex markets dropped over 15% in April 2020, and while job growth in our markets outpaced the nation in the second quarter, we are still 7.9% below pre-pandemic employment compared to 4.4% for the U.S. overall.  We see the gap as an opportunity for growth to continue in the coming months as we benefit from the full reopening of the West Coast economies. We believe that many workers that exited the primary employment centers during pandemic-related shutdowns and work-from-home programs will return as businesses reopen and resume expansion that was placed on hold during the pandemic. 
As we proceed through the summer months, we edged closer to the targeted office reopening date set by most large tech employers in early September. As recent reports about Apple and Google suggest, the COVID-19 Delta variant could lead to temporary delays in this reopening process. Our survey of job openings in the Essex markets for the largest tech companies continues to be very strong as we report 33,000 job openings as of July, a 99% increase over last year's trough. New venture capital investment has set a record pace this year with Essex markets once again leading with respect to funds invested, providing growth capital that supports future jobs. Generally, economic sectors that fell the furthest during the pandemic are now positioned for the strongest recovery in the reopening process led by restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues, travel and filming.  Return-to-office plans, which remain focused on hybrid approaches will continue to draw employees closer to corporate offices. Given that many workers won't be required to be in the office on a full-time basis, we expect average commute distances to increase. 
As we highlight on Page F 17.1 of our supplemental,  this transition has already started in recent months, as our hardest hit markets in the Bay Area once again experienced net positive migration from beyond the NORCAL region. In particular, since the end of Q1, the submarkets surrounding San Francisco Bay have seen positive net migration that represents 18% of total move-outs over the trailing 3 months compared to minus 8% a year ago. These inflows are led by residents returning from adjacent metros such as Sacramento and the Monterey Peninsula as well as renewed flow of recent graduates arriving from college towns across the country, a notable positive turnaround from last year. In Seattle CBD, we've seen similar or even stronger recent inflows and we're likewise experiencing a strong market rent recovery. 
On the supply outlook, we provided our semiannual update to our 2021 forecast on S-17 of the supplemental with slight increases to 2021 supply as COVID-related construction delays shifted incremental units from late 2020 into 2021. We expect modestly fewer apartment deliveries in the second half of 2021, with more significant declines in Los Angeles and Oakland. While it is still too early to quantify, recent volatility in lumber prices and shortages for building materials may impact construction starts and the timing of deliveries in subsequent years. Multifamily permitting activity in Essex markets also continues to trend favorably, declining 200 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis as of May 2021 compared to the national average, which grew 230 basis points. Median single-family home prices in Essex markets continued upward in California and Seattle grew 18% and 21%, respectively, on a trailing 3-month basis. The escalating cost of homeownership combined with greater rental affordability from the pandemic have increased the financial incentive to rent. We suspect these trends will continue, given muted single-family supply and limited permitting activity, and believe these factors will be a key differentiator for our markets in the coming years compared to many U.S. markets with greater housing supply. 
Turning to apartment transactions. Activity has steadily accelerated since the start of the year with the majority of apartment trades occurring in the low to mid-3% cap rate range based on current rents.  Generally, investors anticipate a robust rent recovery, especially in markets where current rents are substantially below pre-pandemic levels. With the recent improvement in our cost of capital, we have turned our focus once again to acquisitions and development while remaining disciplined with respect to FFO accretion targets. With respect to our preferred equity program, we continue to see new deals, although the market is becoming more competitive.  Lower cap rates from pre-pandemic levels have produced higher-than-anticipated market valuations, which in turn has resulted in higher levels of early redemption. That concludes my comments. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our COO, Angela Kleiman."

My comments today will focus on our second quarter results and current market dynamics. With the reopening of the West Coast economy, the recovery has generated improvements in demand and thus pricing power. Our operating strategy during COVID to favor occupancy while adjusting concessions to maintain schedule rents enabled us to optimize rent growth concurrent with the increase in demand, resulting in same-store net effective rent growth of 8.3% since January 1, and most of this growth occurred in the second quarter. A key contributor of this accomplishment is the fantastic job by our operations team in responding quickly to this dynamic market environment. While market conditions have improved rapidly during our second quarter -- driving our second quarter results to exceed expectations. I would like to provide some context for why sequential same-property revenues declined by 90 basis points compared to the first quarter. The two major factors that drove this decline were 50 basis points in delinquency and 50 basis points in concessions. Delinquency in the first quarter was temporarily lifted by the onetime unemployment disbursements from the stimulus funds as expected in the second quarter. Delinquency reverted back to 2.6% of scheduled rents versus the 2.1% in the first quarter. On concessions, the nominal amount increased from higher volume of leases in the second quarter relative to the first quarter of this year. To be clear, concessions in our markets have declined substantially and are virtually nonexistent except for select CBD markets. Our average concession for the stabilized portfolio is under 1 week in the second quarter compared to over a week in the first quarter and over 2 weeks in the fourth quarter. Although concessions have generally improved in the second quarter, they remain elevated, ranging from 2.5 to 3 weeks in certain CBDs such as CBD L.A, San Jose and Oakland. 
Given the extraordinary pandemic-related volatility in rents and concessions over the past 1.5 years, I thought it would be insightful to provide an overview of the change in net effective rents compared to pre-COVID levels. As of this June, our same-store average net effective rent compared to March of last year was down by 3.1%. Since then, we have seen continued strength, and based on preliminary July results, our average net effective rents are now 1.5% above pre-COVID levels. It is notable that this 1.5% portfolio average diverged regionally, with both Seattle and Southern California up 5.8% and 9.3%, respectively, while Northern California has yet to fully recover with net effective rents currently at 8% below pre-COVID levels. On a sequential basis, net effective rents on new leases have improved rapidly throughout the second quarter and preliminary July rents increased 4.7% compared to the month of June, led by CBD San Francisco and CBD Seattle, both up about 11%. Not surprisingly, these 2 markets were hit hardest during the pandemic and are now experiencing the most rent growth. 
Moving on to office development activities, which we view as an indicator of future job growth and accordingly, housing demand. In general, the areas along the West Coast was the greatest amount of office development have been San Jose and Seattle. Currently, San Jose has 8.1% of total office stock under construction, and similarly, Seattle has 7% of office stock under construction. Notable activities include Apple leasing an additional 700,000 square feet, and LinkedIn announced recent plans to upgrade their existing office in Sunnyvale. In the Seattle region, Facebook expanded their Bellevue footprint by 330,000 square feet and Amazon announced 1,400 new web services jobs in Redland. We expect in the long term, areas with higher office deliveries such as San Jose and Seattle will have capacity for greater apartment supply without impacting rental rates. While these normal relationships were disrupted during the pandemic, we anticipate conditions to normalize in the coming quarters. 
Lastly, as the economic recovery continues to gain momentum, we have restarted both our apartment renovation programs and technology initiatives, including actively enhancing the functionality of our mobile leasing platform and SmartRent home automation. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak."

I'll start with a few comments on our second quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on our investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the second quarter exceeded the m",621,"Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our second quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on our investments and the balance sheet. 
I'm pleased to report core FFO for the second quarter exceeded the midpoint of the revised range we provided during the NAREIT conference by $0.08 per share. The favorable results are primarily attributable to stronger same-property revenues, higher commercial income and lower operating expenses. Of the $0.08, $0.03 relates to the timing of operating expenses and G&A spend, which is now forecasted to occur in the second half of the year. 
As Angela discussed, we are seeing stronger rent growth in our markets than we expected just a few months ago. As such, we are raising the full year midpoint of our same-property revenue growth by 50 basis points to minus 1.4%. It should be noted this was the high end of the revised range we provided in June. In addition, we have lowered our operating expense growth by 25 basis points at the midpoint due to lower taxes in the Seattle portfolio. All of this results in an improvement in same property NOI growth by 80 basis points at the midpoint to minus 3%. Year-to-date, we have revised our same-property revenue growth at the midpoint, up 110 basis points and NOI by 160 basis points. 
As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.09 per share to $12.33. This reflects the stronger operating results, partially offset by the impact of the early redemption of preferred equity investments, which I will discuss in a minute. Year-to-date, we have raised core FFO by $0.17 or 1.4%. 
Turning to the investment market. As we've discussed on previous calls, strong demand for West Coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing has led to sales and recapitalizations of several properties underlying our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments, resulting in several early redemptions. During the quarter, we received $36 million from an early redemption of a subordinated loan, which included $4.7 million in prepayment fees, which have been excluded from core FFO. Year-to-date, we have been redeemed on approximately $150 million of investments and expect that number could grow to approximately $250 million by year-end. This is significantly above the high end of the range we provided at the start of the year. However, this speaks to the high valuation apartment properties are commanding today, which is good for Essex and the net asset value of the company. As for new preferred equity investments, we have a healthy pipeline of accretive deals, and we are still on track to achieve our original guidance of $100 million to $150 million in the second half of the year. As a reminder, our original guidance assume new investments would match redemptions during the year. However, the timing mismatch between the higher level of early reductions coupled with funding of new investments expected later this year has led to an approximate $0.10 per share drag on our FFO for the year. 
Moving to the balance sheet. We remain in a strong financial position due to refinancing over 1/3 of our debt over the past 1.5 years, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to reduce our weighted average rate by 70 basis points to 3.1% and lengthening our maturity profile by an additional 2 years. We currently have only 7% of our debt maturing through the end of 2023. Given our broader maturity schedule, limited near-term funding needs and ample liquidity, we are in a strong position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. 
This concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

But I think we feel really very good about what's happening here. I noted in my comments that we're fully recovered with respect to market rents versus pre-pandemic levels, while only recovered about half the job so far. So that I think that's a powerful place to start. And as we look around the West Coast, we feel great about what's happening. And we expect good times to continue, consumer is super optimistic. They've saved money via COVID versus COVID by not traveling and a variety of other things, the millennials forming households. And there's a lot of hiring here on the West Coast. So that's why we talk about the top 10 tech companies and how many open positions they have. They come a long way in the past year. After what we perceive as them pulling back mid-COVID on their expansion plans, I think that they're now turning that corner or have turned that corner, hiring more people, pursuing things that they put on hold a year ago. And so everything feels like it's in good order at this point in time. As you go to the cities, the main driver of job growth at this point in time has been the recovery of all the industries that have been so dramatically affected a year ago, including the leisure, hospitality, restaurants, filming in Southern California, et cetera. And as we look at the world, we're looking at whether we believe these industries are poised for future growth. And we think absolutely they are. We think that we're in affluent areas, affluent areas demand services, you're starting to see those services come back in terms of restaurants and nicely. And again, I wouldn't have expected to be fully back with respect to rents at a time when we've only recovered about half of the jobs that we lost. Makes sense?"

Is it sort of reasonable to think that 2022 will be the mirror image of that. And then maybe we may be even continue to push rents above a normal trend over the medium term?"

So -- and you know how we are. We tend to be pretty careful in terms of guidance. And so we don't want to go too far out there. But I would say that I would expect certainly the return to office to be a good thing for the downtown locations because most of the top 10 tech companies or most of the tech companies in general have announced a hybrid type of approach, which means that people are going to have to be closer to the offices to show up, let's say, plus or minus 3x per week. As a result of that, the people that move to the hinterlands, the most suburban parts of our portfolio probably are going to need to come back. And I think about Ventura, I don't want to pick on Ventura because it's done great. But it's a long way on a commute pattern from Ventura into where the jobs are in L.A. And I don't think people are even going to want to do that three times a week. So I think that kind of frames the dynamics. Those that had a year given the pandemic to make a different choice about where to live, I think, will likely make a different choice going forward now that there's more clarity about what the companies are going to do with respect to their work from home or return to office programs."

The rest of it is going to be in 2022. So there's an inherent lagging concept with respect to what's going on with market rents, which Adam just talked about versus how it shows up on the income statement. So I think that's important. In terms of just looking at market rents, we tried to provide a little bit of color on that. And with respect to S-17, is what we're trying to get at that, overall, our our economic rent growth on S-17 is at minus 0.9%. And that's 1/12 of everyone throughout the year. So January 2021 versus January 2020, plus February through the year divided by 12 is what that number represents. So we started the year at -- in the minus 9% to minus 10% range. And that implies to get to 0.9% on S-17 that the fourth quarter will be plus 6%. And that does not anticipate a lot of rent growth between now and then, which is pretty typical. We typically hit the peak of market rents in July at the end of the peak leasing season, and then it flattens out for the rest of the year. So that's what's assumed in those numbers."

So kind of peaking in July and not a lot of growth for the rest of the year. If -- as we think about it, however, there are some things that are different. For example, will the tech companies continue hiring? Normally, what happens is hiring tails off at the end of the year. Companies get business plans at the -- towards the third and fourth quarter, and then they start implementing them in the first quarter. That's what really drives the peak leasing season. So the question here is, will companies continue hiring at a higher level given COVID than they have in the past. I think there's a very good chance that, that could happen. I also -- this work from home and return to office concept could have an impact on that as well if more people are moving back into the more urban areas from people that were displaced as California and Washington were shutting down a year ago. If those people continue to come back later this year, that could possibly push rents higher in the second part of the year. So we've -- again, assumed based on our experience and what typically happens the normal curve with respect to rents, but there are some things that are different here.

And they're really coming from Sacramento and some of the outerlying areas within California, but we're also noticing people moving in from college towns. So people college grads are coming here for jobs and it's really geographically dispersed. I mean there's no discernible pattern from where they're coming from. It's kind of all over. And we do think that it does speak to the strength of our market and people coming back and returning after the services have reopened and the economy has reopened. Now we're seeing the people return. And so we think it's a good sign and a good leading indicator. You should note that this Seattle in our portfolio looks similar as well. We're seeing a big in-migration in Seattle as well. So we didn't show it here, but the Bay Area and Seattle both have a similar chart where there's a big influx. And I think you're seeing it in the rent growth that Angela spoke to and San Fran being up 11% in the CBD and NORCAL and some of the other suburban markets in NorCal having bigger sequential rent growth more recently is partly due to this in-immigration."

And I would say the broader comment is that the migration out of the West Coast, our view was largely driven by businesses being shut down and putting people in the position of not having a paycheck and effectively forcing them to move to somewhere else. And I know that the sort of it doesn't fit the narrative. The narrative is that all these people wanted to leave California. I think the reality is completely different from that. And therefore, I go back to my basic comment, which is, do we feel comfortable with the businesses that are here and with job growth going forward? And when you look at the components of that, okay, the hotels are now mostly open here on the West Coast. The restaurants are opening and -- but we were still at 50% of capacity a month or 2 ago. So we opened completely on June 15. But that process has been relatively slow. And I think that's why job growth has lagged the U.S. as we've come out of the pandemic. And -- but I guess, the key point here is most of the migration that occurred was not voluntary migration. It was caused by shutting down businesses. And then if you look at the flip side of that, are those businesses likely to reopen given COVID is mostly behind us, and we feel 100% absolutely convinced that, that will occur. And so when we look -- we have some more broader information on migration in general. And a lot of the same things that we talked about a year or 2 ago are still in place. The inflows into our markets tend to be the high-cost East Coast metros. And the outflows tend to be into lower-cost Western areas. So those trends really haven't changed all that much. But Barb, this S-17.1 is trying to address specifically the cadence of what's coming in and what's going out. And to your point, yes, everything -- of course, everything is in there. out here to try to push a narrative that is not reality because if we do that, we're just going to shoot ourselves in the foot. So there's no evidence, I think, of Essex trying to be overly optimistic. And so we're trying to communicate what's really happening out there and what we're really seeing. So I guess that was..."

And do you see now as a particularly interesting time to be investing in your markets for all the reasons you just described, but also particularly special because of what's happened outside of California and Washington and what you think might come back, and that there will be sort of a narrowing of the performance gap over the next several years?"

And our Board is pretty focused on this geographic diversity issue and some of the challenges that we've had more recently with respect to regulation and other things. But we don't want to get too far away from sort of this longer-term pattern because we -- it isn't like we're going to grow every year the same, conditions change, but we remain focused in our analysis on which areas have the highest CAGRs of rent growth over time. And it may surprise you because you can say the West Coast has dropped off of that. More recently, yes, but if you look back let's say, 15 years because I had these numbers right out of our strategic plan in front of us. Seattle led all the major markets with a 5.6% 15-year rent growth CAGR from 2004 to 2019, so to the pre-COVID level. And Northern California was pretty close to that. And we start going down the list. And certainly, Boston and Miami are pretty attractive in that respect, as is Northern New Jersey. But then there are a lot of markets that really have fallen well below that. And so our whole thesis here has been, let's try to identify the things that promote long-term rent growth and let's invest in those markets. And we can -- as you know, we've looked at some things on the East Coast before, and we'll continue doing that. But I guess as we think about things, let me just make a simple comparison. Let's compare San Jose with Austin. And there are cities of about the same size, same population. Austin has about 28,000 multifamily units in construction, whereas San Jose has about 8,000. We also don't produce very much housing or for sale housing in San Jose and the median price is well over $1 million. So as an apartment owner, we look at that and say,  are we better off being in San Jose or in Austin? And we conclude that it's better to be in San Jose. I mean, Austin has to get extraordinary amounts of growth over and above San Jose, which, of course, is driven by the tech companies, which are doing really well, and they hire a lot of people. So I guess I would say the bloom is not off the West Coast. Yes, we grew really fast from 2011 through 2016 when -- by the way, we had job growth in the 4% to 5% range on the West Coast. And then it slowed down because of affordability issues, because you can't have rents grow twice as fast as incomes over long periods of time without creating affordability issues. So there is a long-term approach to the business. And I think that making vast portfolio decisions based on -- with all the unique circumstances in COVID would be misguided."

And I guess my question on that part is, are you -- have you thought about the Delta variant, how it's spreading a lot quicker. I think I've just seen some studies that say like vaccinated people can also get it as well, like as easily as unvaccinated. And the market that you're in are most likely to reshut down and reimplement restrictions if cases rise, hospitalizations rise, et cetera. So given that that's likely to happen as the fall comes, what kind of weighting do you kind of give to that notion of a potential hiccup from reimposed restrictions?"

And I guess I would say, unfortunately, we have no way to really figure out what COVID might do going forward. And -- but we're definitely aware of the risk. One thing that I think is a little bit different in California. Clearly, we've got population densities that are pretty high. And so the risk of COVID is perhaps greater given that. And I think the government actually has done a very good job here of trying to promote vaccination rates in the Essex markets. And I think our vaccination rates are pretty high relative to the rest of the world. So the information I have is that the people with at least 1 shot and are 12 years and older were in California, Washington about 82% vaccinated versus 67% for [indiscernible] the U.S. So I think that what's happened here is we've tried to [indiscernible] risk by really pushing the vaccination rate. And they've done a very good job of areas with high population density have a different COVID risk than some of the other areas. And in this case, I think it's been dealt with effectively."

We created that index so that we could keep our eye on where are the open positions for the top 10 tech companies? Are they moving more to some of these other locations? And if so, what do we do about it? So I didn't mean to imply actually that we're so focused on 15-year CAGRs of rent growth. So definitely, the historical information is important, but we're trying to supplement that in 100 different ways with a ton of data sources that are either confirming or raising questions about what the future looks like. That's why Angela is talking about how much office construction. If you're going to build office buildings, presumably there are going to be employees in there, and we're going to need to build apartments to house those employees. I mean these are all indicators of what's happening in the future, keeping our eye on the top 10 tech companies and they're hiring trends, again, both within in California and outside of California, super important in that regard. Again, I go back to the industries. What are the driving industries? What are the industries that sort of drive the entire machine? We can -- it's certainly not the hospitality and the restaurant workers that are driving it, they are really the result of affluent, wealthy areas demand services, and guess what, they pay a lot more than in other places of the country because of that. And so -- I think what's happening here is we're in the process of all those people that were displaced from shutting down restaurants and other services, we're going to need to draw them back into the area. But I think that given the demand for those services and given the wealth that has been created here by the tech community, by motion pictures in Southern California and other people that want to live near a beach, let's say, those services are in demand, and they're going to come back, and it will take a little bit of time perhaps to do that. But again, we're trying to say, okay, let's stay focused on what are the drivers of the economy here. And again, as I look at it, and hopefully, everyone will agree, tech is not going away or hasn't gone away. Certainly, all the information that we've given out with respect to the tech companies over time, confirms the thesis that they're here, they're not going away. They continue to invest in our markets. Motion pictures in Southern California, you can't shoot films where you require 50 to 100 people on a set during COVID, completely shut down. Demand for content, not going away anytime soon. Therefore, there's a very good chance that, that is going to resume. And I can -- could go on beyond that. But I think that, that sets the point, if the drivers are intact, the things that follow, the demand for services, restaurants, et cetera, will follow. And the thesis of the company in terms of job growth remains intact. And then if you don't produce enough housing supply, I would view that as a good thing."

But I would say what's happened here is -- and we had callers on previous calls that have said, hey, with negative job growth, how are you able to maintain high levels of occupancy in the cities. And obviously, a great question. And the answer to that was, of course, that we drew people because the price point was lower. We drew people from other places into some of the better locations. So they improved their location given lower rents. And so now you look at this equation that we're 96% occupied, people are starting to come back, and there's no availability and therefore, market rents are doing what they're doing. So I think a lot of this is really driven by our strategy during the pandemic. And now it will be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years because with market rents now back to where they were pre-pandemic level, what is the movement within the portfolio both in and out of those locations that have much higher rents. So in the case of San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland, they're still substantially below the prior rent. So there's still reason to believe that those -- the people that moved in given lower rents will stay, but that may uncouple over the next several years."

Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A.
On today's call, I'll start with our second quarter results, which were driven by a strengthening economy and positive fundamentals that underlie a robust recovery on the West Coast. I'll also discuss the status of reopening the West Coast economies and related factors, concluding with an overview of the West Coast apartment transaction markets and investments.
Our second quarter results were ahead of our initial expectations entering the year as the economic recovery from the pandemic occurred faster than we expected. With a strong economy and high vaccination rates, we are now confident that the worst of the pandemic-related impacts are behind us. As noted on previous calls, our strategy during the pandemic was to maintain high occupancy and scheduled rent, both necessary for a rapid recovery. To that end, net effective rents surged during the second quarter, along with year-over-year improvement in occupancy, other income and delinquency. The recovery in net effective rents continued unabated in July. And we are now pleased to announce that July net effective rents for the Essex portfolio have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels, with our suburban markets leading the way, while the downtowns are improving but still generally below pre-pandemic levels. Obviously, these higher rents will be converted into revenue as leases turn. And Angela will provide additional details in a moment.
Having past the midpoint of 2021 and looking forward, we made a second set of positive revisions to our West Coast market forecasts, which can be found on Page S-17 of the supplemental. Driving the changes is an increase in 2021 GDP and job growth estimates to 7% and 5%, up from 4.3% and 3.2%, respectively, from our initial forecasts. As a result, we now expect our average 2021 net effective rent growth to improve to minus 0.9% from minus 1.9% from the beginning of the year. To put this into perspective, consider that our net effective rents were down about 9% year-over-year in Q1 2021. Given our current expectation of minus 0.9% rent growth for the year, year-over-year net effective market rents are now forecasted to increase about 6% in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Cash delinquencies were up modestly on a sequential basis at 2.6% of scheduled rent for the quarter and well above our 30-year average delinquency rate of 30 to 40 basis points. The American Rescue Plan of 2021 provides funding for emergency rental assistance, which was allocated to the states for distribution to renters for pandemic-related delinquencies. During the second quarter, collections of delinquent rents from the American Rescue Plan were negligible, as the pace of processing reimbursements has been slow since the program launched in March. We expect that to improve in the coming months. We expect delinquency rates to return to normal levels over time as more workers enter the workforce and eviction protections lapse on September 30 in both California and Washington. At this point, only about $7 million of the $55 million in delinquent rents shown on Page S-16 of the supplemental has been recorded as revenue. Given uncertainty about the timing of collections, no additional revenues are contemplated in our financial guidance.
Even with the approved job and economic outlook, the reopening process was gradual through the second quarter, with full reopening declared in mid- and late June for California and Washington, respectively. The unemployment rate was still 6.5% in the Essex markets as of May 2021, underperforming the nation. Through Q2, we have regained about half of the jobs lost in the early months of the pandemic. Employment in the Essex markets dropped over 15% in April 2020, and while job growth in our markets outpaced the nation in the second quarter, we are still 7.9% below pre-pandemic employment compared to 4.4% for the U.S. overall. We see the gap as an opportunity for growth to continue in the coming months as we benefit from the full reopening of the West Coast economies. We believe that many workers that exited the primary employment centers during pandemic-related shutdowns and work-from-home programs will return as businesses reopen and resume expansion that was placed on hold during the pandemic.
As we proceed through the summer months, we edge closer to the targeted office reopening dates set by most large tech employers in early September. As recent reports about Apple and Google suggest, the COVID-19 Delta variant could lead to temporary delays in this reopening process. Our survey of job openings in the Essex markets for the largest tech companies continues to be very strong, as we report 33,000 job openings as of July, a 99% increase over last year's trough. New venture capital investment has set a record pace this year, with Essex markets once again leading with respect to funds invested, providing growth capital that supports future jobs. Generally, economic sectors that fell the furthest during the pandemic are now positioned for the strongest recovery in the reopening process, led by restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues, travel and filming. Return-to-office plans, which remained focused on hybrid approaches, will continue to draw employees closer to corporate offices. Given that many workers won't be required to be in the office on a full-time basis, we expect average commute distances to increase. As we highlight on Page S-17.1 of our supplemental, this transition has already started in recent months, as our hardest-hit markets in the Bay Area once again experienced net positive migration from beyond the NorCal region. In particular, since the end of Q1, the submarkets surrounding San Francisco Bay have seen positive net migration that represents 18% of total move-outs over the trailing 3 months compared to minus 8% a year ago. These inflows are led by residents returning from adjacent metros such as Sacramento and the Monterey peninsula; as well as renewed flow of recent graduates arriving from college towns across the country, a notable positive turnaround from last year. In Seattle CBD, we've seen similar or even stronger recent inflows and we're likewise experiences -- experiencing a strong market rent recovery.
On the supply outlook, we provided our semiannual update to our 2021 forecasts on S-17 of the supplemental with slight increases to 2021 supply, as COVID-related construction delays shifted incremental units from late 2020 into 2021. We expect modestly fewer apartment deliveries in the second half of 2021, with more significant declines in Los Angeles and Oakland. While it is still too early to quantify, recent volatility in lumber prices and shortages for building materials may impact construction starts and the timing of deliveries in subsequent years. Multifamily permitting activity in Essex markets also continues to trend favorably, declining 200 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis as of May 2021 compared to the national average which grew 230 basis points. Median single-family home prices in Essex markets continued upward in California and Seattle, [ growing ] 18% and 21%, respectively, on a trailing 3-month basis. The escalating costs of homeownership combined with greater rental affordability from the pandemic have increased the financial incentive to rent. We suspect these trends will continue, given muted single family supply and limited permitting activity, and believe these factors will be a key differentiator for our markets in the coming years compared to many U.S. markets with greater housing supply.
Turning to apartment transactions. Activity has steadily accelerated since the start of the year, with the majority of apartment trades occurring in the low- to mid-3% cap rate range based on current rents. Generally, investors anticipate a robust rent recovery, especially in markets where current rents are substantially below pre-pandemic levels. With the recent improvement in our cost of capital, we have turned our focus once again to acquisitions and development while remaining disciplined with respect to FFO accretion targets. With respect to our preferred equity program, we continue to see new deals, although the market is becoming more competitive. Lower cap rates from pre-pandemic levels have produced higher-than-anticipated market valuations, which in turn has resulted in higher levels of early redemption.
That concludes my comments. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our COO, Angela Kleiman."

My comments today will focus on our second quarter results and current market dynamics.
With the reopening of the West Coast economy, the recovery has generated improvements in demand and thus pricing power. Our operating strategy during COVID to favor occupancy while adjusting concessions to maintain scheduled rents enabled us to optimize rent growth concurrent with the increase in demand, resulting in same-store net effective rent growth of 8.3% since January 1. And most of this growth occurred in the second quarter. A key contributor of this accomplishment is the fantastic job by our operations team in responding quickly to this dynamic market environment.
While market conditions have improved rapidly, during our second quarter -- driving our second quarter results to exceed expectations, I would like to provide some context for why sequential same-property revenues declined by 90 basis points compared to the first quarter. The 2 major factors that drove this decline were 50 basis points in delinquency and 50 basis points in concessions. Delinquency in the first quarter was temporarily lifted by the onetime unemployment disbursements from the stimulus funds. As expected in the second quarter, delinquency reverted back to 2.6% of scheduled rent versus the 2.1% in the first quarter. On concessions, the nominal amount increased from higher volume of leases in the second quarter relative to the first quarter of this year. To be clear: Concessions in our markets have declined substantially and are virtually nonexistent, except for select CBD markets. Our average concession for the stabilized portfolio is under 1 week in the second quarter compared to over a week in the first quarter and over 2 weeks in the fourth quarter. Although concessions have generally improved in the second quarter, they remain elevated, ranging from 2.5 to 3 weeks in certain CBDs such as CBD L.A., San Jose and Oakland.
Given the extraordinary pandemic-related volatility in rents and concessions over the past 1.5 years, I thought it would be insightful to provide an overview of the change in net effective rents compared to pre-COVID levels. As of this June, our same-store average net effective rent compared to March of last year was down by 3.1%. Since then, we have seen continued strength, and based on preliminary July results, our average net effective rents are now 1.5% above pre-COVID levels. It is notable that this 1.5% portfolio average diverged regionally, with both Seattle and Southern California up 5.8% and 9.3%, respectively, while Northern California has yet to fully recover, with net effective rents currently at 8% below pre-COVID levels. On a sequential basis, net effective rents on new leases have improved rapidly throughout the second quarter. And preliminary July rent increased 4.7% compared to the month of June, led by CBD San Francisco and CBD Seattle, both up about 11%. Not surprisingly, these 2 markets were hit hardest during the pandemic and are now experiencing the most rent growth.
Moving on to office development activities, which we view as an indicator of future job growth and, accordingly, housing demand. In general, the areas along the West Coast with the greatest amount of office development have been San Jose and Seattle. Currently, San Jose has 8.1% of total office stock under construction, and similarly, Seattle has [ 7.7% ] of office stock under construction. Notable activities include Apple leasing an additional 700,000 square feet. And LinkedIn announced recent plans to upgrade their existing office in Sunnyvale. In the Seattle region, Facebook expanded their Bellevue footprint by 330,000 square feet. And Amazon announced 1,400 new web services jobs in Redlands. We expect in the long term areas with higher office deliveries such as San Jose and Seattle will have capacity for greater apartment supply without impacting rental rates. While these normal relationships were disrupted during the pandemic, we anticipate conditions to normalize in the coming quarters.
Lastly, as the economic recovery continues to gain momentum, we have restarted both our apartment renovation programs and technology initiatives, including actively enhancing the functionality of our mobile leasing platform and SmartRent home automation.
Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak."
332646,1673196971,2358119,"Essex Property Trust, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Angela.I'll start with a few comments on our second quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on our investments and the balance sheet.I'm pleased to report core FFO for the second quarter exceeded the m",621,"Thanks, Angela.
I'll start with a few comments on our second quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on our investments and the balance sheet.
I'm pleased to report core FFO for the second quarter exceeded the midpoint of the revised range we provided during the NAREIT conference by $0.08 per share. The favorable results are primarily attributable to stronger same-property revenues, higher commercial income and lower operating expenses. Of the $0.08 beat, $0.03 relates to the timing of operating expenses and G&A spend, which is now forecasted to occur in the second half of the year.
As Angela discussed, we are seeing stronger rent growth in our markets than we expected just a few months ago. As such, we are raising the full year midpoint of our same-property revenue growth by 50 basis points to minus 1.4%. It should be noted this was the high end of the revised range we provided in June. In addition, we have lowered our operating expense growth by 25 basis points at the midpoint due to lower taxes in the Seattle portfolio. All of this results in an improvement in same-property NOI growth by 80 basis points at the midpoint to minus 3%. Year-to-date, we have revised our same-property revenue growth at the midpoint up 110 basis points and NOI by 160 basis points.
As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.09 per share to $12.33. This reflects the stronger operating results partially offset by the impact of the early redemptions of preferred equity investments, which I will discuss in a minute. Year-to-date, we have raised core FFO by $0.17 or 1.4%.
Turning to the investment market. As we've discussed on previous calls, strong demand for West Coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing has led to sales and recapitalizations of several properties underlying our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments, resulting in several early redemptions. During the quarter, we received $36 million from an early redemption of a subordinated loan, which included $4.7 million in prepayment fees, which have been excluded from core FFO. Year-to-date, we have been redeemed on approximately $150 million of investments and expect that number could grow to approximately $250 million by year-end. This is significantly above the high end of the range we provided at the start of the year. However, this speaks to the high valuation apartment properties are commanding today, which is good for Essex and the net asset value of the company.
As for new preferred equity investments, we have a healthy pipeline of accretive deals. And we are still on track to achieve our original guidance of 100 million to 150 million in the second half of the year. As a reminder: Our original guidance assumed new investments would match redemptions during the year. However, the timing mismatch between the higher level of early reductions, coupled with funding of new investments expected later this year, has led to an approximate $0.10 per share drag on our FFO for the year.
Moving to the balance sheet. We remain in a strong financial position due to refinancing over 1/3 of our debt over the past 1.5 years, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to reduce our weighted average rate by 70 basis points to 3.1% and lengthening our maturity profile by an additional 2 years. We currently have only 7% of our debt maturing through the end of 2023. Given our laddered maturity schedule, limited near-term funding needs and ample liquidity, we are in a strong position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
This concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

I think I'll handle that one. And others may want to comment as well, but I think we feel really very good about what's happening here, noted in my comments that we're fully recovered with respect to market rents versus pre-pandemic levels while only recovered about half the jobs, so far. So that -- I think that's a powerful place to start. And if we look around the West Coast, we feel great about what's happening, and we expect good times to continue. The consumer is super optimistic. They've saved money via COVID, versus COVID by not traveling and a variety of other things; millennials forming households. And there's a lot of hiring here on the West Coast, so that's why we talk about the top 10 tech companies and how many open positions they have. They've come a long way in the past year. And after what we perceived as them pulling back mid-COVID on their expansion plans, I think that they're now turning that corner or have turned that corner, hiring more people, pursuing things that they put on hold a year ago. And so everything feels like it's in good order at this point in time.
As you go to the cities, the main driver of job growth at this point in time has been the recovery of all the industries that have been so dramatically affected a year ago, including the leisure, hospitality, restaurants, filming in Southern California, et cetera. And as we look at the world, we're looking at whether we believe these industries are poised for future growth. And we think absolutely they are. We think that we're in affluent areas. Affluent areas demand services. You're starting to see those services come back in terms of restaurants and a variety of other areas, and so we see this turning around nicely. And again I wouldn't have expected to be fully back with respect to rents at a time when we've only recovered about half the jobs that we lost. Makes sense?"

And Barb will look at me very strangely if we start talking about '22 at this point in time, so -- and you know how we are. We tend to be pretty careful in terms of guidance. And so we don't want to go too far out there, but I would say that I would expect certainly the return to office to be a good thing for the downtown locations because most of the top 10 tech companies or most of the tech companies in general have announced a hybrid type of approach which means that people are going to have to be closer to the offices to show up, let's say, plus or minus 3 times per week. As a result of that, the people that moved to the hinterlands or the most suburban parts of our portfolio probably are going to need to come back. And I think about Ventura. I don't want to pick on Ventura because it's done great, but it's a long way on a commute pattern from Ventura into the -- where the jobs are in L.A. And I don't think people are even going to want to do that 3 times a week. So I think that kind of frames the dynamics. The -- those that had a year, given the pandemic, to make a different choice about where to live, I think, will likely make a different choice going forward now that there's more clarity about what the -- what companies are going to do with respect to their work-from-home or return-to-office programs."

In the second half of the year, you -- as each -- we have to turn leases in order to impact our same-store or our revenue. And so you -- as you get toward the end of the year, it becomes less relevant and more relevant obviously next year. So take a transaction in October. You only have 3 months of that new lease in 2021. The rest of it is going to be in 2022. So there is an inherent lagging concept with respect to what's going on with market rents, which Angela just talked about, versus how it shows up on the income statement. So I think that's important. In terms of just looking at market rents, we've tried to provide a little bit of color on that. And with respect to S-17 is what we're trying to get at, that overall our economic rent growth on S-17 is at minus 0.9%. And that's 1/12 of every month throughout the year. So January 2021 versus January 2020, plus February, through the year, divided by 12 is what that number represents. So we started the year at a -- in the minus 9% to minus 10% range. That implies, to get to 0.9% -- minus 0.9%, on S-17, that the fourth quarter will be plus 6%. And that does not anticipate a lot of rent growth between now and then, which is pretty typical. We typically hit the peak of market rents in July, at the end of the peak leasing season, and then it flattens out for the rest of the year. So that's what's assumed in those numbers."

We assumed more or less the typical trend with respect to market rents, so kind of peaking in July and not a lot of growth for the rest of the year. If -- as we think about it, however, there are some things that are different. For example, will the tech companies continue hiring? Normally what happens is hiring tails off at the end of the year. Companies give business plans at the -- towards the third and fourth quarter and then they start implementing them in the first quarter. That's what really drives the peak leasing season. So the question here is will companies continue hiring at a higher level, given COVID, than they have in the past. I think there's a very good chance that, that could happen. I also -- this work-from-home and return-to-office concept could have an impact on that as well. If more people are, yes, moving back into the more urban areas from -- the people that were displaced as California and Washington were shutting down a year ago, if those people continue to come back later this year, that could possibly push rents higher in the second part of the year. So we've, again, assumed based on our experience and what typically happens a normal curve with respect to rents, but there are some things that are different here and so we could end up with [ being a ] surprise to the positive side."

And we do think that it does speak to the strength of our markets and people coming back and returning after the services have reopened and the economy has reopened. Now we're seeing the people return, and so we think it's a good sign and a good leading indicator. You should note that this -- Seattle in our portfolio looks similar as well. We're seeing a big in-migration in Seattle as well. So we didn't show it here, but it's Bay Area and Seattle both have a similar chart where there is a big influx. And I think you're seeing it in the rent growth that Angela spoke to and San Fran being up 11% in the CBD. And NorCal and some of the other suburban markets in NorCal having bigger sequential rent growth more recently is partly due to this in-migration."

And I would say -- the broader comment is that the migration out of the West Coast, our view, was largely driven by businesses being shut down and putting people in the position of not having a paycheck and effectively forcing them to move to somewhere else. And I know that sort of it doesn't fit the narrative. The narrative is that all these people wanted to leave California. I think the reality is completely different from that. And therefore, I go back to my basic comment, which is do we feel comfortable with the businesses that are here and with job growth going forward. And when you look at the components of that: Okay, the hotels are now mostly open here on the West Coast. The restaurants are opening and -- but we were still at 50% of capacity a month or 2 ago. So we opened completely on June 15, but that process has been relatively slow. And I think that's why job growth has lagged the U.S. as we've come out of the pandemic. And -- but I guess the key point here is most of the migration that occurred was not voluntary migration. It was caused by shutting down businesses. And then if you look at the flip side of that, are those businesses likely to reopen given COVID is mostly behind us? And we feel 100%, absolutely convinced that, that will occur.
And so when we look -- we have some more broader information on migration in general. And a lot of the same things that we talked about a year or 2 ago are still in place. The inflows into our markets tend to be the high-cost East Coast metros, and the outflows tend to be into lower-cost Western areas. So those trends really haven't changed all that much, but Barb, this -- S-17.1 is trying to address specifically the cadence of what's coming in and what's going out. And to your point, yes, of course, everything is in there. We're not here to try to push a narrative that is not reality because, if we do that, we're just going to shoot ourselves in the foot. So there's no evidence, I think, of Essex trying to be overly optimistic. And so we're trying to communicate what's really happening out there and what we're really seeing. So I guess that would [indiscernible] -- yes."

And do you see now as a particularly interesting time to be investing in your markets for all the reasons you just described but also particularly special because of what's happened outside of California and Washington and what you think might come back and that there will be sort of a narrowing of the performance gap over the next several years?"

It's a great question, Rich. And our Board is pretty focused on this geographic diversity issue and some of the challenges that we've had more recently with respect to regulation and other things, but we don't want to get too far away from sort of this longer-term pattern because we -- it isn't like we're going to grow every year the same. Conditions change, but we remain focused, in our analysis, on which areas have the highest CAGRs of rent growth over time. And it may surprise you because you can say the West Coast has dropped off of that. More recently, yes, but if you look back, let's say, 15 years because I have these numbers right out of our strategic plan in front of us, Seattle led all the major markets by -- with a 5.6% 15-year rent growth CAGR from 2004 to 2019. So to the pre-COVID level. And Northern California was pretty close to that. And we start going down the list. And certainly Boston and Miami are pretty attractive in that respect, as is Northern New Jersey, but then there are a lot of markets that really have fallen well below that. And so our whole thesis here has been let's try to identify the things that promote long-term rent growth and let's invest in those markets. And we can -- as you know, we've looked at some things on the East Coast before, and we'll continue doing that, but I guess, as we think about things, let's -- let me just make a simple comparison. Let's compare San Jose with Austin. And there are cities of about the same size, same population.
Austin has about 28,000 multifamily units in construction, whereas San Jose has about 8,000. We also don't produce very much housing or for-sale housing in San Jose, and the median price is well over $1 million. So as an apartment owner, we look at that and say, are we better off being in San Jose or in Austin? And we conclude that it's better to be in San Jose. I mean Austin has to get extraordinary amounts of growth over and above San Jose, which of course is driven by the tech companies which are doing really well. And they hire a lot of people, so I guess I would say the bloom is not off the West Coast. Yes, we grew really fast from 2011 through 2016, when by the way, we had job growth in the 4% to 5% range on the West Coast. And then it slowed down because of affordability issues, because you can't have rents grow twice as fast as incomes over long periods of time without creating affordability issues. So there is a long-term approach to the business, and I think that making vast portfolio decisions based on -- with all the unique circumstances in COVID would be misguided."

I think I've just seen some studies that say like vaccinated people can also spread it as well, like, as easily as unvaccinated. And the markets that you're in are most likely to re-shut down and reimplement restrictions if cases rise, hospitalizations rise, et cetera, so given that that's likely to happen as the fall comes, what kind of weighting do you kind of give to that notion of a potential hiccup from reimposed restrictions?"

And I guess I would say, unfortunately, we have no way to really figure out what COVID might do going forward and -- but we're definitely aware of the risks. And one thing that I think is a little bit different in California, clearly we've got population densities that are pretty high, and so the risk of COVID is perhaps greater given that. And I think the government actually has done a very good job here of trying to promote vaccination rates in the Essex markets. And I think our vaccination rates are pretty high relative to the rest of the world. So the information I have is that the people with at least one shot and are 12 years and older were in California and Washington about 82% vaccinated versus 67% for the U.S. So I think that what's happened here is we've tried to -- the government has tried to react to that risk by really pushing the vaccination rate, and they've done a very good job of that. So I think that lowers our exposure, to some extent, but no doubt areas with high population density have a different COVID risk than some of the other areas.

We created that index so that we could keep our eye on where are the open positions for the top 10 tech companies. Are they moving more to some of these other locations? And if so, what do we do about it? So yes, I didn't mean to imply actually that we're so focused on 15-year CAGRs of rent growth. So definitely the historical information is important, but we're trying to supplement that in a hundred different ways with a ton of data sources that are either confirming or raising questions about what the future looks like. That's why Angela is talking about how much office construction. If you're going to build office buildings, presumably there are going to be employees in there and we're going to need to build apartments to house those employees. I mean these are all indicators of what's happening in the future. Keeping our eye on the top 10 tech companies and their hiring trends, again both within California and outside of California, super important in that regard.
Again I go back to the industries. What are the driving industries? What are the industries that sort of drive the entire machine? We can -- it's certainly not the hospitality and the restaurant workers that are driving it. They are really the result of affluent, wealthy areas [ demanding those ] services. And guess what. They pay a lot more than in other places of the country because of that. And so I think what's happening here is we're in the process of -- all those people that were displaced from shutting down restaurants and other services, we're going to need to draw them back into the area, but I think that, given the demand for those services and given the wealth that has been created here by the tech community, by motion pictures in Southern California and other people that want to live near a beach, let's say, those services are in demand. And they're going to come back. It's -- it will take a little bit of time perhaps to do that, but again, we're trying to say, okay, let's stay focused on what are the drivers of the economy here. And again as I look at it, and hopefully, everyone will agree, tech is not going away or hasn't gone away. Certainly all the information that we've given out with respect to the tech companies over time confirms the thesis that they're here. They're not going away. They continue to invest in our markets. Motion pictures in Southern California: You can't shoot, film where you require 50 to 100 people on a set during COVID. Completely shut down. Demand for content, not going away anytime soon. Therefore, there's a very good chance that, that is going to resume. And I can go on beyond that, but I think that, that sets the point.
If the drivers are intact, the things that follow, the demand for services, restaurants, et cetera will follow. And the thesis of the company in terms of job growth remains intact. And then if you don't produce enough housing supply, I would view that as a good thing."

And the answer to that was, of course, that we drew people because the price point was lower. We drew people from other places into some of the better locations. So they improved their location given lower rents. And so now you look at this equation that we're 96% occupied. People are starting to come back and there's no availability, and therefore market rents are doing what they're doing. So I think a lot of this is really driven by our strategy during the pandemic. And now it'll be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years because market -- with market rents now back to where they were pre-pandemic levels, what is the movement within the portfolio both in and out of those locations that have much higher rents? So in the case of San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland, they're still substantially below the prior rents, so there's still reason to believe that those -- the people that moved in given lower rents will stay, but that may uncouple over the next several years."

Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will provide an overview of our third quarter results, our initial operational outlook for 202",1092,"Good day, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will provide an overview of our third quarter results, our initial operational outlook for 2022, apartment market conditions and then conclude with the regulatory environment. 
Our third quarter results exceeded expectations, reflecting substantial improvement in West Coast economic conditions and housing demand. Net effective market rents are now 6.4% above pre-COVID levels and it's notable that exceeded pre-COVID market rents despite having recovered only about 63% of the jobs lost during the pandemic. As a result of improving market conditions, we reported quarterly core FFO of $3.12 per share, $0.08 per share above both our sequential results and guidance provided last quarter. This is the first of likely many quarterly sequential improvements in core FFO. 
Southern California continues to deliver the strongest growth with net effective rents up 17.2% compared to pre-COVID while Northern California is still down 5.2%. Return to office delays at many tech companies and slower job growth compared to other West Coast areas were factors in the pace of recovery for Northern California. Overall, September job growth in the Essex markets was 5.2%, substantially above the U.S. average of 4%. 
Turning to our outlook for 2022. We published our initial market rent estimates on Page F17 of our supplemental package. We are expecting 7.7% net effective rent growth on average in 2022, with Northern California the notable laggard in 2021 forecasted to lead the portfolio average end market rent growth next year. A key assumption driving our outlook for 2022 is the return to a predominantly hybrid office environment occurring over the first half of the year, supporting our 2022 job growth outlook and our expectation that the West Coast markets will resume their long-term outperformance versus U.S. averages. 
Our confidence in the Bay Area recovery next year is partially driven by rental affordability following a year of solid income growth, lower effective rents and exceptional growth in single-family home prices. Median for-sale home prices are up 17% in California and almost 16% in Seattle, making for-sale housing more costly relative to rental housing and often impeding the transition from renter to homeowner. Finally, despite large increases in for-sale housing prices, our expectation for the production of for-sale housing in 2022 remains very muted at only 0.4% of the single-family housing stock. 
We previously noted that many large tech companies in our market have delayed their office reopenings as a result of the Delta variant this fall, which we believe is the primary factor in the slow recovery of Northern California compared to other Essex markets. Nevertheless, recent tech company announcements regarding office expansion, open positions in the Essex markets and new commitments to office space all support our belief that the leading employers remain fully committed to a hybrid office-centric environment on the West Coast. 
Page S-17.1 of our supplemental highlights recent investments by large tech companies which have continued throughout the pandemic and include Apple's 550,000 square foot recent expansion in Culver City, their new 490,000 square foot tech campus that will soon begin construction in North San Jose and a recent acquisition of 5 office buildings with a total of 458,000 square feet in Cupertino. Google last quarter received needed approvals for its planned 80-acre campus near Downtown San Jose and YouTube's 2.5 million square foot campus in San Bruno was just approved by the city last week. 
We continue to track the large tech companies hiring in terms of open positions and job locations, giving us confidence that we continue to grow alongside the most dynamic sector of the U.S. economy. Our most recent survey of open positions indicates 38,000 job openings in the Essex markets for the 10 largest tech companies, up 9,000 jobs or 26% as compared to the first quarter of 2020. Strong economic growth on the West Coast is further supported by venture capital investments which achieved new highs in Q3 '21 of $72 billion, of which 44% was directed to organizations in the Essex markets. 
Turning to our supply outlook for 2022, we are expecting 0.6% housing supply growth for the full year, including 0.9% growth for the multifamily stock which is manageable relative to our expectations for job growth of 4.1% in 2022. Overall, our West Coast markets will remain well below the national rate of new housing supply growth, especially compared to the rapid accelerating pace of housing deliveries across many low-barrier markets next year. Longer term, residential building permits in Essex markets saw a modest 3.5% increase on a trailing 12-month basis, which is favorable compared to the U.S. where permits have increased 13.6% compared to 1 year ago. 
While our markets often temporarily underperform the national averages during recessions, we remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, including the cadence of housing supply deliveries with permitting data supporting our West Coast thesis. 
Turning to the apartment transaction market. We continue to see strong demand from institutional capital to invest in the multifamily sector along the West Coast as evidenced by increasing transaction volume and cap rates in the mid-3% range. Apartment values across our markets are up approximately 15% on average compared to pre-COVID valuations. The company has recently seen more development opportunities, and we were able to purchase 2 commercial properties in the third quarter, 1 located in South San Francisco that we expect to become a near-term apartment development opportunity and another in Seattle that we will begin to entitle for apartments while earning an attractive 6% going-in yield with a high-quality tenant. We also recently closed 2 apartment acquisitions, as noted in the press release, and our acquisition pipeline is strong. Barb will discuss a new co-investment program in a moment, which is strategically important given our preference not to issue common stock at the current market price. 
Finally, the California statewide eviction moratorium ended September 30. However, a few meaningful local jurisdictions have extended their separate eviction prohibitions. The net result is that a significant portion of our portfolio remains subject to eviction moratoria and other regulations that will slow the pace of scheduled rent growth in 2022. Fortunately, the federal tenant relief program has come to the aid of many of our residents, although the reimbursement process continues to be slow and requires a significant coordination and support from the Essex team. I am grateful for this extensive team effort. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

First, I'll start by expressing my appreciation for our operations team as we are in the midst of a strong recovery, our team has been busier and working harder than ever. I also want to thank the support departments, especially our delinquency collections team for their diligence to help our customers navigate the complex rent reimbursement legislations. 
On to today's comments, I'll provide an overview of our portfolio strategy relative to current market conditions, followed by some regional commentary and expectations for our markets. Our third quarter results reflect a combination of the operating strategy implemented early in the pandemic and a healthy recovery in net effective rents that began in the second quarter as California and Washington finally reopened from the pandemic shutdowns. As you may recall, in the second quarter of 2020 when the pandemic mandated shutdowns halted our economy, Essex quickly pivoted to a strategy that focused on maintaining high occupancy and coupon rents with the use of significant concessions. Now over a year later, as our markets recover, we are starting to see the benefits of this strategy flow through our financial results. 
In the third quarter, same-property revenue -- same-property revenues grew by 2.7%, which is primarily attributable to a reduction in concessions compared to the previous period. By primarily utilizing concessions last year, we were able to limit the in-place rent decline to only 1.1% in the third quarter. The benefit of this strategy is also coming through our sequential revenue growth, which increased 3.2% this quarter from the second quarter. With the market volatility we experienced over the past year, this is an extraordinary result and positions the company well going forward. 
From a portfolio-wide perspective, market conditions remain strong compared to a year ago as demonstrated by the 12.6% blended net effective rent growth in the quarter. In addition, rents relative to pre-COVID levels have continued to improve, further enhanced by a delay to the typical seasonal slowdown in all our markets. 
Turning to some market-specific commentary from north to south. Rents and jobs in the Seattle region have had a strong recovery with net effective rents up 8.3% compared to pre-COVID levels and year-over-year job growth of 5.5% in September. New supply continues to be largely concentrated into CBD, which is less impactful to Essex because 85% of our Seattle portfolio is located outside of CBD. 
Looking forward to 2022, as outlined in our S-17 of the supplemental, total housing supply deliveries for the region is expected to decline compared to 2021, and we anticipate job recovery to continue, led by Amazon, which recently announced plans to hire over 12,000 corporate and tech employees in Seattle. As such, we are forecasting market rent growth of 7.2% in 2022. 
Moving down to Northern California, which is our only region where net effective rents remain below pre-COVID levels. Greater job loss and apartment supply deliveries caused net effective rents to fall further in Northern California since the onset of the pandemic. In addition, the job recovery in Northern California has been at a slower pace than our other regions, with only 4.4% year-over-year improvement compared to a 5.2% for the entire Essex portfolio as of September. We believe this is partly driven by the more owner mandating normal business activities. Apartment supply, particularly in San Mateo and Oakland CBD are also presenting challenges for nearby properties, leading to financial concessions for stabilized properties for -- of over a week in these markets in September. On the other hand, we anticipate that Northern California will be our best-performing region in 2022, with market rent growth forecast of 8.7% on our S-17. As Mike discussed, we expect hybrid office reopenings to continue, which will drive additional job growth and healthy demand for apartment units. With similar level of supply delivery expected in 2022 as this year,  we are optimistic that Northern California is in its early stages of its recovery. 
Lastly, on Southern California. Rent growth has continued to improve in the third quarter, and net effective rents in September are 17.2% above pre-COVID levels. As we have mentioned in the past, Southern California is a tale of 2 markets, the urban areas in the downtown L.A. versus the more suburban communities, which have generally outperformed. In June, LA rents were still below pre-COVID levels, but as of September, they are now 6.8% above. While Orange County, San Diego and Ventura have achieved rents between 17% to 30% above pre-COVID levels. 
Job growth in Southern California continues to progress well, up 5.9% in September as the region's economy continues to reopen and recover. With the exception of the downtown L.A. area where concessions averaged 1 week in September, the rest of our Southern California market has demonstrated solid fundamentals with no concessions recognized in September. We expect Southern California strong rent growth to continue in 2022, led by Los Angeles, which has just begun to recover the jobs loss during the COVID recession. Apartment supply in the region is forecasted to increase next year compared to this year and could present pockets of interim softness counterbalanced by a continued favorable job to supply ratio across the region. As you can see on our S-17 market rent growth for Southern California of 7.1%, we anticipate this region to perform at a comparable level in Seattle. With this backdrop of stable occupancy amidst a favorable supply-demand relationship, our portfolio is well positioned for the continued growth. 
I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak."

I'll start with a few comments on our third quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the third quarter exceeded the midpoint",672,"Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our third quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the third quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08 per share. The favorable outcome was due to stronger operating results at both our consolidated and co-investment properties, higher commercial income and lower G&A expense. During the quarter, we saw an improvement in our delinquency rate, which declined to 1.4% of scheduled rent on a cash basis come to 2.6% in the second quarter. The decline is attributable to an increase in income from the federal tenant relief programs that were established to repay landlords for past due rents. Year-to-date through September, we have received $11.6 million from the various tenant relief programs, of which $9.5 million was received in the third quarter. 
Given the increased pace of reimbursement, we began to reduce our net accounts receivable balance in order to maintain our conservative approach to delinquencies and collections. As a result of the strong third quarter results, we are raising the full year midpoint for same-property revenues by 20 basis points to minus 1.2%. As should be noted, this was the prior high end of our range. 
There are 2 factors I want to highlight as it relates to our fourth quarter guidance. First, as Angela discussed, we are seeing strong rent growth in our markets. While there will be a small benefit to the fourth quarter, the vast majority of the benefit from higher rent growth won't be felt until 2022 when we have the opportunity to turn more leases. Second, our fourth quarter guidance assumes we continue to receive additional government reimbursements for past due rents and contemplates a continued reduction in our net accounts receivable balance. Thus, we expect our reported delinquencies as a percent of scheduled rent to be above our cash delinquencies, which is consistent with the third quarter reported results. As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.11 per share to $12.44. This reflects the better-than-expected third quarter results and changes to our full year outlook. Year-to-date, we have raised core FFO by $0.28 or 2.3% at the midpoint. 
Turning to the investment markets. During the quarter, we raised a new institutional joint venture to fund acquisitions as we believe this is the most attractive source of capital today to maximize shareholder value. The new venture will have approximately $660 million of buying power, a portion of which is expected to be invested by year-end. 
As I discussed on our last call, we are seeing an elevated level of early redemptions of our preferred equity investments due to strong demand for West Coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing, which is leading to sales and recapitalization. For the year, we expect redemptions to be around $290 million. Roughly 40% of these redemptions are expected to occur in the fourth quarter. Given the current environment, we could see continued elevated levels of early redemptions in 2022. 
In terms of new preferred equity and structured finance commitment, we are on track to achieve our 2021 objectives as outlined at the start of the year. Year-to-date, we have closed on approximately $110 million of new commitments. As a reminder, it typically takes 3 to 6 months post closing to fund our commitments given they tend to be tied to development projects. 
Moving to the balance sheet. As we expected, we are starting to see an improvement in our financial metrics, driven by a recovery in our operating results. In the third quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from 6.6x last quarter to 6.4x. We believe this ratio will continue to decline through growth in EBITDA over the next several quarters. With limited near-term debt maturities and ample liquidity, we remain in a strong financial position. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

We expect to outperform the U.S. with respect to job growth, certainly going forward. And we view the catalyst of the return to office in Northern California as being sort of the last piece that's probably the relative underperformance that we've had thus far relative to the peer group. And we see that as still being a very strong part of our portfolio. Historically, Northern California produces the highest CAGR of rent growth over long periods of time. And we expect that dominance to show itself. And a lot of the reasons why we're embedded in the various comments that you heard from  all of us. So hopefully, that all made sense.

And no doubt, we are feeling quite a bit of pressure on the cost side. Certainly finding positions, especially on-site positions are challenging and compensation is going up, for sure. On the -- the one piece that's good in California, obviously, is property taxes because Prop 13 limits that increase. And so I -- but I go back to rents. Rents are obviously the big thing. We're a high gross margin type of company, and therefore, the rent growth really matters in this equation. And I think in an inflationary world as do very well. And so I would expect that our rent growth would more than compensate for whatever cost increases that we have. And I think it's -- it would be -- I'm not saying I want this to happen. But I think if we were in a more -- a stronger inflationary period, I think it would be a net positive in terms of the financial performance of the company. Obviously, if inflation goes up, all asset values decline in value. So maybe that would be one sticking point as well because probably cap rates change and some other things happen as well.

They're both kind of separate, which is why I'll cover them separately. The first one, which is in South San Francisco, we've had that tied up for over 3 years. And so during that time, we worked with the city to determine what sort of zoning we could get. And during that time, we're basically able to increase the density by over 100 units. So coupled -- when you take that, coupled with the cap rate compression that we've seen in the market, the deal made more sense than really any development deal that we've penciled in the last couple of years. So there is in-place income on the existing use, which is in the, call it, high 3 kind of cap rate range, which is fine. And that will get us through 2 entitlements, which we would expect in 9 months to a year or so. 
The other one, somewhat of an outlier. It's a single-tenant office deal in Seattle, really good location. There's still another 9 years on the lease.  And we have a partial guarantee for that term. So it's north of a 6 cap on current income.  It does pencil on today's multifamily underwriting. And it is actually zoned for multifamily, but we'll revisit that in 5, 6, 7 years from now to see what makes the most sense. But for now, that's a very solid covered land play from our perspective."

Well, we've obviously dealt with regulatory issues over many, many years, really for the 35 years I've been here.

So with California Rent Control law of the statewide law, at CPI plus 5 max of 10% annual increase. I don't think that, that in and of itself will cause a significant valuation differential. And I think that's the key part that if you're moving your rents by CPI plus 5, let's call that 8 or something like that, most buyers will think that, that is plenty of compensation for the transaction.

I mean, our research group, Paul Morgan, they use a variety of data sets and they're not looking at any 1 thing, not creating some base case scenario. The simple part of it is looking at what we expect job growth to do and how many units of demand are represented by the job growth and then how much supply do we have. And so fortunately, again, we're 96% occupied in all these markets. So it is like we have a hole to fill before that -- before the demand over supply situation takes hold. So we're already there. But included in some of the things you looked at, which is, I think, some pretty interesting data. For example, Seattle has recovered 79% of the jobs that they lost in the pandemic and he's expecting them to be at 110% and by the end of the fourth quarter. So they will actually be above their pre-COVID employment level, whereas almost all the other markets are still below pre-COVID level by the end of 2022. So it's not that simple. He considers affordability, which affordability is a key part of what we do. And we look at things now because there's been such incredible growth in rents in Southern California, they screen. And the way we do affordability is on a market basis, not a property-by-property basis because we're trying to look at the overall dynamic in the marketplace. And Southern California because it has such great rent growth is screening a little bit expensive, and Northern California, which has the highest incomes and rents that are pretty moderate given what's happened here, so that's what leads to the better growth rate for Northern California next year. And just by way of background, I'll give you a quick comparison. So rents in Seattle and Los Angeles, the median rent, the market rent, not Essex portfolio is about $1,816 in both cases. But in Seattle, the median household income is $102,000 and in L.A., it's about $88,000. So Paul would look at that relationship and say, ""You know what, that's a positive for Seattle."" It has about the same rent, has a lot more room to run with respect to incomes, and that would factor into his equation in terms of what we expect market rents to do. That makes sense?"

But going back to our basic thesis, if we have 530,000 jobs created next year and the typical relationship between a household and a job is 2:1. So we have somewhere around 265,000 units of demand for apartments, and we produce a total supply of 64,000 homes, we should do pretty darn well in that scenario.  Again, affordability becomes the key issue, and affordability is different by market. We screen relatively inexpensive in Northern California and relatively expensive in Southern California. But just looking at basic supply demand, we should be in great shape next year. So we don't know exactly what's going to happen. We think 7.7% is a big number, but we'll wait and see."

So I want to note that there previously was a ADU law that was passed earlier this year and this whole situation has been quite politically active with respect to the the my backyard versus the the now in my backyard groups.  And that's going to be an ongoing battle. So I think personally, given that there was an ADU law that was out there before and it had relatively little impact that that's going to continue to be the case. There was a LA Times article that was recently written and it said -- it estimate, I don't know where this estimate came from, but I'll just mention it for the sake of of transparency. It mentioned that estimated 1.5% of single-family homes are likely to use SB 9. So I suspect that will be high. But the backdrop of this is that Governor Newsom and various other sources have indicated that the state is short millions of homes. And the likelihood the SB 9 and SB 10 will change that, I think, is very unlikely."

And so the question is really a magnitude issue. And what you're going to -- what we're going to continue to do is focus on at this point, wherever we can push rents, but more likely as we head into November, December and now focusing on occupancy.

Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will provide an overview of our third quarter results, our initial operational outlook for 202",1094,"Good day, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will provide an overview of our third quarter results, our initial operational outlook for 2022, apartment market conditions and then conclude with the regulatory environment.
Our third quarter results exceeded expectations, reflecting substantial improvement in West Coast economic conditions and housing demand. Net effective market rents are now 6.4% above pre-COVID levels and it's notable that we've exceeded pre-COVID market rents despite having recovered only about 63% of the jobs lost during the pandemic. As a result of improving market conditions, we reported quarterly core FFO of $3.12 per share, $0.08 per share above both our sequential results and guidance provided last quarter. This is the first of likely many quarterly sequential improvements in core FFO.
Southern California continues to deliver the strongest growth with net effective rents up 17.2% compared to pre-COVID while Northern California is still down 5.2%. Return to office delays at many tech companies and slower job growth compared to other West Coast areas were factors in the pace of recovery for Northern California. Overall, September job growth in the Essex markets was 5.2%, substantially above the U.S. average of 4%.
Turning to our outlook for 2022. We published our initial market rent estimates on Page S-17 of our supplemental package. We are expecting 7.7% net effective rent growth on average in 2022 with Northern California the notable laggard in 2021 forecasted to lead the portfolio average in market rent growth next year. A key assumption driving our outlook for 2022 is the return to a predominantly hybrid office environment occurring over the first half of the year, supporting our 2022 job growth outlook and our expectation that the West Coast markets will resume their long-term outperformance versus U.S. averages.
Our confidence in the Bay Area recovery next year is partially driven by rental affordability following a year of solid income growth, lower effective rents and exceptional growth in single-family home prices. Median for-sale home prices are up 17% in California and almost 16% in Seattle, making for-sale housing more costly relative to rental housing and often impeding the transition from renter to homeowner. Finally, despite large increases in for-sale housing prices, our expectation for the production of for-sale housing in 2022 remains very muted at only 0.4% of the single-family housing stock.
We previously noted that many large tech companies in our markets have delayed their office reopenings as a result of the Delta variant this fall, which we believe is the primary factor in the slow recovery of Northern California compared to other Essex markets. Nevertheless, recent tech company announcements regarding office expansion, open positions in the Essex markets and new commitments to office space all support our belief that the leading employers remain fully committed to a hybrid office-centric environment on the West Coast.
Page S-17.1 of our supplemental highlights recent investments by large tech companies which have continued throughout the pandemic and include Apple's 550,000 square foot recent expansion in Culver City, their new 490,000 square foot tech campus that will soon begin construction in North San Jose and a recent acquisition of 5 office buildings with a total of 458,000 square feet in Cupertino. Google last quarter received needed approvals for its planned 80-acre campus near Downtown San Jose and YouTube's 2.5 million square foot campus in San Bruno was just approved by the city last week.
We continue to track the large tech companies hiring in terms of open positions and job locations, giving us confidence that we continue to grow alongside the most dynamic sector of the U.S. economy. Our most recent survey of open positions indicates 38,000 job openings in the Essex markets for the 10 largest tech companies, up 9,000 jobs or 26% as compared to the first quarter of 2020. Strong economic growth on the West Coast is further supported by venture capital investments which achieved new highs in Q3 '21 of $72 billion, of which 44% was directed to organizations in the Essex markets.
Turning to our supply outlook for 2022, we are expecting 0.6% housing supply growth for the full year, including 0.9% growth for the multifamily stock which is manageable relative to our expectations for job growth of 4.1% in 2022. Overall, our West Coast markets will remain well below the national rate of new housing supply growth and especially compared to the rapid accelerating pace of housing deliveries across many low-barrier markets next year. Longer term, residential building permits in Essex markets saw a modest 3.5% increase on a trailing 12-month basis, which is favorable compared to the U.S. where permits have increased 13.6% compared to 1 year ago.
While our markets often temporarily underperform the national averages during recessions, we remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, including the cadence of housing supply deliveries with permitting data supporting our West Coast thesis.
Turning to the apartment transaction market. We continue to see strong demand from institutional capital to invest in the multifamily sector along the West Coast as evidenced by increasing transaction volume and cap rates in the mid-3% range. Apartment values across our markets are up approximately 15% on average compared to pre-COVID valuations. The company has recently seen more development opportunities, and we were able to purchase 2 commercial properties in the third quarter, one located in South San Francisco that we expect to become a near-term apartment development opportunity and another in Seattle that we will begin to entitle for apartments while earning an attractive 6% going-in yield with a high-quality tenant. We also recently closed 2 apartment acquisitions, as noted in the press release, and our acquisition pipeline is strong. Barb will discuss a new co-investment program in a moment, which is strategically important given our preference not to issue common stock at the current market price.
Finally, the California statewide eviction moratorium ended September 30. However, a few meaningful local jurisdictions have extended their separate eviction prohibitions. The net result is that a significant portion of our portfolio remains subject to eviction moratoria and other regulations that will slow the pace of scheduled rent growth in 2022. Fortunately, the Federal tenant relief program has come to the aid of many of our residents, although the reimbursement process continues to be slow and requires a significant coordination and support from the Essex team. I am grateful for this extensive team effort.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

First, I'll start by expressing my appreciation for our operations team as we are in the midst of a strong recovery, our team has been busier and working harder than ever. I also want to thank the support departments, especially our delinquency collections team for their diligence to help our customers navigate the complex rent reimbursement legislations.
On to today's comments, I'll provide an overview of our portfolio strategy relative to current market conditions, followed by some regional commentary and expectations for our markets. Our third quarter results reflect a combination of the operating strategy implemented early in the pandemic and a healthy recovery in net effective rents that began in the second quarter as California and Washington finally reopened from the pandemic shutdowns.
As you may recall, in the second quarter of 2020 when the pandemic-mandated shutdowns halted our economy, Essex quickly pivoted to a strategy that focused on maintaining high occupancy and coupon rents with the use of significant concessions. Now over a year later, as our markets recover, we are starting to see the benefits of this strategy flow through our financial results.
In the third quarter, same-property revenue -- same-property revenues grew by 2.7%, which is primarily attributable to a reduction in concessions compared to the previous period. By primarily utilizing concessions last year, we were able to limit the in-place rent decline to only 1.1% in the third quarter. The benefit of this strategy is also coming through our sequential revenue growth, which increased 3.2% this quarter from the second quarter. With the market volatility we experienced over the past year, this is an extraordinary result and positions the company well going forward.
From a portfolio-wide perspective, market conditions remain strong compared to a year ago as demonstrated by the 12.6% blended net effective rent growth in the quarter. In addition, rents relative to pre-COVID levels have continued to improve, further enhanced by a delay to the typical seasonal slowdown in all our markets.
Turning to some market-specific commentary from north to south. Rents and jobs in the Seattle region have had a strong recovery with net effective rents up 8.3% compared to pre-COVID levels and year-over-year job growth of 5.5% in September. New supply continues to be largely concentrated in the CBD, which is less impactful to Essex because 85% of our Seattle portfolio is located outside of CBD.
Looking forward to 2022, as outlined in our S-17 of the supplemental, total housing supply deliveries for the region is expected to decline compared to 2021, and we anticipate job recovery to continue, led by Amazon, which recently announced plans to hire over 12,000 corporate and tech employees in Seattle. As such, we are forecasting market rent growth of 7.2% in 2022.
Moving down to Northern California, which is our only region where net effective rents remain below pre-COVID levels. Greater job loss and apartment supply deliveries caused net effective rents to fall further in Northern California since the onset of the pandemic. In addition, the job recovery in Northern California has been at a slower pace than our other regions, with only 4.4% year-over-year improvement compared to a 5.2% for the entire Essex portfolio as of September. We believe this is partly driven by the more owner mandates delaying normal business activities.
Apartment supply, particularly in San Mateo and Oakland CBD are also presenting challenges for nearby properties, leading to financial concessions for stabilized properties for -- of over a week in these markets in September. On the other hand, we anticipate that Northern California will be our best-performing region in 2022, with market rent growth forecast of 8.7% on our S-17. As Mike discussed, we expect hybrid office reopenings to continue, which will drive additional job growth and healthy demand for apartment units. With similar level of supply delivery expected in 2022 as this year, we are optimistic that Northern California is in its early stages of its recovery.
Lastly, on Southern California. Rent growth has continued to improve in the third quarter, and net effective rents in September are 17.2% above pre-COVID levels. As we have mentioned in the past, Southern California is a tale of 2 markets, the urban areas in the downtown L.A. versus the more suburban communities, which have generally outperformed. In June, L.A. rents were still below pre-COVID levels, but as of September, they are now 6.8% above. While Orange County, San Diego and Ventura have achieved rents between 17% to 30% above pre-COVID levels.
Job growth in Southern California continues to progress well, up 5.9% in September as the region's economy continues to reopen and recover. With the exception of the Downtown L.A. area where concessions averaged 1 week in September, the rest of our Southern California market has demonstrated solid fundamentals with no concessions recognized in September.
We expect Southern California strong rent growth to continue in 2022, led by Los Angeles, which has just begun to recover the jobs lost during the COVID recession. Apartment supply in the region is forecasted to increase next year compared to this year and could present pockets of interim softness counterbalanced by a continued favorable job to supply ratio across the region. As you can see on our S-17 market rent growth for Southern California of 7.1%, we anticipate this region to perform at a comparable level as Seattle. With this backdrop of stable occupancy amidst a favorable supply-demand relationship, our portfolio is well positioned for the continued growth.
I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak."

I'll start with a few comments on our third quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the third quarter exceeded the midpoint",672,"Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our third quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance, followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core FFO for the third quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08 per share. The favorable outcome was due to stronger operating results at both our consolidated and co-investment properties, higher commercial income and lower G&A expense.
During the quarter, we saw an improvement in our delinquency rate, which declined to 1.4% of scheduled rent on a cash basis compared to 2.6% in the second quarter. The decline is attributable to an increase in income from the Federal tenant relief programs that were established to repay landlords for past due rents. Year-to-date through September, we have received $11.6 million from the various tenant relief programs, of which $9.5 million was received in the third quarter.
Given the increased pace of reimbursement, we began to reduce our net accounts receivable balance in order to maintain our conservative approach to delinquencies and collections. As a result of the strong third quarter results, we are raising the full year midpoint for same-property revenues by 20 basis points to minus 1.2%. As should be noted, this was the prior high end of our range.
There are 2 factors I want to highlight as it relates to our fourth quarter guidance. First, as Angela discussed, we are seeing strong rent growth in our markets. While there will be a small benefit to the fourth quarter, the vast majority of the benefit from higher rent growth won't be felt until 2022 when we have the opportunity to turn more leases. Second, our fourth quarter guidance assumes we continue to receive additional government reimbursements for past due rents and contemplates a continued reduction in our net accounts receivable balance. Thus, we expect our reported delinquencies as a percent of scheduled rent to be above our cash delinquencies, which is consistent with the third quarter reported results.
As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.11 per share to $12.44. This reflects the better-than-expected third quarter results and changes to our full year outlook. Year-to-date, we have raised core FFO by $0.28 or 2.3% at the midpoint.
Turning to the investment markets. During the quarter, we raised a new institutional joint venture to fund acquisitions as we believe this is the most attractive source of capital today to maximize shareholder value. The new venture will have approximately $660 million of buying power, a portion of which is expected to be invested by year-end.
As I discussed on our last call, we are seeing an elevated level of early redemptions of our preferred equity investments due to strong demand for West Coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing, which is leading to sales and recapitalization. For the year, we expect redemptions to be around $290 million. Roughly 40% of these redemptions are expected to occur in the fourth quarter. Given the current environment, we could see continued elevated levels of early redemptions in 2022.
In terms of new preferred equity and structured finance commitment, we are on track to achieve our 2021 objectives as outlined at the start of the year. Year-to-date, we have closed on approximately $110 million of new commitments. As a reminder, it typically takes 3 to 6 months post closing to fund our commitments given they tend to be tied to development projects.
Moving to the balance sheet. As we expected, we are starting to see an improvement in our financial metrics, driven by a recovery in our operating results. In the third quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from 6.6x last quarter to 6.4x. We believe this ratio will continue to decline through growth in EBITDA over the next several quarters. With limited near-term debt maturities and ample liquidity, we remain in a strong financial position.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

We expect to outperform the U.S. with respect to job growth, certainly going forward. And we view the catalyst of the return to office in Northern California as being sort of the last piece, that's probably the relative underperformance that we've had thus far relative to the peer group. And we see that as still being a very strong part of our portfolio.
Historically, Northern California produces the highest CAGR of rent growth over long periods of time. And we expect that dominance to show itself. And a lot of the reasons why we're embedded in the various comments that you heard from all of us. So hopefully, that all made sense. A number of open positions for tech companies, the big investments that the tech companies continue to make within the Northern California markets, et cetera, I think it bodes well.

But it has had the most muted recovery, yet, it has, I would say, the strongest and most dynamic job base.
So again, we're looking forward to that. We were hoping it would happen earlier. But again, I think the Delta variant has postponed that. But again, we feel strong. We think all the things, all the conditions that we would expect to see from a number of open positions for these companies, major commitments to campuses and lease commitments for office space, et cetera, all seem to be focused on a return-to-office program probably in a hybrid sense for these companies.

And no doubt, we are feeling quite a bit of pressure on the cost side. Certainly finding positions, especially on-site positions is challenging and compensation is going up, for sure.
On the -- the one piece that's good in California, obviously, is property taxes because Prop. 13 limits that increase. And so I -- but I go back to rents. Rents are obviously the big thing. We're a high gross margin type of company, and therefore, the rent growth really matters in this equation. And I think in an inflationary world, rents do very well. And so I would expect that our rent growth would more than compensate for whatever cost increases that we have. And I think it's -- it would be -- I'm not saying I want this to happen. But I think if we were in a more -- a stronger inflationary period, I think it would be a net positive in terms of the financial performance of the company. Obviously, if inflation goes up, all asset values decline in value. So maybe that would be one sticking point as well because probably cap rates change and some other things happen as well.

They're both kind of separate, which is why I'll cover them separately. The first one, which is in South San Francisco, we've had that tied up for over 3 years. And so during that time, we worked with the city to determine what sort of zoning we could get. And during that time, we're basically able to increase the density by over 100 units. So coupled -- when you take that, coupled with the cap rate compression that we've seen in the market, the deal made more sense than really any development deal that we've penciled in the last couple of years. So there is in-place income on the existing use, which -- it's in the, call it, high 3 kind of cap rate range, which is fine. And that will get us through 2 entitlements, which we would expect in 9 months to a year or so.
The other one, somewhat of an outlier. It's a single-tenant office deal in Seattle, really good location. There's still another 9 years on the lease. And we have a partial guarantee for that term. So it's north of a 6 cap on current income. It does pencil on today's multifamily underwriting. And it is actually zoned for multifamily, but we'll revisit that in 5, 6, 7 years from now to see what makes the most sense. But for now, that's a very solid covered land play from our perspective."

Well, we've obviously dealt with regulatory issues over many, many years, really for the 35 years I've been here.

But generally speaking, all apartments are valued based on market rents today, not -- and then again, the loss to lease is a determination based on facts and circumstances.
So with California rent control law, the statewide law, at CPI plus 5% max of 10% annual increase, I don't think that, that in and of itself will cause a significant valuation differential. And I think that's the key part that if you're moving your rents by CPI plus 5%, let's call that 8% or something like that, most buyers will think that, that is plenty of compensation for the transaction. And I don't think cap rates move all that much because of that. Adam, do you want to comment on that?"

First, this year was an unprecedented year because we started out the year with a huge negative rent growth and have turned positive. So it's a very steep curve. And so this trajectory is not likely to repeat next year. And so -- but because of that, and the delay in the seasonal peak, it has created a small drag on revenue for next year. And secondly, some markets, those over 10%, which, broadly speaking, will be our Orange County, San Diego and Ventura counties, they have -- they're above the 10% cap -- rent control cap. And so that will be a factor as well."

The simple part of it",405,"Yes, it's a great question. And yes, I'm not sure we approach it that way. I mean, our research group, Paul Morgan, he -- they use a variety of data sets and they're not looking at any one thing, not creating some base case scenario. The simple part of it is looking at what we expect job growth to do and how many units of demand are represented by the job growth and then how much supply do we have. And so fortunately, again, we're 96% occupied in all these markets. So it is like we have a hole to fill before that -- before the demand over supply situation takes hold. So we're already there.
But included in some of the things he looks at, which is, I think, some pretty interesting data. For example, Seattle has recovered 79% of the jobs that they lost in the pandemic, and he's expecting them to be at 110% by the end of the fourth quarter. So they will actually be above their pre-COVID employment level, whereas almost all the other markets are still below pre-COVID level by the end of 2022. So it's not that simple. He considers affordability, which affordability is a key part of what we do. And we look at things now because there's been such incredible growth in rents in Southern California, they screen. And the way we do affordability is on a market basis, not a property-by-property basis because we're trying to look at the overall dynamic in the marketplace.
And Southern California because it has such great rent growth is screening a little bit expensive, and Northern California, which has the highest incomes and rents that are pretty moderate given what's happened here, so that's what leads to the better growth rate for Northern California next year. And just by way of background, I'll give you a quick comparison. So rents in Seattle and Los Angeles, the median rent, the market rent, not Essex portfolio is about $1,816 in both cases. But in Seattle, the median household income is $102,000 and in L.A., it's about $88,000. So Paul would look at that relationship and say, ""You know what, that's a positive for Seattle."" It has about the same rents, has a lot more room to run with respect to incomes, and that would factor into his equation in terms of what we expect market rents to do. That makes sense?"

And so occupancy, some have noted has actually declined a little bit, but that's really because we're pushing rents. When you push rents, you hold out a little bit longer and you are willing to accept a little bit lower occupancy level.
But going back to our basic thesis, if we have 530,000 jobs created next year and the typical relationship between a household and a job is 2:1. So we have somewhere around 265,000 units of demand for apartments, and we produce a total supply of 64,000 homes, we should do pretty darn well in that scenario. Again, affordability becomes the key issue, and affordability is different by market. We screen relatively inexpensive in Northern California and relatively expensive in Southern California. But just looking at basic supply demand, we should be in great shape next year. And -- so we don't know exactly what's going to happen. We think 7.7% is a big number, but we'll wait and see."

The other factor to keep in mind is we have a lot of money coming back from preferred equity redemptions.

We are still waiting and sort of guessing as to what might happen with SB 9 and 10. And of the 2, the one that's more impactful is SB 9 because that would effectively have the state override local zoning laws as it relates to the development of ADU units. And so potentially allowing more ADU units to be built in the suburbs. So I want to note that there previously was a ADU law that was passed earlier this year and this whole situation has been quite politically active with respect to the YIMBYs, the ""Yes In My Backyard"" versus the NIMBYs, the, ""No, In My Back Yard"" groups. And that's going to be an ongoing battle.
So I think personally, given that there was an ADU law that was out there before and it had relatively little impact that's going to continue to be the case. There was a L.A. Times article that was recently written and it said -- it estimated, I don't know where this estimate came from, but I'll just mention it for the sake of transparency. It mentioned that estimated 1.5% of single-family homes are likely to use SB 9. So I suspect that will be high. But the backdrop of this is that Governor Newsom and various other sources have indicated that the state is short millions of homes. And the likelihood the SB 9 and SB 10 will change that, I think, is very unlikely."

And what you're going to -- what we're going to continue to do is focus on at this point, wherever we can push rents, but more likely as we head into November, December and now focusing on occupancy.
