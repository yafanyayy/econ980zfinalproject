Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our fourth quarter and full year earnings release, which we issued earlier today. 2020 was a year like no other. Despite the challenges of historic global pandemics, the NiSource team remained focused on our core mission of providing safe, reliable energy to our customers and the communities we serve, while at the same time, enhancing our position to execute on significant long-term growth opportunities. Our generation investments will drop by compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emission 90% by 2030. 
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In 2020, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.32 per share as our cost management and regulatory mitigation efforts reduced the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In addition to some I've mentioned mentioned already, we achieved a number of other key milestones in 2020. We invested $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utilities, primarily on safety and asset modernization, which remains a top priority. We advanced and matured our safety management system and safety enhancement initiatives and 70% of our low-pressure systems are now protected with automatic shutoff devices and remote monitoring. 
We launched our transformative NiSource Next initiative to support our safety initiatives build organizational capabilities and enhance our efficiency. We sold the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts business, completing the transaction in 8 months. We lowered the weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt by 60 basis points and enhanced our liquidity through the COVID-19 pandemic, and we continue to see strong demand for natural gas. Experiencing a net gain of more than 30,000 gas customers across our 6 state footprint. 
We are today reaffirming our 2021 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.28 to $1.36 per share. Consistent with the long-term growth plan we provided at Investor Day, we expect to make $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual growth, safety and asset modernization investments from 2021 through 2024, and and $1.8 billion to $2 billion in renewable generation investments through 2023. 
I will note that we do expect an order in our Pennsylvania base rate case in the first quarter, with rates that would be retroactive to January 23. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our 2020 financial performance in more detail."

Looking at our 2020 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $508 million or $1.32 per share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $495 million or $1.32 per share in 2019.",575,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our 2020 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $508 million or $1.32 per share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $495 million or $1.32 per share in 2019. 
I would note the loss of fourth quarter earnings related to the sale of CMA reduced 2020 non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.05. Looking more closely at our segment 12-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5. Operating earnings were up about $36 million for the year in our gas segment. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $19 million due to the sale of CMA partially offset by infrastructure program revenues and increased customer growth. 
Operating expenses, also net of the cost of energy and track expenses were down about $55 million, mostly due to the CMA sale and lower employee and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased COVID-related costs. 
In our electric segment, 12-month non-GAAP operating earnings were down by nearly $40 million, driven primarily by an approximately $16 million increase in operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to new rates from the recent rate case, partially offset by COVID-related impacts from customer usage, late payment fees and reconnection fees. 
Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and track expenses were up by approximately $55 million due to the increased depreciation expenses. 
Turning to Slide 6. We provide additional details about the financial impact of COVID-19. As you can see, we're seeing lower commercial and industrial sales, which are partially offset by increased residential sales. We're also seeing reduced late payment and reconnection fees as well as higher bad debt and other expenses. 
The total growth impact of COVID-19 in 2020 was approximately $0.10 per share. This impact was partially offset by non safety-related cost management and regulatory solutions, bringing the net 2020 impact of COVID-19 to approximately $0.05 per share. 
Consistent with our base case, we currently expect an additional COVID impact in 2021 of approximately $0.05 per share which is factored into our 2021 non-GAAP EPS guidance range. While we're monitoring the pandemic closely, to date, it has not presented significant barriers to our safety and infrastructure. With long-term debt average interest rate was approximately liquidity of about $1.7 billion, consisting of cash, cash and available capacity ratings from all 3 major rating agencies are investment grade, and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. 
Taken together, this represents us new infrastructure investments. Let's take a quick look at Slide 9, which highlights our current financing plan. I would just note that we continue to look at ways to optimize the financing of our growth strategy. 
We are currently evaluating scenarios, utilizing hybrids and/or convertibles that get 50% or more equity credit with the rating agencies and could minimize the need for block equity offering in 2022 or 2023. We would anticipate a hybrid or convertible offering sometime in the first half of 2021. 
I would also note that next week, we plan to file a new at the market or ATM equity program to satisfy our ATM needs for the next 3 years. Just to remind everyone, our guidance is inclusive of this financing plan. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe, who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates for our gas and electric businesses."

Now let's take a look at some NiSource Utilities highlights for the fourth quarter and early first quarter of 2021, starting with our gas operations on Slide 10. In Pennsylvania, our base rate case remains pending before the Public Utility Commission. The application originally filed in April 2020 was modified in December and now seeks an annual revenue and the continued safety of the system. An order is expected in the first quarter of 2021 with new rates expected to become effective retroactive to January 23, 2021. 
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission approved the settlement in our base rate request in November 2020. The approved settlement supports further upgrading and replacement of our pipelines and is expected to increase annual revenue by $3.3 million, including $1.3 million of current tracker revenue. New rates became effective in December 2020. 
In Indiana, our latest tracker update was approved in December in our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. The update covers $26 million in incremental capital invested under the program between January and June of 2020, and new rates became effective in January of 2021. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission in 2020 approved a 6-year extension of the program, including nearly $950 million in planned capital investments through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing gas transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or TDISC tracker. 
Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 11. In January, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the latest tracker update request in our long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. The approved electric TDISC tracker update covers more than $122 million in incremental capital investments made between July 2019 and June 2020, and new rates became effective this month. This well-established program includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further enhance safety and reliability. 
The program originally approved by the IURC in 2016 includes approximately $1.2 billion in electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. 
And now I'll ask Shawn Anderson to provide an update about our renewable generation projects."

As Joe shared earlier, we completed our first 2 wind projects, Rosewater and Jordan Creek on time in December, which is an exciting milestone and executing our generation transition. 
Rosewater is our joint venture with EDP Renewables North America and our tax equity partner, Wells Fargo. Jordan Creek represents a power purchase agreement or PPA with NextEra Energy Resources. These completed projects are now powering more than 125,000 homes across Indiana with cleaner, more cost-effective energy. Our third wind project Indiana Crossroads remains under construction. This joint venture with EDP is expected to be in service at the end of this year. 
These renewable projects are consistent with their 2018 integrated resource plan, within which the preferred pathway plans to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all coal generation by 2028 to be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options. 
The plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers, an estimated $4 billion over 30 years. 
As Joe noted earlier, we continue to expect to make $1.8 billion to $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023. To date, we have executed agreements representing approximately $1.25 billion of this anticipated investment. Commercial negotiations for additional solar and storage capacity continue to advance. Half of the capacity and the replacement plan is targeted to be owned by joint ventures that will include NIPSCO and tax equity partners as the members, the balance of new capacity is expected to be primarily in the form of PPAs. 
In November 2020, we filed applications with the IURC for the approval of the Dunns Bridge I and II  and Cavalry Solar energy centers. These 3 Indiana projects or build transfer agreements with NextEra Energy resources and represent a combined capital investment of approximately $850 million for NIPSCO. 
These projects are expected to be placed into service across 2022 and 2023. NextEra will construct the solar and storage facilities, and we plan to form joint ventures with tax equity investors to own, operate and maintain these assets. And IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2021. 
We continue to fill out the balance of our capacity. In January, the IURC approved our Brickyard in Greensboro Solar and storage PPAs. NextEra Energy Resources will develop these projects, which are expected to be completed in mid-2023. 
And in December 2020, NIPSCO announced a long-term PPA with the clean energy infrastructure business of capital dynamics to develop Gibson Solar the 280-megawatt solar project in Gibson County, Indiana. NIPSCO filed an application with the IURC for approval of this project in January 2021. Construction is expected to begin in 2022 with commercial operations to begin in 2023. 
Also in December of 2020, NIPSCO filed an application with the IURC for approval of the Green River Solar PPA. Advanced negotiations continue for additional build transfer agreements to fill out the remainder of our capacity needs. We expect those negotiations to be completed in the first half of 2021 and the necessary regulatory filings coming shortly thereafter. 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, NIPSCO will be submitting an integrated resource plan for the IURC that will continue to outline its long-term generation plans, including the planned retirement of Michigan City Generate Station. The preferred plan that emerges from the 2021 IRP could create additional capital investment opportunity. 
Before we move on from our electric story, I would like to provide a quick update on units 14 and 15 at our Shafer generating station. As you know, all 4 coal units at Shafer are planned to retire by May 2023, as outlined in the 2018 IRP. As we continue to evaluate the economics of our generating fleet and the ongoing costs and investments required to keep the coal units operational, we determined that the right path forward for us is to initiate the retirement of 2 of the 4 coal units at Shafer. 
Units 14 and 15 will retire by the end of 2021, which is the most economic decision for our customers. NIPSCO's remaining fleet and new renewable capacity and secured capacity purchases will continue to reliably serve the energy needs to our customers. 
Our 2018 IRP and further detailed at our Investor Day, and we look forward to more projects and updates to come in future quarters. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Joe."

As I noted earlier, our safety enhancement initiatives advanced and matured in 2020. Our implementation of API's safety management system, or SMS, transition from an accelerated project launch to an established operating model within NiSource, and we expanded the implementation to our electric business. 
With the ongoing support and advice from the independent quality review board, we are continuing to mature our SMS processes, capabilities and talent and we're collaborating with our industry peers to enhance safety and reduce operational risk. We had a number of safety milestones in 2020 that are worth calling out. We launched mobile gas leak detection pilot projects and implemented a service line mapping strategy to enhance records quality across our footprint. 
We added special clearance processes and other layers of protection to critical field operations activities. Our gas meter shops and our fabrication facility earned ISO 9001 certification, a strong first step in a continuing quality effort. And the final safety recommendation around emergency preparedness and response was closed by the National Transportation Safety Board as we continue to mature our emergency response processes. 
As noted, SMS has become our core operating model, built on our culture of empowering everyone to report and identify risk, including the authority to stop work whenever necessary. Enhancing process safety with layers of protection and building accountability for effective asset management to reduce risk. 
You'll see additional enhancements to our safety plan in 2021. I am also pleased to note some recognition that NiSource received in mid-November when we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the seventh consecutive year. NiSource is 1 of 7 U.S. utilities on the 2020 list. The ranking is based on environmental, social and governance criteria and reflects our progress on our sustainability strategy which includes aggressive greenhouse gas reductions, safety enhancements and executing against $40 billion of long-term safety, asset modernization and renewable energy investment opportunities. 
We're honored to once again be included on this international benchmark for sustainable business practices, which recognizes the takeaways. Our 2020 financial and operational results reflects the resiliency of our business and our team as we executed on our safety and asset modernization programs. Our electric generation transition strategy reliably served customers through the historic COVID pandemic and took steps to reposition the company to execute on significant long-term growth opportunities. 
We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.28 to $1.36 in 2021. Our long-term growth commitments remain in place these include $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual growth, safety and modernization investments from 2021 through 2024, plus $1.8 billion to $2 billion in renewable generation investments across 2022 and 2023. 
And compound annual earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 through 2024, with near-term growth of 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2023. Our electric generation strategy continues to advance with our first 2 wind projects complete and numerous other renewable projects in development.

I'd keep in mind that the retirement schedule may or may not be as valuable. We're looking out that far from a 2021 vantage point. So we'll take all of that under consideration. The 1 thing I'd say though, Mike, and I think this is obvious to all of us with the current events that are going on across the industry right now, it just starkly demonstrates the reliability and capacity are essential, and the integrated resource planning process itself is critically important. 
So that's why our approach really starts with reliability and balances all the other attributes against that fundamental requirement. So this experience that we're seeing now will be -- should provide critical learning for us as we go through the next round of the IRP.

Especially with the fully forecasted rate year convention, it almost sets up pattern that calls for an annual filing. 
And that we've only missed that maybe one-time in the last decade. There may be 1 year out of the last 10 where we didn't file an annual case.

And I'll note that front and center for us has been and will always be the health, safety and wellness of our employees and safety for our customers, and that's a key driver of the whole outlook for COVID. Regarding the economic recovery, and you can see from our results, reason to be what I'd call, cautiously optimistic though there's other impacts to consider, including ongoing expenses, that could relate to adjustments to work protocols, other revenue collections, regulatory treatment and potential after shocks in the economy. 
And all of those are hard to predict, but certainly something we should all be attentive to. All considered to the spirit of your question and recognizing that we're deep in the first quarter right now and clearly deep in the heating season with the weather we're experiencing across the country. Our guidance reaffirmation today reflects our base case for 2021 and also our long-term growth rate. 
From a margin standpoint, the residential usage has remained strong. It really came out of the came out of the block strong at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. And we've seen that trend continue into 2021. Commercial usage has been consistently down and continues to be a profile that we're going to closely monitor and perhaps is the most strong indicator of recovery across our territories. 
Industrial usage, admittedly not all perfectly correlated with COVID factors. There's a number of things that can drive industrial usage. So it's hard to say deterministically that it's all COVID. But that was the most impacted in 2020, though the deep impacts were concentrated in the second quarter, right at the beginning of the pandemic, and we've seen steady recovery ever since then, and that continues today. 
But any change in that trend, and that's the Aftershock question, could obviously be impactful to our results. So again, all of that kind of adds up to reason to be cautiously optimistic about recovery and the path ahead. And as we noted earlier on the call, we would expect to have more clarity by the time our first quarter call comes around. We'll certainly have the heating season behind us, always a big quarter for us. And that should put us in a position to tighten up our outlook on COVID."

Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our fourth quarter and full year earnings release, which we issued earlier today. 
2020 was a year like no other. Despite the challenges of a historic global pandemic, the NiSource team remained focused on our core mission of providing safe, reliable energy to our customers and the communities we serve while, at the same time, enhancing our position to execute on significant long-term growth opportunities. Our 2020 financial and operation results reflect the resiliency of our business and continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs as well as our transition away from coal generation.
In Indiana, we completed 2 wind power projects in December, and we continue to expect that our infrastructure and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emission 90% by 2030.  
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In 2020, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.32 per share, as our cost management and regulatory mitigation efforts reduced the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to some I've mentioned already, we achieved a number of other key milestones in 2020. 
We invested $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utilities, primarily on safety and asset modernization, which remains a top priority. We advanced and matured our Safety Management System and safety enhancement initiatives, and 70% of our low-pressure systems are now protected with automatic shutoff devices and remote monitoring.
We launched our transformative NiSource Next initiative to support our safety initiatives, build organizational capabilities and enhance our efficiency. We sold the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts business, completing the transaction in 8 months. We lowered the weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt by 60 basis points and enhanced our liquidity through the COVID-19 pandemic. And we continue to see strong demand for natural gas, experiencing a net gain of more than 30,000 gas customers across our 6 state footprint.  
We are today reaffirming our 2021 non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance of $1.28 to $1.36 per share. Consistent with the long-term growth plan we provided at Investor Day, we expect to make $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual growth, safety and asset modernization investments from 2021 through 2024, and $1.8 billion to $2 billion in renewable generation investments through 2023. I will note that we do expect an order in our Pennsylvania base rate case in the first quarter with rates that would be retroactive to January 23.  
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our 2020 financial performance in more detail."

Looking at our 2020 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $508 million or $1.32 per share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $495 million or $1.32 per share in 2019",692,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. 
Looking at our 2020 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $508 million or $1.32 per share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $495 million or $1.32 per share in 2019. I would note the loss of fourth quarter earnings is related to the sale of CMA reduced 2020 non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.05. 
Looking more closely at our segment 12-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5. Operating earnings were up about $36 million for the year in our gas segment. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were down about $19 million due to the sale of CMA, partially offset by infrastructure program revenues and increased customer growth. Operating expenses, also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were down about $55 million, mostly due to the CMA sale and lower employee and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased COVID-related costs.  
In our electric segment, 12-month non-GAAP operating earnings were down by nearly $40 million driven primarily by an approximately $16 million increase in operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to new rates from the recent rate case, partially offset by COVID-related impacts from customer usage, late payment fees and reconnection fees. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were up by approximately $55 million due to the increased depreciation expenses.  
Turning to Slide 6. We provide additional details about the financial impact of COVID-19. As you can see, we're seeing lower commercial and industrial sales, which are partially offset by increased residential sales. We're also seeing reduced late payment and reconnection fees as well as higher bad debt and other expenses. 
The total growth impact of COVID-19 in 2020 was approximately $0.10 per share. This impact was partially offset by non safety-related cost management and regulatory solutions, bringing the net 2020 impact of COVID-19 to approximately $0.05 per share.  
Consistent with our base case, we currently expect an additional COVID impact in 2021 of approximately $0.05 per share, which is factored into our 2021 non-GAAP EPS guidance range. While we're monitoring the pandemic closely, to date, it has not presented significant barriers to our safety and infrastructure modernization programs or long-term growth. As Joe mentioned, we are reaffirming both our 2021 earnings guidance and the guidance for long-term CapEx and EPS CAGR that we outlined at Investor Day.
Now turning to Slide 7. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $9.7 billion, of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. Following the successful liability management transaction in the third quarter, the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 years and weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.7 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization programs. Our credit ratings from all 3 major rating agencies are investment grade, and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. 
Let's take a quick look at Slide 9, which highlights our current financing plan. I would just note that we continue to look at ways to optimize the financing of our growth strategy. We are currently evaluating scenarios, utilizing hybrids and/or convertibles that get 50% or more equity credit with the rating agencies and could minimize the need for block equity offering in 2022 or 2023. We would anticipate a hybrid or convertible offering sometime in the first half of 2021.  
I would also note that next week, we plan to file a new at-the-market, or ATM, equity program to satisfy our ATM needs for the next 3 years. Just to remind everyone, our guidance is inclusive of this financing plan.  
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe, who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates for our gas and electric businesses."

Now let's take a look at some NiSource Utilities highlights for the fourth quarter and early first quarter of 2021, starting with our gas operations on Slide 10. In Pennsylvania, our base rate case remains pending before the Public Utility Commission. The application originally filed in April 2020 was modified in December and now seeks an annual revenue increase of $76.8 million to invest in, modernize and upgrade our existing natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. An order is expected in the first quarter of 2021, with new rates expected to become effective retroactive to January 23, 2021.  
In Maryland, the Public Service Commission approved the settlement in our base rate request in November 2020. The approved settlement supports further upgrading and replacement of our pipelines and is expected to increase annual revenue by $3.3 million, including $1.3 million of current tracker revenue. New rates became effective in December 2020.
In Indiana, our latest tracker update was approved in December in our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. The update covers $26 million in incremental capital invested under the program between January and June of 2020, and new rates became effective in January of 2021. 
The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission in 2020 approved a 6-year extension of the program, including nearly $950 million in planned capital investments through 2025, to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing gas transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or TDISC tracker.  
Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 11. In January, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the latest tracker update request in our long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. The approved electric TDISC tracker update covers more than $122 million in incremental capital investments made between July 2019 and June 2020, and new rates became effective this month. 
This well-established program includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further enhance safety and reliability. The program originally approved by the IURC in 2016 includes approximately $1.2 billion in electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022.  
And now I'll ask Shawn Anderson to provide an update about our renewable generation projects."

As Joe shared earlier, we completed our first 2 wind projects, Rosewater and Jordan Creek, on time in December, which is an exciting milestone and executing our generation transition. Rosewater is our joint venture with EDP Renewables Nort",769,"Thank you, Joe. As Joe shared earlier, we completed our first 2 wind projects, Rosewater and Jordan Creek, on time in December, which is an exciting milestone and executing our generation transition. Rosewater is our joint venture with EDP Renewables North America and our tax equity partner, Wells Fargo. Jordan Creek represents a power purchase agreement, or PPA, with NextEra Energy Resources. These completed projects are now powering more than 125,000 homes across Indiana with cleaner, more cost-effective energy. 
Our third wind project, Indiana Crossroads, remains under construction. This joint venture with EDP is expected to be in service at the end of this year.  
These renewable projects are consistent with our 2018 integrated resource plan, within which the preferred pathway plans to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all coal generation by 2028, to be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options. The plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers an estimated $4 billion over 30 years.  
As Joe noted earlier, we continue to expect to make $1.8 billion to $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023. To date, we have executed agreements representing approximately $1.25 billion of this anticipated investment. Commercial negotiations for additional solar and storage capacity continue to advance. Half of the capacity and the replacement plan is targeted to be owned by joint ventures that will include NIPSCO and tax equity partners as the members. The balance of new capacity is expected to be primarily in the form of PPAs.  
In November 2020, we filed applications with the IURC for the approval of the Dunns Bridge I and II, and Cavalry Solar Energy Centers. These 3 Indiana projects are build transfer agreements with NextEra Energy Resources and represent a combined capital investment of approximately $850 million for NIPSCO. These projects are expected to be placed into service across 2022 and 2023. 
NextEra will construct the solar and storage facilities, and we plan to form joint ventures with tax equity investors to own, operate and maintain these assets. An IURC order is expected in the second quarter of 2021. 
We continue to fill out the balance of our capacity. In January, the IURC approved our Brickyard and Greensboro Solar and storage PPAs. NextEra Energy Resources will develop these projects, which are expected to be completed in mid-2023. 
And in December 2020, NIPSCO announced a long-term PPA with the clean energy infrastructure business of Capital Dynamics to develop Gibson Solar, the 280-megawatt solar project in Gibson County, Indiana. NIPSCO filed an application with the IURC for approval of this project in January 2021. Construction is expected to begin in 2022, with commercial operations to begin in 2023.  
Also in December of 2020, NIPSCO filed an application with the IURC for approval of the Green River Solar PPA. Advanced negotiations continue for additional build transfer agreements to fill out the remainder of our capacity needs. We expect those negotiations to be completed in the first half of 2021, and the necessary regulatory filings coming shortly thereafter.  
In the fourth quarter of 2021, NIPSCO will be submitting an integrated resource plan for the IURC that will continue to outline its long-term generation plans, including the planned retirement of Michigan City Generating Station. The preferred plan that emerges from the 2021 IRP could create additional capital investment opportunities.  
Before we move on from our electric story, I would like to provide a quick update on units 14 and 15 at our Schahfer Generating Station. As you know, all 4 coal units at Schahfer are planned to retire by May 2023, as outlined in the 2018 IRP. As we continue to evaluate the economics of our generating fleet and the ongoing costs and investments required to keep the coal units operational, we determined that the right path forward for us is to initiate the retirement of 2 of the 4 coal units at Schahfer. Units 14 and 15 will retire by the end of 2021, which is the most economic decision for our customers. NIPSCO's remaining fleet and new renewable capacity and secured capacity purchases will continue to reliably serve the energy needs to our customers. 
To be clear, our earnings guidance is not impacted by this decision. We are excited about the significant progress in executing the plan we identified in our 2018 IRP and further detailed at our Investor Day, and we look forward to more projects and updates to come in future quarters.  
Now I will turn the call back over to Joe."

As I noted earlier, our safety enhancement initiatives advanced and matured in 2020. Our implementation of API's Safety Management System, or SMS, transition from an accelerated project launch to an established operating model within NiSource, and we expanded the implementation to our electric business.  
With the ongoing support and advice from the independent Quality Review Board, we are continuing to mature our SMS processes, capabilities and talent. And we're collaborating with our industry peers to enhance safety and reduce operational risk. 
We had a number of safety milestones in 2020 that are worth calling out. We launched mobile gas leak detection pilot projects and implemented a service line mapping strategy to enhance records quality across our footprint. We added special clearance processes and other layers of protection to critical field operations activities. 
Our gas meter shops and our fabrication facility earned ISO 9001 certification, a strong first step in a continuing quality effort. And the final safety recommendation around emergency preparedness and response was closed by the National Transportation Safety Board, as we continue to mature our emergency response processes.  
As noted, SMS has become our core operating model, built on our culture of empowering everyone to report and identify risk, including the authority to stop work whenever necessary, enhancing process safety with layers of protection and building accountability for effective asset management to reduce risk. You'll see additional enhancements to our safety plan in 2021. 
I am also pleased to note some recognition that NiSource received in mid-November when we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the seventh consecutive year. NiSource is 1 of 7 U.S. utilities on the 2020 list. The ranking is based on environmental, social and governance criteria, and reflects our progress on our sustainability strategy, which includes aggressive greenhouse gas reductions, safety enhancements and executing against $40 billion of long-term safety, asset modernization and renewable energy investment opportunities. We're honored to once again be included on this international benchmark for sustainable business practices, which recognizes the comprehensive focus on ESG principles at the core of how we run our business. 
Before turning to the Q&A portion of today's call, I'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. Our 2020 financial and operational results reflects the resiliency of our business and our team as we executed on our safety and asset modernization programs, our electric generation transition strategy reliably served customers through the historic COVID pandemic and took steps to reposition the company to execute on significant long-term growth opportunities.  
We continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.28 to $1.36 in 2021. Our long-term growth commitments remain in place. These include $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual growth, safety and modernization investments from 2021 through 2024, plus $1.8 billion to $2 billion in renewable generation investments across 2022 and 2023, and compound annual earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 through 2024, with near-term growth of 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2023. Our electric generation strategy continues to advance with our first 2 wind projects complete and numerous other renewable projects in development.  
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions."

We'll kick off the process with stakeholder engagement relatively soon. And then in the middle of the summer after we developed scenarios is when you'd likely see, to the extent it helps provide insight any RFPs, that might be included. 
I'd keep in mind that the retirement schedule for the Michigan City plant drives the capacity need for the future because we pretty got to 2023 capacity replacement plans set. And so RFPs may or may not be as valuable, looking out that far from a 2021 vantage point. So we'll take all of that under consideration. 
The one thing I'd say though, Mike, and I think this is obvious to all of us, with the current events that are going on across the industry right now, it just starkly demonstrates the reliability and capacity are essential, and the Integrated Resource Planning process itself is critically important. So that's why our approach really starts with reliability and balances all the other attributes against that fundamental requirement. 
So this experience that we're seeing now will be -- should provide critical learning for us as we go through the next round of the IRP. And so I don't want to predict with a high degree of precision, even the process at this point, because there's a lot to learn from what's happening in the markets."

We should see a commission decision soon enough, and we'll certainly keep you and all of our stakeholders updated as that plays out. 
And I won't front run any future filings, but if you look at the pace of investment in Pennsylvania and the historic cycle there, we've had over about a decade 8 rate cases settled with the stakeholders in Pennsylvania and well supported by the commission. So I think that track record and that pattern is a good indicator because our investment pace is as much -- is as strong as ever in Pennsylvania. it's a good indicator of what the future will likely look like. Especially with the fully forecasted rate year convention, it almost sets up a pattern that calls for an annual filing, and that we've only missed that maybe one time in the last decade.

Thanks, Richard, and I'll kick that off. And I'll note that front and center for us has been and will always be the health, safety and wellness of our employees and safety for our customers, and that's the key driver of the whole outlook for COVID. 
Regarding the economic recovery, and you can see from our results, reason to be, what I'd call, cautiously optimistic, though there's other impacts to consider, including ongoing expenses that could relate to adjustments to work protocols, other revenue collections, regulatory treatment and potential aftershocks in the economy, and all of those are hard to predict, but certainly something we should all be attentive to. 
All considered to the spirit of your question and recognizing that we're deep in the first quarter right now and clearly deep in the heating season with the weather we're experiencing across the country, our guidance reaffirmation today reflects our base case for 2021 and also our long-term growth rate. 
From a margin standpoint, the residential usage has remained strong. It really came out of the block strong at the beginning of the COVID pandemic, and we've seen that trend continue into 2021. Commercial usage has been consistently down and continues to be a profile that we're going to closely monitor and perhaps is the most strong indicator of recovery across our territories. 
Industrial usage, admittedly not all perfectly correlated with COVID factors. There's a number of things that can drive industrial usage, so it's hard to say deterministically that it's all COVID; but that was the most impacted in 2020, though the deep impacts were concentrated in the second quarter right at the beginning of the pandemic. And we've seen steady recovery ever since then, and that continues today. But any change in that trend, and that's the aftershock question, could obviously be impactful to our results. 
So again, all of that kind of adds up to reason to be cautiously optimistic about recovery and the path ahead. And as we noted earlier on the call, we would expect to have more clarity by the time our first quarter call comes around. We'll certainly have the heating season behind us. Always a big quarter for us, and that should put us in a position to tighten up our outlook on COVID."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today.

Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. With the successful completion of last month's convertible issuance, NiSource is well positioned to execute the next stage of our growth plan, driven by safety and asset modernization programs as well as our electric generation transition strategy. 
In Indiana, we kicked off our 2021 integrated resource plan process, which will inform our strategy beyond 2023, and we initiated 4 new renewable energy projects. We continue to expect that our infrastructure and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net point of our narrowed 2021 guidance through 2024. We also expect to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030. 
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In the first quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net cents per share. These results include increased earnings from our safety and modernization investments and reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. As you saw in our release, today, we narrowed our 2021 non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings guidance to $1.32 to $1.36 per share, which represents the upper half of the previous range. This narrowed range reflects lower than previously expected COVID impacts and more certainty with regulatory outcomes, offset by slightly higher diluted share count resulting from the equity unit issuance. We expect to make approximately $10 billion in capital investments through 2024. These include annual investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in growth, safety and modernization programs. In addition, our investments in renewable generation are now expected to total approximately $2 billion over this period. 
As we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day, NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania received an order in its 2020 rate case, and it has filed a new rate case to support its safety and modernization plans, which I will discuss in more detail later in this call. In addition, we have continued to successfully execute on our renewable energy strategy, adding 4 new renewable energy projects as part of our Your Energy, Your Future initiative. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in more detail."

Looking at our first quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $305 million or $0.77 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.",759,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our first quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $305 million or $0.77 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020. I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, or CMA, due to the sale closing in October of 2020. 
Looking more closely at our segment 3-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $374 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $18 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $84 million due to the sale of CMA, partially offset by increased infrastructure program revenues and customer growth. Operating expenses also net of the cost of energy and track expenses were lower by about $66 million, mostly due to the CMA sale and lower employee-related costs, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense. In our Electric segment, 3-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $91 million, which was approximately $11 million higher than the first quarter of 2020. This increase was driven primarily by an approximately $9 million increase in operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and track expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and track expenses were slightly lower due to environmental and employee-related costs. 
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9.8 billion, of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.9 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization program. Our credit ratings from all 3 major rating agencies are investment grade, and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. 
Let's take a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our updated financing plan. I would just note that following last month's equity unit issuance, we no longer expect to issue block or discrete equity through 2024. This issuance that receives 100% equity credit from all 3 agencies allows NiSource to tap and provide timely proceeds for our renewable investments. Most importantly, this issuance significantly derisk our financing plans and is consistent with all of our earnings, include an annual revenue increase of $63.5 million in the rate case we filed in 2020. This reflects our investments to modernize and upgrade our natural gas. In addition, the company filed another base rate case in March to support its ongoing safety and modernization program. In Kentucky, we received an order on April 30 from the Public Service Commission in our safety modification and replacement program tracker filing. This order approved $40 million in upgrades and replacements underway and $0.6 million of incremental revenue. In Indiana, NIPSCO continues its long-term gas modernization program. Nearly $950 million in capital investments are planned through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing gas transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or T disc tracker. Rates approved in our 2020 filing became effective in January of this year. In Virginia, we implemented rates approved in our 2020 steps to advance Virginia Energy or save tracker filing. 
Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. NIPSCO has filed notice to terminate its current electric transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge, or TDSIC plan. We expect to file a new 5-year plan on or soon after June 1. The updated plan will include newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. As mentioned earlier, we have begun our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP process. Similar to our 2018 IRP, the process will include an RFP for new resources. We plan to receive input from customers in a wide variety of other stakeholders throughout the year and expect to submit our plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission by November. 
I would now like to ask Shawn to provide more on the significance of the IRP and an update about our renewable generation projects."

We continue to make strong progress on our renewable generation transition. In total, we have announced 14 renewable projects, which will likely fill the balance of capacity necessary to replace the retiring units at our Shafer Generating Station, which continues to track for retirement by May 2023. 
The 4 new projects have been announced in 2021. They include 2 projects with EDP Renewables, Indiana Crossroads Solar Park, which is a build transfer agreement and is expected to enter service in 2022, and Indiana Crossroads II, which is a wind project announced as a power purchase agreement, or PPA, and is expected to enter service in 2023. We also announced Fairbanks Solar, a build transfer agreement with Invenergy, for a 250-megawatt project expected to be online in 2023. And finally, we signed a build transfer agreement with capital dynamics for a 200-megawatt project expected to be operational in 2023, named Elliot Solar. We have already begun the regulatory approval process for these projects. Upcoming shortly in the second quarter of 2021, we expect an order from the IURC on 4 previously filed projects. Our Dunns Bridge I and II, Cavalry Solar Energy Center and Green River Solar projects. 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all coal generation by 2028 to be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options. The plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers an estimated $4 billion over 30 years. The executed agreements we've announced are also within budget, representing approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments. The projects these agreements support represent NIPSCO's investment interest in the replacement capacity, which equates to approximately half of the total capacity needed. The remaining new capacity is in the form of power purchase agreements. 
Finally, as Joe has highlighted, in the fourth quarter of 2021, NIPSCO plans to submit a new integrated resource plan to the IURC that will continue to outline its long-term generation plans, including the planned retirement of Michigan City Generating Station. The preferred plan that emerges from the 2021 IRP could create additional capital investment opportunities. We are excited about the significant progress in executing our plan, and we look forward to more updates in the future quarters. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe."

I guess, Joe, do you see value in maybe to further simplify maybe your jurisdictional footprint, maybe shrink your balance sheet, shut off the ATMs and internal programs and kick some incremental dry powder, especially as we're seeing additional opportunities on the renewable side ramp up over the next few years? A little bit of a strategic start question."

And as we've said consistently, we're always exploring opportunities to drive and sustain long-term shareholder value, and that's really the underpinning of the question. And options for shaping our footprint and our business mix",409,"Yes. Yes. Thanks, Shahr. And as we've said consistently, we're always exploring opportunities to drive and sustain long-term shareholder value, and that's really the underpinning of the question. And options for shaping our footprint and our business mix are a key part of that, and we objectively and thoroughly evaluate those on an ongoing basis. The key backdrop for us is the current plan that has 10% or higher rate base growth in each of our utility companies, and that comprises the $40 billion of identified investments over 20 years that I think is uniquely well balanced and supported by constructive regulatory mechanisms and policy environments across our jurisdiction. So that all adds up to a strong hand with options and time to ensure any moves that we might make truly enhance value on a risk-adjusted basis. So very open minded, very deliberate and thoughtful about that, and it's -- as we work through, particularly this year, our electric IRP, as we've talked about today, and we refine other long-range investment plans particularly beyond 2023. It's a pretty clear plan out through '23. These options will all remain on the table. We'll continue to look at those opportunities. 
And then on the point about LDC values, we're all seeing that LDC value indicators in the private markets appeared to be really strong. And these are more aligned with the fundamentals and the sustainable growth that we see in the business. And so I think it's important to take that as an input that kind of cuts both ways, and then maybe even extending that perspective just a bit in a clean energy transition, supporting a modern high-tech economy. It's more important that we've solved for and plan for secure, reliable, resilient energy systems. And we think the natural gas system has a key role in that transition. So we're looking at all of that with a long-term shareholder value perspective, and it will always be an alternative to traditional we've done. It really does put us in a place of having more flexibility because it firmly puts us in our target range of 14% to 15% FFO to debt, which gives us luckily about how we grow the business.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. With the successful completion of last month's convertible issuance, NiSourc",421,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. With the successful completion of last month's convertible issuance, NiSource is well positioned to execute the next stage of our growth plan, driven by safety and asset modernization programs as well as our electric generation transition strategy.  In Indiana, we kicked off our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan process, which will inform our strategy beyond 2023, and we initiated 4 new renewable energy projects. We continue to expect that our infrastructure and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating of our narrowed 2021 guidance through 2024. We also expect to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030.
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In the first quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net cents per share. These results include increased earnings from our safety and modernization investments and reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. As you saw in our release, today, we narrowed our 2021 non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings guidance to $1.32 to $1.36 per share, which represents the upper half of the previous range. This narrowed range reflects lower than previously expected COVID impacts and more certainty with regulatory outcome, offset by slightly higher diluted share count resulting from the equity unit issuance. We expect to make approximately $10 billion in capital investments through 2024. These include annual investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in growth, safety and modernization programs. In addition, our investments in renewable generation are now expected to total approximately $2 billion over this period.
As we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day, NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania received an order in its 2020 rate case, and it has filed a new rate case to support its safety and modernization plans, which I will discuss in more detail later in this call. In addition, we have continued to successfully execute on our renewable energy strategy, adding 4 new renewable energy projects as part of our Your Energy, Your Future initiative.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in more detail."

Looking at our first quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $305 million or $0.77 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.",758,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our first quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $305 million or $0.77 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020. I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, or CMA, due to the sale closing in October of 2020. 
Looking more closely at our segment 3-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $374 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $18 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $84 million due to the sale of CMA, partially offset by increased infrastructure program revenues and customer growth. Operating expenses also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $66 million, mostly due to the CMA sale and lower employee-related costs, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense. In our electric segment, 3-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $91 million, which was approximately $11 million higher than the first quarter of 2020. This increase was driven primarily by an approximately $9 million increase in operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were slightly lower due to environmental and employee-related costs.
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9.8 billion, of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 year, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.9 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization program. Our credit ratings from all 3 major rating agencies are investment grade, and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. 
Let's take a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our updated financing plan. I would just note that following last month's equity unit issuance, we no longer expect to issue block or discrete equity through 2024. This issuance that receives 100% equity credit from all 3 agencies allows NiSource to tap and provide timely proceeds for our renewable investments. Most importantly, this issuance significantly derisk our financing plans and is consistent with all of our earnings, include an annual revenue increase of $63.5 million in the rate case we filed in 2020. This reflects our investments to modernize and upgrade our natural gas. In addition, the company filed another base rate case in March to support its ongoing safety and modernization program. In Kentucky, we received an order on April 30 from the Public Service Commission in our safety modification and replacement program tracker filing. This order approved $40 million in upgrades and replacements underway and $0.6 million of incremental revenue. In Indiana, NIPSCO continues its long-term gas modernization program. Nearly $950 million in capital investments are planned through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing gas Transmission, Distribution and Storage Improvement Charge, or TDSIC tracker. Rates approved in our 2020 filing became effective in January of this year. In Virginia, we implemented rates approved in our 2020 steps to advance Virginia energy or save tracker filing.
Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. NIPSCO has filed notice to terminate its current electric Transmission, Distribution and Storage Improvement Charge, or TDSIC plan. We expect to file a new 5-year plan on or soon after June 1. The updated plan will include newly identified projects, aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. As mentioned earlier, we have begun our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP process. Similar to our 2018 IRP, the process will include an RFP for new resources. We plan to receive input from customers in a wide variety of other stakeholders throughout the year and expect to submit our plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission by November.
I would now like to ask Shawn to provide more on the significance of the IRP and an update about our renewable generation projects."

We continue to make strong progress on our renewable generation transition. In total, we have announced 14 renewable projects, which will likely fill the balance of capacity necessary to replace the retiring units at our Shafer Generating Station, which continues to track for retirement by May 2023.  4 new projects have been announced in 2021. They include 2 projects with EDP Renewables Indiana Crossroads Solar Park, which is a build transfer agreement and is expected to enter service in 2022; and Indiana Crossroads II, which is a wind project announced as a Power Purchase Agreement, or PPA, and is expected to enter service in 2023. We also announced Fairbanks Solar, a build transfer agreement with Invenergy, for a 250-megawatt project expected to be online in 2023. And finally, we signed a build transfer agreement with Capital Dynamics for a 200-megawatt project expected to be operational in 2023, named Elliot Solar. We have already begun the regulatory approval process for these projects. Upcoming shortly in the second quarter of 2021, we expect an order from the IURC on 4 previously filed projects. Our Dunns Bridge I and II, Cavalry Solar Energy Center and Green River Solar projects. 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all coal generation by 2028 to be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options. The plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers an estimated $4 billion over 30 years. The executed agreements we've announced are also within budget, representing approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments. The projects these agreements support represent NIPSCO's investment interest in the replacement capacity, which equates to approximately half of the total capacity needed. The remaining new capacity is in the form of Power Purchase Agreements.
Finally, as Joe has highlighted, in the fourth quarter of 2021, NIPSCO plans to submit a new Integrated Resource Plan to the IURC that will continue to outline its long-term generation plans, including the planned retirement of Michigan City Generating Station. The preferred plan that emerges from the 2021 IRP could create additional capital investment opportunities. We are excited about the significant progress in executing our plan, and we look forward to more updates in the future quarters.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe."

Our Safety Management System, SMS, is an established operating model within NiSource. Recent advances in SMS include expanded quality management and achieving Gold Shovel Standard Certification. We are continuously enhancing process safety capabilities and ensuring effective asset management to reduce risk. I'd also like to note that we've begun a third-party validation of our SMS implementation, and we are working toward accreditation in 2022.
Before turning to the Q&A portion of today's call, I'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. With last month's convertible issuance, NiSource is well positioned to execute the next stage of our growth plan, driven by continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs as well as our electric generation transition strategy. We are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings guidance to $1.32 to $1.36 per share, which represents the upper half of the previous guidance. We expect to make approximately $10 billion in capital investments through 2024. These include annual investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in growth, safety and modernization programs. In addition, our investments in renewable generation are now expected to total approximately $2 billion over this period. As we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day, NiSource continues to expect to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. In addition, we now have a total of 14 renewable energy projects as part of our Your Energy, Your Future initiative.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions."

I guess, Joe, do you see value in maybe to further simplify  your jurisdictional footprint, maybe shrink your balance sheet, shut off the ATMs and internal programs and kick some incremental dry powder, especially as we're seeing additional opportunities on the renewable side ramp up over the next few years? A little bit of a strategic start question."

And as we've said consistently, we're always exploring opportunities to drive and sustain long-term shareholder value, and that's really the underpinning of the question. And options for shaping our footprint and our business mix",408,"Yes. Yes. Thanks, Shahr. And as we've said consistently, we're always exploring opportunities to drive and sustain long-term shareholder value, and that's really the underpinning of the question. And options for shaping our footprint and our business mix are a key part of that, and we objectively and thoroughly evaluate those on an ongoing basis. The key backdrop for us is the current plan that has 10% or higher rate base growth in each of our utility companies, and that comprises the $40 billion of identified investments over 20 years that I think is uniquely well balanced and supported by constructive regulatory mechanisms and policy environments across our jurisdiction. So that all adds up to a strong hand with options and time to ensure any moves that we might make truly enhance value on a risk-adjusted basis. So very open minded, very deliberate and thoughtful about that. And it's -- as we work through, particularly this year, our electric IRP, as we've talked about today, and we refine other long-range investment plans particularly beyond 2023. It's a pretty clear plan out through '23. These options will all remain on the table. We'll continue to look at those opportunities.
And then on the point about LDC values, we're all seeing that LDC value indicators in the private markets appeared to be really strong. And these are more aligned with the fundamentals and the sustainable growth that we see in the business. And so I think it's important to take that as an input that kind of cuts both ways, and then maybe even extending that perspective just a bit in a clean energy transition, supporting a modern high-tech economy. It's more important that we've solved for and planned for secure, reliable, resilient energy systems. We think the natural gas system has a key role in that transition. So we're looking at all of that with a long-term shareholder value perspective, and it will always be an alternative to traditional we've done. It really does put us in a place of having more flexibility because it firmly puts us in our target range of 14% to 15% FFO to debt, which gives us luckily about how we grow the business. And certainly, as we continue to look at the long-term plan, we'll look at portfolio, but we'll also look at what are those growth opportunities in our business and the timing of those growth investments and how we finance those."

And then you also have an interplay between your TDSIC timing and your rate cases. So that's another driver of the timing for this filing."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today.

Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. With the successful completion of last month's convertible issuance, NiSource is well positioned to execute the next stage of our growth plan, driven by safety and asset modernization programs as well as our electric generation transition strategy. 
In Indiana, we kicked off our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan process, which will inform our strategy beyond 2023, and we initiated 4 new renewable energy projects. We continue to expect that our infrastructure and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from the midpoint of our narrowed 2021 guidance through 2024. We also expect to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030.
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In the first quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings of $0.77 per share. These results include increased earnings from our safety and modernization investments and reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. As you saw in our release, today, we narrowed our 2021 non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings guidance to $1.32 to $1.36 per share, which represents the upper half of the previous range. This narrowed range reflects lower than previously expected COVID impacts and more certainty with regulatory outcomes, offset by slightly higher diluted share count resulting from the equity unit issuance. We expect to make approximately $10 billion in capital investments through 2024. These include annual investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in growth, safety and modernization programs. In addition, our investments in renewable generation are now expected to total approximately $2 billion over this period.
As we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day, NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania received an order in its 2020 rate case, and it has filed a new rate case to support its safety and modernization plans, which I will discuss in more detail later in this call. In addition, we have continued to successfully execute on our renewable energy strategy, adding 4 new renewable energy projects as part of our Your Energy, Your Future initiative.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in more detail."
292092,712087345,2321358,"NiSource Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our first quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $305 million or $0.77 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.",486,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our first quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $305 million or $0.77 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020. I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, or CMA, due to the sale closing in October of 2020. 
Looking more closely at our segment 3-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $374 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $18 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $84 million due to the sale of CMA, partially offset by increased infrastructure program revenues and customer growth. Operating expenses, also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were lower by about $66 million, mostly due to the CMA sale and lower employee-related costs, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense. 
In our electric segment, 3-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $91 million, which was approximately $11 million higher than the first quarter of 2020. This increase was driven primarily by an approximately $9 million increase in operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were slightly lower due to environmental and employee-related costs.
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $9.8 billion, of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.9 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization program. Our credit ratings from all 3 major rating agencies are investment-grade, and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. 
Let's take a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our updated financing plan. I would just note that following last month's equity unit issuance, we no longer expect to issue block or discrete equity through 2024. This issuance that receives 100% equity credit from all 3 agencies allows NiSource capture share price upside and provide timely proceeds for our renewable investments. Most importantly, this issuance significantly derisk our financing plans and is consistent with all of our earnings and credit commitments. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe, who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates for our gas and electric businesses."

Now let's look some NiSource utilities highlights for the first quarter of 2021, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. 
In Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission approved an annual revenue increase of $63.5 million in the rate case we filed in 2020. This reflects our investments to modernize and upgrade our natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. The Commission also approved an ROE of 9.86%, with rates effective as of January 23 of this year. 
In addition, the company filed another base rate case in March to support its ongoing safety and modernization program. In Kentucky, we received an order on April 30 from the Public Service Commission in our safety modification and replacement program tracker filing. This order approves $40 million in upgrades and replacements underway in 2021 and $2.6 million of incremental revenue. 
In Indiana, NIPSCO continues its long-term gas modernization program. Nearly $950 million in capital investments are planned through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing gas Transmission, Distribution and Storage Improvement Charge, or TDSIC tracker. Rates approved in our 2020 filing became effective in January of this year. In Virginia, we implemented rates approved in our 2020 Steps to Advance Virginia Energy or SAVE tracker filing.
Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. NIPSCO has filed notice to terminate its current electric Transmission, Distribution and Storage Improvement Charge, or TDSIC plan. We expect to file a new 5-year plan on or soon after June 1. The updated plan will include newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. 
As mentioned earlier, we have begun our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP process. Similar to our 2018 IRP, the process will include an RFP for new resources. We plan to receive input from customers in a wide variety of other stakeholders throughout the year and expect to submit our plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission by November.
I would now like to ask Shawn to provide more on the significance of the IRP and an update about our renewable generation projects."

We continue to make strong progress on our renewable generation transition. In total, we have announced 14 renewable projects, which will likely fill the balance of capacity necessary to replace the retiring units at our Schahfer Generating Station, which continue to track for retirement by May 2023. Four new projects have been announced in 2021. They include 2 projects with EDP Renewables, Indiana Crossroads Solar Park, which is a build transfer agreement and is expected to enter service in 2022; and Indiana Crossroads II, which is a wind project announced as a Power Purchase Agreement, or PPA, and is expected to enter service in 2023. 
We also announced Fairbanks Solar, a build transfer agreement with Invenergy, for a 250-megawatt project expected to be online in 2023. And finally, we signed a build transfer agreement with Capital Dynamics for a 200-megawatt project expected to be operational in 2023, named Elliott Solar. We have already begun the regulatory approval process for these projects. 
Upcoming shortly in the second quarter of 2021, we expect an order from the IURC on 4 previously filed projects, our Dunns Bridge I and II, Cavalry Solar Energy Center and Green River Solar projects. All of these updates continue to track on time to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all coal generation by 2028 to be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options. The plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers an estimated $4 billion over 30 years. 
The executed agreements we've announced are also within budget, representing approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments. The projects these agreements support represent NIPSCO's investment interest in the replacement capacity, which equates to approximately half of the total capacity needed. The remaining new capacity is in the form of Power Purchase Agreements.
Finally, as Joe has highlighted, in the fourth quarter of 2021, NIPSCO plans to submit a new Integrated Resource Plan to the IURC that will continue to outline its long-term generation plans, including the planned retirement of Michigan City Generating Station. The preferred plan that emerges from the 2021 IRP could create additional capital investment opportunities. We are excited about the significant progress in executing our plan, and we look forward to more updates in the future quarters.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe."

And as we've said consistently, we're always exploring opportunities to drive and sustain long-term shareholder value, and that's really the underpinning of the question. And options for shaping our footprint and our business mix are a key part of that, and we objectively and thoroughly evaluate those on an ongoing basis. The key backdrop for us is the current plan that has 10% or higher rate base growth in each of our utility companies, and that comprises the $40 billion of identified investments over 20 years that I think is uniquely well balanced and supported by constructive regulatory mechanisms and policy environments across our jurisdiction. 
So that all adds up to a strong hand with options and time to ensure any moves that we might make truly enhance value on a risk-adjusted basis. So very open minded, very deliberate and thoughtful about that. And it's -- as we work through, particularly this year, our electric IRP, as we've talked about today, and we refine other long-range investment plans particularly beyond 2023. It's a pretty clear plan out through '23. These options will all remain on the table. We'll continue to look at those opportunities.
And then on the point about LDC values, we're all seeing that LDC value indicators in the private markets appeared to be really strong. And these are more aligned with the fundamentals and the sustainable growth that we see in the business. And so I think it's important to take that as an input that kind of cuts both ways, and then maybe even extending that perspective just a bit in a clean energy transition, supporting a modern high-tech economy. It's more important that we've solved for and planned for secure, reliable, resilient energy systems. And we think the natural gas system has a key role in that transition. 
So we're looking at all of that with a long-term shareholder value perspective, and it will always be an alternative to traditional financing, as you noted."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today.

Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. We made significant progress in our generation transition and the current renewable replacement plan, with Indiana Commission approval now received for all of our joint venture renewable projects. In addition, we have received more than 180 proposals in our 2021 integrated resource plan, or IRP process, which will inform our generation replacement strategy in Indiana beyond 2023. We continue to expect that our infrastructure programs and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In the second quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings of $0.13 per share. Results reflect safety and modernization investments, COVID impacts, and they reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. We expect 2021 earnings of $1.32 to $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings. We continue to expect annual growth, safety and modernization investments of $1.9 to $2.2 billion, plus approximately $2 billion in renewables and associated transmission investments through 2023.
NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. As I mentioned, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission has approved 13 of our 14 proposed renewable energy projects and the new RFP for electric capacity and energy associated with NIPSCO's 2021 IRP, that is currently underway, has drawn strong engagement from the vendor community. In other parts of our business, we filed rate cases in Ohio, Kentucky and Maryland during the quarter, in addition to the case filed during the first quarter in Pennsylvania, where we are in advanced settlement discussions.
Safety advancements continue across NiSource, guided by our implementation of the industry's safety management system, which serves as our core operating model. Recent advancements include the accelerated integration of contractors into our safety plans and deployment of Picarro advanced leak detection technology in 2 more states. Our environmental performance targets represent another vital commitment. I'm pleased to say that we remain on target. We expect to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 from 2005 levels. That includes a 50% reduction in methane emissions from gas mains and services by 2025. On that commitment, NiSource has already achieved an estimated 39% reduction in pipeline methane emissions compared to 2005 levels. Our infrastructure replacement programs are driving these improvements. Also, last year, more than 1 million of our customers participated in our energy efficiency programs.
On that note, let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the second quarter, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. The Ohio rate case is 1 of 3 new rate cases filed in the second quarter. We are requesting an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million, net of the trackers being rolled into base rates. Pending a decision from the PUCO, new rates would be effective in mid-2022. In Kentucky, we filed a request for an approximately $27 million annual revenue increase net of trackers. And in Maryland, we filed a case on May 14, once again, net of trackers, requesting about a $5 million annual revenue increase. New rates are proposed to go into effect in December of this year. In Pennsylvania, we filed a case just before the end of the first quarter, requesting an annual increase in revenue of approximately $98 million.
Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. I'll touch on NIPSCO's electric TDSIC plan. We filed a new 5-year plan in June. The $1.6 billion plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. We expect to receive an order from the IURC in December of this year. The other items on this slide relate to our transition out of coal generation, and I'll turn it over to Shawn Anderson to give more detail."

We continue to be encouraged by the strong progress advancing our renewable generation projects stemming from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP. Over the course of the last 3 months, 8 renewables projects informed by the 2018 IRP preferred pathway received approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. This brings NIPSCO to the verge of an important milestone with 13 of 14 renewables projects approved to advance and replace the retiring capacity of the Shafer generating station. Importantly, this includes all joint venture projects and leaves crossroads to wind, a power purchase agreement as the only project to waiting approval. Combining these new generating facilities with a number of transmission projects to support system reliability across the new footprint, NiSource continues to track toward approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023.
We are excited these projects will produce clean, reliable power for our communities, while saving NIPSCO customers approximately $4 billion over the long term. While the commercial and regulatory processes have advanced to support the preferred pathway from the 2018 IRP, NIPSCO's 2021 IRP process is well underway and continues to track within its time line. As noted in our release, in second quarter, we completed a request for proposal solicitation, similar to the process deployed in 2018. We are pleased with the response in terms of both the quality and the quantity of the proposals, which continues to show high levels of engagement in the vendor community as we advance our generation transition. Furthermore, with these more than 180 proposals covering a wide range of technologies and ownership constructs, it continues to point to a robust market across generation technologies, which will drive value for our customers and stakeholders.
A few notes about the process and timing. The IRP analysis that we are currently stepping through will utilize data from the RFP to help inform the broad resource portfolio options for NIPSCO in terms of Michigan City retirement timing, choices of replacement technologies and ownership constructs. We will share directional findings with stakeholders at public advisory meetings in the third quarter, incorporating stakeholder feedback along the way. We expect to develop a stakeholder supported preferred resource path within the 2021 IRP, which will be submitted to the IURC on or before November 1. Once the preferred plan is finalized and communicated, execution activities could commence, which may include commercial negotiations and further due diligence on specific assets or projects. Any specific projects then identified, which support this preferred plan would represent incremental projects beyond the 14 highlighted earlier and in addition to the approximately $2 billion in renewable investments NIPSCO has already filed. These are significant steps within NiSource and are part of our energy transition, which we are calling your energy, your future, as we work with stakeholders to create a dependable, affordable and sustainable energy model, delivering the reliability our customers can trust.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our second quarter financial performance in more detail."

I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts due to the sale closing in October of 2020.
Looking more closely at our segment 3-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5. Gas distribution [Audio Gap] operating earnings were about $66 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $8 million versus last year [Audio Gap] down about $28 million due to the sale of CMA [Audio Gap] upward in expenses also [Audio Gap] offset by higher empoyee related [Audio Gap] costs and outside services  [Audio Gap], which was nearly $5 million lower than the second quarter of 2020.

Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were up about $16 million due to generation related maintenance and employee-related costs.
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.2 billion, of which about $9.1 billion [Audio Gap] was long-term debt in years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. With Moody's recently concluding their latest credit review, all 3 major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment-grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.
Let's take a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan. There are no changes to our plan since last quarter's equity unit issuance. Last quarter's issuance has significantly derisked our financing plans and is consistent with all of our earnings and credit commitments. As Joe mentioned in our key takeaways, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. I should remind everyone that we're stating the guidance and diluted earnings per share due to last quarter's equity issuance.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions."

It seems like just on the slides that language is no longer on there. Just wanted to get your color and latest thoughts on any potential for that in your planning period. And whether in the near term, it's just that given the equity units and other funding that's already planned for the base CapEx, whether there is no immediate fee to raise that type of cash for other CapEx?"

We remain focused on long-term shareholder value. That hasn't changed. And we're evaluating market conditions and our portfolio is an ongoing part of that process. And so though it's related to the financing, as you noted, we continue to view any asset sale as primarily a strategic decision based on long-term shareholder value, more than as a way to satisfy any near-term financing needs. And that's really -- I mean, we've stated it over and over, that's underpinned by our plan that drives 7% to 9% long-term growth, inclusive of all financing in the current planning horizon and without any asset sales. So clearly, a strategic shift would need to enhance what's already a strong plan. That said, given our exceptionally large known CapEx cycle and potential future investment opportunities that will unfold as we go forward and continued modest equity funding needs that go along with that, meaning our ATM program, shouldn't be surprising that we're not taking those options off the table just because it's not on a slide, doesn't mean it's not continuing to be on the table. And those factors can converge with strategic alternatives at any point in time. So I appreciate the question."

We're at what I would call full implementation now of the SMS framework across our business. And the way it's translating into the financial results that you pointed out are in a couple of different ways. It's broadening on a risk basis the portfolio of investments that we're making and ultimately that we're reflecting in our regulatory proceedings. And so think about the different asset classes, transmission pipe, distribution pipe, measurement regulation, even in our case, nonjurisdictional programs beyond the meter. So that -- we put all those side-by-side, evaluate the risk profile of each asset class and prioritize investments accordingly. That's a much more sophisticated model than has been the case historically. And so it's shifting the investment mix. And in some cases, we've seen the regulatory support for those follow along with tracker programs, for example, expanding to include differentiated programs. So it's been sort of a net broadening of the investment plan. And then from an O&M standpoint, it's -- you've seen the O&M trajectory here. We're down, and it's actually driving efficiencies in some ways because of the nature of how the programs are designed. So the actual program level cost is fully embedded in our current run rate. And I wouldn't expect to see an increasing layer of cost associated -- O&M cost associated with the SMS program itself. And then finally, I think maybe the most important point is the derisking that's happening as a result of those programs, both in terms of asset programs and process safety, where we've implemented incremental process controls across risk areas in the business or critical tasks that might have high consequence risks associated with them, and we've been implementing those. We'll continue to do that. But those generally are reconfiguration versus incremental capacity in the business model. So I feel very good about where we are from a financial profile related to SMS and safety and a lot of opportunity in front of us for further derisking of the business."

Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. We made significant progress in our generation transition and the current renewable replacement plan, with Indiana Commission approval now received for all of our joint venture renewable projects. In addition, we have received more than 180 proposals in our 2021 integrated resource plan, or IRP process, which will inform our generation replacement strategy in Indiana beyond 2023. We continue to expect that our infrastructure programs and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In the second quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings of $0.13 per share. Results reflect safety and modernization investments, COVID impacts, and they reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. We expect 2021 earnings of $1.32 to $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings. We continue to expect annual growth, safety and modernization investments of $1.9 to $2.2 billion, plus approximately $2 billion in renewables and associated transmission investments through 2023.
NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. As I mentioned, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission has approved 13 of our 14 proposed renewable energy projects and the new RFP for electric capacity and energy associated with NIPSCO's 2021 IRP, that is currently underway, has drawn strong engagement from the vendor community. In other parts of our business, we filed rate cases in Ohio, Kentucky and Maryland during the quarter, in addition to the case filed during the first quarter in Pennsylvania, where we are in advanced settlement discussions.
Safety advancements continue across NiSource, guided by our implementation of the industry's safety management system, which serves as our core operating model. Recent advancements include the accelerated integration of contractors into our safety plans and deployment of Picarro advanced leak detection technology in 2 more states. Our environmental performance targets represent another vital commitment. I'm pleased to say that we remain on target. We expect to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 from 2005 levels. That includes a 50% reduction in methane emissions from gas mains and services by 2025. On that commitment, NiSource has already achieved an estimated 39% reduction in pipeline methane emissions compared to 2005 levels. Our infrastructure replacement programs are driving these improvements. Also, last year, more than 1 million of our customers participated in our energy efficiency programs.
On that note, let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the second quarter, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. The Ohio rate case is 1 of 3 new rate cases filed in the second quarter. We are requesting an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million, net of the trackers being rolled into base rates. Pending a decision from the PUCO, new rates would be effective in mid-2022. In Kentucky, we filed a request for an approximately $27 million annual revenue increase net of trackers. And in Maryland, we filed a case on May 14, once again, net of trackers, requesting about a $5 million annual revenue increase. New rates are proposed to go into effect in December of this year. In Pennsylvania, we filed a case just before the end of the first quarter, requesting an annual increase in revenue of approximately $98 million.
Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. I'll touch on NIPSCO's electric TDSIC plan. We filed a new 5-year plan in June. The $1.6 billion plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. We expect to receive an order from the IURC in December of this year. The other items on this slide relate to our transition out of coal generation, and I'll turn it over to Shawn Anderson to give more detail."

We continue to be encouraged by the strong progress advancing our renewable generation projects stemming from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP. Over the course of the last 3 months, 8 renewables projects informed by the 2018 IRP preferred pathway received approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. This brings NIPSCO to the verge of an important milestone with 13 of 14 renewables projects approved to advance and replace the retiring capacity of the Schahfer generating station. Importantly, this includes all joint venture projects and leaves Crossroads II Wind, a power purchase agreement, as the only project to waiting approval. Combining these new generating facilities with a number of transmission projects to support system reliability across the new footprint, NiSource continues to track toward approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023.
We are excited these projects will produce clean, reliable power for our communities, while saving NIPSCO customers approximately $4 billion over the long term. While the commercial and regulatory processes have advanced to support the preferred pathway for the 2018 IRP, NIPSCO's 2021 IRP process is well underway and continues to track within its time line. As noted in our release, in second quarter, we completed a request for proposal solicitation, similar to the process deployed in 2018. We are pleased with the response in terms of both the quality and the quantity of the proposals, which continues to show high levels of engagement in the vendor community as we advance our generation transition. Furthermore, with these more than 180 proposals covering a wide range of technologies and ownership constructs, it continues to point to a robust market across generation technologies, which will drive value for our customers and stakeholders.
A few notes about the process and timing. The IRP analysis that we are currently stepping through will utilize data from the RFP to help inform the broad resource portfolio options for NIPSCO in terms of Michigan City retirement timing, choices of replacement technologies and ownership constructs. We will share directional findings with stakeholders at public advisory meetings in the third quarter, incorporating stakeholder feedback along the way. We expect to develop a stakeholder-supported preferred resource path within the 2021 IRP, which will be submitted to the IURC on or before November 1. Once the preferred plan is finalized and communicated, execution activities could commence, which may include commercial negotiations and further due diligence on specific assets or projects. Any specific projects then identified, which support this preferred plan would represent incremental projects beyond the 14 highlighted earlier and in addition to the approximately $2 billion in renewable investments NIPSCO has already filed. These are significant steps within NiSource and are part of our energy transition, which we are calling Your Energy, Your Future, as we work with stakeholders to create a dependable, affordable and sustainable energy model, delivering the reliability our customers can trust.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our second quarter financial performance in more detail."

Looking at our second quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $53 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $50 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020. I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts due to the sale closing in October of 2020.
Looking more closely at our segment 3-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5. Gas distribution [Audio Gap] operating earnings were about $66 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $8 million versus last year [Audio Gap] down about $28 million due to the sale of CMA [Audio Gap] upward in expenses also [Audio Gap] offset by higher employee related [Audio Gap] costs and outside services  [Audio Gap], which was nearly $5 million lower than the second quarter of 2020. Operating revenues rose about $11 million, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were up about $16 million due to generation related maintenance and employee-related costs.
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.2 billion, of which about $9.1 billion [Audio Gap] was long-term debt [Audio Gap] in years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. With Moody's recently concluding their latest credit review, all 3 major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment-grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.
Let's take a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan. There are no changes to our plan since last quarter's equity unit issuance. Last quarter's issuance has significantly derisked our financing plans and it's consistent with all of our earnings and credit commitments. As Joe mentioned in our key takeaways, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. I should remind everyone that we're stating the guidance and diluted earnings per share due to last quarter's equity issuance.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions."

We remain focused on long-term shareholder value. That hasn't changed. And we're evaluating market conditions and our portfolio as an ongoing part of that process. And so though it's related to the financing, as you noted, we continue to view any asset sale as primarily a strategic decision based on long-term shareholder value, more than as a way to satisfy any near-term financing needs. And that's really -- I mean, we've stated it over and over, that's underpinned by our plan that drives 7% to 9% long-term growth, inclusive of all financing in the current planning horizon and without any asset sales. So clearly, a strategic shift would need to enhance what's already a strong plan. That said, given our exceptionally large known CapEx cycle and potential future investment opportunities that will unfold as we go forward and continued modest equity funding needs that go along with that, meaning our ATM program, shouldn't be surprising that we're not taking those options off the table. Just because it's not on a slide, doesn't mean it's not continuing to be on the table. And those factors can converge with strategic alternatives at any point in time. So I appreciate the question."

We're at what I would call full implementation now of the SMS framework across our business. And the way it's translating into the financial results that you pointed out are in a couple of different ways. It's broadening on a risk basis the portfolio of investments that we're making and ultimately that we're reflecting in our regulatory proceedings. And so think about the different asset classes, transmission pipe, distribution pipe, measurement regulation, even in our case, nonjurisdictional programs beyond the meter. So that -- we put all those side-by-side, evaluate the risk profile of each asset class and prioritize investments accordingly. That's a much more sophisticated model than has been the case historically. And so it's shifting the investment mix. And in some cases, we've seen the regulatory support for those follow along with tracker programs, for example, expanding to include differentiated programs. So it's been sort of a net broadening of the investment plan. And then from an O&M standpoint, it's -- you've seen the O&M trajectory here. We're down, and it's actually driving efficiencies in some ways because of the nature of how the programs are designed. So the actual program level cost is fully embedded in our current run rate. And I wouldn't expect to see an increasing layer of cost associated -- O&M cost associated with the SMS program itself. And then finally, I think maybe the most important point is the derisking that's happening as a result of those programs, both in terms of asset programs and process safety, where we've implemented incremental process controls across risk areas in the business or critical tasks that might have high consequence risks associated with them, and we've been implementing those. We'll continue to do that. But those generally are reconfiguration versus incremental capacity in the business model. So I feel very good about where we are from a financial profile related to SMS and safety and a lot of opportunity in front of us for further derisking of the business."

Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. We made significant progress in our generation transition and the current renewable replacement plan, with Indiana Commission approval now received for all of our joint venture renewable projects. In addition, we have received more than 180 proposals in our 2021 integrated resource plan, or IRP process, which will inform our generation replacement strategy in Indiana beyond 2023. We continue to expect that our infrastructure programs and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In the second quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings of $0.13 per share. Results reflect safety and modernization investments, COVID impacts, and they reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. We expect 2021 earnings of $1.32 to $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings. We continue to expect annual growth, safety and modernization investments of $1.9 to $2.2 billion, plus approximately $2 billion in renewables and associated transmission investments through 2023.
NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. As I mentioned, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission has approved 13 of our 14 proposed renewable energy projects and the new RFP for electric capacity and energy associated with NIPSCO's 2021 IRP, that is currently underway, has drawn strong engagement from the vendor community. In other parts of our business, we filed rate cases in Ohio, Kentucky and Maryland during the quarter, in addition to the case filed during the first quarter in Pennsylvania, where we are in advanced settlement discussions.
Safety advancements continue across NiSource, guided by our implementation of the industry's safety management system, which serves as our core operating model. Recent advancements include the accelerated integration of contractors into our safety plans and deployment of Picarro advanced leak detection technology in 2 more states. Our environmental performance targets represent another vital commitment. I'm pleased to say that we remain on target. We expect to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 from 2005 levels. That includes a 50% reduction in methane emissions from gas mains and services by 2025. On that commitment, NiSource has already achieved an estimated 39% reduction in pipeline methane emissions compared to 2005 levels. Our infrastructure replacement programs are driving these improvements. Also, last year, more than 1 million of our customers participated in our energy efficiency programs.
On that note, let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the second quarter, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. The Ohio rate case is 1 of 3 new rate cases filed in the second quarter. We are requesting an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million, net of the trackers being rolled into base rates. Pending a decision from the PUCO, new rates would be effective in mid-2022. In Kentucky, we filed a request for an approximately $27 million annual revenue increase net of trackers. And in Maryland, we filed a case on May 14, once again, net of trackers, requesting about a $5 million annual revenue increase. New rates are proposed to go into effect in December of this year. In Pennsylvania, we filed a case just before the end of the first quarter, requesting an annual increase in revenue of approximately $98 million.
Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. I'll touch on NIPSCO's electric TDSIC plan. We filed a new 5-year plan in June. The $1.6 billion plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. We expect to receive an order from the IURC in December of this year. The other items on this slide relate to our transition out of coal generation, and I'll turn it over to Shawn Anderson to give more detail."

We continue to be encouraged by the strong progress advancing our renewable generation projects stemming from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP. Over the course of the last 3 months, 8 renewables projects informed by the 2018 IRP preferred pathway received approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. This brings NIPSCO to the verge of an important milestone with 13 of 14 renewables projects approved to advance and replace the retiring capacity of the Schahfer generating station. Importantly, this includes all joint venture projects and leaves Crossroads II Wind, a power purchase agreement, as the only project to waiting approval. Combining these new generating facilities with a number of transmission projects to support system reliability across the new footprint, NiSource continues to track toward approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023.
We are excited these projects will produce clean, reliable power for our communities, while saving NIPSCO customers approximately $4 billion over the long term. While the commercial and regulatory processes have advanced to support the preferred pathway for the 2018 IRP, NIPSCO's 2021 IRP process is well underway and continues to track within its time line. As noted in our release, in second quarter, we completed a request for proposal solicitation, similar to the process deployed in 2018. We are pleased with the response in terms of both the quality and the quantity of the proposals, which continues to show high levels of engagement in the vendor community as we advance our generation transition. Furthermore, with these more than 180 proposals covering a wide range of technologies and ownership constructs, it continues to point to a robust market across generation technologies, which will drive value for our customers and stakeholders.
A few notes about the process and timing. The IRP analysis that we are currently stepping through will utilize data from the RFP to help inform the broad resource portfolio options for NIPSCO in terms of Michigan City retirement timing, choices of replacement technologies and ownership constructs. We will share directional findings with stakeholders at public advisory meetings in the third quarter, incorporating stakeholder feedback along the way. We expect to develop a stakeholder-supported preferred resource path within the 2021 IRP, which will be submitted to the IURC on or before November 1. Once the preferred plan is finalized and communicated, execution activities could commence, which may include commercial negotiations and further due diligence on specific assets or projects. Any specific projects then identified, which support this preferred plan would represent incremental projects beyond the 14 highlighted earlier and in addition to the approximately $2 billion in renewable investments NIPSCO has already filed. These are significant steps within NiSource and are part of our energy transition, which we are calling Your Energy, Your Future, as we work with stakeholders to create a dependable, affordable and sustainable energy model, delivering the reliability our customers can trust.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our second quarter financial performance in more detail."

I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts due to the sale closing in October of 2020.
Looking more closely at our segment 3-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5. Gas distribution [Audio Gap] operating earnings were about $66 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $8 million versus last year [Audio Gap] down about $28 million due to the sale of CMA [Audio Gap] upward in expenses also [Audio Gap] offset by higher employee related [Audio Gap] costs and outside services  [Audio Gap], which was nearly $5 million lower than the second quarter of 2020. Operating revenues rose about $11 million, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were up about $16 million due to generation related maintenance and employee-related costs.
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.2 billion, of which about $9.1 billion [Audio Gap] was long-term debt [Audio Gap] in years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. With Moody's recently concluding their latest credit review, all 3 major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment-grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.
Let's take a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan. There are no changes to our plan since last quarter's equity unit issuance. Last quarter's issuance has significantly derisked our financing plans and it's consistent with all of our earnings and credit commitments. As Joe mentioned in our key takeaways, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. I should remind everyone that we're stating the guidance and diluted earnings per share due to last quarter's equity issuance.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions."

It seems like just on the slides that language is no longer on there. Just wanted to get your color and latest thoughts on any potential for that in your planning period. And whether in the near term, it's just that given the equity units and other funding that's already planned for the base CapEx, whether there is no immediate fee to raise that type of cash for other CapEx?"

We remain focused on long-term shareholder value. That hasn't changed. And we're evaluating market conditions and our portfolio as an ongoing part of that process. And so though it's related to the financing, as you noted, we continue to view any asset sale as primarily a strategic decision based on long-term shareholder value, more than as a way to satisfy any near-term financing needs. And that's really -- I mean, we've stated it over and over, that's underpinned by our plan that drives 7% to 9% long-term growth, inclusive of all financing in the current planning horizon and without any asset sales. So clearly, a strategic shift would need to enhance what's already a strong plan. That said, given our exceptionally large known CapEx cycle and potential future investment opportunities that will unfold as we go forward and continued modest equity funding needs that go along with that, meaning our ATM program, shouldn't be surprising that we're not taking those options off the table. Just because it's not on a slide, doesn't mean it's not continuing to be on the table. And those factors can converge with strategic alternatives at any point in time. So I appreciate the question."

We're at what I would call full implementation now of the SMS framework across our business. And the way it's translating into the financial results that you pointed out are in a couple of different ways. It's broadening on a risk basis the portfolio of investments that we're making and ultimately that we're reflecting in our regulatory proceedings. And so think about the different asset classes, transmission pipe, distribution pipe, measurement regulation, even in our case, nonjurisdictional programs beyond the meter. So that -- we put all those side-by-side, evaluate the risk profile of each asset class and prioritize investments accordingly. That's a much more sophisticated model than has been the case historically. And so it's shifting the investment mix. And in some cases, we've seen the regulatory support for those follow along with tracker programs, for example, expanding to include differentiated programs. So it's been sort of a net broadening of the investment plan. And then from an O&M standpoint, it's -- you've seen the O&M trajectory here. We're down, and it's actually driving efficiencies in some ways because of the nature of how the programs are designed. So the actual program level cost is fully embedded in our current run rate. And I wouldn't expect to see an increasing layer of cost associated -- O&M cost associated with the SMS program itself. And then finally, I think maybe the most important point is the derisking that's happening as a result of those programs, both in terms of asset programs and process safety, where we've implemented incremental process controls across risk areas in the business or critical tasks that might have high consequence risks associated with them, and we've been implementing those. We'll continue to do that. But those generally are reconfiguration versus incremental capacity in the business model. So I feel very good about where we are from a financial profile related to SMS and safety and a lot of opportunity in front of us for further derisking of the business."

Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. We made significant progress in our generation transition and the current renewable replacement plan, with Indiana Commission approval now received for all of our joint venture renewable projects. In addition, we have received more than 180 proposals in our 2021 integrated resource plan, or IRP process, which will inform our generation replacement strategy in Indiana beyond 2023. We continue to expect that our infrastructure programs and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. In the second quarter, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings of $0.13 per share. Results reflect safety and modernization investments, COVID impacts, and they reflect the profile of our business without Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. We expect 2021 earnings of $1.32 to $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings. We continue to expect annual growth, safety and modernization investments of $1.9 to $2.2 billion, plus approximately $2 billion in renewables and associated transmission investments through 2023.
NiSource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. As I mentioned, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission has approved 13 of our 14 proposed renewable energy projects and the new RFP for electric capacity and energy associated with NIPSCO's 2021 IRP, that is currently underway, has drawn strong engagement from the vendor community. In other parts of our business, we filed rate cases in Ohio, Kentucky and Maryland during the quarter, in addition to the case filed during the first quarter in Pennsylvania, where we are in advanced settlement discussions.
Safety advancements continue across NiSource, guided by our implementation of the industry's safety management system, which serves as our core operating model. Recent advancements include the accelerated integration of contractors into our safety plans and deployment of Picarro advanced leak detection technology in 2 more states. Our environmental performance targets represent another vital commitment. I'm pleased to say that we remain on target. We expect to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 from 2005 levels. That includes a 50% reduction in methane emissions from gas mains and services by 2025. On that commitment, NiSource has already achieved an estimated 39% reduction in pipeline methane emissions compared to 2005 levels. Our infrastructure replacement programs are driving these improvements. Also, last year, more than 1 million of our customers participated in our energy efficiency programs.
On that note, let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the second quarter, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. The Ohio rate case is 1 of 3 new rate cases filed in the second quarter. We are requesting an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million, net of the trackers being rolled into base rates. Pending a decision from the PUCO, new rates would be effective in mid-2022. In Kentucky, we filed a request for an approximately $27 million annual revenue increase net of trackers. And in Maryland, we filed a case on May 14, once again, net of trackers, requesting about a $5 million annual revenue increase. New rates are proposed to go into effect in December of this year. In Pennsylvania, we filed a case just before the end of the first quarter, requesting an annual increase in revenue of approximately $98 million.
Now let's look at our electric operations on Slide 10. I'll touch on NIPSCO's electric TDSIC plan. We filed a new 5-year plan in June. The $1.6 billion plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. We expect to receive an order from the IURC in December of this year. The other items on this slide relate to our transition out of coal generation, and I'll turn it over to Shawn Anderson to give more detail."

We continue to be encouraged by the strong progress advancing our renewable generation projects stemming from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP. Over the course of the last 3 months, 8 renewables projects informed by the 2018 IRP preferred pathway received approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. This brings NIPSCO to the verge of an important milestone with 13 of 14 renewables projects approved to advance and replace the retiring capacity of the Schahfer generating station. Importantly, this includes all joint venture projects and leaves Crossroads II Wind, a power purchase agreement, as the only project awaiting approval. Combining these new generating facilities with a number of transmission projects to support system reliability across the new footprint, NiSource continues to track toward approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023.
We are excited these projects will produce clean, reliable power for our communities, while saving NIPSCO customers approximately $4 billion over the long term. While the commercial and regulatory processes have advanced to support the preferred pathway for the 2018 IRP, NIPSCO's 2021 IRP process is well underway and continues to track within its time line. As noted in our release, in second quarter, we completed a request for proposal solicitation, similar to the process deployed in 2018. We are pleased with the response in terms of both the quality and the quantity of the proposals, which continues to show high levels of engagement in the vendor community as we advance our generation transition. Furthermore, with these more than 180 proposals covering a wide range of technologies and ownership constructs, it continues to point to a robust market across generation technologies, which will drive value for our customers and stakeholders.
A few notes about the process and timing. The IRP analysis that we are currently stepping through will utilize data from the RFP to help inform the broad resource portfolio options for NIPSCO in terms of Michigan City retirement timing, choices of replacement technologies and ownership constructs. We will share directional findings with stakeholders at public advisory meetings in the third quarter, incorporating stakeholder feedback along the way. We expect to develop a stakeholder-supported preferred resource path within the 2021 IRP, which will be submitted to the IURC on or before November 1. Once the preferred plan is finalized and communicated, execution activities could commence, which may include commercial negotiations and further due diligence on specific assets or projects. Any specific projects then identified, which support this preferred plan would represent incremental projects beyond the 14 highlighted earlier and in addition to the approximately $2 billion in renewable investments NIPSCO has already filed. These are significant steps within NiSource and are part of our energy transition, which we are calling Your Energy, Your Future, as we work with stakeholders to create a dependable, affordable and sustainable energy model, delivering the reliability our customers can trust.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald, who will discuss our second quarter financial performance in more detail."

Looking at our second quarter 2021 results on Slide 4, we had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $53 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $50 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020. I would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to Columbia Gas of Massachusetts due to the sale closing in October of 2020.
Looking more closely at our segment 3-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5. Gas distribution operating earnings were about $66 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $8 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were down about $28 million due to the sale of CMA and partially offset by increased infrastructure program revenues and customer growth. Operating expenses, also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, were lower by about $20 million mostly due to the CMA sale, offset by higher employee-related costs and outside services spending. 
In our Electric segment, 3-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $85 million, which was nearly $5 million lower than the second quarter of 2020. Operating revenues rose about $11 million, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were up about $16 million due to generation related maintenance and employee-related costs.
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.2 billion, of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. 
With Moody's recently concluding their latest credit review, all 3 major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment-grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.
Let's take a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan. There are no changes to our plan since last quarter's equity unit issuance. Last quarter's issuance has significantly derisked our financing plans and it's consistent with all of our earnings and credit commitments. As Joe mentioned in our key takeaways, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance and long-term financial commitments. I should remind everyone that we're stating the guidance and diluted earnings per share due to last quarter's equity issuance.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We're now ready to take your questions."

We remain focused on long-term shareholder value. That hasn't changed. And we're evaluating market conditions and our portfolio as an ongoing part of that process. And so though it's related to the financing, as you noted, we continue to view any asset sale as primarily a strategic decision based on long-term shareholder value, more than as a way to satisfy any near-term financing needs. And that's really -- I mean, we've stated it over and over, that's underpinned by our plan that drives 7% to 9% long-term growth, inclusive of all financing in the current planning horizon and without any asset sales. So clearly, a strategic shift would need to enhance what's already a strong plan. That said, given our exceptionally large known CapEx cycle and potential future investment opportunities that will unfold as we go forward and continued modest equity funding needs that go along with that, meaning our ATM program, shouldn't be surprising that we're not taking those options off the table. Just because it's not on a slide, doesn't mean it's not continuing to be on the table. And those factors can converge with strategic alternatives at any point in time. So I appreciate the question."

We're at what I would call full implementation now of the SMS framework across our business. And the way it's translating into the financial results that you pointed out are in a couple of different ways. It's broadening on a risk basis the portfolio of investments that we're making and ultimately that we're reflecting in our regulatory proceedings. And so think about the different asset classes, transmission pipe, distribution pipe, measurement regulation, even in our case, nonjurisdictional programs beyond the meter. So that -- we put all those side-by-side, evaluate the risk profile of each asset class and prioritize investments accordingly. That's a much more sophisticated model than has been the case historically. And so it's shifting the investment mix. And in some cases, we've seen the regulatory support for those follow along with tracker programs, for example, expanding to include differentiated programs. So it's been sort of a net broadening of the investment plan. And then from an O&M standpoint, it's -- you've seen the O&M trajectory here. We're down, and it's actually driving efficiencies in some ways because of the nature of how the programs are designed. So the actual program level cost is fully embedded in our current run rate. And I wouldn't expect to see an increasing layer of cost associated -- O&M cost associated with the SMS program itself. And then finally, I think maybe the most important point is the derisking that's happening as a result of those programs, both in terms of asset programs and process safety, where we've implemented incremental process controls across risk areas in the business or critical tasks that might have high consequence risks associated with them, and we've been implementing those. We'll continue to do that. But those generally are reconfiguration versus incremental capacity in the business model. So I feel very good about where we are from a financial profile related to SMS and safety and a lot of opportunity in front of us for further derisking of the business."

Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our third quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. Strong execution of NiSource's significant renewable energy investments continues to be the highlight of our foundation for future growth, and we continue to expect that our core infrastructure programs and renewable generation investments will drive industry-leading compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share through 2024, growth driven by our commitments to safety, reliability, customer affordability and sustainability.
As we begin to refine our outlook for longer-term growth, the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2021 integrated resource plan identifies additional investment opportunities, while advancing the retirement of remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028, and it supports our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030.
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. We are updating our guidance for 2021 to target the top end of the range of $1.32 to $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings, or NOEPS. We are also initiating guidance for 2022 of $1.42 to $1.48 and that is consistent with our 5% to 7% near-term growth commitment. Our long-term diluted NOEPS guidance of 7% to 9% through 2024 is now based on the expected top end of our 2021 guidance range, and we reaffirm 5% to 7% growth in 2023.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the preferred plan from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP, advances our plans to retire remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028 as we shift to lower cost, clean and reliable generation. Investments of up to $750 million will be required to replace retiring coal-fired generation. The NIPSCO portion of this investment will be better understood following further evaluation of the proposals we solicited associated with the IRP. Our regulatory execution progresses with a proposed order approving a settlement in Pennsylvania, a settlement filed in Kentucky and a proposed order in Maryland. In addition, we filed a gas rate case in Indiana in September. We achieved non-GAAP diluted NOEPS of $0.11 in the third quarter of 2021 versus $0.09 in 2020.
Now let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the third quarter, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. The Columbia Gas of Ohio rate case continues to progress. Net of the trackers being rolled into base rates, the filing requests an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million. Pending a decision next year from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, new rates would be effective in mid-2022. NIPSCO filed a gas rate case on September 29, requesting a revenue increase of $115 million annually. The case is focused on infrastructure modernization and providing safe, reliable service while remaining in compliance with state and federal safety requirements. In Pennsylvania, an administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement in our rate case. The settlement would increase revenue by $58.5 million with new rates effective December 29 of this year. The adjusted rates will help to continue investments in infrastructure upgrades, system reliability and maintenance enhancements. We expect the commission's final order by mid-December.
In Kentucky, we have filed a proposed settlement of our rate case. The settlement includes an overall increase in revenues of $18.6 million to support continued investments in safety and replacing aging infrastructure. Columbia Gas of Maryland received a proposed order from an administrative law judge on Friday, recommending an increase of approximately $2.56 million in revenues as compared to a request of approximately $4.8 million. We expect the final order from the Maryland Public Service Commission in December. Before we move on, I'd like to note that Columbia Gas of Ohio, our largest LDC is ranked #1 in the Midwest region in J.D. Power's 2021 Gas Utility Business Customer Satisfaction study. Also, congratulations to our customer experience team for the successful launch of the Columbia Gas and NIPSCO mobile apps. They're an important step forward in building our connected digital customer experience.
Let's now turn to our electric operations on Slide 10. NIPSCO's electric key disc plan is pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC. This is a 5-year $1.6 billion proposal that would replace the previous plan, which NIPSCO filed in April to terminate. The pending plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. The other items on this slide relate to our renewable generation strategy, and I'll turn it over to Sean Anderson to give more detail."

The selection of the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP is a significant milestone in our transition from coal-fired generation toward cleaner and reliable forms of generation all of which are expected to save NIPSCO customers approximately $4 billion over the long term. The preferred path from the 2021 IRP refines the time line to retire coal-fired generations at the Michigan City Generating Station to between 2026 and 2028. It also calls for retirement of 2 vintage gas peaking units, 16A and 16B which are both located at the Shafer Generating Station site. The most viable replacement option calls for a portfolio of resources, including incremental solar, stand-alone battery storage and natural gas peaking resources. We estimate that investments of up to $750 million will be required to support the retirement of these units. We expect to be able to quantify the NIPSCO portion of this investment opportunity in the first half of next year, after further evaluating bids and the request for proposals and completing due diligence on projects which align with the preferred path. Meanwhile, we continue to execute on the plan for retirement of remaining coal-fired generation at Shafer. Units 14 and 15 retired as of October 1, and units 17 and 18 are on track to retire by 2023.
We are making steady progress on the renewables project build-out informed by the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP. Our partners on these projects are some of the strongest developers in the renewable energy space, and we remain in close contact regarding the progress of these projects. We continue to expect to invest approximately $2 billion in renewable generation by 2023 to replace the retiring capacity at Shafer. As part of the execution of this plan, Construction continues on the Indiana Crossroads I wind project, which is on track to become operational in the fourth quarter of this year. Construction has also started on a pair of solar projects. Dunns Bridge Solar I is being constructed by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources under a build transfer agreement. EDP Renewables North America is building the Indiana Crossroads solar project, which will be operated as a joint venture. Both are expected to enter service next year. The IURC provided regulatory approval of the Indiana Crossroads II wind project on September 1. And with that action, all 14 renewables projects needed to replace the retiring capacity, and Shafer generating station have now received approval. In addition to the slate of renewables projects we have announced, NiSource plans to evaluate hydrogen and emerging storage technologies. It's important for us to gain a risk-informed understanding of the options and technologies that may emerge as pathways toward further decarbonization.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our third quarter financial performance in more detail."

Before getting into the specific results, I'd just like to highlight the solid execution and progress that now has us guiding to the top end of our 2021 guidance range of $1.32 to $1.36. This new 2021 expectation also serves as a starting point for both our near-term and long-term growth commitments. We have also initiated 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48, which, at its midpoint represents a growth rate of over 6.6% from the 2021 top end.
Turning to our third quarter 2021 results on Slide 4. We had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $47 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $36 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020. The 2021 results reflect our ongoing execution of infrastructure investments offset somewhat by the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which closed in October of 2020.
Looking more closely at our segment 3-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $18 million for the quarter, representing an increase of approximately $8 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down nearly $18 million due to the sale of CMA. Operating expenses, also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $26 million, mostly due to the CMA sale, offset slightly by higher employee-related costs and outside services spending. In our electric segment, 3-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $130 million, which was nearly $3 million lower than the third quarter of 2020. Net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, operating revenues decreased slightly by about $2 million due to slightly lower residential usage, offset by increased TDSIC revenues. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were nearly flat compared to 2020. 
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.6 billion, of which about $9.2 billion of long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 14 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.7 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization programs. As we noted last quarter, all 3 major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment-grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue the support for our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.
As you can see on Slide 7, we've narrowed our 2021 capital investment estimate to approximately $2 billion and reiterated our 2022 capital forecast of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion.
Taking a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan. There are no changes to our plans since April's equity unit issuance. I would highlight that this balanced financing plan continues to be consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments. As I mentioned earlier, we have updated our 2021 earnings guidance, issued guidance for 2022 and reaffirmed our long-term growth commitments. I would also remind everyone that we're planning to provide an extension to our growth plan at an Investor Day during the first half of next year. So please stay tuned.
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're ready now to take your questions."

And then in terms of timing, there is some flexibility because these projects in some ways could be a little bit modular in nature.

But having said that, direct pay does provide some flexibility and potentially be reducing the need for external financing or reducing equity needs. So we do see it as a positive, but we've got to get more detail and really to understand how that would impact rate bases and deferred taxes to see what the pure impact would be to our financing plan."

Electric is a little different with the transition from coal to renewables and clean energy. So those are typically long-dated programs. If you look at the underlying regulatory mechanisms like the TDSIC gas plant in NIPSCO, there's almost $1 billion of identified investment approved in the gas TDSIC plan. It's a multiyear beyond our '24 guidance horizon. Similarly, the Ohio IRP operates that way in Virginia, the gas Save program. similarly. So a lot of these are annualized programs with trackers that support them that run beyond our current 2024 long-term guidance Orion. So I'm not going to guide to a specific point in time where 10% rate base growth is predictable. That's the kind of update we'll give on Analyst Day next year.

Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our third quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. Strong execution of NiSource's significant renewable energy investments continues to be the highlight of our foundation for future growth, and we continue to expect that our core infrastructure programs and renewable generation investments will drive industry-leading compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share through 2024, growth driven by our commitments to safety, reliability, customer affordability and sustainability.
As we begin to refine our outlook for longer-term growth, the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2021 integrated resource plan identifies additional investment opportunities, while advancing the retirement of remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028, and it supports our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030.
Let's turn now to Slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. We are updating our guidance for 2021 to target the top end of the range of $1.32 to $1.36 per share in non-GAAP diluted net operating earnings, or NOEPS. We are also initiating guidance for 2022 of $1.42 to $1.48 and that is consistent with our 5% to 7% near-term growth commitment. 
Our long-term diluted NOEPS guidance of 7% to 9% through 2024 is now based on the expected top end of our 2021 guidance range, and we reaffirm 5% to 7% growth in 2023.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the preferred plan from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP, advances our plans to retire remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028 as we shift to lower cost, clean and reliable generation. Investments of up to $750 million will be required to replace retiring coal-fired generation. 
The NIPSCO portion of this investment will be better understood following further evaluation of the proposals we solicited associated with the IRP. Our regulatory execution progresses with a proposed order approving a settlement in Pennsylvania, a settlement filed in Kentucky and a proposed order in Maryland. 
In addition, we filed a gas rate case in Indiana in September. We achieved non-GAAP diluted NOEPS of $0.11 in the third quarter of 2021 versus $0.09 in 2020. Now let's look at some NiSource utilities highlights for the third quarter, starting with our gas operations on Slide 9. The Columbia Gas of Ohio rate case continues to progress. Net of the trackers being rolled into base rates, the filing requests an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million. 
Pending a decision next year from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, new rates would be effective in mid-2022. NIPSCO filed a gas rate case on September 29, requesting a revenue increase of $115 million annually. The case is focused on infrastructure modernization and providing safe, reliable service while remaining in compliance with state and federal safety requirements. 
In Pennsylvania, an administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement in our rate case. The settlement would increase revenue by $58.5 million with new rates effective December 29 of this year. The adjusted rates will help to continue investments in infrastructure upgrades, system reliability and maintenance enhancements. We expect the commission's final order by mid-December.
In Kentucky, we have filed a proposed settlement of our rate case. The settlement includes an overall increase in revenues of $18.6 million to support continued investments in safety and replacing aging infrastructure. Columbia Gas of Maryland received a proposed order from an administrative law judge on Friday, recommending an increase of approximately $2.56 million in revenues as compared to a request of approximately $4.8 million. 
We expect the final order from the Maryland Public Service Commission in December. Before we move on, I'd like to note that Columbia Gas of Ohio, our largest LDC is ranked #1 in the Midwest region in J.D. Power's 2021 Gas Utility Business Customer Satisfaction study. Also, congratulations to our customer experience team for the successful launch of the Columbia Gas and NIPSCO mobile apps. They're an important step forward in building our connected digital customer experience.
Let's now turn to our electric operations on Slide 10. NIPSCO's electric key disc plan is pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC. This is a 5-year $1.6 billion proposal that would replace the previous plan, which NIPSCO filed in April to terminate. The pending plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. The other items on this slide relate to our renewable generation strategy, and I'll turn it over to Sean Anderson to give more detail."

The selection of the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP is a significant milestone in our transition from coal-fired generation toward cleaner and reliable forms of generation all of which are expected to save NIPSCO customers approximately $4 billion over the long term. 
The preferred path from the 2021 IRP refines the time line to retire coal-fired generations at the Michigan City Generating Station to between 2026 and 2028. It also calls for retirement of 2 vintage gas peaking units, 16A and 16B which are both located at the Shafer Generating Station site. The most viable replacement option calls for a portfolio of resources, including incremental solar, stand-alone battery storage and natural gas peaking resources. 
We estimate that investments of up to $750 million will be required to support the retirement of these units. We expect to be able to quantify the NIPSCO portion of this investment opportunity in the first half of next year, after further evaluating bids and the request for proposals and completing due diligence on projects which align with the preferred path. 
Meanwhile, we continue to execute on the plan for retirement of remaining coal-fired generation at Shafer. Units 14 and 15 retired as of October 1, and units 17 and 18 are on track to retire by 2023.
We are making steady progress on the renewables project build-out informed by the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2018 IRP. Our partners on these projects are some of the strongest developers in the renewable energy space, and we remain in close contact regarding the progress of these projects. We continue to expect to invest approximately $2 billion in renewable generation by 2023 to replace the retiring capacity at Shafer. 
As part of the execution of this plan, Construction continues on the Indiana Crossroads I wind project, which is on track to become operational in the fourth quarter of this year. Construction has also started on a pair of solar projects. Dunns Bridge Solar I is being constructed by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources under a build transfer agreement. 
EDP Renewables North America is building the Indiana Crossroads solar project, which will be operated as a joint venture. Both are expected to enter service next year. The IURC provided regulatory approval of the Indiana Crossroads II wind project on September 1. And with that action, all 14 renewables projects needed to replace the retiring capacity, and Shafer generating station have now received approval. 
In addition to the slate of renewables projects we have announced, NiSource plans to evaluate hydrogen and emerging storage technologies. It's important for us to gain a risk-informed understanding of the options and technologies that may emerge as pathways toward further decarbonization.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald who will discuss our third quarter financial performance in more detail."

Before getting into the specific results, I'd just like to highlight the solid execution and progress that now has us guiding to the top end of our 2021 guidance range of $1.32 to $1.36. This new 2021 expectation also serves as a starting point for both our near-term and long-term growth commitments. We have also initiated 2022 guidance of $1.42 to $1.48, which, at its midpoint represents a growth rate of over 6.6% from the 2021 top end.
Turning to our third quarter 2021 results on Slide 4. We had non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $47 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $36 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020. The 2021 results reflect our ongoing execution of infrastructure investments offset somewhat by the sale of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which closed in October of 2020.
Looking more closely at our segment 3-month non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $18 million for the quarter, representing an increase of approximately $8 million versus last year. Operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down nearly $18 million due to the sale of CMA. 
Operating expenses, also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $26 million, mostly due to the CMA sale, offset slightly by higher employee-related costs and outside services spending. In our electric segment, 3-month non-GAAP operating earnings were about $130 million, which was nearly $3 million lower than the third quarter of 2020. 
Net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, operating revenues decreased slightly by about $2 million due to slightly lower residential usage, offset by increased TDSIC revenues. Operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were nearly flat compared to 2020. 
Now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $9.6 billion, of which about $9.2 billion of long-term debt. The weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 14 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. 
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.7 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization programs. As we noted last quarter, all 3 major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment-grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. Taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue the support for our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.
As you can see on Slide 7, we've narrowed our 2021 capital investment estimate to approximately $2 billion and reiterated our 2022 capital forecast of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion.
Taking a quick look at Slide 8, which highlights our financing plan. There are no changes to our plans since April's equity unit issuance. I would highlight that this balanced financing plan continues to be consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments. As I mentioned earlier, we have updated our 2021 earnings guidance, issued guidance for 2022 and reaffirmed our long-term growth commitments. 
I would also remind everyone that we're planning to provide an extension to our growth plan at an Investor Day during the first half of next year. So please stay tuned. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We're ready now to take your questions."

And then in terms of timing, there is some flexibility because these projects in some ways could be a little bit modular in nature. It provides a fair amount of flexibility to optimize that. The transmission work, for example, is going to begin immediately and it could take up to 3 years to complete the transmission work necessary to take those units offline.

And you'd have that fixed cost related to that project associated with that technology to the extent that, that data is executed within this window that we're describing. 
And to the extent that to the extent that you continue to do through the due diligence process, you might understand more or less about what it would take on the total investment side, most notably transmission to action those projects."

I'll take the sort of the long view side of that question. And if you look at the $40 billion of identified investments that we rolled out on Investor Day just a little over a year ago, that's really predominantly on the kinds of investments that are already in flight in the gas business in particular. 
Electric is a little different with the transition from coal to renewables and clean energy. So those are typically long-dated programs. If you look at the underlying regulatory mechanisms like the TDSIC gas plant in NIPSCO, there's almost $1 billion of identified investment approved in the gas TDSIC plan. 
It's a multiyear beyond our '24 guidance horizon. Similarly, the Ohio IRP operates that way in Virginia, the gas SAVE program. similarly. So a lot of these are annualized programs with trackers that support them that run beyond our current 2024 long-term guidance horizon. 
So I'm not going to guide to a specific point in time where 10% rate base growth is predictable. That's the kind of update we'll give on Analyst Day next year. But the core point here is the underlying fundamental investment thesis is very long dated across all of the LDCs."

Given the recent attractive valuation data points that we've been seeing for where the gas assets have been transacting at. How do you think strategically about your 10%-plus rate base growers with this long-term horizon and the potential for asset optimization to limit other need or other types of financing over your forecast horizon?"

So very much the same long-term strategic orientation. When we look at a portfolio of companies that have that kind of fundamental growth opportunity that we see as long-dated in constructive jurisdictions that's well supported, any rotation would have to be accretive to a plan that reflects that kind of growth engine build in across really literally each and every company that we operate has that same profile right now. 
So it's a strategic question about long-term growth, first and foremost. That said, we're very open minded, very analytical about that, very objective and work very closely with our Board to continuously assess that opportunity. As it comes to capital rotation and alternative forms of financing, let me ask Donald to touch on that side of the question."

That's diluted net operating earnings per share. And our long-term growth commitments have been reaffirmed. 
We talked about it here on the call, the preferred plan for NIPSCO's IRP, now advances our plans to retire all coal-fired generation to between 2026 and 2028. And NIPSCO's portion of those investments needed to replace this capacity will be evaluated in the coming months with an expectation to roll out more clarity and precision on that at an Investor Day to be held in the latter part of the first half of next year.
Our progress on the gas rate cases continues. We've got settlements on the table or orders are waited in 3 states and filing of a new case in Indiana and along with the Ohio case that's pending. And finally, again, we do look forward to the steps between now and an Investor Day at the end of the first half of 2022, key opportunity for us to extend this long-term growth trajectory. And we do appreciate you for joining us this morning. We know it's a busy day for all of you. So please stay safe and make it a good day. Thank you."
