I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. 
Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast. Joining me today are Geoffrey Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 29, 2021. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. And today's event should last about an hour. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summary. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance as well as changes to our future revenue reporting structure given our new operating model, which will go into effect next quarter. This presentation can be accessed from our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. 
During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. 
Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and are given on an organic basis, which adjusts for foreign currency. There were no acquisitions made in the last year that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential improvement compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and are made on an as-reported basis. All references to share gains or losses are on a revenue and calendar quarter basis, unless otherwise stated. 
Finally, reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. 
With that, let's get started."

The Q3 results that we reported this morning reflect that our business is well on its way to returning to growth, with a sequential improvement in both revenue and earnings. This happened despite the impac",2232,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today. The Q3 results that we reported this morning reflect that our business is well on its way to returning to growth, with a sequential improvement in both revenue and earnings. This happened despite the impact of the COVID resurgence on procedure volumes in late December and January. 
We're also outperforming our markets. As our new products are driving share gains in an increasing number of our businesses. In fact, we outperformed the market even if you exclude our strong ventilator sales. And when you consider that, we're going up against a number of our competitors' year-end pushes, and our results include the month of January when COVID was having an increased impact on procedure volumes. Our performance is even more impressive. 
We're also seeing signs that our hospital customers are preparing for a robust recovery. For example, purchases of our capital equipment this past quarter have been notably strong. The use of our capital equipment, such as energy consoles, robotics and navigation systems is tied directly to procedures. So it's telling that hospitals are prioritizing spending on this type of equipment. 
Now as we head into our fourth quarter, we're bullish on the recovery and our ability to return to growth and outpace our competitors. We feel that the momentum we have is going to build over the coming quarters driven not just by the COVID recovery, but by the strong new product flow that we expect to bring to the market. And we're supplementing this pipeline with increasing cadence of tuck-in M&A. 
We've also implemented our new to operating model, and we're enhancing our culture with a sharpened competitive focus. Through the actions we've taken over the past year, we're emerging from this pandemic as a stronger Medtronic, and I'm confident that we're well positioned for both the short and the long term. 
Now as we've done on the past a couple of earning calls, I'm going to lead off with the discussion of market share, which has become an important focus across the company. I acknowledge that the COVID impact on procedures, along with the timing of the quarter, does mask some of the underlying market dynamics. But I hope that you're now seeing a strong trend of share gains for Medtronic. 
And there are multiple drivers for our improved market performance. Our prolific pipeline is key. But also the transformation of our operating model and culture is beginning to drive results. And the changes we've made during the pandemic, moving from simply serving as a supplier to our customers to becoming a true partner, has driven stronger customer relationships and improved business performance. 
Our consistent and sustained flow of new products is our engine for growth. In the past quarter alone, we've received an additional 46 product approvals, bringing our total to over 220 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China since January of 2020. 
Let's start with the businesses where we are gaining share in our Cardiac and Vascular group. We continue to outperform our competitors in cardiac rhythm. We gained another point of share this past quarter on the strength of our micro family of leadless pacemakers, and our cobalt and chrome high-power devices. 
Micro continues to perform extremely well with 64% growth globally including 76% growth in the U.S. In Coronary, while we we're dealing with the financial impact of the China drug-eluting stent national tender, we're still winning share globally. We estimate that our DES unit share is up 3 points year-over-year and 2 points sequentially, led by strong share gains in the U.S. on our 1 month [ dual ] anti-platelet therapy a labeling and expanded indication for high bleeding risk patients. 
And in China, we believe that being one of the winners of the DES national tender strategically positions us to make maintain our leadership in the China cardiovascular market. Not only do we expect to pull-through other products, but we expect to leverage our scale and reach to drive the successful future rollouts of our TAVR and Ardian products. 
In drug-coated balloons, we're growing well above the market despite increased competition. We gained a couple of points of share on the strength of our market leading IN.PACT family. 
In fact, we're seeing continued strong adoption of our DCB for AV fistula maintenance for dialysis patients driven by the publication of our data in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
Next, turning to our minimally invasive therapies group, our Surgical Innovations business had a good quarter against our primary competitor, J&J. We gained nearly 1 point of share year-over-year driven by our energy and endostapling product lines. 
Our Respiratory Interventions business had a great quarter, growing over 75%, and this was driven by the importance of our airway and ventilator products in treated COVID patients. And as expected, our ventilator sales were down sequentially, but nearly tripled year-over-year. And our PB 980 gained share in the high acuity ventilator market. 
We also gained share in Airways driven by our impressive growth of over 60% in video laryngoscopes. 
Looking ahead, our ventilator revenue should normalize as pandemic-related demand decreases, and we anticipate year-over-year headwinds starting next quarter. 
Our Patient Monitoring business also had a strong double-digit growth quarter. Our Nellcor pulse oximetry product lines grew double digits as we won share sequentially for [ Masimo ]. 
In gastrointestinal, we had some modest share gains, driven in part by our partnership with the NHS in England. The NHS is using our PillCam COLON to help reduce large patient backlogs for colorectal screenings. 
And our Renal Care business grew in the high single digits, with share gains in renal access. 
In our Restorative Therapies group, we're seeing share gains across several businesses. In Cranial and Spinal Technologies, while share was stable year-over-year, we do believe we're up sequentially. We had a strong quarter in large capital equipment sales with a record number of Mazor Robotics system unit sales and near records for our O-arm imaging and StealthStation navigation systems. 
And with Mazor, we estimate that we continue to meaningfully outsell our nearest competitor, Globus, in the spine robotics space. 
In Neuromodulation, our recent product rollouts are leading to share gains in both brain modulation and Pain Stim. In brain modulation, our percept PC launch has led to nearly 1 point of share gain year-over-year and several points of share gains sequentially from Boston Scientific and Abbot. 
Now given our technology differentiation, we expect DBS share gains to be a multiyear trend. In Pain Stim, we're gaining strong momentum from our DTM launch, with nearly 1 point of share gain year-over-year, which is even more impressive when you consider that this business is facing a replacement headwind. 
Our DTM trial surged this quarter after the release of our 12-month data in late October. And overall, our trials are up 10% year-over-year, which is a really good leading indicator for the health of our Pain Stim business. 
In Pelvic Health, not only is the market growth accelerated over the past couple of quarters, but we continue to win share back from Axonics based on the differentiation of our Interstim micro device. 
Since last quarter, we gained another point of share in Europe and 3 points of share in the U.S. We've now taken back 9 points of share from Axonics over the past 2 quarters. And when you look specifically at the U.S. rechargeable market, we gained back 14 points of share sequentially this quarter. 
So there are a number of businesses where we are gaining or holding share, but there are still some businesses where we've got some work to do. 
In our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, we believe we lost about 1 point of share year-over-year and sequentially, primarily to J&J's broad EP product portfolio. Now we expect this share performance to turn around in the quarters ahead due in part to our diamond temp cardiac ablation system, which just received FDA approval.
In cardiac diagnostics, customer response to our LINQ 2.0 system has been outstanding. Given our remote programming capabilities, enhanced feature set and a 4.5-year longevity. 
That said, we estimate we lost a few points of share sequentially to Boston Scientific as they enter this market. We continue now to ramp our unique wafer scaling for LINQ 2.0 but expect to be supply-constrained for the next few quarters. However, we are confident in the competitive differentiation of our LINQ 2.0 device. And we expect to maintain our strong leadership position in this market that we created and have innovated for the last 20 years. 
In Neurovascular, while we held share year-over-year with strong growth in aspirations and coils, we lost a bit of share sequentially. And this was primarily in flow diverters as new entrants, specifically Terumo and Stryker, picked up some share. We have a series of new product launches coming in neuro later this calendar year. So I'm confident that after the initial impact of competition and flow diverters, that we'll get back to taking share. 
In Diabetes, we're making considerable progress in our turnaround efforts, and we actually returned to growth this quarter. While we're still not growing with the market, we're gaining momentum with the successful launches of our 770G system in the U.S. and the 780G, which is now available in 26 countries across 4 continents. 
Now as a result of all this, we estimate we picked up several points of durable insulin pump share sequentially. 
Next, let's turn to our product pipeline. We're at the front end of a number of large opportunities to win share and create and disrupt big markets. All aimed squarely at accelerating our growth. 
A number of these catalysts are on deck this calendar year, and the long-term pipeline also remains full. Starting with CVG, we're expecting to present our ON-MEd renal denervation pivotal trial results later this calendar year, likely at the TCT Conference in October. This could be one of the most important events in Medtech this year given the multibillion-dollar addressable market in hypertension. 
Now depending on the results of our On-MED trial, we're planning to submit for FDA approval later this calendar year, and we've already been granted breakthrough device designation. 
In our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, we are expecting a first-line therapy indication for Arctic Front cryoballoon in the first half of this calendar year. We also continue to make good progress on bringing our disruptive pulse field ablation system to market. 
In structural heart, we expect to roll out our next-generation Evolut FX TAVR valve later this calendar year with its enhanced deliverability and ease of use. We continue to enroll the pivotal trial for our Intrepid transcatheter mitral valve as well. And we're pleased to see that half of medical, which is our partnership with the foundry completed the first-in-human procedure of its differentiated transcatheter mitral repair technology. 
This unique device has the potential to be very disruptive to current mitral clip technology. 
In MITG, we're really excited as we're nearing some very important milestones for our HUGO soft tissue robot system. We remain on track to submit for CE Mark and to file for U.S. IDE approval next month. 
In RTG, we're investing heavily in growth opportunities. In neurosurgery, we're expanding the capabilities of our Mazor spine robotic system. In Pain Stim, we're expecting to launch our recharge free device later this linear. This is a big opportunity for Medtronic to dramatically increase our share in the recharge-free category of Pain Stim. 
We also expect to submit our ECAPs device to the FDA later this calendar year. ECAPs could be a very disruptive technology in Pain Stim. And we intend to bring it to market, combined with all the advantages of our DTM therapy and our Intellis device platform. 
In brain modulation, we expect to launch our SenSight directional lead later this calendar year, which will close a key competitive gap. In fact, when you combine SenSight with our per set PC device, our deep brain stimulation system will be far ahead of the competition. And we're not stopping there. We're now enrolling our ADAPT PD pivotal trial, which is studying our closed-loop adaptive technology that will further extend our leadership position in DBS. 
In Neurovascular, in addition to the flow diverter launch, as I mentioned earlier, we have 5 additional products that we plan to launch this calendar year. Now we haven't disclosed the details of these launches for competitive reasons, but we're excited about the innovation that we're bringing into the stroke market. 
In Diabetes, we have now submitted the adult and the pediatric 780G insulin pump and Zeus Sensor to the FDA to provide them with an efficient means to simultaneously review our multiple submissions. Approval timing, well, that's going to be dependent on the FDA's bandwidth as the branch of the FDA responsible for diabetes product reviews has focused their resources on COVID diagnostic submissions. 
Regarding our synergy sensor, which is disposable, easier to apply and half the size of our current sensor, we've completed our pivotal trial and intend to submit it to the FDA once we complete our manufacturing module this summer. 
I'll now have Karen take you through a discussion of our third quarter financials and our outlook. And then I'm going to come back with some concluding remarks before we go to Q&A. Karen, over to you."

As Geoff mentioned, we're well on our way to returning to growth. 
As sequentially, our revenue increased 2% and and adjusted EPS grew by 26% on the strength of our new products and execution. While the resurgence of COVID did impact our performance across several businesses, we continue to view this impact as temporary. It's worth noting that our average daily sales in the third quarter were tracking higher than the second quarter through the latter part of December. However, we saw a step down driven by the COVID resurgence starting in the holiday period and continuing through the end of the quarter. 
Procedure volumes were light in many geographies and specifically impacted our surgical innovations, spine and many of our cardiac and vascular businesses. 
As Geoff mentioned, despite the slowdown in procedures, sales of our capital equipment were strong and point to a turn soon. While our third quarter revenue was in line with Street's expectations, we came in $0.14 ahead of consensus on EPS. With an $0.11 beat on better operating margins and $0.03 on tax. 
FX, which was a greater-than-expected tailwind to revenues was a headwind to EPS, $0.02 more than our November expectations. We continue to see strong sequential improvement in our adjusted margins. 180 basis points on our gross margin and 430 basis points on our operating margins. Our operating margin improvement was faster than expected. Driven in part by expense controls in SG&A. 
Down the P&L, our tax rate came in lower than we expected as we finalized taxes owed on certain prior year's returns during the quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Our cash position is strong, and we remain focused on investing both organically and inorganically through tuck-in acquisitions and minority investments to drive our long-term growth. We recently announced another acquisition of the Radial Artery Access portfolio from privately held risk neurovascular. And now have 8 tuck-ins since the beginning of last calendar year, with a combined total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion. We expect these investments to fuel revenue growth acceleration and create strong returns for our shareholders. And we continue to supplement these returns with a strong and growing dividend. We are an S&P dividend Aristocrat, having increased our dividend for 43 years, and our yield of 2% places us in the top quintile of all S&P 500 health care companies. 
Now turning to our outlook. While we expect the impact from the COVID resurgence to diminish, the effect from the ongoing pandemic to our business remains challenging to predict. So we will continue to not provide our typical guidance. 
That said, I do want to give you our sense of the trends ahead. We continue to see a lag in our average daily sales in the first couple of weeks of February. But we expect that to steadily improve, not only as we exit the month but throughout the quarter. As COVID hospitalizations decrease, ICU capacity increases and hospitals return to more normal procedure volumes. Said a different way, we expect March to be stronger than February and April to be stronger than March. 
As we look at fourth quarter Street expectations and from where we sit today, we are comfortable with Street consensus on revenues and EPS. Within this, it's reasonable to think about organic revenue growth in a range between 30% and 34% if the recovery trends follow our expectations. In that case, by group, RTG organic growth would be around 50%; CVG, around 40%; and MITG, around 15%, reflecting the continued ramp down in ventilator revenues and a tough year-over-year comparison. 
And Diabetes organic growth would be in the high single digits. 
On the P&L, while we continue to invest in our product pipeline and launches, we do expect sequential operating leverage as our revenue improves. Therefore, we would expect around 1 point to 1.5 points improvement on gross margin and 1.5 to 2 points improvement on operating margin, both on a sequential basis. 
Regarding currency, assuming recent rates hold constant, the tailwind to revenue would be roughly $250 million. On the bottom line, we expect an approximate $0.04 headwind. 
I'd like to end by reminding you that our new operating model became effective earlier this month. And I'm excited by the impact it will have on our culture and our ability to drive growth acceleration. It will have minimal impact, however, on our external reporting. And you can refer to the slides in our earnings presentation for details on the minor changes going forward. 
Back to you, Geoff."

And then just any sense of kind of Zeus versus synergy in terms of relative time line? Does it make sense to launch those products independently if they're going to be sort of right on top of each other from a following strategy. So just a general diabetes update, be very helpful."

So I'd say with 780G, what people are really enjoying about that is getting to stay in automotive a lot longer. That leads to better plasmic control in the early reports, people are in the kind of the '90s in the post-market realm for glycemic control, but more importantly, they're not getting interrupted to take blood sugars that's cut down in half. They're able to slip through the night with really good blood sugar control and we measure things like Net Promoter Score on a product level as well, and it's up about tenfold from what we saw experience of 670G. 
So a very, very big improvement and we're also seeing in the 670G. I think the transmitter, which connects the CGM to the pump seems to function better than the way we used to connect that on 670G. So it's more reliable. And that, coupled with being able to see your numbers in the phone has led to a better experience as well. And of course, that pipeline is upgradable to not just the 780G, but also the new sensor pipeline we asked about and the extended wear infusion set. 
With regard to the synergy, we've already filed SUs that was filed in November. Synergy will be filed upon the completion of the manufacturing validation in the summertime. So they will be separated by probably enough to make a difference where we're going to want to have both products in the market, but we'll sort that out. We don't need to launch it. We don't need to launch, but I think we're going to have a period of time where Zeus will precede synergy for both pump integration as well as stand-alone use."

Well, so first of all, I'd say that we got affected by a few things in the quarter, mostly coming out of the holidays into January. We saw the more due to COVID and also where we had more concentrated kind of hospital clusters where so you're in a tertiary care setting for like TAVR or cardiac surgery procedures. When you had cities shutting down because of COVID, we just had more of an impact on volume. And it's come back a little bit. But for some weather here in the February time frame, as Karen described. But I'd say generally, the things that were moving in the quarter were micro, also Tyrx, they were both really good. DCBs coming back and the CRM portfolio with the exception of TACI, which still has its replacement headwinds, was moving in the right direction. 
As I said, TAVI was a slower than we had hoped quarter-on-quarter, but we think the cup momentum as we go forward into the next quarter. And of course, in core coronary, while we gained share, we did have a $45 million headwind due to the China des tender, which is going to recur every quarter until it annualizes."

How much leverage can we see? How much is spending that's been held back versus needs to be put into place once procedures come back? 
And then second, if you could touch on free cash flow, trends continue to look pretty encouraging. How should we think about free cash flow conversion going forward?"

We did see good continued expense control this quarter, particularly in SG&A, and we would expect that to continue. That has helped drive our sequential margin improvement. It's not the only thing, obviously, revenue growth help drive it, too. And we talk about the fact that we expect sequential margin improvement both in gross and operating margins for Q4. And as we think ahead, I would just keep in mind that our fourth quarter operating margins tend to be our highest margin. So I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate those onto the full year for next year. But we do, again, expect to have continued good expense control. 
And in terms of free cash flow, yes, we have seen very encouraging things with free cash flow, both on better-than-expected profit from the beginning of the year. Along with better-than-expected collections on accounts receivable despite the pandemic. So we've got good momentum, particularly in both places. And you've seen our free cash flow, at least year-to-date, be above that 80% conversion. 
I would say that free cash flow is more of an annual metric because cash flows can be lumpy. And while we may be under that 80% conversion rate for the full year, just because of COVID and the pandemic, we are clearly committed to that conversion rate being above the 80% going forward."

So by my math, your guidance implies about 3% to 4% underlying growth in Q4. Should we be thinking about -- is there any reason why we shouldn't be thinking about fiscal '22 underlying growth of about 5% or their ventilator -- you have headwinds like ventilator sales, the value recall and the extra week in '21. So does that make the 5% underlying challenging and for any reason why the margins in '22 won't be in line with 2019. You're exiting this year at about 29%."

You bring those edges together and you leave, you fix the leak of the valve, but you leave behind basically a stenotic valve, which continues to partially leak. And the idea of replacing that valve were in the case of like a half moon, where you're basically replacing the back leaflet. You can eliminate MR completely and also leave open future options to fix that valve, which you're cut off from an clip technology. So it doesn't really make sense to us to pursue something that has a couple of players in it already and has some residual limitations. It makes more sense to go for repair solution that creates more options and does a better job of eliminating MR. 
With regard to the INTREPID trial, we did change the endpoint in that trial. And it's picked up a lot. It's a basin design, so the enrollment won't be dependent on some interim looks down the road. Enrollment did pick up. We continue to have some challenges where there are code hotspots at the individual center level, but it's continuing along. And then your last question on appendage. I guess kind of like the first one, unless we have a really different French technology that brings more to the party. It's not something that we're going to pursue just me-too products in. We have obviously some interest in that space, but it has to be a technology that really matters and brings a difference to the patients and the clinicians."

How digital is impacting our -- I'll call it our offerings to our customers and patients. And you mentioned Viz.ai, which is helping expand the stroke market and the way we -- and our partnership with them is help differentiate Medtronic and drive share. That's a good example. But I think another 1 that's a big 1 that we've talked about is remote capabilities in our card in our implantable business, and I'll highlight our cardiac rhythm business. Correct me if I'm wrong, Sean, even there's remote programming, there's remote device management, there's remote patient management. And it is really picking up. Some of this technology was there before COVID, but the uptake was slow. And then during COVID, the timing worked out with our pipeline, we launched some additional remote capabilities. But we're seeing things like, for example, MRI when patients have to go back to get -- go into the hospital and they haven't implanted cardiac device, they needed an MRI. That used to be more of a manual intervention. A Medtronic field representative actually going to the hospital to meet with the patient and make some programming changes. That now is up to 25% or more of those are done now remotely. And it was pretty low single digits prior to COVID. So the uptake on -- that's just one example of how digital is changing workflows. And providing, I think, in this case, better patient outcomes, but in more -- a lot of efficiencies. So we're seeing the digital piece take off, and it will provide also productivity for our company. We believe we can provide -- we've learned how to do like medical education, remotely. 
Now you can't do all med ed remotely, I mean there's exchange of scientific data, and there's some ability to train remotely. And obviously, at some point, these physicians want to get in the cadaver lab and things like that. And we haven't figured out how to do that remotely. But we're amazed at when our backs were against the wall and you couldn't meet with physicians, how digital came to the rescue and provided high quality experience. Now physicians, they are now on board with this. 
So I think that will, one, speed up adoption of new technology, which is a good thing, but two, provide efficiencies for us."

And I would expect that to continue and I think the most of the work of these tuck-ins, most of the volume rather, will come around our existing therapies in existing markets to augment them. And really, I don't look at as an extension of our organic growth strategy because we're not buying growth here. We're buying technology and kind of adding to that, whether it be additional technology or clinical science and then making these standard of care around the world.

The Q3 results that we reported this morning reflect that our business is well on its way to returning to growth with a sequential improvement in both revenue and earnings. This happened",2219,"[Presentation] 
Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today. 
The Q3 results that we reported this morning reflect that our business is well on its way to returning to growth with a sequential improvement in both revenue and earnings. This happened despite the impact of the COVID resurgence on procedure volumes in late December and January. We're also outperforming our markets as our new products are driving share gains in an increasing number of our businesses. In fact, we outperformed the market even if you exclude our strong ventilator sales. And when you consider that we're going up against a number of our competitors' year-end pushes and our results include the month of January when COVID was having a increased impact on procedure volumes, our performance is even more impressive.  
We're also seeing signs that our hospital customers are preparing for a robust recovery. For example, purchases of our capital equipment this past quarter have been notably strong. The use of our capital equipment, such as energy consoles, robotics and navigation systems, is tied directly to procedures. So it's telling that hospitals are prioritizing spending on this type of equipment.  
Now as we head into our fourth quarter, we're bullish on the recovery and our ability to return to growth and outpace our competitors. We feel that the momentum we have is going to build over the coming quarters driven not just by the COVID recovery, but by the strong new product flow that we expect to bring to the market.  And we're supplementing this pipeline with an increasing cadence of tuck-in M&A. We've also implemented our new operating model, and we're enhancing our culture with a sharpened competitive focus.  Through the actions we've taken over the past year, we're emerging from this pandemic as a stronger Medtronic, and I'm confident that we're well positioned for both the short and the long term.  
Now as we've done on the past couple of earning calls, I'm going to lead off with the discussion of market share, which has become an important focus across the company. I acknowledge that the COVID impact on procedures, along with the timing of our quarter, does mask some of the underlying market dynamics. But I hope that you're now seeing a strong trend of share gains for Medtronic.  
And there are multiple drivers for our improved market performance. Our prolific pipeline is key, but also the transformation of our operating model and culture is beginning to drive results.  And the changes we've made during the pandemic, moving from simply serving as a supplier to our customers to becoming a true partner, has driven stronger customer relationships and improved business performance.  
Our consistent and sustained flow of new products is our engine for growth. In the past quarter alone, we've received an additional 46 product approvals, bringing our total to over 220 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China since January of 2020.  
Let's start with the businesses where we are gaining share in our Cardiac and Vascular Group. We continue to outperform our competitors in cardiac rhythm. We gained another point of share this past quarter on the strength of our micro family of leadless pacemakers and our Cobalt and Crome high-power devices.  Micro continues to perform extremely well with 64% growth globally, including 76% growth in the U.S.  
In coronary, while we we're dealing with the financial impact of the China drug-eluting stent national tender, we're still winning share globally. We estimate that our DES unit share is up 3 points year-over-year and 2 points sequentially led by strong share gains in the U.S. on our 1-month dual anti-platelet therapy labeling and expanded indication for high-bleeding risk patients.  And in China, we believe that being one of the winners of the DES national tender strategically positions us to maintain our leadership in the China cardiovascular market.  Not only do we expect to pull through other products, but we expect to leverage our scale and reach to drive the successful future rollouts of our TAVR and Ardian products.  
In drug-coated balloons, we're growing well above the market despite increased competition. We gained a couple of points of share on the strength of our market-leading IN.PACT family.  In fact, we're seeing continued strong adoption of our DCB for AV fistula maintenance for dialysis patients driven by the publication of our data in the New England Journal of Medicine.  
Next, turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. 
Our Surgical Innovations business had a good quarter against our primary competitor, J&J. We gained nearly 1 point of share year-over-year driven by our energy and endo stapling product lines.  
Our Respiratory Interventions business had a great quarter, growing over 75%. And this was driven by the importance of our airway and ventilator products in treated-COVID patients. And as expected, our ventilator sales were down sequentially, but nearly tripled year-over-year. And our PB980 gained share in the high-acuity ventilator market. We also gained share in airways driven by our impressive growth of over 60% in video laryngoscopes.  Looking ahead, our ventilator revenue should normalize as pandemic-related demand decreases, and we anticipate year-over-year headwinds starting next quarter. 
Our Patient Monitoring business also had a strong double-digit growth quarter. Our Nellcor pulse oximetry product lines grew double digits as we won share sequentially for Masimo. 
In Gastrointestinal, we had some modest share gains driven in part by our partnership with the NHS in England. The NHS is using our PillCam COLON to help reduce large patient backlogs for colorectal screenings. 
And our Renal Care business grew in the high single digits with share gains in renal access. 
In our Restorative Therapies group, we're seeing share gains across several businesses. In Cranial & Spinal Technologies, while share was stable year-over-year, we do believe we're up sequentially. 
We had a strong quarter in large capital equipment sales with a record number of Mazor robotic system unit sales and near records for our O-arm imaging and StealthStation navigation systems. And with Mazor, we estimate that we continue to meaningfully outsell our nearest competitor, Globus, in the spine robotics space. 
In Neuromodulation, our recent product rollouts are leading the share gains in both Brain Modulation and Pain Stim. In Brain Modulation, our Percept PC launch has led to nearly 1 point of share gain year-over-year and several points of share gains sequentially from Boston Scientific and Abbot. Now given our technology differentiation, we expect DBS share gains to be a multiyear trend. 
In Pain Stim, we're gaining strong momentum from our DTM launch with nearly 1 point of share gain year-over-year, which is even more impressive when you consider that this business is facing a replacement headwind. Our DTM trial surged this quarter after the release of our 12-month data in late October. And overall, our trials are up 10% year-over-year, which is a really good leading indicator for the health of our Pain Stim business. 
In Pelvic Health, not only is the market growth accelerated over the past couple of quarters, but we continue to win share back from Axonics based on the differentiation of our InterStim Micro device. Since last quarter, we gained another point of share in Europe and 3 points of share in the U.S. We've now taken back 9 points of share from Axonics over the past 2 quarters. And when you look specifically at the U.S. rechargeable market, we gained back 14 points of share sequentially this quarter. 
So there are a number of businesses where we are gaining or holding share, but there are still some businesses where we've got some work to do. In our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, we believe we lost about 1 point of share year-over-year and sequentially, primarily to J&J's broad EP product portfolio. Now we expect this share performance to turn around in the quarters ahead due in part to our DiamondTemp cardiac ablation system, which just received FDA approval.  In cardiac diagnostics, customer response to our LINQ II system has been outstanding given our remote programming capabilities, enhanced feature set and a 4.5-year longevity.  
That said, we estimate we lost a few points of share sequentially to Boston Scientific as they enter this market.  We continue now to ramp our unique wafer scale manufacturing for LINQ II, but expect to be supply-constrained for the next few quarters. However, we are confident in the competitive differentiation of our LINQ II device, and we expect to maintain our strong leadership position in this market that we created and have innovated for the last 20 years.  
In Neurovascular, while we held share year-over-year with strong growth in aspirations and coils, we lost a bit of share sequentially. And this was primarily in flow diverters as new entrants, specifically Terumo and Stryker, pick up some share. We have a series of new product launches coming in neuro later this calendar year, so I'm confident that after the initial impact of competition in flow diverters that we'll get back to taking share.  
In Diabetes, we're making considerable progress in our turnaround efforts, and we actually returned to growth this quarter. While we're still not growing with the market, we're gaining momentum with the successful launches of our 770G system in the U.S. and the 780G, which is now available in 26 countries across 4 continents.  Now as a result of all this, we estimate we picked up several points of durable insulin pump share sequentially.  
Next, let's turn to our product pipeline. We're at the front end of a number of large opportunities to win share and create and disrupt big markets, all aimed squarely at accelerating our growth.  A number of these catalysts are on deck this calendar year, and the long-term pipeline also remains full. 
Starting with CVG, we're expecting to present our ON-MED renal denervation pivotal trial results later this calendar year likely at the TCT Conference in October. This could be one of the most important events in medtech this year given the multibillion-dollar addressable market in hypertension.  Now depending on the results of our On-MED trial, we're planning to submit for FDA approval later this calendar year, and we've already been granted breakthrough device designation.  
In our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, we are expecting a first-line therapy indication for Arctic Front cryoballoon in the first half of this calendar year. We also continue to make good progress on bringing our disruptive pulse field ablation system to market.  
In Structural Heart, we expect to roll out our next-generation Evolut FX TAVR valve later this calendar year with its enhanced deliverability and ease of use. We continue to enroll the pivotal trial for our Intrepid transcatheter mitral valve as well. And we're pleased to see that Half Moon Medical, which is our partnership with the foundry, completed the first-in-human procedure of its differentiated transcatheter mitral repair technology.  This unique device has the potential to be very disruptive to current mitral clip technology.  
In MITG, we're really excited as we're nearing some very important milestones for our Hugo soft tissue robot system. We remain on track to submit for CE Mark and to file for U.S. IDE approval next month.  
In RTG, we're investing heavily in growth opportunities. In Neurosurgery, we're expanding the capabilities of our Mazor spine robotic system. In Pain Stim, we're expecting to launch our recharge-free device later this calendar year. This is a big opportunity for Medtronic to dramatically increase our share in the recharge-free category of Pain Stim.  We also expect to submit our ECAPs device to the FDA later this calendar year. ECAPs could be a very disruptive technology in Pain Stim, and we intend to bring it to market combined with all the advantages of our DTM therapy and our Intellis device platform.  
In Brain Modulation, we expect to launch our SenSight directional lead later this calendar year, which will close a key competitive gap. In fact, when you combine SenSight with our Percept PC device, our deep brain stimulation system will be far ahead of the competition. And we're not stopping there. We're now enrolling our ADAPT-PD pivotal trial, which is studying our closed-loop adaptive technology that will further extend our leadership position in DBS.  
In Neurovascular, in addition to the flow diverter launch, as I mentioned earlier, we have 5 additional products that we plan to launch this calendar year. Now we haven't disclosed the details of these launches for competitive reasons, but we're excited about the innovation that we're bringing into the stroke market.  
In Diabetes, we have now submitted the adult and the pediatric 780G insulin pump and Zeus sensor to the FDA to provide them with an efficient means to simultaneously review our multiple submissions. Approval timing, well, that's going to be dependent on the FDA's bandwidth as the branch of the FDA responsible for diabetes product reviews has focused their resources on COVID-diagnostic submissions.  
Regarding our Synergy sensor, which is disposable, easier to apply and half the size of our current sensor, we've completed our pivotal trial and intend to submit it to the FDA once we complete our manufacturing module this summer.  
I'll now have Karen take you through a discussion of our third quarter financials and our outlook. And then I'm going to come back with some concluding remarks before we go to Q&A. 
Karen, over to you."

Our third quarter revenue declined 1% organic and adjusted EPS declined 10%. As Geoff mentioned, we're well on our way to returning to growth as sequentially, our revenue increased 2% and adjusted EPS grew by 26% on the strength of our new pr",768,"Thank you. 
Our third quarter revenue declined 1% organic and adjusted EPS declined 10%. As Geoff mentioned, we're well on our way to returning to growth as sequentially, our revenue increased 2% and adjusted EPS grew by 26% on the strength of our new products and execution. While the resurgence of COVID did impact our performance across several businesses, we continue to view this impact as temporary.  It's worth noting that our average daily sales in the third quarter were tracking higher than the second quarter through the latter part of December. However, we saw a step down driven by the COVID resurgence starting in the holiday period and continuing through the end of the quarter.  
Procedure volumes were light in many geographies and specifically impacted our Surgical Innovations, Spine and many of our Cardiac and Vascular businesses.  As Geoff mentioned, despite the slowdown in procedures, sales of our capital equipment were strong and point to a turn soon. 
While our third quarter revenue was in line with Street expectations, we came in $0.14 ahead of consensus on EPS with an $0.11 beat on better operating margins and $0.03 on tax.  FX, which was a greater-than-expected tailwind to revenues, was a headwind to EPS, $0.02 more than our November expectations. 
We continue to see strong sequential improvement in our adjusted margins, 180 basis points on our gross margin and 430 basis points on our operating margin. Our operating margin improvement was faster than expected driven in part by expense controls in SG&A.  Down the P&L, our tax rate came in lower than we expected as we finalized taxes owed on certain prior year's returns during the quarter.  
Turning to our balance sheet. Our cash position is strong, and we remain focused on investing, both organically and inorganically, through tuck-in acquisitions and minority investments to drive our long-term growth. We recently announced another acquisition of the radial artery access portfolio from privately held RIST Neurovascular and now have 8 tuck-ins since the beginning of last calendar year with a combined total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion. 
We expect these investments to fuel revenue growth acceleration and create strong returns for our shareholders. And we continue to supplement these returns with a strong and growing dividend. We are an S&P Dividend Aristocrat having increased our dividend for 43 years, and our yield of 2% places us in the top quintile of all S&P 500 health care companies.  
Now turning to our outlook. While we expect the impact from the COVID resurgence to diminish, the effect from the ongoing pandemic to our business remains challenging to predict. So we will continue to not provide our typical guidance.  
That said, I do want to give you our sense of the trends ahead. We continue to see a lag in our average daily sales in the first couple of weeks of February. But we expect that to steadily improve not only as we exit the month, but throughout the quarter as COVID hospitalizations decrease, ICU capacity increases and hospitals return to more normal procedure volumes. Said a different way, we expect March to be stronger than February and April to be stronger than March.  
As we look at fourth quarter Street expectations and from where we sit today, we are comfortable with Street consensus on revenues and EPS. Within this, it's reasonable to think about organic revenue growth in a range between 30% and 34% if the recovery trends follow our expectations. In that case, by group, RTG organic growth would be around 50%; CVG, around 40%; and MITG, around 15%, reflecting the continued ramp down in ventilator revenues and a tough year-over-year comparison; and Diabetes organic growth would be in the high single digits.  
On the P&L, while we continue to invest in our product pipeline and launches, we do expect sequential operating leverage as our revenue improves. Therefore, we would expect around 1 point to 1.5 points improvement on gross margin and 1.5 points to 2 points improvement on operating margin, both on a sequential basis.  Regarding currency, assuming recent rates hold constant, the tailwind to revenue would be roughly $250 million. On the bottom line, we expect an approximate $0.04 headwind.  
I'd like to end by reminding you that our new operating model became effective earlier this month. And I'm excited by the impact it will have on our culture and our ability to drive growth acceleration. It will have minimal impact, however, on our external reporting. And you can refer to the slides in our earnings presentation for details on the minor changes going forward.  
Back to you, Geoff."

I just wonder if you could talk about what you're seeing in 780G relative to what we had seen historically with 670G.  The guidance for next quarter probably doesn't seem as strong as I would expect given the momentum in diabetes this quarter. 
So is there anything to think about there? And then just any sense of kind of Zeus versus Synergy in terms of relative time line? Does it make sense to launch those products independently if they're going to be sort of right on top of each other from a following strategy. So just a general diabetes update would be very helpful."

So I'd say with 780G, what people are really enjoying about that is getting to stay in auto mode a lot longer. So that leads to better glycemic control. With the early reports, people are in the kind of the '90s in the post-market realm for glycemic control, but more importantly, they're not getting interrupted to take blood sugars that's cut down in half. They're able to sleep through the night with really good blood sugar control. And we measure things like Net Promoter Score on a product level as well, and it's up about tenfold from what we saw experience of 670G.  So a very, very big improvement. 
And we're also seeing in the 670G, I think the transmitter, which connects CGM to the pump, seems to function better than the way we used to connect that on 670G. So it's more reliable. And that, coupled with being able to see your numbers in the phone, has led to a better experience as well. And of course, that pipeline is upgradable to not just the 780G, but also the new sensor pipeline you asked about and the extended wear infusion set. 
With regard to Synergy, we've already filed Zeus that was filed in November. Synergy will be filed upon the completion of the manufacturing validation in the summertime. So they will be separated by probably enough to make a difference where we're going to want to have both products in the market, but we'll sort that out. We don't need to launch it -- we don't need to launch yet, but I think we're going to have a period of time where Zeus will precede Synergy for both pump integration as well as stand-alone use."

When you had cities shutting down because of COVID, we just had more of an impact on volume. And it's come back a little bit, but for some weather here in the February time frame, as Karen described. But I'd say generally, the things that were moving the quarter were Micra, also TYRX, they were both really good. DCB is coming back. And the CRM portfolio with the exception of tachy, which still has its replacement headwinds, was moving in the right direction. 
As I said, TAVI was a slower than we had hoped quarter-on-quarter, but we think it's going to pick up momentum as we go forward into the next quarter.

That has helped drive our sequential margin improvement. It's not the only thing. Obviously, revenue growth helped drive it, too. And we talk about the fact that we expect sequential margin improvement both in gross and operating margins for Q4. As we think ahead, I would just keep in mind that our fourth quarter operating margins tend to be our highest margin. So I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate those onto the full year for next year. But we do, again, expect to have continued good expense control. 
And in terms of free cash flow, yes, we have seen very encouraging things with free cash flow both on better-than-expected profit from the beginning of the year along with better-than-expected collections on accounts receivable despite the pandemic. So we've got good momentum particularly in both places. And you've seen our free cash flow, at least year-to-date, be above that 80% conversion.  I would say that free cash flow is more of an annual metric because cash flows can be lumpy. And while we may be under that 80% conversion rate for the full year just because of COVID and the pandemic, we are clearly committed to that conversion rate being above the 80% going forward."

So by my math, your guidance implies about 3% to 4% underlying growth in Q4. Should we be thinking about -- is there any reason why we shouldn't be thinking about fiscal '22 underlying growth of about 5% or there's ventilator -- you have headwinds like ventilator sales, the Valiant recall and the extra week in '21.

So the availability of reimbursement is a critical part of that adoption curve. And just to remind you, we think that we can get that to a $3 billion market with just a 1% penetration. So it's a huge opportunity for us, and reimbursement will be important for that -- the speed of that ramp."

In our neuroscience or in RTG, in the Neuromodulation space, whether it be our new technology in pelvic health or our deep brain stimulation, our Percept PC deep neurostimulator, or in pain, our new pain products, the DTM product, all of those are getting disproportionate share versus the competition.

And the reason for that is because you kind of leave -- you sort of trade 1 disease for another, right? You bring those edges together and you leave -- you fix the leak of the valve, but you leave behind basically a stenotic valve, which continues to partially leak. 
And the idea of replacing that valve were in the case of like a Half Moon where you're basically replacing the back leaflet, you can eliminate MR completely and also leave open future options to fix that valve, which you're cut off from in a clip technology. So it doesn't really make sense to us to pursue something that has a couple of players in it already and has some residual limitations. It makes more sense to go for a repair solution that creates more options and does a better job of eliminating MR. 
With regard to the Intrepid trial, we did change the end point in that trial. And it's picked up a lot. It's a Bayesian design, so the enrollment won't be dependent on some interim looks down the road. Enrollment did pick up. We continue to have some challenges where there are COVID hotspots at the individual center level, but it's continuing along. 
And then your last question on left atrial appendage. I guess kind of like the first one, unless you have a really differentiated technology that brings more to the party, it's not something that we're going to pursue just me-too products in.

In pain, we've got the new DTM product from the Stimgenics acquisition that sits on top of our Intellis platform, and that's got a lot of momentum. And I think the physician community is excited about the idea of us bringing ECAPs to market. So that's -- so we've got a little momentum there. 
And of course, in our overactive or pelvic health business, neuromodulation for overactive bladder, you heard in the commentary, we've got a lot of momentum there as well. And then, of course, you've got the soft tissue robot launching, Bob already articulated the impact there at the MITG level of 100 basis points or so. 
So those are some big ones. And in cardiology, we've got a lot going on as well. Our atrial fibrillation business with Diamond -- the DiamondTemp launch is another one in our first-line indication for our cryo product line are also exciting I think growth drivers for us. 
I don't know, Sean, did I leave anything out there? You've got quite a bit going on in cardiology."

So wondering if you could talk a little bit about both the way that -- if there's any additional initiatives that worth noting like what you've done with Viz.ai and stroke, but also how we should think about the productivity of the P&L of operations in a world where you'll be leaning more, I suppose, on digital in '22 and '23 than you were in '19 and early '20?"

How digital is impacting our -- I'll call it our offerings to our customers and patients. And you mentioned Viz.ai, which is helping expand the stroke market and the way we -- and our partnership with them has helped differentiate Medtronic and drive share. That's a good example. 
But I think another one that's a big one that we've talked about is remote capabilities in our implantable business, and I'll highlight our cardiac rhythm business. Correct me if I'm wrong, Sean, even there's remote programming, there's remote device management, there's remote patient management. And it is really picking up. Some of this technology was there before COVID, but the uptake was slow. And then during COVID, the timing worked out with our pipeline. 
We launched some additional remote capabilities. But we're seeing things like, for example, MRI. When patients have to go back to get -- go into the hospital and they haven't implanted cardiac device, they needed an MRI, that used to be more of a manual intervention. A Medtronic field representative actually going to the hospital to meet with the patient and make some programming changes. That now is up to 25% or more of those are done now remotely. And it was pretty -- it was low single digits prior to COVID. 
So the uptake on -- that's just one example of how digital is changing workflows and providing, I think, in this case, better patient outcomes, but in more -- a lot of efficiencies. So we're seeing the digital piece take off, and it will provide also productivity for our company. We believe we can provide -- we've learned how to do like medical education remotely.  
Now you can't do all med ed remotely. I mean there's exchange of scientific data, and there's some ability to train remotely. And obviously, at some point, these physicians want to get in the cadaver lab or and things like that. And we haven't figured out how to do that remotely. But we're amazed at -- when our backs were against the wall and you couldn't meet with physicians, how digital came to the rescue and provided a high-quality experience. Now physicians, they are now onboard with this.  
So I think that will, one, speed up adoption of new technology, which is a good thing; but two, provide efficiencies for us."

Look, the M&A, these -- I'd call them -- I won't call them bite size, but smaller tuck-in deals where we're getting at these companies at relatively early stage, most cases, before commercialization seems to be something that's working for us. 
So we can do more of these. We add more value. And we're getting them at values that makes sense. So we're getting good returns on these. And we're spreading our risk across a number of these deals. And I would expect that to continue. And I think the most of the work of these tuck-ins, most of the volume rather, will come around our existing therapies in existing markets to augment them. 
And really, I look at it as an extension of our organic growth strategy because we're not buying growth here. We're buying technology and then kind of adding to that, whether it be additional technology or clinical science, and then making these standard of care around the world. So that's going to be the lion's share of it. 
In terms of white space, this is something we haven't signaled where we're always looking at new markets to better position the company to optimize our portfolio for growth. When you start looking at white space truly outside of the -- then you kind of move outside of the tuck in, and these tend to be a little larger. And this really is something we're always looking at, if we think it's the right move to help our portfolio. But the focus is the tuck ins."

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations.
  
Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast. Joining me today are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 29, 2021. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's event should last about an hour.
  
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summary. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance as well as changes to our future reporting structure, given our new operating model, which will go into effect next quarter. This presentation can be accessed from our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.
  
During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.  
Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and are given on an organic basis, which adjusts for foreign currency. There were no acquisitions made in the last year that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential improvement compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 are made on an as-reported basis. All references to share gains or losses are on a revenue and calendar quarter basis unless otherwise stated. Finally, reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.
  
With that, let's get started."

The Q3 results that we reported this morning reflect that our business is well on its way to returning to growth with a sequential improvement in both revenue and earnings. This happened",2221,"[Presentation] 
Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today. 
The Q3 results that we reported this morning reflect that our business is well on its way to returning to growth with a sequential improvement in both revenue and earnings. This happened despite the impact of the COVID resurgence on procedure volumes in late December and January. We're also outperforming our markets as our new products are driving share gains in an increasing number of our businesses. In fact, we outperformed the market even if you exclude our strong ventilator sales. And when you consider that we're going up against a number of our competitors' year-end pushes and our results include the month of January when COVID was having a increased impact on procedure volumes, our performance is even more impressive.  
  
  We're also seeing signs that our hospital customers are preparing for a robust recovery. For example, purchases of our capital equipment this past quarter have been notably strong. The use of our capital equipment, such as energy consoles, robotics and navigation systems, is tied directly to procedures. So it's telling that hospitals are prioritizing spending on this type of equipment.  
  
  Now as we head into our fourth quarter, we're bullish on the recovery and our ability to return to growth and outpace our competitors. We feel that the momentum we have is going to build over the coming quarters driven not just by the COVID recovery, but by the strong new product flow that we expect to bring to the market.  And we're supplementing this pipeline with an increasing cadence of tuck-in M&A. We've also implemented our new operating model, and we're enhancing our culture with a sharpened competitive focus.  Through the actions we've taken over the past year, we're emerging from this pandemic as a stronger Medtronic, and I'm confident that we're well positioned for both the short and the long term.  
  
  Now as we've done on the past couple of earning calls, I'm going to lead off with the discussion of market share, which has become an important focus across the company. I acknowledge that the COVID impact on procedures, along with the timing of our quarter, does mask some of the underlying market dynamics. But I hope that you're now seeing a strong trend of share gains for Medtronic.  
  
  And there are multiple drivers for our improved market performance. Our prolific pipeline is key, but also the transformation of our operating model and culture is beginning to drive results.  And the changes we've made during the pandemic, moving from simply serving as a supplier to our customers to becoming a true partner, has driven stronger customer relationships and improved business performance.  
  
  Our consistent and sustained flow of new products is our engine for growth. In the past quarter alone, we've received an additional 46 product approvals, bringing our total to over 220 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China since January of 2020.  
  
  Let's start with the businesses where we are gaining share in our Cardiac and Vascular Group. We continue to outperform our competitors in cardiac rhythm. We gained another point of share this past quarter on the strength of our micro family of leadless pacemakers and our Cobalt and Crome high-power devices.  Micro continues to perform extremely well with 64% growth globally, including 76% growth in the U.S.  
  
  In coronary, while we we're dealing with the financial impact of the China drug-eluting stent national tender, we're still winning share globally. We estimate that our DES unit share is up 3 points year-over-year and 2 points sequentially led by strong share gains in the U.S. on our 1-month dual anti-platelet therapy labeling and expanded indication for high-bleeding risk patients.  And in China, we believe that being one of the winners of the DES national tender strategically positions us to maintain our leadership in the China cardiovascular market.  Not only do we expect to pull through other products, but we expect to leverage our scale and reach to drive the successful future rollouts of our TAVR and Ardian products.  
  
  In drug-coated balloons, we're growing well above the market despite increased competition. We gained a couple of points of share on the strength of our market-leading IN.PACT family.  In fact, we're seeing continued strong adoption of our DCB for AV fistula maintenance for dialysis patients driven by the publication of our data in the New England Journal of Medicine.  
  
  Next, turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. 
Our Surgical Innovations business had a good quarter against our primary competitor, J&J. We gained nearly 1 point of share year-over-year driven by our energy and endo stapling product lines.  
  Our Respiratory Interventions business had a great quarter, growing over 75%. And this was driven by the importance of our airway and ventilator products in treated COVID patients. And as expected, our ventilator sales were down sequentially, but nearly tripled year-over-year. And our PB980 gained share in the high-acuity ventilator market. We also gained share in airways driven by our impressive growth of over 60% in video laryngoscopes.  Looking ahead, our ventilator revenue should normalize as pandemic-related demand decreases, and we anticipate year-over-year headwinds starting next quarter. 
Our Patient Monitoring business also had a strong double-digit growth quarter. Our Nellcor pulse oximetry product lines grew double digits as we won share sequentially for Masimo. 
In Gastrointestinal, we had some modest share gains driven in part by our partnership with the NHS in England. The NHS is using our PillCam COLON to help reduce large patient backlogs for colorectal screenings. 
And our Renal Care business grew in the high single digits with share gains in renal access. 
In our Restorative Therapies group, we're seeing share gains across several businesses. In Cranial & Spinal Technologies, while share was stable year-over-year, we do believe we're up sequentially. 
We had a strong quarter in large capital equipment sales with a record number of Mazor robotic system unit sales and near records for our O-arm imaging and StealthStation navigation systems. And with Mazor, we estimate that we continue to meaningfully outsell our nearest competitor, Globus, in the spine robotics space. 
In Neuromodulation, our recent product rollouts are leading the share gains in both Brain Modulation and Pain Stim. In Brain Modulation, our Percept PC launch has led to nearly 1 point of share gain year-over-year and several points of share gains sequentially from Boston Scientific and Abbott. Now given our technology differentiation, we expect DBS share gains to be a multiyear trend. 
In Pain Stim, we're gaining strong momentum from our DTM launch with nearly 1 point of share gain year-over-year, which is even more impressive when you consider that this business is facing a replacement headwind. Our DTM trial surged this quarter after the release of our 12-month data in late October. And overall, our trials are up 10% year-over-year, which is a really good leading indicator for the health of our Pain Stim business. 
In Pelvic Health, not only is the market growth accelerated over the past couple of quarters, but we continue to win share back from Axonics based on the differentiation of our InterStim Micro device. Since last quarter, we gained another point of share in Europe and 3 points of share in the U.S. We've now taken back 9 points of share from Axonics over the past 2 quarters. And when you look specifically at the U.S. rechargeable market, we gained back 14 points of share sequentially this quarter. 
So there are a number of businesses where we are gaining or holding share, but there are still some businesses where we've got some work to do. In our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, we believe we lost about 1 point of share year-over-year and sequentially, primarily to J&J's broad EP product portfolio. Now we expect this share performance to turn around in the quarters ahead due in part to our DiamondTemp cardiac ablation system, which just received FDA approval.  In cardiac diagnostics, customer response to our LINQ II system has been outstanding given our remote programming capabilities, enhanced feature set and a 4.5-year longevity.  
  
  That said, we estimate we lost a few points of share sequentially to Boston Scientific as they enter this market.  We continue now to ramp our unique wafer scale manufacturing for LINQ II, but expect to be supply-constrained for the next few quarters. However, we are confident in the competitive differentiation of our LINQ II device, and we expect to maintain our strong leadership position in this market that we created and have innovated for the last 20 years.  
  
  In Neurovascular, while we held share year-over-year with strong growth in aspirations and coils, we lost a bit of share sequentially. And this was primarily in flow diverters as new entrants, specifically Terumo and Stryker, pick up some share. We have a series of new product launches coming in neuro later this calendar year, so I'm confident that after the initial impact of competition in flow diverters that we'll get back to taking share.  
  
  In Diabetes, we're making considerable progress in our turnaround efforts, and we actually returned to growth this quarter. While we're still not growing with the market, we're gaining momentum with the successful launches of our 770G system in the U.S. and the 780G, which is now available in 26 countries across 4 continents.  Now as a result of all this, we estimate we picked up several points of durable insulin pump share sequentially.  
  
  Next, let's turn to our product pipeline. We're at the front end of a number of large opportunities to win share and create and disrupt big markets, all aimed squarely at accelerating our growth.  A number of these catalysts are on deck this calendar year, and the long-term pipeline also remains full. 
Starting with CVG, we're expecting to present our ON-MED renal denervation pivotal trial results later this calendar year likely at the TCT Conference in October. This could be one of the most important events in medtech this year given the multibillion-dollar addressable market in hypertension.  Now depending on the results of our On-MED trial, we're planning to submit for FDA approval later this calendar year, and we've already been granted breakthrough device designation.  
  
  In our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, we are expecting a first-line therapy indication for our Arctic Front cryoballoon in the first half of this calendar year. We also continue to make good progress on bringing our disruptive pulse field ablation system to market.  
  
  In Structural Heart, we expect to roll out our next-generation Evolut FX TAVR valve later this calendar year with its enhanced deliverability and ease of use. We continue to enroll the pivotal trial for our Intrepid transcatheter mitral valve as well. And we're pleased to see that Half Moon Medical, which is our partnership with the foundry, completed the first-in-human procedure of its differentiated transcatheter mitral repair technology.  This unique device has the potential to be very disruptive to current mitral clip technology.  
  
  In MITG, we're really excited as we're nearing some very important milestones for our Hugo soft tissue robot system. We remain on track to submit for CE Mark and to file for U.S. IDE approval next month.  
  
  In RTG, we're investing heavily in growth opportunities. In Neurosurgery, we're expanding the capabilities of our Mazor spine robotic system. In Pain Stim, we're expecting to launch our recharge-free device later this calendar year. This is a big opportunity for Medtronic to dramatically increase our share in the recharge-free category of Pain Stim.  We also expect to submit our ECAPS device to the FDA later this calendar year. ECAPS could be a very disruptive technology in Pain Stim, and we intend to bring it to market combined with all the advantages of our DTM therapy and our Intellis device platform.  
  
  In Brain Modulation, we expect to launch our SenSight directional lead later this calendar year, which will close a key competitive gap. In fact, when you combine SenSight with our Percept PC device, our deep brain stimulation system will be far ahead of the competition. And we're not stopping there. We're now enrolling our ADAPT-PD pivotal trial, which is studying our closed-loop adaptive technology that will further extend our leadership position in DBS.  
In Neurovascular, in addition to the flow diverter launch, as I mentioned earlier, we have 5 additional products that we plan to launch this calendar year. Now we haven't disclosed the details of these launches for competitive reasons, but we're excited about the innovation that we're bringing into the stroke market.  
  
  In Diabetes, we have now submitted the adult and the pediatric 780G insulin pump and Zeus sensor to the FDA to provide them with an efficient means to simultaneously review our multiple submissions. Approval timing, well, that's going to be dependent on the FDA's bandwidth as the branch of the FDA responsible for diabetes product reviews has focused their resources on COVID-diagnostic submissions.  
  
  Regarding our Synergy sensor, which is disposable, easier to apply and half the size of our current sensor, we've completed our pivotal trial and intend to submit it to the FDA once we complete our manufacturing module this summer.  
  
  I'll now have Karen take you through a discussion of our third quarter financials and our outlook. And then I'm going to come back with some concluding remarks before we go to Q&A. 
Karen, over to you."

Our third quarter revenue declined 1% organic and adjusted EPS declined 10%. As Geoff mentioned, we're well on our way to returning to growth as sequentially, our revenue increased 2% and adjusted EPS grew by 26% on the strength of our new products and execution. While the resurgence of COVID did impact our performance across several businesses, we continue to view this impact as temporary.  It's worth noting that our average daily sales in the third quarter were tracking higher than the second quarter through the latter part of December. However, we saw a step down driven by the COVID resurgence starting in the holiday period and continuing through the end of the quarter.  
Procedure volumes were light in many geographies and specifically impacted our Surgical Innovations, Spine and many of our Cardiac and Vascular businesses.  As Geoff mentioned, despite the slowdown in procedures, sales of our capital equipment were strong and point to a turn soon. 
While our third quarter revenue was in line with Street expectations, we came in $0.14 ahead of consensus on EPS with an $0.11 beat on better operating margins and $0.03 on tax.  FX, which was a greater-than-expected tailwind to revenues, was a headwind to EPS, $0.02 more than our November expectations. 
We continue to see strong sequential improvement in our adjusted margins, 180 basis points on our gross margin and 430 basis points on our operating margin. Our operating margin improvement was faster than expected driven in part by expense controls in SG&A.  Down the P&L, our tax rate came in lower than we expected as we finalized taxes owed on certain prior year's returns during the quarter.  
  
  Turning to our balance sheet. Our cash position is strong, and we remain focused on investing, both organically and inorganically, through tuck-in acquisitions and minority investments to drive our long-term growth. We recently announced another acquisition of the radial artery access portfolio from privately held RIST Neurovascular and now have 8 tuck-ins since the beginning of last calendar year with a combined total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion. 
We expect these investments to fuel revenue growth acceleration and create strong returns for our shareholders. And we continue to supplement these returns with a strong and growing dividend. We are an S&P Dividend Aristocrat having increased our dividend for 43 years, and our yield of 2% places us in the top quintile of all S&P 500 health care companies.  
  
  Now turning to our outlook. While we expect the impact from the COVID resurgence to diminish, the effect from the ongoing pandemic to our business remains challenging to predict. So we will continue to not provide our typical guidance.  
  
  That said, I do want to give you our sense of the trends ahead. We continue to see a lag in our average daily sales in the first couple of weeks of February. But we expect that to steadily improve not only as we exit the month, but throughout the quarter as COVID hospitalizations decrease, ICU capacity increases and hospitals return to more normal procedure volumes. Said a different way, we expect March to be stronger than February and April to be stronger than March.  
  
  As we look at fourth quarter Street expectations and from where we sit today, we are comfortable with Street consensus on revenues and EPS. Within this, it's reasonable to think about organic revenue growth in a range between 30% and 34% if the recovery trends follow our expectations. In that case, by group, RTG organic growth would be around 50%; CVG, around 40%; and MITG, around 15%, reflecting the continued ramp-down in ventilator revenues and a tough year-over-year comparison; and Diabetes organic growth would be in the high single digits.  
  
  On the P&L, while we continue to invest in our product pipeline and launches, we do expect sequential operating leverage as our revenue improves. Therefore, we would expect around 1 point to 1.5 points improvement on gross margin and 1.5 points to 2 points improvement on operating margin, both on a sequential basis.  Regarding currency, assuming recent rates hold constant, the tailwind to revenue would be roughly $250 million. On the bottom line, we expect an approximate $0.04 headwind.  
  
  I'd like to end by reminding you that our new operating model became effective earlier this month. And I'm excited by the impact it will have on our culture and our ability to drive growth acceleration. It will have minimal impact, however, on our external reporting. And you can refer to the slides in our earnings presentation for details on the minor changes going forward.  
  
  Back to you, Geoff."

I mean, Sean, the Diabetes business obviously was the standout versus most Street models here this quarter. I just wonder if you could talk about what you're seeing in 780G relative to what we had seen historically with 670G.  The guidance for next quarter probably doesn't seem as strong as I would expect given the momentum in diabetes this quarter. 
So is there anything to think about there? And then just any sense of kind of Zeus versus Synergy in terms of relative time line? Does it make sense to launch those products independently if they're going to be sort of right on top of each other from a following strategy. So just a general diabetes update would be very helpful."

So I'd say with 780G, what people are really enjoying about that is getting to stay in auto mode a lot longer. So that leads to better glycemic control. With the early reports, people are in the kind of the '90s in the post-market realm for glycemic control, but more importantly, they're not getting interrupted to take blood sugars that's cut down in half. They're able to sleep through the night with really good blood sugar control. And we measure things like Net Promoter Score on a product level as well, and it's up about tenfold from what we saw experience of 670G.  So a very, very big improvement. 
And we're also seeing in the 670G, I think the transmitter, which connects CGM to the pump, seems to function better than the way we used to connect that on 670G. So it's more reliable. And that, coupled with being able to see your numbers in the phone, has led to a better experience as well. And of course, that pipeline is upgradable to not just the 780G, but also the new sensor pipeline you asked about and the extended wear infusion set. 
With regard to the Synergy, we've already filed Zeus that was filed in November. Synergy will be filed upon the completion of the manufacturing validation in the summertime. So they will be separated by probably enough to make a difference where we're going to want to have both products in the market, but we'll sort that out. We don't need to launch it if we don't need to launch yet, but I think we're going to have a period of time where Zeus will precede Synergy for both pump integration as well as stand-alone use."

Well, so first of all, I'd say that we got affected by a few things in the quarter, mostly coming out of the holidays into January. We saw the more elective parts of CVG slow down due to COVID and also where we had more concentrated kind of hospital clusters where,  say you're in a tertiary care setting for like TAVR or cardiac surgery procedures. When you had cities shutting down because of COVID, we just had more of an impact on volume. And it's come back a little bit, but for some weather here in the February time frame, as Karen described. But I'd say generally, the things that were moving the quarter were Micra, also TYRX, they were both really good. DCB is coming back. And the CRM portfolio with the exception of tachy, which still has its replacement headwinds, was moving in the right direction. 
As I said, TAVI was a slower than we had hoped quarter-on-quarter, but we think it's going to pick up momentum as we go forward into the next quarter. And of course, in core Coronary, while we gained share, we did have a $45 million headwind due to the China DES tender, which is going to recur every quarter until it annualizes."

That has helped drive our sequential margin improvement. It's not the only thing. Obviously, revenue growth helped drive it, too. And we talk about the fact that we expect sequential margin improvement both in gross and operating margins for Q4. As we think ahead, I would just keep in mind that our fourth quarter operating margins tend to be our highest margin. So I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate those onto the full year for next year. But we do, again, expect to have continued good expense control. 
And in terms of free cash flow, yes, we have seen very encouraging things with free cash flow both on better-than-expected profit from the beginning of the year along with better-than-expected collections on accounts receivable despite the pandemic. So we've got good momentum particularly in both places. And you've seen our free cash flow, at least year-to-date, be above that 80% conversion.  I would say that free cash flow is more of an annual metric because cash flows can be lumpy. And while we may be under that 80% conversion rate for the full year just because of COVID and the pandemic, we are clearly committed to that conversion rate being above the 80% going forward."

And I'll ask my question for Karen. Karen, I apologize. On fiscal 2022, I know we're going to get a lot of questions on it. So by my math, your guidance implies about 3% to 4% underlying growth in Q4. Should we be thinking about -- is there any reason why we shouldn't be thinking about fiscal '22 underlying growth of about 5% or there's ventilator -- you have headwinds like ventilator sales, the Valiant recall and the extra week in '21. So does that make 5% underlying challenging? And is there any reason why the margins in '22 won't be in line with 2019? You're exiting this year at about 29%."

So the availability of reimbursement is a critical part of that adoption curve. And just to remind you, we think that we can get that to a $3 billion market with just a 1% penetration. So it's a huge opportunity for us, and reimbursement will be important for that -- the speed of that ramp."

In our neuroscience or in RTG, in the Neuromodulation space, whether it be our new technology in pelvic health or our deep brain stimulation, our Percept PC deep neurostimulator, or in pain, our new pain products, the DTM product, all of those are getting disproportionate share versus the competition.

And the reason for that is because you kind of leave -- you sort of trade one disease for another, right? You bring those edges together and you leave -- you fix the leak of the valve, but you leave behind basically a stenotic valve, which continues to partially leak. 
And the idea of replacing that valve were in the case of like a Half Moon where you're basically replacing the back leaflet, you can eliminate MR completely and also leave open future options to fix that valve, which you're cut off from in a clip technology. So it doesn't really make sense to us to pursue something that has a couple of players in it already and has some residual limitations. It makes more sense to go for a repair solution that creates more options and does a better job of eliminating MR. 
With regard to the Intrepid trial, we did change the end point in that trial. And it's picked up a lot. It's a Bayesian design, so the enrollment won't be dependent on some interim looks down the road. Enrollment did pick up. We continue to have some challenges where there are COVID hotspots at the individual center level, but it's continuing along. 
And then your last question on left atrial appendage. I guess kind of like the first one, unless you have a really differentiated technology that brings more to the party, it's not something that we're going to pursue just me-too products in.

How digital is impacting our -- I'll call it our offerings to our customers and patients. And you mentioned Viz.ai, which is helping expand the stroke market and the way we -- and our partnership with them has helped differentiate Medtronic and drive share. That's a good example. 
But I think another one that's a big one that we've talked about is remote capabilities in our implantable business, and I'll highlight our cardiac rhythm business. Correct me if I'm wrong, Sean, even there's remote programming, there's remote device management, there's remote patient management. And it is really picking up. Some of this technology was there before COVID, but the uptake was slow. And then during COVID, the timing worked out with our pipeline. 
We launched some additional remote capabilities. But we're seeing things like, for example, MRI. When patients have to go back to get -- go into the hospital and they haven't implanted cardiac device, they needed an MRI, that used to be more of a manual intervention. A Medtronic field representative actually going to the hospital to meet with the patient and make some programming changes. That now is up to 25% or more of those are done now remotely. And it was pretty -- it was low single digits prior to COVID. 
So the uptake on -- that's just one example of how digital is changing workflows and providing, I think, in this case, better patient outcomes, but in more -- a lot of efficiencies. So we're seeing the digital piece take off, and it will provide also productivity for our company. We believe we can provide -- we've learned how to do like medical education remotely.  
Now you can't do all med ed remotely. I mean there's exchange of scientific data, and there's some ability to train remotely. And obviously, at some point, these physicians want to get in the cadaver lab or and things like that. And we haven't figured out how to do that remotely. But we're amazed at -- when our backs were against the wall and you couldn't meet with physicians, how digital came to the rescue and provided a high-quality experience. Now physicians, they are now onboard with this.  
So I think that will, one, speed up adoption of new technology, which is a good thing; but two, provide efficiencies for us."

Look, the M&A, these -- I'd call them -- I won't call them bite size, but smaller tuck-in deals where we're getting at these companies at relatively early stage, most cases, before commercialization seems to be something that's working for us. 
So we can do more of these. We add more value. And we're getting them at values that makes sense. So we're getting good returns on these. And we're spreading our risk across a number of these deals. And I would expect that to continue. And I think the most of the work of these tuck-ins, most of the volume rather, will come around our existing therapies in existing markets to augment them. 
And really, I look at it as an extension of our organic growth strategy because we're not buying growth here. We're buying technology and then kind of adding to that, whether it be additional technology or clinical science, and then making these standard of care around the world. So that's going to be the lion's share of it. 
In terms of white space, this is something we haven't signaled where we're always looking at new markets to better position the company to optimize our portfolio for growth. When you start looking at white space truly outside of the -- then you kind of move outside of the tuck-in, and these tend to be a little larger. And this really is something we're always looking at, if we think it's the right move to help our portfolio. But the focus is the tuck-ins."

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. 
Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast. Joining me today are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021, which ended on April 30, 2021. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. And today's event should last about an hour. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed from the link in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. 
As we mentioned last quarter, the fourth quarter marks the first time that we're using the new nomenclature and reporting structure of our new operating model. For more information on these changes, please see the relevant slides in our earnings presentation. 
During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. Fourth quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last 4 quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. 
Full fiscal year organic revenue comparisons exclude the impact of foreign currency, the benefit in the first 12 months of our Titan Spine acquisition and the benefit of the extra week in our first quarter. References to sequential improvement compare to the third quarter of fiscal '21 and are made on an as-reported basis. All references to share gains or losses are on a revenue and calendar quarter basis unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. 
And with that, let's get started."
31348,667302066,2302249,"Medtronic plc, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported a strong quarter this morning. The expectations that we set for Q4 on the last earnings call were seen by many in the financial community as aggressive. Yet we executed and we delivered, bea",2988,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported a strong quarter this morning. The expectations that we set for Q4 on the last earnings call were seen by many in the financial community as aggressive. Yet we executed and we delivered, beating Street estimates on revenue, margins and EPS. Most of our end markets are returning to near-normal pre-COVID growth. While some geographies are lagging due to COVID's persistence, momentum built throughout the quarter, and we feel confident about the year ahead. Karen will give you more color on our guidance later in this call. But the key takeaway is that we're guiding above Street estimates on the top line while simultaneously accelerating our investments at the front end of major product launches in surgical robotics and renal denervation. 
Now in robotics and renal denervation, we're investing in our marketing, customer service and support capabilities to maximize these product launches. We're also investing in R&D broadly with meaningful programs across the company. As we talked about at our Investor Day last year, we have a packed pipeline across our businesses with a number of meaningful opportunities. And our top priority is to invest in our business and pipeline to take advantage of those opportunities. As a result, we plan on increasing our R&D spend by more than 10% in FY '22, the biggest dollar increase in R&D spend in our company's history, all while delivering strong EPS growth. We're ultra focused on accelerating our top line growth, and we're making incremental investments to put us in a place to drive a sustainable, higher level of growth than you've historically come to expect from Medtronic. 
Before I get into some details on the fourth quarter, I'd like to reflect on the past year, my first as CEO. It's certainly been a difficult environment with the pandemic, but our organization has risen to the challenge and achieved so much in such a short period of time and under unique circumstances. Now it's become clichÃ© for companies to say that they're expecting to emerge from the pandemic stronger as I've heard this raise echoed for many of our competitors. But you've been hearing this from us from day 1. And I think you'll find it hard to name another company in our space that has done more to emerge from the pandemic stronger than Medtronic, whether it was investing in our employees, helping our customers and patients, sustaining our R&D programs or changing our operating model, and putting in place a new Medtronic mindset culture. This past year was transformational for us. 
In fiscal 2021, customers eliminated the vast majority of their quarter end bulk purchases, resulting in a more balanced order flow across the quarter. This has improved our predictability and our pricing, made our business easier to manage and reduced stress on our operations. This past fiscal year, we also accelerated our tuck-in acquisitions, adding key technologies like AI-driven spine planning tools for Medicrea and market-leading smart pen technology from Companion Medical, among others. We also advanced our organic pipeline with more than 230 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China in FY '21. 
FY '21 was also the year that we stepped up and helped our customers and communities during the pandemic. As a leading manufacturer of high acuity ventilators, we significantly increased our production and open sourced our IP to allow others to produce our ventilators around the world. We continue to support communities in need, most recently as a key member of the Global Task Force on Pandemic Response, which was organized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and supported by the Business Roundtable. With the help of other task force members, we're working to supply 1,000 ventilators to India. Medtronic and the Medtronic Foundation also just announced an additional $3 million for COVID relief efforts in underserved areas of India, Brazil and the U.S. and other regions, which brings our combined support of COVID-19 efforts to $56 million. 
And in FY '21, we announced our goal of becoming carbon neutral in our operations by the end of the decade. We've set aggressive targets to reduce our environmental footprint as we focus on creating a sustainable future for our business, our communities and our planet. We've always had a strong mission to guide this company, which includes integrating a strong corporate purpose into our strategy and maintaining good citizenship. And this year, we've enhanced our corporate culture to emphasize our commitment to being bold, more competitive and moving with greater speed and decisiveness, which we believe will help drive the execution of our mission. 
We're also focused on becoming a more diverse and inclusive organization, and I was very proud that Medtronic was recognized earlier this month as #11 on Diversity Inc.'s top 50 U.S. companies for diversity, one of the biggest jumps by any company. We know we have room to improve, and we're striving to be a company that attracts, develops and retains top talent from all gender and ethnic backgrounds. 
To sum up F '21, it was a year marked by progress and accomplishments that will propel us into FY '22 with a stronger foundation for growth and a greater ability to execute, deliver and exceed our own expectations. We have momentum, energy and a pipeline that gives our team optimism about what we can accomplish this year. 
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter results and start with a look at market share as we've been doing the last few earnings calls. We continue to gain share in an increasing number of our businesses, driven by our differentiated product offerings. And we've put in place operating mechanisms to ensure that we continue to drive this competitive culture across the organization. Market share is one of the key metrics that we will hold our teams accountable to deliver in evaluating performance. And in FY '22, it will be included as a metric in our annual incentive compensation. While the impact of COVID on procedures, along with the timing of our quarter, does mask some of the underlying market dynamics, we are seeing a growing trend of share gains for Medtronic. 
Leading the list for share gains this quarter is one of our largest businesses, Cardiac Rhythm Management, which has gained share over the past several quarters. We estimate that our CRM business has gained 2 to 3 points year-over-year. And CRM is now at the highest share level in more than a decade with strong gains from around the globe. Now these gains have been driven by Micra, our leadless pacemaker, which grew 74% in Q4 and is now annualizing at nearly $400 million. Micra is a great example of the innovation and disruption that we're driving at Medtronic. 
But it's not just Micra generating our share gains, our Cobalt and Crome High Power devices are also contributing, driving our CRTD product line to 74% growth in Q4. 
In TAVR, our share was up over 1 point year-over-year and was stable sequentially. we reached an all-time record of U.S. TAVR implants in the quarter. Late last month, we announced interim results of our Optimized Pro study, which showed that our new implant technique is resulting in single-digit pacemaker rates. 
In addition, last week at EuroPCR, we announced very strong low risk data, which showed that the advantages of our Evolut TAVR system are maintained over surgical valves at 2 years post-procedure. Importantly, our data showed no convergence of the TAVR and SAVR curves for death or disabling stroke as well as continued low valve thrombosis rates out to year 2. This stands in contrast to our competition's PARTNER III data. And we'll leverage this data with implanting physicians as we continue to go on the offensive [indiscernible] 
We estimate that we gain share both year-over-year and sequentially. Our GI diagnostic product lines grew in the low 50s, driven by high 60s growth of our PillCam. Last month, we received FDA clearance for our GI Genius module, which uses artificial intelligence to assist physicians in detecting both precancerous and cancerous growth during colonoscopies. GI Genius can highlight lesions realtime and identify polyps that might otherwise go undetected by the human eye, improving the quality of colonoscopies. 
In our Cranial & Spinal Technologies business, we estimate that we gained share in both Spine and neurosurgery, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our strategy of bringing a digital ecosystem of enabling technology to spine procedures is working. We had record sales of our Stealthstation navigation systems, O-arm imaging systems, Midas Rex capital and Advanced Energy products. And we estimate that our Mazor robotics system continues to outpace our closest competitor. 
In ENT, we estimate that our share is up over 1 point year-over-year. The ongoing launches of our NIM VITAL neuromonitoring system and Stealthstation Flexi and T navigation system, coupled with share gains in disposable sinus blades, are driving our above-market performance. 
In Pelvic Health, share gain continued with the momentum created by the launch of InterStim Micro and the Surescan leads. Our sales growth outpaced tax audits in the calendar first quarter, and we did this despite having a far larger sales base. While the European sacral neuromodulation market remains sluggish due to COVID resurgence, the U.S. market continues to accelerate. 
Turning to neuromodulation. We estimate that we have gained about 1 point of Pain Stim share year-over-year and even more sequentially. Our SCS product line grew 73% in Q4, and we continued to outpace the competition in the calendar first quarter. The market continues to show strong enthusiasm for our DTM SCS therapy, which now carries a superiority label from the FDA. And our strategy of going after competitive account conversions is yielding great results. Our DTM trial adoption remained robust and grew sequentially, a good leading indicator for future growth in our Pain Stim business. 
In Brain Modulation, while we estimate we lost a couple of points of share year-over-year, we continue to gain sequential share on the back of the Percept PC launch. Percept has resulted in 10 points of new implant share gains in the U.S. since its launch last summer. 
So there are a number of businesses where we're gaining share, but there are still some businesses where we've got some work to do. In Cardiac Diagnostics, as we discussed last quarter, we continue to be supply-constrained with our new LINQ II system in Q4 as we ramp our unique wafer scale manufacturing. We estimate we lost about 1 point sequentially and mid-single-digit share points year-over-year, primarily to Boston Scientific. We're working through the supply ramp-up and expect to have improved supply in the back half of the fiscal year. In addition, we implemented a product ship hold on the LINQ II last week as we analyze an issue. In the meantime, customers are continuing to use our Reveal LINQ. Once we resolve the issue, we're confident that the proven market leadership of Reveal LINQ and the competitive differentiation of LINQ II will allow us to continue to win in this space. 
In our Aortic business, we announced the voluntary recall of our Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft system in February. We also announced that we would be working to ramp production of our previous generation product, the Valiant Captivia, but that we would not be at full production until September. The loss of Navion had a $35 million impact to revenue in Q4 and resulted in us losing high-teens share in the thoracic stent graft market. That said, our customers have expressed strong interest in using the Valiant Captivia product when inventory is available. And looking ahead, we're estimating that the quarterly revenue impact will decrease as we go through FY '22 from $30 million in Q1 to $50 million in Q4. 
In Neurovascular, we estimate we lost a couple of points of share year-over-year, driven primarily by new competitive flow diverters from Stryker and Terumo. That said, we saw our share stabilize sequentially as we launched our Solitaire X 3-millimeter stent retriever in the U.S. and started the limited launch of our pipeline vantage flow diverter in certain CE mark countries. We expect our new products to drive sequential share gains going forward. 
In Diabetes, we continue to execute on our turnaround strategy, growing 9% this quarter. This is still below market and we estimate we lost about 5 points of share year-over-year. However, our share was stable sequentially. Our new Minimed 770G and 780G insulin pumps are giving us momentum, resulting in very strong double-digit global insulin pump growth. 
Next, let's turn to our pipeline. We're launching a number of products across the company and even more coming. We expect our robust pipeline to be the key driver of accelerating our top line growth as we're at the front of some large opportunities to win share, create new markets and disrupt existing markets. And as I noted earlier, we're continuing to fuel R&D investments, such that our pipeline can be a continuous source of sustained revenue growth over the coming years. 
Starting with Cardiovascular. One of our largest future drivers is renal denervation as we develop our solution to go after the multibillion-dollar addressable market in hypertension. We're expecting to present our ON-MED pivotal trial results later this year, likely at the TCT Conference in November. And these results are likely to be one of the most highly anticipated events in medtech this year. 
In Cardiac Rhythm Management, we're planning to file for CE Mark for our disruptive extravascular ICD technology this quarter. Let me repeat that. I said this quarter. And in our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, we're expecting a first-line therapy indication for our Arctic Front cryoballoon in the U.S. this coming quarter. We also continue to make good progress on bringing our disruptive pulse field ablation system in the market with strong enrollment in our pulse AF pivotal trial. 
In Structural Heart, we received FDA approval in Q4 for our Harmony transcatheter pulmonary valve, the first-of-its-kind and a breakthrough treatment for patients with congenital heart disease. In TAVR, we received low-risk Shonin approval in Japan and are expecting reimbursement approval later this fiscal year. We also expect the U.S. rollout of our next-generation TAVR valve, the Evolut FX, later this calendar year, which will feature enhanced deliverability and ease of use. 
Turning to our Medical Surgical portfolio. Another very important program is our Hugo robotic-assisted surgery platform. At the end of march, we reported that we'd submitted Hugo for CE Mark and U.S. IDE approval. Well, today, I'm happy to report that the FDA has granted the IDE approval, and we're preparing to commence our expand Euro trial in the U.S. to study Hugo in urologic procedures. We also had our first revenue from Hugo placements at hospitals outside the U.S. in Q4. These systems will collect clinical data to support regulatory approvals in the U.S. and around the world. 
As you think about modeling the revenue from our Surgical Robotics business, we're expecting $50 million to $100 million in FY '22, and that's likely to roughly double or triple in FY '23. We expect soft tissue robotics to be a meaningful growth driver going forward, not just for Medsurg, but for overall Medtronic. 
In our Neuroscience portfolio, we have some exciting near-term milestones coming in our Neuromodulation business. We're expecting to launch our Vanta recharge-free spinal cord stimulator in the first half of this fiscal year. This is a big opportunity for us to gain additional share in Pain Stim given our low share in the recharge-free portion of the market. We're also on track to submit our ECAPS device to the FDA later this calendar year, which has the potential to be a disruptive technology in the spinal cord stim space. 
And in Brain Mod, we're expecting FDA approval for our Sensite directional lead later this calendar year. This will close a key competitive gap and further differentiate our Percept PC system, which I mentioned earlier, was already taken a lot of share in DBS. 
And in Pelvic Health, we received IDE approval last month to start our Titan 1 feasibility study. This trial will evaluate our implantable tibial system, a device that we think could substantially increase our ability to serve overactive bladder patients, many of whom do not seek therapy or remain on current therapy. 
In Neurovascular, in addition to the Solitaire X 3-millimeter stent retriever and Pipeline Vantage flow diverter that I mentioned earlier, we're rolling out 5 additional products this calendar year. This includes meaningful innovation for the stroke market, like our Pipeline Shield Flow diverter in the U.S. and Risk Radial Access system. 
In Diabetes, we recently received CE Mark approval for our ZEUS CGM sensor, which will be marketing as the Guardian 4 sensor. The no calibration data that was used to support the CE Mark approval will be presented next week at the virtual ATTD conference, and the abstract is available on the ATTD website. We're pleased with the accuracy of [indiscernible] and that it has now been labeled for dosing without fingersticks. 
Starting this fall, Europeans will not only have access to the 780G with the highest reported time and range of any insulin pump, but also our Guardian 4 sensor with no fingersticks required and our extended infusion set with an industry-leading 7-day wear. We think this is a highly differentiated product offering and one that we can't wait to bring to other markets. In the U.S., the 780G and Guardian 4 sensor are under active review with the FDA. 
Finally, we're making progress on our Synergy sensor, which is disposable, easier to apply and half the size of our current sensor. We intend to submit this answer to the FDA in the first half of the fiscal year once we complete our manufacturing module. 
I'll now turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and guidance. Karen?"

Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 32%, and adjusted EPS increased 159%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn we experienced at the start of the pandemic last year. 
Our end markets continue to recover from the impact of COVID. And we continue to execute on our strategy and launch new products, resulting in a sequential revenue increase of 5% and sequential adjusted EPS growth of 16%. Our adjusted EPS was $0.08 better than consensus with $0.02 on higher operating profit and $0.06 from a lower than estimated tax rate. Our recovery from the COVID resurgence in December and January improved throughout the quarter as expected. March was stronger than February, and April was stronger than March. We were particularly pleased with the strength of the last several weeks of the quarter, which we believe sets us up nicely for the start of our new fiscal year. 
From a geographic standpoint, we had strong 47% growth in the United States. Outside of the U.S., our developed markets grew 11% with continued pockets of COVID resurgence in parts of Western Europe, Japan and Canada. Our emerging markets grew 41%, driven by China growth in the low 90s. 
Our adjusted margins continued to improve sequentially with 120 basis points on our gross margin and 190 basis points on our operating margin. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 9.6%, better than initially estimated given a favorable jurisdictional mix of profits, along with certain onetime benefits. 
We've said throughout this past year that the actions we're taking during the pandemic do not only support our employees and our customers, but also continue investing, would impact our free cash flow. That said, we're pleased that we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow, converting 81% of our non-GAAP earnings into cash, just above our long-term conversion target of 80%. 
During the quarter, we repaid in full a JPY 300 billion term loan that was issued earlier in the fiscal year. And our year-end cash position remains above $10.5 billion. You can be assured that despite the pandemic, Medtronic continues to be in a strong financial position to drive our long-term strategies. 
Reflecting the confidence that we and our Board have in the future growth of this company, this morning, we announced that we are increasing our dividend by 9%. We are an S&P dividend aristocrat, having increased our dividend now for 44 years, and the dividend is an important part of the total return we generate for our shareholders. We also restarted our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter with a focus on covering dilution from our stock-based compensation. 
Now turning to our guidance. We're confident in the continuing procedure recovery around the globe and the resilience of our end markets and as a result, today, reinstate giving formal guidance. We expect strong organic revenue growth acceleration in fiscal '22 to 9%, plus or minus, 1 point above current Street consensus. And while the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $400 million to $500 million. 
By segment, we expect Cardiovascular and Neuroscience to grow 10% to 11%; Medical Surgical to grow 6% to 7%; and Diabetes to grow 3% to 4%, all on an organic basis. You'll remember that last year, we had an extra week in our fiscal calendar, and these growth rates have not been adjusted for that extra week given the offset that we had from customer bulk purchases. As a result, we do not intend to adjust our organic growth in fiscal '22 for the extra week in fiscal '21. 
In the first quarter, we're comfortable with Street consensus on revenue, which implies organic growth of 17% to 18% and a currency tailwind between $200 million and $250 million at recent rates. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 14% to 15%, Medical Surgical to grow 18% to 19%, Neuroscience to grow 25% to 26% and Diabetes to be flat. With so many big opportunities in front of us, we're prioritizing R&D and commercial investments with growth above and beyond what you would see in a normal year, and we're allocating this capital across our businesses to our best opportunities. As you know, 2 of our largest opportunities are surgical robotics and renal denervation. We're purposely making significant investments in them to ensure we fully capitalize on the multibillion-dollar opportunities ahead. Just to give you a sense, when you combine the fact that it's early in the revenue cycle of these 2 programs with our heavy investment, we are planning for an operating loss of approximately $400 million next fiscal year from these combined programs. Yet, it is important to note that even with these kind of investments, we're still expecting operating margin expansion. 
This is the power of Medtronic's business model, that we can simultaneously make large-scale investments in some of the most important future technology areas in med tech, cover the dilution and deliver strong profitability and returns for our shareholders. On the bottom line, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.60 to $5.75 in fiscal '22, which includes a benefit of $0.10 to $0.15 from currency at recent rates. For the first quarter, we expect EPS of $1.31 to $1.34, above currentStreet consensus of $1.29 to $1.31. And first quarter EPS would include a currency tailwind of about $0.03 at recent rates. 
Before I hand it back over to Geoff, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of the employees across Medtronic who scaled mountains this year, leaning in to deliver a great year under difficult circumstances. I'm proud to be part of such a terrific team, and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Back to you, Geoff."

But I'll start with the answer. Overall, we're nearing a full recovery. And we're seeing with each month of the quarter, every month was better than the prior month, and that continued to improve and accelerate into May, largely driven by the U.S. market. I mean once we hit that vaccination inflection point, I mean, I know a couple of months ago, people were worried that it wasn't moving fast enough. Then we hit an inflection point and things really opened up. And so in the U.S., where -- depending what therapy you want to look at, anywhere from 85% to over 100% of pre-COVID levels, and like I said, every month got better. And then you got to look around the world. China is pretty much back to normal totally. And Europe being our second biggest Western Europe, if you look at that as 1 market, that is lagging behind the U.S. But look, we're confident that when you have a health care system like they have with that kind of infrastructure, once they get the vaccinations going, it will hit that same inflection point in the United States and open up. But as you know, they're a couple of months behind. 
The harder one to peg down is the emerging markets, I mean, places like India, where the virus is still ranging. Southeast -- other parts of Southeast Asia, Latin America, they don't have the same infrastructure even when they get the vaccine, and there's a lot of people, so there's a lot of vaccines that you need to get there. So that's a harder one to pin down. But overall, as a company, I guess said, we're nearing a full recovery despite the emerging market piece, really driven by the acceleration of the United States. And like I said, we expect Europe to come not too far behind."

But what you really want to know is when your blood sugar is high or when it's low, is your sensor accurate? And those data are really accurate, and you'll see that in the presentation. 
And the other thing that's important is the trending is by the sugar reliably being going up or down, and that's really what matters. So kind of like A1c is a big average over time for glycemic control and time and range replace that metric. Really, the accuracy in the right places in the ranges is what's important.

So we're investing in sales and marketing and other related growth investments. 
But inorganic still is a priority. We did a number of a number of deals last year, tuck-in deals. And I'd say tuck-ins are still the focus. And those tuck-in deals could be up to several billion dollars. I mean the ones we did over the last 18 months have been smaller than that. But I wouldn't mistake size for impact. Some of these ones like Medicrea, which is the AI planning tool and outcomes tracking tool for spine, is a real nice piece of the puzzle for our Spine strategy.

But I think the theme you -- I'd walk away with this that we're committed to investing in growth, both organically, inorganically and doing what it takes to do that and still deliver on the EPS growth expectations that we set out. And so that's what the team is focused on, and you're seeing the benefits of that. I don't know, Karen, if you want to?"

And then secondly, there has been this, what it feels like a bit of an inflection point in terms of robotic surgery momentum and placement throughout the back end of last year and the first part of this year. I'm just wondering how if you could describe your -- how you compare the fourth quarter to the third quarter and how the cadence feels in terms of new placements and pull-through in your current programs as well?"

Yes, I was going to ask you to clarify because you said robotics, I wasn't sure. So on the Spine side, look, Matt, I know you followed this for years. The strategy of surrounding the spine procedure and preceding the spine procedure and following up",417,"Okay. Yes, I was going to ask you to clarify because you said robotics, I wasn't sure. So on the Spine side, look, Matt, I know you followed this for years. The strategy of surrounding the spine procedure and preceding the spine procedure and following up the spine procedure with enabling technology from surgical planning, to navigation, interoperative imaging, the robot, this is paying off. I mean we had record sales last quarter of our capital equipment tied to spine procedures and continue to outpace the competition on the robotic sales. But more than anything, okay, more important than all of that is the surgeon feedback that we're getting has hit an inflection point. They are now talking about the outcomes that they're getting from this. It's the planning, the precision of the planning to get the right alignment plan in there, and then the accuracy of executing to that plan with NAV and the robot and then the ability to follow it up and access images in the pack system through Medicrea to come back and retrain or continue to evolve our algorithms and also show surgeons are you really getting that alignment that you thought. This is coming together. And we -- I think we're separating ourselves from the pack and really, really getting closer to what our ultimate goal here is to transform spine surgery from the art that it is today to a science and then demonstrate it with outcomes. So that is something we're very excited. Like you mentioned the momentum, the momentum -- the lagging -- the momentum from the enabling technology, like I said, record sales, and it's because the buzz is out there from surgeons starting to talk about the results they're getting from using this. And people that were sitting on the sidelines are jumping in and the bus is moving. The train's left the station on this one. And the feedback from our field, again, a lagging indicator, is palpable, the energy. So we're feeling really good about spine and robotics. And then the lessons that we've learned from spine, we are spending a lot of time, our Spine team, and Brett Wall, working with Bob White and Megan Rosengarten on the on the soft tissue I think a lot of those lessons learned. I mean the markets aren't the same. They are different, but there are some lessons learned, and there are some synergies there that we will incorporate into our Hugo soft tissue robot launch."

We've got increased role clarity and accountability across the org in this new decentralized model. And people are now looking forward and focused on their key metrics. So like for our operating units, it's this innovation pipeline, it's their market growth, it's their market share, as we just talked about. And this market share, one, is liberating for us because instead of comparing ourselves to ourselves, we're comparing ourselves to the market with the clear expectation to grow at or above the market. That clarifies a lot. 
For our regions, things like strategic account growth over and above what we're getting in the traditional medtech model of selling to the specialist physician and focused on those patients. But in addition to that, the strategic account growth. For our Executive Committee, right, for the people on this call, measurements around capital allocation to the high-growth segments, portfolio management, all in a focus to increase our overall company weighted average market growth rate, right? So -- and then finally, I'd say there's lots of excitement, more than I would have thought maybe even about the culture changes, this thing we're calling the Medtronic mindset that has these -- it really works alongside our mission. Medtronic is known for a mission-driven company. We always want to be known for that. That's kind of our ROI, if you will. But adding these things like acting boldly, competing to win, move with speeding decisiveness, delivering results the right way, adding these into the mix alongside our mission has generated a lot of energy, and it's kind of taken off organically inside the company. And so I'd say, overall, really happy with where it's going, and we're starting to see the results of this."

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations.  
Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast. Joining me today are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021, which ended on April 30, 2021. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. And today's event should last about an hour.  
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed from the link in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.  
As we mentioned last quarter, the fourth quarter marks the first time that we're using the new nomenclature and reporting structure of our new operating model. For more information on these changes, please see the relevant slides in our earnings presentation.  
During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. Fourth quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last 4 quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth.  
Full fiscal year organic revenue comparisons exclude the impact of foreign currency, the benefit in the first 12 months of our Titan Spine acquisition and the benefit of the extra week in our first quarter. References to sequential improvement compare to the third quarter of fiscal '21 and are made on an as-reported basis. All references to share gains or losses are on a revenue and calendar quarter basis unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.  
And with that, let's get started."
31348,667302066,2302476,"Medtronic plc, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported a strong quarter this morning. The expectations that we set for Q4 on the last earnings call were seen by many in the financial community as aggressive. Yet we executed and we delivered, bea",2994,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported a strong quarter this morning. The expectations that we set for Q4 on the last earnings call were seen by many in the financial community as aggressive. Yet we executed and we delivered, beating Street estimates on revenue, margins and EPS. Most of our end markets are returning to near-normal pre-COVID growth. While some geographies are lagging due to COVID's persistence, momentum built throughout the quarter, and we feel confident about the year ahead. Karen will give you more color on our guidance later in this call. But the key takeaway is that we're guiding above Street estimates on the top line while simultaneously accelerating our investments at the front end of major product launches in surgical robotics and renal denervation. 
Now in robotics and renal denervation, we're investing in our marketing, customer service and support capabilities to maximize these product launches. We're also investing in R&D broadly with meaningful programs across the company. As we talked about at our Investor Day last year, we have a packed pipeline across our businesses with a number of meaningful opportunities. And our top priority is to invest in our business and pipeline to take advantage of those opportunities. 
As a result, we plan on increasing our R&D spend by more than 10% in FY '22, the biggest dollar increase in R&D spend in our company's history, all while delivering strong EPS growth. We're ultra-focused on accelerating our top line growth, and we're making incremental investments to put us in a place to drive a sustainable, higher level of growth than you've historically come to expect from Medtronic.  
Before I get into some details on the fourth quarter, I'd like to reflect on the past year, my first as CEO. It's certainly been a difficult environment with the pandemic, but our organization has risen to the challenge and achieved so much in such a short period of time and under unique circumstances. Now it's become cliché for companies to say that they're expecting to emerge from the pandemic stronger as I've heard this phrase echoed from many of our competitors. But you've been hearing this from us from day 1. And I think you'll find it hard to name another company in our space that has done more to emerge from this pandemic stronger than Medtronic, whether it was investing in our employees, helping our customers and patients, sustaining our R&D programs or changing our operating model, and putting in place a new Medtronic mindset culture. This past year was transformational for us.  
In fiscal 2021, customers eliminated the vast majority of their quarter end bulk purchases, resulting in a more balanced order flow across the quarter. This has improved our predictability and our pricing, made our business easier to manage and reduced stress on our operations. This past fiscal year, we also accelerated our tuck-in acquisitions, adding key technologies like AI-driven spine planning tools for Medicrea and market-leading smart pen technology from Companion Medical, among others. We also advanced our organic pipeline with more than 230 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China in FY '21.  
FY '21 was also the year that we stepped up and helped our customers and communities during the pandemic. As a leading manufacturer of high-acuity ventilators, we significantly increased our production and open-sourced our IP to allow others to produce our ventilators around the world. We continue to support communities in need, most recently as a key member of the Global Task Force on Pandemic Response, which was organized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and supported by the Business Roundtable. With the help of other task force members, we're working to supply 1,000 ventilators to India. Medtronic and the Medtronic Foundation also just announced an additional $3 million for COVID relief efforts in underserved areas of India, Brazil and the U.S. and other regions, which brings our combined support of COVID-19 efforts to $56 million.  
And in FY '21, we announced our goal of becoming carbon neutral in our operations by the end of the decade. We've set aggressive targets to reduce our environmental footprint as we focus on creating a sustainable future for our business, our communities and our planet. We've always had a strong mission to guide this company, which includes integrating a strong corporate purpose into our strategy and maintaining good citizenship. And this year, we've enhanced our corporate culture to emphasize our commitment to being bold, more competitive and moving with greater speed and decisiveness, which we believe will help drive the execution of our mission.  
We're also focused on becoming a more diverse and inclusive organization, and I was very proud that Medtronic was recognized earlier this month as #11 on DiversityInc's Top 50 U.S. Companies for Diversity, one of the biggest jumps by any company. We know we have room to improve, and we're striving to be a company that attracts, develops and retains top talent from all gender and ethnic backgrounds.  
To sum up F '21, it was a year marked by progress and accomplishments that will propel us into FY '22 with a stronger foundation for growth and a greater ability to execute, deliver and exceed our own expectations. We have momentum, energy and a pipeline that gives our team optimism about what we can accomplish this year.  
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter results and start with a look at market share as we've been doing the last few earnings calls. We continue to gain share in an increasing number of our businesses, driven by our differentiated product offerings. And we've put in place operating mechanisms to ensure that we continue to drive this competitive culture across the organization. Market share is one of the key metrics that we will hold our teams accountable to deliver in evaluating performance. And in FY '22, it will be included as a metric in our annual incentive compensation. While the impact of COVID on procedures, along with the timing of our quarter, does mask some of the underlying market dynamics, we are seeing a growing trend of share gains for Medtronic.  
Leading the list for share gains this quarter is one of our largest businesses, Cardiac Rhythm Management, which has gained share over the past several quarters. We estimate that our CRM business has gained 2 to 3 points year-over-year. And CRM is now at the highest share level in more than a decade with strong gains from around the globe. Now these gains have been driven by Micra, our leadless pacemaker, which grew 74% in Q4 and is now annualizing at nearly $400 million. Micra is a great example of the innovation and disruption that we're driving at Medtronic. But it's not just Micra generating our share gains, our Cobalt and Crome high-power devices are also contributing, driving our CRT-D product line to 74% growth in Q4.  
In TAVR, our share was up over 1 point year-over-year and was stable sequentially. We reached an all-time record of U.S. TAVR implants in the quarter. Late last month, we announced interim results of our OPTIMIZE PRO study, which showed that our new implant technique is resulting in single-digit pacemaker rates.  
In addition, last week at EuroPCR, we announced very strong low-risk data, which showed that the advantages of our Evolut TAVR system are maintained over surgical valves at 2 years post-procedure. Importantly, our data showed no convergence of the TAVR and SAVR curves for death or disabling stroke as well as continued low valve thrombosis rates out to year 2. This stands in contrast to our competition's PARTNER 3 data. And we'll leverage this data with implanting physicians as we continue to go on the offensive in win share in this important growth market. 
In our Gastrointestinal business, we estimate that we gained share, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our GI diagnostic product lines grew in the low 50s, driven by high 60s growth of our PillCam. Last month, we received FDA clearance for our GI Genius module, which uses artificial intelligence to assist physicians in detecting both precancerous and cancerous growth during colonoscopies. GI Genius can highlight lesions realtime and identify polyps that might otherwise go undetected by the human eye, improving the quality of colonoscopies.  
In our Cranial & Spinal Technologies business, we estimate that we gained share in both Spine and Neurosurgery, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our strategy of bringing a digital ecosystem of enabling technology to spine procedures is working. We had record sales of our StealthStation navigation systems, O-arm imaging systems, Midas Rex capital and Advanced Energy products. And we estimate that our Mazor Robotics system continues to outpace our closest competitor.  
In ENT, we estimate that our share is up over 1 point year-over-year. The ongoing launches of our NIM VITAL neuro-monitoring system and StealthStation FlexENT navigation system, coupled with share gains in disposable sinus blades, are driving our above-market performance.  
In Pelvic Health, share gain continued with the momentum created by the launch of InterStim Micro and the SureScan leads. Our sales growth outpaced tax audits in the calendar first quarter, and we did this despite having a far larger sales base. While the European sacral neuromodulation market remains sluggish due to COVID resurgence, the U.S. market continues to accelerate.  
Turning to Neuromodulation. We estimate that we have gained about 1 point of Pain Stim share year-over-year and even more sequentially. Our SCS product line grew 73% in Q4, and we continued to outpace the competition in the calendar first quarter. The market continues to show strong enthusiasm for our DTM SCS therapy, which now carries a superiority label from the FDA. And our strategy of going after competitive account conversions is yielding great results. Our DTM trial adoption remained robust and grew sequentially, a good leading indicator for future growth in our Pain Stim business.  
In Brain Modulation, while we estimate we lost a couple of points of share year-over-year, we continue to gain sequential share on the back of the Percept PC launch. Percept has resulted in 10 points of new implant share gains in the U.S. since its launch last summer.  
So there are a number of businesses where we're gaining share, but there are still some businesses where we've got some work to do. In cardiac diagnostics, as we discussed last quarter, we continue to be supply-constrained with our new LINQ II system in Q4 as we ramp our unique wafer scale manufacturing. We estimate we lost about 1 point sequentially and mid-single-digit share points year-over-year, primarily to Boston Scientific. We're working through the supply ramp-up and expect to have improved supply in the back half of the fiscal year. 
In addition, we implemented a product ship hold on the LINQ II last week as we analyze an issue. In the meantime, customers are continuing to use our Reveal LINQ. Once we resolve the issue, we're confident that the proven market leadership of Reveal LINQ and the competitive differentiation of LINQ II will allow us to continue to win in this space.  
In our Aortic business, we announced the voluntary recall of our Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft system in February. We also announced that we would be working to ramp production of our previous generation product, the Valiant Captivia, but that we would not be at full production until September. The loss of Navion had a $35 million impact to revenue in Q4 and resulted in us losing high-teens share in the thoracic stent graft market. That said, our customers have expressed strong interest in using the Valiant Captivia product when inventory is available. And looking ahead, we're estimating that the quarterly revenue impact will decrease as we go through FY '22 from $30 million in Q1 to $50 million in Q4.  
In Neurovascular, we estimate we lost a couple of points of share year-over-year, driven primarily by new competitive flow diverters from Stryker and Terumo. That said, we saw our share stabilize sequentially as we launched our Solitaire X 3-millimeter stent retriever in the U.S. and started the limited launch of our Pipeline Vantage flow diverter in certain CE Mark countries. We expect our new products to drive sequential share gains going forward.  
In Diabetes, we continue to execute on our turnaround strategy, growing 9% this quarter. This is still below market and we estimate we lost about 5 points of share year-over-year. However, our share was stable sequentially. Our new MiniMed 770G and 780G insulin pumps are giving us momentum, resulting in very strong double-digit global insulin pump growth.  
Next, let's turn to our pipeline. We're launching a number of products across the company and even more coming. We expect our robust pipeline to be the key driver of accelerating our top line growth as we're at the front of some large opportunities to win share, create new markets and disrupt existing markets. And as I noted earlier, we're continuing to fuel R&D investments, such that our pipeline can be a continuous source of sustained revenue growth over the coming years.  
Starting with Cardiovascular. One of our largest future drivers is renal denervation as we develop our solution to go after the multibillion-dollar addressable market in hypertension. We're expecting to present our ON MED pivotal trial results later this year, likely at the TCT Conference in November. And these results are likely to be one of the most highly anticipated events in med tech this year.  
In Cardiac Rhythm Management, we're planning to file for CE Mark for our disruptive extravascular ICD technology this quarter. Let me repeat that. I said this quarter. And in our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, we're expecting a first-line therapy indication for our Arctic Front cryoballoon in the U.S. this coming quarter. We also continue to make good progress on bringing our disruptive pulse field ablation system in the market with strong enrollment in our PULSED AF pivotal trial.  
In Structural Heart, we received FDA approval in Q4 for our Harmony transcatheter pulmonary valve, the first-of-its-kind and a breakthrough treatment for patients with congenital heart disease. In TAVR, we received low-risk Shonin approval in Japan and are expecting reimbursement approval later this fiscal year. We also expect the U.S. rollout of our next-generation TAVR valve, the Evolut FX, later this calendar year, which will feature enhanced deliverability and ease of use.  
Turning to our Medical Surgical portfolio. Another very important program is our Hugo robotic-assisted surgery platform. At the end of March, we reported that we'd submitted Hugo for CE Mark and U.S. IDE approval. Well, today, I'm happy to report that the FDA has granted the IDE approval, and we're preparing to commence our EXPAND Euro trial in the U.S. to study Hugo in neurologic procedures. We also had our first revenue from Hugo placements at hospitals outside the U.S. in Q4. These systems will collect clinical data to support regulatory approvals in the U.S. and around the world.  
As you think about modeling the revenue from our Surgical Robotics business, we're expecting $50 million to $100 million in FY '22, and that's likely to roughly double or triple in FY '23. We expect soft tissue robotics to be a meaningful growth driver going forward, not just for MedSurg, but for overall Medtronic.  
In our Neuroscience portfolio, we have some exciting near-term milestones coming in our Neuromodulation business. We're expecting to launch our Vanta recharge-free spinal cord stimulator in the first half of this fiscal year. This is a big opportunity for us to gain additional share in Pain Stim given our low share in the recharge-free portion of the market. We're also on track to submit our ECAPS device to the FDA later this calendar year, which has the potential to be a disruptive technology in the spinal cord stim space.  
And in Brain Mod, we're expecting FDA approval for our SenSight directional lead later this calendar year. This will close a key competitive gap and further differentiate our Percept PC system, which I mentioned earlier, was already taken a lot of share in DBS.  
And in Pelvic Health, we received IDE approval last month to start our TITAN 1 feasibility study. This trial will evaluate our implantable tibial system, a device that we think could substantially increase our ability to serve overactive bladder patients, many of whom do not seek therapy or remain on current therapy.  
In Neurovascular, in addition to the Solitaire X 3-millimeter stent retriever and Pipeline Vantage flow diverter that I mentioned earlier, we're rolling out 5 additional products this calendar year. This includes meaningful innovation for the stroke market, like our Pipeline Shield flow diverter in the U.S. and Rist Radial Access system.  
In Diabetes, we recently received CE Mark approval for our Zeus CGM sensor, which we'll be marketing as the Guardian 4 sensor. The no calibration data that was used to support the CE Mark approval will be presented next week at the virtual ATTD Conference, and the abstract is available on the ATTD website. We're pleased with the accuracy of Guardian 4 and that it has now been labeled for dosing without fingersticks.  
Starting this fall, Europeans will not only have access to the 780G with the highest reported time and range of any insulin pump, but also our Guardian 4 sensor with no fingersticks required and our extended infusion set with an industry-leading 7-day wear. We think this is a highly differentiated product offering and one that we can't wait to bring to other markets. In the U.S., the 780G and Guardian 4 sensor are under active review with the FDA.  
Finally, we're making progress on our Synergy sensor, which is disposable, easier to apply and half the size of our current sensor. We intend to submit this sensor to the FDA in the first half of the fiscal year once we complete our manufacturing module.  
I'll now turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and guidance. Karen?"
31348,667302066,2302476,"Medtronic plc, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Thank you, Geoff. Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 32%, and adjusted EPS increased 159%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn we experienced at the start of the pandemic last year.  Our end markets continue to recover from the i",971,"Thank you, Geoff. Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 32%, and adjusted EPS increased 159%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn we experienced at the start of the pandemic last year.  
Our end markets continue to recover from the impact of COVID. And we continue to execute on our strategy and launch new products, resulting in a sequential revenue increase of 5% and sequential adjusted EPS growth of 16%. Our adjusted EPS was $0.08 better than consensus with $0.02 on higher operating profit and $0.06 from a lower than estimated tax rate. Our recovery from the COVID resurgence in December and January improved throughout the quarter as expected. March was stronger than February, and April was stronger than March. We were particularly pleased with the strength of the last several weeks of the quarter, which we believe sets us up nicely for the start of our new fiscal year.  
From a geographic standpoint, we had strong 47% growth in the United States. Outside of the U.S., our developed markets grew 11% with continued pockets of COVID resurgence in parts of Western Europe, Japan and Canada. Our emerging markets grew 41%, driven by China growth in the low 90s.  
Our adjusted margins continued to improve sequentially with 120 basis points on our gross margin and 190 basis points on our operating margin. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 9.6%, better than initially estimated given a favorable jurisdictional mix of profits, along with certain onetime benefits.  
We've said throughout this past year that the actions we're taking during the pandemic do not only support our employees and our customers, but also continue investing, would impact our free cash flow. That said, we're pleased that we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow, converting 81% of our non-GAAP earnings into cash, just above our long-term conversion target of 80%.  
During the quarter, we repaid in full a JPY 300 billion term loan that was issued earlier in the fiscal year. And our year-end cash position remains above $10.5 billion. You can be assured that despite the pandemic, Medtronic continues to be in a strong financial position to drive our long-term strategies.  
Reflecting the confidence that we and our Board have in the future growth of this company, this morning, we announced that we are increasing our dividend by 9%. We are an S&P dividend aristocrat, having increased our dividend now for 44 years, and the dividend is an important part of the total return we generate for our shareholders. We also restarted our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter with a focus on covering dilution from our stock-based compensation.  
Now turning to our guidance. We're confident in the continuing procedure recovery around the globe and the resilience of our end markets and as a result, today, reinstate giving formal guidance. We expect strong organic revenue growth acceleration in fiscal '22 to 9%, plus or minus, 1 point above current Street consensus. And while the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $400 million to $500 million.  
By segment, we expect Cardiovascular and Neuroscience to grow 10% to 11%; Medical Surgical to grow 6% to 7%; and Diabetes to grow 3% to 4%, all on an organic basis. You'll remember that last year, we had an extra week in our fiscal calendar, and these growth rates have not been adjusted for that extra week given the offset that we had from customer bulk purchases. As a result, we do not intend to adjust our organic growth in fiscal '22 for the extra week in fiscal '21.  
In the first quarter, we're comfortable with Street consensus on revenue, which implies organic growth of 17% to 18% and a currency tailwind between $200 million and $250 million at recent rates. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 14% to 15%; Medical Surgical to grow 18% to 19%, Neuroscience to grow 25% to 26% and Diabetes to be flat. With so many big opportunities in front of us, we're prioritizing R&D and commercial investments with growth above and beyond what you would see in a normal year, and we're allocating this capital across our businesses to our best opportunities. 
As you know, 2 of our largest opportunities are surgical robotics and renal denervation. We're purposely making significant investments in them to ensure we fully capitalize on the multibillion-dollar opportunities ahead. Just to give you a sense, when you combine the facts that it's early in the revenue cycle of these 2 programs with our heavy investment, we are planning for an operating loss of approximately $400 million next fiscal year from these combined programs. Yet it is important to note that even with these kind of investments, we're still expecting operating margin expansion.  
This is the power of Medtronic's business model, that we can simultaneously make large-scale investments in some of the most important future technology areas in med tech, cover the dilution and deliver strong profitability and returns for our shareholders. 
On the bottom line, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.60 to $5.75 in fiscal '22, which includes a benefit of $0.10 to $0.15 from currency at recent rates. For the first quarter, we expect EPS of $1.31 to $1.34, above current Street consensus of $1.29 to $1.31. And first quarter EPS would include a currency tailwind of about $0.03 at recent rates.  
Before I hand it back over to Geoff, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of the employees across Medtronic who scaled mountains this year, leaning in to deliver a great year under difficult circumstances. I'm proud to be part of such a terrific team, and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Back to you, Geoff."

Now I'd like to close by emphasizing that there's a lot of energy here at Medtronic, and our momentum is building. You're seeing us perform better than our competition. We've executed in the short term, and we're investing for the long term. We've accomplished a lot in FY '21, and this is a good start, but our expectations are higher. What will truly differentiate us is accelerating and delivering sustained revenue growth at or above our markets, not just over a year or 2, but over the next decade. We have incredible programs in our development pipeline with robust expected financial returns. We're developing the next-generation of medical devices that incorporate technologies like artificial intelligence, big data and miniaturized electronics. These programs have the potential to truly change the future of medicine. When we look at the opportunities ahead of us and how we expect to translate these into strong returns for our shareholders, the future is bright. 
And finally, to our 90,000 employees around the world, thank you for everything that you've accomplished this past year. I'm sure they would agree with me when I say if there's one thing you should take away from today's call, it's that at Medtronic, we're just getting started.

But I'll start with the answer. Overall, we're nearing a full recovery. And we're seeing with each month of the quarter, every month was better than the prior month, and that continued to improve and accelerate into May, largely driven by the U.S. market. 
I mean once we hit that vaccination inflection point, I mean, I know a couple of months ago, people were worried that it wasn't moving fast enough. Then we hit an inflection point and things really opened up. And so in the U.S., we're, depending what therapy you want to look at, anywhere from 85% to over 100% of pre-COVID levels, and like I said, every month got better. And then you got to look around the world. China is pretty much back to normal totally. And Europe being our second biggest, Western Europe, if you look at that as 1 market, that is lagging behind the U.S. But look, we're confident that when you have a health care system like they have with that kind of infrastructure, once they get the vaccinations going, it will hit that same inflection point in the United States and open up. But as you know, they're a couple of months behind. 
The harder one to peg down is the emerging markets, I mean, places like India, where the virus is still raging. Southeast -- other parts of Southeast Asia, Latin America, they don't have the same infrastructure even when they get the vaccine, and there's a lot of people, so there's a lot of vaccines that you need to get there. So that's a harder one to pin down. But overall, as a company, like I said, we're nearing a full recovery despite the emerging market piece, really driven by the acceleration of the United States. And like I said, we expect Europe to come not too far behind."

There's the abstract available on the website right now, which includes the MARD numbers. We also have information coming out on the 780G experience, which I'd point you to, to look at. The first 4,000 patients in the real-world experience are being launched there. We'll have additional smart pen data coming out at the ADA meeting. 
But in terms of your specific question on MARD, that's really not a great metric to look at. There's sort of an overall average of how the difference is looking across the full range of the sensor. But what you really want to know is when your blood sugar is high or when it's low, is your sensor accurate? And those data are really accurate, and you'll see that in the presentation. 
And the other thing that's important is the trending, is the blood sugar reliably being -- going up or down, and that's really what matters. So kind of like A1C is a big average over time for glycemic control and time and range replace that metric. Really, the accuracy at the right places in the ranges is what's important. And you'll see that in the data that's being presented. 
In terms of pricing, there's no plan to change the pricing between what we've done with Guardian Sensor 3 and Guardian Sensor 4 in any market."

Certainly, the new product flows, you mentioned 780 and Zeus for the U.S. will be the most important for us to continue to move both patients from the installed base as well as those new patients, those coming out of MDI or competitors. 
I don't have an update on the timing. We're in active review, as Geoff said, on the filing. And we -- the reviewer that's working with us is the same one that reviewed the 770 device. So we think that, that familiarity is going to be helpful. But there's no update on timing at this point."

But reimbursement is certainly the hurdle. We do have CE Mark. We have approval in a lot of countries. But getting that paid for is going to be important. And in the United States, we're awaiting eagerly the proposed rule on MCIT to allow 4 years of coverage as we develop further evidence upon approval. Now that doesn't cover payment. We still work to do there. We still have to go payer by payer because a lot of the patients will fall into the non-Medicare bucket of patients.

In terms of like our priorities, our priorities are investing in growth. And today, we announced the largest increase in R&D in our history and it's because we're seeing these large market opportunities with clear patient need where Medtronic has a right to win. And so we're looking at those holistically, investing organically in R&D, but also other growth investments like we talked about ahead of certain product launches like Guardian and the robot. So we're investing in sales and marketing and other related growth investments. 
But inorganic is a big -- it still is a priority. We did a number of a number of deals last year, tuck-in deals. And I'd say tuck-ins are still the focus. And those tuck-in deals could be up to several billion dollars. I mean the ones we did over the last 18 months have been smaller than that. But I wouldn't mistake size for impact. Some of these ones like Medicrea, which is the AI planning tool and outcomes tracking tool for spine, is a real nice piece of the puzzle for our Spine strategy. And a couple of questions here on the call today about our smart pen, the Companion Medical. So these are impactful deals. And we look to continue those. And so it's still a priority and over and above -- over buybacks. And we'll see how the year plays out. It's tough to predict, right? We're going to remain disciplined here. 
But I think the theme you -- I'd walk away with is that we're committed to investing in growth, both organically, inorganically and doing what it takes to do that and still deliver on the EPS growth expectations that we set out.

So on the Spine side, look, Matt, I know you followed this for years. The strategy of surrounding the spine procedure and preceding the spine procedure and following up the spine procedure with enabling technology from surgical planning, to navigation, interoperative imaging, the robot, this is paying off. I mean we had record sales last quarter of our capital equipment tied to spine procedures and continue to outpace the competition on the robotic sales. But more than anything, okay, more important than all of that is the surgeon feedback that we're getting has hit an inflection point. They are now talking about the outcomes that they're getting from this. 
It's the planning, the precision of the planning to get the right alignment plan in there, and then the accuracy of executing to that plan with nav and the robot and then the ability to follow it up and access images in the PACS system through Medicrea to come back and retrain or continue to evolve our algorithms and also show surgeons are you really getting that alignment that you thought. This is coming together. And we -- I think we're separating ourselves from the pack and really, really getting closer to what our ultimate goal here is to transform spine surgery from the art that it is today to a science and then demonstrate it with outcomes. 
So that is something we're very excited. Like you mentioned the momentum, the momentum -- the lagging -- the momentum from the enabling technology, like I said, record sales, and it's because the buzz is out there from surgeons starting to talk about the results they're getting from using this. And people that were sitting on the sidelines are jumping in and the bus is moving. The train's left the station on this one. And the feedback from our field, again, a lagging indicator, is palpable, the energy. So we're feeling really good about spine and robotics. And then the lessons that we've learned from spine, we are spending a lot of time, our Spine team, and Brett Wall, working with Bob White and Megan Rosengarten on the soft tissue robot. I think a lot of those lessons learned. I mean the markets aren't the same. They are different, but there are some lessons learned, and there are some synergies there that we will incorporate into our Hugo soft tissue robot launch."

So like for our operating units, it's this innovation pipeline, it's their market growth, it's their market share, as we just talked about.

That clarifies a lot. 
For our regions, things like strategic account growth over and above what we're getting in the traditional med tech model of selling to the specialist physician and focused on those patients. But in addition to that, the strategic account growth.

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations.  Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few det",449,"Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's Fiscal Year 2021 Fourth Quarter Earnings Video Webcast. I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations.  
Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast. Joining me today are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021, which ended on April 30, 2021. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. And today's event should last about an hour.  
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed from the link in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.  
As we mentioned last quarter, the fourth quarter marks the first time that we're using the new nomenclature and reporting structure of our new operating model. For more information on these changes, please see the relevant slides in our earnings presentation.  
During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. Fourth quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last 4 quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth.  
Full fiscal year organic revenue comparisons exclude the impact of foreign currency, the benefit in the first 12 months of our Titan Spine acquisition and the benefit of the extra week in our first quarter. References to sequential improvement compare to the third quarter of fiscal '21 and are made on an as-reported basis. All references to share gains or losses are on a revenue and calendar quarter basis unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.  
And with that, let's get started."
31348,667302066,2339879,"Medtronic plc, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported a strong quarter this morning. The expectations that we set for Q4 on the last earnings call were seen by many in the financial community as aggressive. Yet we executed and we delivered, bea",2994,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported a strong quarter this morning. The expectations that we set for Q4 on the last earnings call were seen by many in the financial community as aggressive. Yet we executed and we delivered, beating Street estimates on revenue, margins and EPS. Most of our end markets are returning to near-normal pre-COVID growth. While some geographies are lagging due to COVID's persistence, momentum built throughout the quarter, and we feel confident about the year ahead. Karen will give you more color on our guidance later in this call. But the key takeaway is that we're guiding above Street estimates on the top line while simultaneously accelerating our investments at the front end of major product launches in surgical robotics and renal denervation. 
Now in robotics and renal denervation, we're investing in our marketing, customer service and support capabilities to maximize these product launches. We're also investing in R&D broadly with meaningful programs across the company. As we talked about at our Investor Day last year, we have a packed pipeline across our businesses with a number of meaningful opportunities. And our top priority is to invest in our business and pipeline to take advantage of those opportunities. 
As a result, we plan on increasing our R&D spend by more than 10% in FY '22, the biggest dollar increase in R&D spend in our company's history, all while delivering strong EPS growth. We're ultra-focused on accelerating our top line growth, and we're making incremental investments to put us in a place to drive a sustainable, higher level of growth than you've historically come to expect from Medtronic.  
Before I get into some details on the fourth quarter, I'd like to reflect on the past year, my first as CEO. It's certainly been a difficult environment with the pandemic, but our organization has risen to the challenge and achieved so much in such a short period of time and under unique circumstances. Now it's become cliché for companies to say that they're expecting to emerge from the pandemic stronger as I've heard this phrase echoed from many of our competitors. But you've been hearing this from us from day 1. And I think you'll find it hard to name another company in our space that has done more to emerge from this pandemic stronger than Medtronic, whether it was investing in our employees, helping our customers and patients, sustaining our R&D programs or changing our operating model, and putting in place a new Medtronic mindset culture. This past year was transformational for us.  
In fiscal 2021, customers eliminated the vast majority of their quarter end bulk purchases, resulting in a more balanced order flow across the quarter. This has improved our predictability and our pricing, made our business easier to manage and reduced stress on our operations. This past fiscal year, we also accelerated our tuck-in acquisitions, adding key technologies like AI-driven spine planning tools for Medicrea and market-leading smart pen technology from Companion Medical, among others. We also advanced our organic pipeline with more than 230 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China in FY '21.  
FY '21 was also the year that we stepped up and helped our customers and communities during the pandemic. As a leading manufacturer of high-acuity ventilators, we significantly increased our production and open-sourced our IP to allow others to produce our ventilators around the world. We continue to support communities in need, most recently as a key member of the Global Task Force on Pandemic Response, which was organized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and supported by the Business Roundtable. With the help of other task force members, we're working to supply 1,000 ventilators to India. Medtronic and the Medtronic Foundation also just announced an additional $3 million for COVID relief efforts in underserved areas of India, Brazil and the U.S. and other regions, which brings our combined support of COVID-19 efforts to $56 million.  
And in FY '21, we announced our goal of becoming carbon neutral in our operations by the end of the decade. We've set aggressive targets to reduce our environmental footprint as we focus on creating a sustainable future for our business, our communities and our planet. We've always had a strong mission to guide this company, which includes integrating a strong corporate purpose into our strategy and maintaining good citizenship. And this year, we've enhanced our corporate culture to emphasize our commitment to being bold, more competitive and moving with greater speed and decisiveness, which we believe will help drive the execution of our mission.  
We're also focused on becoming a more diverse and inclusive organization, and I was very proud that Medtronic was recognized earlier this month as #11 on DiversityInc's Top 50 U.S. Companies for Diversity, one of the biggest jumps by any company. We know we have room to improve, and we're striving to be a company that attracts, develops and retains top talent from all gender and ethnic backgrounds.  
To sum up F '21, it was a year marked by progress and accomplishments that will propel us into FY '22 with a stronger foundation for growth and a greater ability to execute, deliver and exceed our own expectations. We have momentum, energy and a pipeline that gives our team optimism about what we can accomplish this year.  
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter results and start with a look at market share as we've been doing the last few earnings calls. We continue to gain share in an increasing number of our businesses, driven by our differentiated product offerings. And we've put in place operating mechanisms to ensure that we continue to drive this competitive culture across the organization. Market share is one of the key metrics that we will hold our teams accountable to deliver in evaluating performance. And in FY '22, it will be included as a metric in our annual incentive compensation. While the impact of COVID on procedures, along with the timing of our quarter, does mask some of the underlying market dynamics, we are seeing a growing trend of share gains for Medtronic.  
Leading the list for share gains this quarter is one of our largest businesses, Cardiac Rhythm Management, which has gained share over the past several quarters. We estimate that our CRM business has gained 2 to 3 points year-over-year. And CRM is now at the highest share level in more than a decade with strong gains from around the globe. Now these gains have been driven by Micra, our leadless pacemaker, which grew 74% in Q4 and is now annualizing at nearly $400 million. Micra is a great example of the innovation and disruption that we're driving at Medtronic. But it's not just Micra generating our share gains, our Cobalt and Crome high-power devices are also contributing, driving our CRT-D product line to 74% growth in Q4.  
In TAVR, our share was up over 1 point year-over-year and was stable sequentially. We reached an all-time record of U.S. TAVR implants in the quarter. Late last month, we announced interim results of our OPTIMIZE PRO study, which showed that our new implant technique is resulting in single-digit pacemaker rates.  
In addition, last week at EuroPCR, we announced very strong low-risk data, which showed that the advantages of our Evolut TAVR system are maintained over surgical valves at 2 years post-procedure. Importantly, our data showed no convergence of the TAVR and SAVR curves for death or disabling stroke as well as continued low valve thrombosis rates out to year 2. This stands in contrast to our competition's PARTNER 3 data. And we'll leverage this data with implanting physicians as we continue to go on the offensive and win share in this important growth market. 
In our Gastrointestinal business, we estimate that we gained share, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our GI diagnostic product lines grew in the low 50s, driven by high 60s growth of our PillCam. Last month, we received FDA clearance for our GI Genius module, which uses artificial intelligence to assist physicians in detecting both precancerous and cancerous growths during colonoscopies. GI Genius can highlight lesions real-time and identify polyps that might otherwise go undetected by the human eye, improving the quality of colonoscopies.  
In our Cranial & Spinal Technologies business, we estimate that we gained share in both Spine and Neurosurgery, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our strategy of bringing a digital ecosystem of enabling technology to spine procedures is working. We had record sales of our StealthStation navigation systems, O-arm imaging systems, Midas Rex capital and Advanced Energy products. And we estimate that our Mazor Robotics system continues to outpace our closest competitor.  
In ENT, we estimate that our share is up over 1 point year-over-year. The ongoing launches of our NIM VITAL neuro-monitoring system and StealthStation FlexENT navigation system, coupled with share gains in disposable sinus blades, are driving our above-market performance.  
In Pelvic Health, share gain continued with the momentum created by the launch of InterStim Micro and the SureScan leads. Our sales growth outpaced tax audits in the calendar first quarter, and we did this despite having a far larger sales base. While the European sacral neuromodulation market remains sluggish due to COVID resurgence, the U.S. market continues to accelerate.  
Turning to Neuromodulation. We estimate that we have gained about 1 point of Pain Stim share year-over-year and even more sequentially. Our SCS product line grew 73% in Q4, and we continued to outpace the competition in the calendar first quarter. The market continues to show strong enthusiasm for our DTM SCS therapy, which now carries a superiority label from the FDA. And our strategy of going after competitive account conversions is yielding great results. Our DTM trial adoption remained robust and grew sequentially, a good leading indicator for future growth in our Pain Stim business.  
In Brain Modulation, while we estimate we lost a couple of points of share year-over-year, we continue to gain sequential share on the back of the Percept PC launch. Percept has resulted in 10 points of new implant share gains in the U.S. since its launch last summer.  
So there are a number of businesses where we're gaining share, but there are still some businesses where we've got some work to do. In cardiac diagnostics, as we discussed last quarter, we continue to be supply-constrained with our new LINQ II system in Q4 as we ramp our unique wafer scale manufacturing. We estimate we lost about 1 point sequentially and mid-single-digit share points year-over-year, primarily to Boston Scientific. We're working through the supply ramp-up and expect to have improved supply in the back half of the fiscal year. 
In addition, we implemented a product ship hold on the LINQ II last week as we analyze an issue. In the meantime, customers are continuing to use our Reveal LINQ. Once we resolve the issue, we're confident that the proven market leadership of Reveal LINQ and the competitive differentiation of LINQ II will allow us to continue to win in this space.  
In our Aortic business, we announced the voluntary recall of our Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft system in February. We also announced that we would be working to ramp production of our previous generation product, the Valiant Captivia, but that we would not be at full production until September. The loss of Navion had a $35 million impact to revenue in Q4 and resulted in us losing high-teens share in the thoracic stent graft market. That said, our customers have expressed strong interest in using the Valiant Captivia product when inventory is available. And looking ahead, we're estimating that the quarterly revenue impact will decrease as we go through FY '22 from $30 million in Q1 to $15 million in Q4.  
In Neurovascular, we estimate we lost a couple of points of share year-over-year, driven primarily by new competitive flow diverters from Stryker and Terumo. That said, we saw our share stabilize sequentially as we launched our Solitaire X 3-millimeter stent retriever in the U.S. and started the limited launch of our Pipeline Vantage flow diverter in certain CE Mark countries. We expect our new products to drive sequential share gains going forward.  
In Diabetes, we continue to execute on our turnaround strategy, growing 9% this quarter. This is still below market and we estimate we lost about 5 points of share year-over-year. However, our share was stable sequentially. Our new MiniMed 770G and 780G insulin pumps are giving us momentum, resulting in very strong double-digit global insulin pump growth.  
Next, let's turn to our pipeline. We're launching a number of products across the company and even more coming. We expect our robust pipeline to be the key driver of accelerating our top line growth as we're at the front of some large opportunities to win share, create new markets and disrupt existing markets. And as I noted earlier, we're continuing to fuel R&D investments, such that our pipeline can be a continuous source of sustained revenue growth over the coming years.  
Starting with Cardiovascular. One of our largest future drivers is renal denervation as we develop our solution to go after the multibillion-dollar addressable market in hypertension. We're expecting to present our ON MED pivotal trial results later this year, likely at the TCT Conference in November. And these results are likely to be one of the most highly anticipated events in med tech this year.  
In Cardiac Rhythm Management, we're planning to file for CE Mark for our disruptive extravascular ICD technology this quarter. Let me repeat that. I said this quarter. And in our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, we're expecting a first-line therapy indication for our Arctic Front cryoballoon in the U.S. this coming quarter. We also continue to make good progress on bringing our disruptive pulse field ablation system in the market with strong enrollment in our PULSED AF pivotal trial.  
In Structural Heart, we received FDA approval in Q4 for our Harmony transcatheter pulmonary valve, the first-of-its-kind and a breakthrough treatment for patients with congenital heart disease. In TAVR, we received low-risk Shonin approval in Japan and are expecting reimbursement approval later this fiscal year. We also expect the U.S. rollout of our next-generation TAVR valve, the Evolut FX, later this calendar year, which will feature enhanced deliverability and ease of use.  
Turning to our Medical Surgical portfolio. Another very important program is our Hugo robotic-assisted surgery platform. At the end of March, we reported that we'd submitted Hugo for CE Mark and U.S. IDE approval. Well, today, I'm happy to report that the FDA has granted the IDE approval, and we're preparing to commence our EXPAND Euro trial in the U.S. to study Hugo in neurologic procedures. We also had our first revenue from Hugo placements at hospitals outside the U.S. in Q4. These systems will collect clinical data to support regulatory approvals in the U.S. and around the world.  
As you think about modeling the revenue from our Surgical Robotics business, we're expecting $50 million to $100 million in FY '22, and that's likely to roughly double or triple in FY '23. We expect soft tissue robotics to be a meaningful growth driver going forward, not just for MedSurg, but for overall Medtronic.  
In our Neuroscience portfolio, we have some exciting near-term milestones coming in our Neuromodulation business. We're expecting to launch our Vanta recharge-free spinal cord stimulator in the first half of this fiscal year. This is a big opportunity for us to gain additional share in Pain Stim given our low share in the recharge-free portion of the market. We're also on track to submit our ECAPS device to the FDA later this calendar year, which has the potential to be a disruptive technology in the spinal cord stim space.  
And in Brain Mod, we're expecting FDA approval for our SenSight directional lead later this calendar year. This will close a key competitive gap and further differentiate our Percept PC system, which I mentioned earlier, was already taken a lot of share in DBS.  
And in Pelvic Health, we received IDE approval last month to start our TITAN 1 feasibility study. This trial will evaluate our implantable tibial system, a device that we think could substantially increase our ability to serve overactive bladder patients, many of whom do not seek therapy or remain on current therapy.  
In Neurovascular, in addition to the Solitaire X 3-millimeter stent retriever and Pipeline Vantage flow diverter that I mentioned earlier, we're rolling out 5 additional products this calendar year. This includes meaningful innovation for the stroke market, like our Pipeline Shield flow diverter in the U.S. and Rist Radial Access system.  
In Diabetes, we recently received CE Mark approval for our Zeus CGM sensor, which we'll be marketing as the Guardian 4 sensor. The no calibration data that was used to support the CE Mark approval will be presented next week at the virtual ATTD Conference, and the abstract is available on the ATTD website. We're pleased with the accuracy of Guardian 4 and that it has now been labeled for dosing without fingersticks.  
Starting this fall, Europeans will not only have access to the 780G with the highest reported time and range of any insulin pump, but also our Guardian 4 sensor with no fingersticks required and our extended infusion set with an industry-leading 7-day wear. We think this is a highly differentiated product offering and one that we can't wait to bring to other markets. In the U.S., the 780G and Guardian 4 sensor are under active review with the FDA.  
Finally, we're making progress on our Synergy sensor, which is disposable, easier to apply and half the size of our current sensor. We intend to submit this sensor to the FDA in the first half of the fiscal year once we complete our manufacturing module.  
I'll now turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and guidance. Karen?"

Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 32%, and adjusted EPS increased 159%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn we experienced at the start of the pandemic last year.  Our end markets continue to recover from the i",969,"Thank you, Geoff. Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 32%, and adjusted EPS increased 159%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn we experienced at the start of the pandemic last year.  
Our end markets continue to recover from the impact of COVID. And we continue to execute on our strategy and launch new products, resulting in a sequential revenue increase of 5% and sequential adjusted EPS growth of 16%. Our adjusted EPS was $0.08 better than consensus with $0.02 on higher operating profit and $0.06 from a lower-than-estimated tax rate. Our recovery from the COVID resurgence in December and January improved throughout the quarter as expected. March was stronger than February, and April was stronger than March. We were particularly pleased with the strength of the last several weeks of the quarter, which we believe sets us up nicely for the start of our new fiscal year.  
From a geographic standpoint, we had strong 47% growth in the United States. Outside of the U.S., our developed markets grew 11% with continued pockets of COVID resurgence in parts of Western Europe, Japan and Canada. Our emerging markets grew 41%, driven by China growth in the low 90s.  
Our adjusted margins continued to improve sequentially with 120 basis points on our gross margin and 190 basis points on our operating margin. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 9.6%, better than initially estimated given a favorable jurisdictional mix of profits, along with certain onetime benefits.  
We've said throughout this past year that the actions we're taking during the pandemic to not only support our employees and our customers but also continue investing would impact our free cash flow. That said, we're pleased that we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow, converting 81% of our non-GAAP earnings into cash, just above our long-term conversion target of 80%.  
During the quarter, we repaid in full a JPY 300 billion term loan that was issued earlier in the fiscal year. And our year-end cash position remains above $10.5 billion. You can be assured that despite the pandemic, Medtronic continues to be in a strong financial position to drive our long-term strategies.  
Reflecting the confidence that we and our Board have in the future growth of this company, this morning, we announced that we are increasing our dividend by 9%. We are an S&P dividend aristocrat, having increased our dividend now for 44 years, and the dividend is an important part of the total return we generate for our shareholders. We also restarted our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter with a focus on covering dilution from our stock-based compensation.  
Now turning to our guidance. We're confident in the continuing procedure recovery around the globe and the resilience of our end markets and as a result, today, reinstate giving formal guidance. We expect strong organic revenue growth acceleration in fiscal '22 to 9%, plus or minus, 1 point above current Street consensus. And while the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $400 million to $500 million.  
By segment, we expect Cardiovascular and Neuroscience to grow 10% to 11%; Medical Surgical to grow 6% to 7%; and Diabetes to grow 3% to 4%, all on an organic basis. You'll remember that last year, we had an extra week in our fiscal calendar, and these growth rates have not been adjusted for that extra week given the offset that we had from customer bulk purchases. As a result, we do not intend to adjust our organic growth in fiscal '22 for the extra week in fiscal '21.  
In the first quarter, we're comfortable with Street consensus on revenue, which implies organic growth of 17% to 18% and a currency tailwind between $200 million and $250 million at recent rates. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 14% to 15%, Medical Surgical to grow 18% to 19%, Neuroscience to grow 25% to 26% and Diabetes to be flat. With so many big opportunities in front of us, we're prioritizing R&D and commercial investments with growth above and beyond what you would see in a normal year, and we're allocating this capital across our businesses to our best opportunities. 
As you know, 2 of our largest opportunities are surgical robotics and renal denervation. We're purposely making significant investments in them to ensure we fully capitalize on the multibillion-dollar opportunities ahead. Just to give you a sense, when you combine the facts that it's early in the revenue cycle of these 2 programs with our heavy investment, we are planning for an operating loss of approximately $400 million next fiscal year from these combined programs. Yet it is important to note that even with these kind of investments, we're still expecting operating margin expansion.  
This is the power of Medtronic's business model, that we can simultaneously make large-scale investments in some of the most important future technology areas in med tech, cover the dilution and deliver strong profitability and returns for our shareholders. 
On the bottom line, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.60 to $5.75 in fiscal '22, which includes a benefit of $0.10 to $0.15 from currency at recent rates. For the first quarter, we expect EPS of $1.31 to $1.34, above current Street consensus of $1.29 to $1.31. And first quarter EPS would include a currency tailwind of about $0.03 at recent rates.  
Before I hand it back over to Geoff, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of the employees across Medtronic who scaled mountains this year, leaning in to deliver a great year under difficult circumstances. I'm proud to be part of such a terrific team, and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Back to you, Geoff."

I mean once we hit that vaccination inflection point, I mean, I know a couple of months ago, people were worried that it wasn't moving fast enough. Then we hit an inflection point and things really opened up. And so in the U.S., we're, depending what therapy you want to look at, anywhere from 85% to over 100% of pre-COVID levels, and like I said, every month got better. And then you got to look around the world. China is pretty much back to normal totally. And Europe being our second biggest, Western Europe, if you look at that as 1 market, that is lagging behind the U.S. But look, we're confident that when you have a health care system like they have with that kind of infrastructure, once they get the vaccinations going, it will hit that same inflection point in the United States and open up. But as you know, they're a couple of months behind. 
The harder one to peg down is the emerging markets, I mean, places like India, where the virus is still raging. Southeast -- other parts of Southeast Asia, Latin America, they don't have the same infrastructure even when they get the vaccine, and there's a lot of people, so there's a lot of vaccines that you need to get there. So that's a harder one to pin down. But overall, as a company, like I said, we're nearing a full recovery despite the emerging market piece, really driven by the acceleration of United States. And like I said, we expect Europe to come not too far behind."

But in terms of your specific question on MARD, that's really not a great metric to look at. There's sort of an overall average of how the difference is looking across the full range of the sensor. But what you really want to know is when your blood sugar is high or when it's low, is your sensor accurate? And those data are really accurate, and you'll see that in the presentation. 
And the other thing that's important is the trending. Is the blood sugar reliably being -- going up or down? And that's really what matters. So kind of like A1C is a big average over time for glycemic control and time and range replace that metric. Really, the accuracy at the right places in the ranges is what's important.

So we're investing in sales and marketing and other related growth investments. 
But inorganic is a big -- it still is a priority. We did a number of a number of deals last year, tuck-in deals. And I'd say tuck-ins are still the focus. And those tuck-in deals could be up to several billion dollars. I mean the ones we did over the last 18 months have been smaller than that. But I wouldn't mistake size for impact. Some of these ones like Medicrea, which is the AI planning tool and outcomes tracking tool for spine, is a real nice piece of the puzzle for our Spine strategy. And a couple of questions here on the call today about our smart pen, the Companion Medical. So these are impactful deals. And we look to continue those. And so it's still a priority and over and above -- over buybacks. And we'll see how the year plays out. It's tough to predict, right? We're going to remain disciplined here.

The first part, if you could maybe just talk a little bit about how some of the pandemic conditions around the world are affecting your progress so far, how you're thinking about fiscal '22 and some of the range that you've put out there in that $50 million to $100 million.
And then secondly, there has been this -- what feels like a bit of an inflection point in terms of robotic surgery momentum and placement throughout the back end of last year and the first part of this year. I'm just wondering how -- if you could describe your -- how you compare the fourth quarter to the third quarter and how the cadence feels in terms of new placements and pull-through in your current programs, Azure?"

Yes, I was going to ask you to clarify because you said robotics, I wasn't sure. So on the Spine side, look, Matt, I know you followed this for years.

So on the Spine side, look, Matt, I know you followed this for years. The strategy of surrounding the spine procedure and preceding the spine procedure and following up the spine procedure with enabling technology from surgical planning, to navigation, interoperative imaging, the robot, this is paying off. I mean we had record sales last quarter of our capital equipment tied to spine procedures and continue to outpace the competition on the robotic sales. But more than anything, okay, more important than all of that is the surgeon feedback that we're getting has hit an inflection point. They are now talking about the outcomes that they're getting from this. 
It's the planning, the precision of the planning to get the right alignment plan in there, and then the accuracy of executing to that plan with nav and the robot and then the ability to follow it up and access images in the PACS system through Medicrea to come back and retrain or continue to evolve our algorithms and also show surgeons are you really getting that alignment that you thought. This is coming together. And we -- I think we're separating ourselves from the pack and really getting closer to what our ultimate goal here is to transform spine surgery from the art that it is today to a science and then demonstrate it with outcomes. 
So that is something we're very excited. Like you mentioned the momentum. The momentum -- the lagging -- the momentum from the enabling technology, like I said, record sales, and it's because the buzz is out there from surgeons starting to talk about the results they're getting from using this. And people that were sitting on the sidelines are jumping in and the bus is moving. The train's left the station on this one. And the feedback from our field, again, a lagging indicator, is palpable, the energy. So we're feeling really good about Spine and Robotics. And then the lessons that we've learned from spine, we are spending a lot of time, our Spine team, and Brett Wall, working with Bob White and Megan Rosengarten on the soft tissue robot. I think a lot of those lessons learned. I mean the markets aren't the same, they are different, but there are some lessons learned, and there are some synergies there that we will incorporate into our Hugo soft tissue robot launch."

So in terms of the operating model, I'd say, look, the dust is still settling a bit. But we're definitely past, I'd say, the most difficult part, and I'm excited about where we're headed. We've got increased role clarity and accountability across the org in this new decentralized model. And people are now looking forward and focused on their key metrics. So like for our operating units, it's this innovation pipeline, it's their market growth, it's their market share, as we just talked about. And this market share one is liberating for us because instead of comparing ourselves to ourselves, we're comparing ourselves to the market with the clear expectation to grow at or above the market. That clarifies a lot. 
For our regions, things like strategic account growth over and above what we're getting in the traditional med tech model of selling to the specialist physician and focused on those patients, but in addition to that, the strategic account growth. For our Executive Committee, right, for the people on this call, measurements around capital allocation to the high-growth segments, portfolio management, all in a focus to increase our overall company weighted average market growth rate, right? 
So -- and then finally, I'd say there's lots of excitement, more than I would have thought maybe even, about the culture changes, this thing we're calling the Medtronic Mindset that has these -- it really works alongside our mission. Medtronic is known for a mission-driven company. We always want to be known for that. That's kind of our ROI, if you will. But adding these things, like acting boldly, competing to win, move with speed and decisiveness, delivering results the right way, adding these into the mix alongside our mission has generated a lot of energy, and it's kind of taken off organically inside the company. And so I'd say, overall, really happy with where it's going, and we're starting to see the results of this."

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations.  
Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast. Joining me today are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021, which ended on April 30, 2021. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. And today's event should last about an hour.  
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed from the link in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.  
As we mentioned last quarter, the fourth quarter marks the first time that we're using the new nomenclature and reporting structure of our new operating model. For more information on these changes, please see the relevant slides in our earnings presentation.  
During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. Fourth quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last 4 quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth.  
Full fiscal year organic revenue comparisons exclude the impact of foreign currency, the benefit in the first 12 months of our Titan Spine acquisition and the benefit of the extra week in our first quarter. References to sequential improvement compare to the third quarter of fiscal '21 and are made on an as-reported basis. All references to share gains or losses are on a revenue and calendar quarter basis unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.  
And with that, let's get started."
31348,667302066,2339881,"Medtronic plc, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported a strong quarter this morning. The expectations that we set for Q4 on the last earnings call were seen by many in the financial community as aggressive. Yet we executed and we delivered, bea",2994,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported a strong quarter this morning. The expectations that we set for Q4 on the last earnings call were seen by many in the financial community as aggressive. Yet we executed and we delivered, beating Street estimates on revenue, margins and EPS. Most of our end markets are returning to near-normal pre-COVID growth. While some geographies are lagging due to COVID's persistence, momentum built throughout the quarter, and we feel confident about the year ahead. Karen will give you more color on our guidance later in this call. But the key takeaway is that we're guiding above Street estimates on the top line while simultaneously accelerating our investments at the front end of major product launches in surgical robotics and renal denervation. 
Now in robotics and renal denervation, we're investing in our marketing, customer service and support capabilities to maximize these product launches. We're also investing in R&D broadly with meaningful programs across the company. As we talked about at our Investor Day last year, we have a packed pipeline across our businesses with a number of meaningful opportunities. And our top priority is to invest in our business and pipeline to take advantage of those opportunities. 
As a result, we plan on increasing our R&D spend by more than 10% in FY '22, the biggest dollar increase in R&D spend in our company's history, all while delivering strong EPS growth. We're ultra-focused on accelerating our top line growth, and we're making incremental investments to put us in a place to drive a sustainable, higher level of growth than you've historically come to expect from Medtronic.  
Before I get into some details on the fourth quarter, I'd like to reflect on the past year, my first as CEO. It's certainly been a difficult environment with the pandemic, but our organization has risen to the challenge and achieved so much in such a short period of time and under unique circumstances. Now it's become cliché for companies to say that they're expecting to emerge from the pandemic stronger as I've heard this phrase echoed from many of our competitors. But you've been hearing this from us from day 1. And I think you'll find it hard to name another company in our space that has done more to emerge from this pandemic stronger than Medtronic, whether it was investing in our employees, helping our customers and patients, sustaining our R&D programs or changing our operating model, and putting in place a new Medtronic mindset culture. This past year was transformational for us.  
In fiscal 2021, customers eliminated the vast majority of their quarter end bulk purchases, resulting in a more balanced order flow across the quarter. This has improved our predictability and our pricing, made our business easier to manage and reduced stress on our operations. This past fiscal year, we also accelerated our tuck-in acquisitions, adding key technologies like AI-driven spine planning tools for Medicrea and market-leading smart pen technology from Companion Medical, among others. We also advanced our organic pipeline with more than 230 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China in FY '21.  
FY '21 was also the year that we stepped up and helped our customers and communities during the pandemic. As a leading manufacturer of high-acuity ventilators, we significantly increased our production and open-sourced our IP to allow others to produce our ventilators around the world. We continue to support communities in need, most recently as a key member of the Global Task Force on Pandemic Response, which was organized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and supported by the Business Roundtable. With the help of other task force members, we're working to supply 1,000 ventilators to India. Medtronic and the Medtronic Foundation also just announced an additional $3 million for COVID relief efforts in underserved areas of India, Brazil and the U.S. and other regions, which brings our combined support of COVID-19 efforts to $56 million.  
And in FY '21, we announced our goal of becoming carbon neutral in our operations by the end of the decade. We've set aggressive targets to reduce our environmental footprint as we focus on creating a sustainable future for our business, our communities and our planet. We've always had a strong mission to guide this company, which includes integrating a strong corporate purpose into our strategy and maintaining good citizenship. And this year, we've enhanced our corporate culture to emphasize our commitment to being bold, more competitive and moving with greater speed and decisiveness, which we believe will help drive the execution of our mission.  
We're also focused on becoming a more diverse and inclusive organization, and I was very proud that Medtronic was recognized earlier this month as #11 on DiversityInc's Top 50 U.S. Companies for Diversity, one of the biggest jumps by any company. We know we have room to improve, and we're striving to be a company that attracts, develops and retains top talent from all gender and ethnic backgrounds.  
To sum up F '21, it was a year marked by progress and accomplishments that will propel us into FY '22 with a stronger foundation for growth and a greater ability to execute, deliver and exceed our own expectations. We have momentum, energy and a pipeline that gives our team optimism about what we can accomplish this year.  
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter results and start with a look at market share as we've been doing the last few earnings calls. We continue to gain share in an increasing number of our businesses, driven by our differentiated product offerings. And we've put in place operating mechanisms to ensure that we continue to drive this competitive culture across the organization. Market share is one of the key metrics that we will hold our teams accountable to deliver in evaluating performance. And in FY '22, it will be included as a metric in our annual incentive compensation. While the impact of COVID on procedures, along with the timing of our quarter, does mask some of the underlying market dynamics, we are seeing a growing trend of share gains for Medtronic.  
Leading the list for share gains this quarter is one of our largest businesses, Cardiac Rhythm Management, which has gained share over the past several quarters. We estimate that our CRM business has gained 2 to 3 points year-over-year. And CRM is now at the highest share level in more than a decade with strong gains from around the globe. Now these gains have been driven by Micra, our leadless pacemaker, which grew 74% in Q4 and is now annualizing at nearly $400 million. Micra is a great example of the innovation and disruption that we're driving at Medtronic. But it's not just Micra generating our share gains, our Cobalt and Crome high-power devices are also contributing, driving our CRT-D product line to 74% growth in Q4.  
In TAVR, our share was up over 1 point year-over-year and was stable sequentially. We reached an all-time record of U.S. TAVR implants in the quarter. Late last month, we announced interim results of our OPTIMIZE PRO study, which showed that our new implant technique is resulting in single-digit pacemaker rates.  
In addition, last week at EuroPCR, we announced very strong low-risk data, which showed that the advantages of our Evolut TAVR system are maintained over surgical valves at 2 years post-procedure. Importantly, our data showed no convergence of the TAVR and SAVR curves for death or disabling stroke as well as continued low valve thrombosis rates out to year 2. This stands in contrast to our competition's PARTNER 3 data. And we'll leverage this data with implanting physicians as we continue to go on the offensive and win share in this important growth market. 
In our Gastrointestinal business, we estimate that we gained share, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our GI diagnostic product lines grew in the low 50s, driven by high 60s growth of our PillCam. Last month, we received FDA clearance for our GI Genius module, which uses artificial intelligence to assist physicians in detecting both precancerous and cancerous growths during colonoscopies. GI Genius can highlight lesions real-time and identify polyps that might otherwise go undetected by the human eye, improving the quality of colonoscopies.  
In our Cranial & Spinal Technologies business, we estimate that we gained share in both Spine and Neurosurgery, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our strategy of bringing a digital ecosystem of enabling technology to spine procedures is working. We had record sales of our StealthStation navigation systems, O-arm imaging systems, Midas Rex capital and Advanced Energy products. And we estimate that our Mazor Robotics system continues to outpace our closest competitor.  
In ENT, we estimate that our share is up over 1 point year-over-year. The ongoing launches of our NIM VITAL neuro-monitoring system and StealthStation FlexENT navigation system, coupled with share gains in disposable sinus blades, are driving our above-market performance.  
In Pelvic Health, share gain continued with the momentum created by the launch of InterStim Micro and the SureScan leads. Our sales growth outpaced tax audits in the calendar first quarter, and we did this despite having a far larger sales base. While the European sacral neuromodulation market remains sluggish due to COVID resurgence, the U.S. market continues to accelerate.  
Turning to Neuromodulation. We estimate that we have gained about 1 point of Pain Stim share year-over-year and even more sequentially. Our SCS product line grew 73% in Q4, and we continued to outpace the competition in the calendar first quarter. The market continues to show strong enthusiasm for our DTM SCS therapy, which now carries a superiority label from the FDA. And our strategy of going after competitive account conversions is yielding great results. Our DTM trial adoption remained robust and grew sequentially, a good leading indicator for future growth in our Pain Stim business.  
In Brain Modulation, while we estimate we lost a couple of points of share year-over-year, we continue to gain sequential share on the back of the Percept PC launch. Percept has resulted in 10 points of new implant share gains in the U.S. since its launch last summer.  
So there are a number of businesses where we're gaining share, but there are still some businesses where we've got some work to do. In cardiac diagnostics, as we discussed last quarter, we continue to be supply-constrained with our new LINQ II system in Q4 as we ramp our unique wafer scale manufacturing. We estimate we lost about 1 point sequentially and mid-single-digit share points year-over-year, primarily to Boston Scientific. We're working through the supply ramp-up and expect to have improved supply in the back half of the fiscal year. 
In addition, we implemented a product ship hold on the LINQ II last week as we analyze an issue. In the meantime, customers are continuing to use our Reveal LINQ. Once we resolve the issue, we're confident that the proven market leadership of Reveal LINQ and the competitive differentiation of LINQ II will allow us to continue to win in this space.  
In our Aortic business, we announced the voluntary recall of our Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft system in February. We also announced that we would be working to ramp production of our previous generation product, the Valiant Captivia, but that we would not be at full production until September. The loss of Navion had a $35 million impact to revenue in Q4 and resulted in us losing high-teens share in the thoracic stent graft market. That said, our customers have expressed strong interest in using the Valiant Captivia product when inventory is available. And looking ahead, we're estimating that the quarterly revenue impact will decrease as we go through FY '22 from $30 million in Q1 to $15 million in Q4.  
In Neurovascular, we estimate we lost a couple of points of share year-over-year, driven primarily by new competitive flow diverters from Stryker and Terumo. That said, we saw our share stabilize sequentially as we launched our Solitaire X 3-millimeter stent retriever in the U.S. and started the limited launch of our Pipeline Vantage flow diverter in certain CE Mark countries. We expect our new products to drive sequential share gains going forward.  
In Diabetes, we continue to execute on our turnaround strategy, growing 9% this quarter. This is still below market and we estimate we lost about 5 points of share year-over-year. However, our share was stable sequentially. Our new MiniMed 770G and 780G insulin pumps are giving us momentum, resulting in very strong double-digit global insulin pump growth.  
Next, let's turn to our pipeline. We're launching a number of products across the company and even more coming. We expect our robust pipeline to be the key driver of accelerating our top line growth as we're at the front of some large opportunities to win share, create new markets and disrupt existing markets. And as I noted earlier, we're continuing to fuel R&D investments, such that our pipeline can be a continuous source of sustained revenue growth over the coming years.  
Starting with Cardiovascular. One of our largest future drivers is renal denervation as we develop our solution to go after the multibillion-dollar addressable market in hypertension. We're expecting to present our ON MED pivotal trial results later this year, likely at the TCT Conference in November. And these results are likely to be one of the most highly anticipated events in med tech this year.  
In Cardiac Rhythm Management, we're planning to file for CE Mark for our disruptive extravascular ICD technology this quarter. Let me repeat that. I said this quarter. And in our Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, we're expecting a first-line therapy indication for our Arctic Front cryoballoon in the U.S. this coming quarter. We also continue to make good progress on bringing our disruptive pulse field ablation system in the market with strong enrollment in our PULSED AF pivotal trial.  
In Structural Heart, we received FDA approval in Q4 for our Harmony transcatheter pulmonary valve, the first-of-its-kind and a breakthrough treatment for patients with congenital heart disease. In TAVR, we received low-risk Shonin approval in Japan and are expecting reimbursement approval later this fiscal year. We also expect the U.S. rollout of our next-generation TAVR valve, the Evolut FX, later this calendar year, which will feature enhanced deliverability and ease of use.  
Turning to our Medical Surgical portfolio. Another very important program is our Hugo robotic-assisted surgery platform. At the end of March, we reported that we'd submitted Hugo for CE Mark and U.S. IDE approval. Well, today, I'm happy to report that the FDA has granted the IDE approval, and we're preparing to commence our EXPAND Euro trial in the U.S. to study Hugo in neurologic procedures. We also had our first revenue from Hugo placements at hospitals outside the U.S. in Q4. These systems will collect clinical data to support regulatory approvals in the U.S. and around the world.  
As you think about modeling the revenue from our Surgical Robotics business, we're expecting $50 million to $100 million in FY '22, and that's likely to roughly double or triple in FY '23. We expect soft tissue robotics to be a meaningful growth driver going forward, not just for MedSurg, but for overall Medtronic.  
In our Neuroscience portfolio, we have some exciting near-term milestones coming in our Neuromodulation business. We're expecting to launch our Vanta recharge-free spinal cord stimulator in the first half of this fiscal year. This is a big opportunity for us to gain additional share in Pain Stim given our low share in the recharge-free portion of the market. We're also on track to submit our ECAPS device to the FDA later this calendar year, which has the potential to be a disruptive technology in the spinal cord stim space.  
And in Brain Mod, we're expecting FDA approval for our SenSight directional lead later this calendar year. This will close a key competitive gap and further differentiate our Percept PC system, which I mentioned earlier, was already taken a lot of share in DBS.  
And in Pelvic Health, we received IDE approval last month to start our TITAN 1 feasibility study. This trial will evaluate our implantable tibial system, a device that we think could substantially increase our ability to serve overactive bladder patients, many of whom do not seek therapy or remain on current therapy.  
In Neurovascular, in addition to the Solitaire X 3-millimeter stent retriever and Pipeline Vantage flow diverter that I mentioned earlier, we're rolling out 5 additional products this calendar year. This includes meaningful innovation for the stroke market, like our Pipeline Shield flow diverter in the U.S. and Rist Radial Access system.  
In Diabetes, we recently received CE Mark approval for our Zeus CGM sensor, which we'll be marketing as the Guardian 4 sensor. The no calibration data that was used to support the CE Mark approval will be presented next week at the virtual ATTD Conference, and the abstract is available on the ATTD website. We're pleased with the accuracy of Guardian 4 and that it has now been labeled for dosing without fingersticks.  
Starting this fall, Europeans will not only have access to the 780G with the highest reported time and range of any insulin pump, but also our Guardian 4 sensor with no fingersticks required and our extended infusion set with an industry-leading 7-day wear. We think this is a highly differentiated product offering and one that we can't wait to bring to other markets. In the U.S., the 780G and Guardian 4 sensor are under active review with the FDA.  
Finally, we're making progress on our Synergy sensor, which is disposable, easier to apply and half the size of our current sensor. We intend to submit this sensor to the FDA in the first half of the fiscal year once we complete our manufacturing module.  
I'll now turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and guidance. Karen?"
31348,667302066,2339881,"Medtronic plc, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Thank you, Geoff. Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 32%, and adjusted EPS increased 159%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn we experienced at the start of the pandemic last year.  Our end markets continue to recover from the i",969,"Thank you, Geoff. Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 32%, and adjusted EPS increased 159%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn we experienced at the start of the pandemic last year.  
Our end markets continue to recover from the impact of COVID. And we continue to execute on our strategy and launch new products, resulting in a sequential revenue increase of 5% and sequential adjusted EPS growth of 16%. Our adjusted EPS was $0.08 better than consensus with $0.02 on higher operating profit and $0.06 from a lower-than-estimated tax rate. Our recovery from the COVID resurgence in December and January improved throughout the quarter as expected. March was stronger than February, and April was stronger than March. We were particularly pleased with the strength of the last several weeks of the quarter, which we believe sets us up nicely for the start of our new fiscal year.  
From a geographic standpoint, we had strong 47% growth in the United States. Outside of the U.S., our developed markets grew 11% with continued pockets of COVID resurgence in parts of Western Europe, Japan and Canada. Our emerging markets grew 41%, driven by China growth in the low 90s.  
Our adjusted margins continued to improve sequentially with 120 basis points on our gross margin and 190 basis points on our operating margin. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 9.6%, better than initially estimated given a favorable jurisdictional mix of profits, along with certain onetime benefits.  
We've said throughout this past year that the actions we're taking during the pandemic to not only support our employees and our customers but also continue investing would impact our free cash flow. That said, we're pleased that we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow, converting 81% of our non-GAAP earnings into cash, just above our long-term conversion target of 80%.  
During the quarter, we repaid in full a JPY 300 billion term loan that was issued earlier in the fiscal year. And our year-end cash position remains above $10.5 billion. You can be assured that despite the pandemic, Medtronic continues to be in a strong financial position to drive our long-term strategies.  
Reflecting the confidence that we and our Board have in the future growth of this company, this morning, we announced that we are increasing our dividend by 9%. We are an S&P dividend aristocrat, having increased our dividend now for 44 years, and the dividend is an important part of the total return we generate for our shareholders. We also restarted our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter with a focus on covering dilution from our stock-based compensation.  
Now turning to our guidance. We're confident in the continuing procedure recovery around the globe and the resilience of our end markets and as a result, today, reinstate giving formal guidance. We expect strong organic revenue growth acceleration in fiscal '22 to 9%, plus or minus, 1 point above current Street consensus. And while the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $400 million to $500 million.  
By segment, we expect Cardiovascular and Neuroscience to grow 10% to 11%; Medical Surgical to grow 6% to 7%; and Diabetes to grow 3% to 4%, all on an organic basis. You'll remember that last year, we had an extra week in our fiscal calendar, and these growth rates have not been adjusted for that extra week given the offset that we had from customer bulk purchases. As a result, we do not intend to adjust our organic growth in fiscal '22 for the extra week in fiscal '21.  
In the first quarter, we're comfortable with Street consensus on revenue, which implies organic growth of 17% to 18% and a currency tailwind between $200 million and $250 million at recent rates. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 14% to 15%, Medical Surgical to grow 18% to 19%, Neuroscience to grow 25% to 26% and Diabetes to be flat. With so many big opportunities in front of us, we're prioritizing R&D and commercial investments with growth above and beyond what you would see in a normal year, and we're allocating this capital across our businesses to our best opportunities. 
As you know, 2 of our largest opportunities are surgical robotics and renal denervation. We're purposely making significant investments in them to ensure we fully capitalize on the multibillion-dollar opportunities ahead. Just to give you a sense, when you combine the facts that it's early in the revenue cycle of these 2 programs with our heavy investment, we are planning for an operating loss of approximately $400 million next fiscal year from these combined programs. Yet it is important to note that even with these kind of investments, we're still expecting operating margin expansion.  
This is the power of Medtronic's business model, that we can simultaneously make large-scale investments in some of the most important future technology areas in med tech, cover the dilution and deliver strong profitability and returns for our shareholders. 
On the bottom line, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.60 to $5.75 in fiscal '22, which includes a benefit of $0.10 to $0.15 from currency at recent rates. For the first quarter, we expect EPS of $1.31 to $1.34, above current Street consensus of $1.29 to $1.31. And first quarter EPS would include a currency tailwind of about $0.03 at recent rates.  
Before I hand it back over to Geoff, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of the employees across Medtronic who scaled mountains this year, leaning in to deliver a great year under difficult circumstances. I'm proud to be part of such a terrific team, and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Back to you, Geoff."

Now I'd like to close by emphasizing that there's a lot of energy here at Medtronic, and our momentum is building. You're seeing us perform better than our competition. We've executed in the short term, and we're investing for the long term. We've accomplished a lot in FY '21, and this is a good start, but our expectations are higher. What will truly differentiate us is accelerating and delivering sustained revenue growth at or above our markets, not just over a year or 2, but over the next decade. We have incredible programs in our development pipeline with robust expected financial returns. We're developing the next-generation of medical devices that incorporate technologies like artificial intelligence, big data and miniaturized electronics. These programs have the potential to truly change the future of medicine. When we look at the opportunities ahead of us and how we expect to translate these into strong returns for our shareholders, the future is bright. 
And finally, to our 90,000 employees around the world, thank you for everything that you've accomplished this past year. I'm sure they would agree with me when I say if there's one thing you should take away from today's call, it's that at Medtronic, we're just getting started. 
With that, let's now move to Q&A. We'll try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. By the way, it's worth noting that the IR Magazine recently recognized our Investor Relations as the best of all companies in the United States, an award we're very proud to receive as it was the result of voting from hundreds of investors and analysts, and we look forward to continuing to provide you with transparent communication and a high level of service.

But I'll start with the answer. Overall, we're nearing a full recovery. And we're seeing with each month of the quarter, every month was better than the prior month, and that continued to improve and accelerate into May, largely driven by the U.S. market. 
I mean once we hit that vaccination inflection point, I mean, I know a couple of months ago, people were worried that it wasn't moving fast enough. Then we hit an inflection point and things really opened up. And so in the U.S., we're, depending what therapy you want to look at, anywhere from 85% to over 100% of pre-COVID levels, and like I said, every month got better. And then you got to look around the world. China is pretty much back to normal totally. And Europe being our second biggest, Western Europe, if you look at that as 1 market, that is lagging behind the U.S. But look, we're confident that when you have a health care system like they have with that kind of infrastructure, once they get the vaccinations going, it will hit that same inflection point in the United States and open up. But as you know, they're a couple of months behind. 
The harder one to peg down is the emerging markets, I mean, places like India, where the virus is still raging. Southeast -- other parts of Southeast Asia, Latin America, they don't have the same infrastructure even when they get the vaccine, and there's a lot of people, so there's a lot of vaccines that you need to get there. So that's a harder one to pin down. But overall, as a company, like I said, we're nearing a full recovery despite the emerging market piece, really driven by the acceleration of United States. And like I said, we expect Europe to come not too far behind."

And maybe tied into that, just your latest expectations on the timing of potential FDA approvals for those products."

Chris, I'll take the first part, and I'm going to let Sean comment on the second part. But one thing to keep in mind with our diabetes guide is that we purposely did not adjust for the extra week across the whole company that we had last year because the reduction in bulk purchases offset it. But that reduction in bulk purchases did not affect our Diabetes business. So really, we need to look at it with the loss of the extra week that is indeed affecting them. And that loss of the extra week is about 150 basis points on the year. So hopefully, that's helpful."

I'd just build on what Karen said, we also had a bit of a comparable issue within some international markets where there was some stockpiling of the consumables that get used, so that's a little bit of -- in your comparison. But the bigger effect for us is that the installed base in the last 6 months, so those coming out of warranty in the last 6 months, was just higher than what we're going to see in the first half of the fiscal year. So just getting a difference in how many patients come out with timing. Certainly, the new product flows, you mentioned 780 and Zeus for the U.S., will be the most important for us to continue to move both patients from the installed base as well as those new patients, those coming out of MDI or competitors. 
I don't have an update on the timing. We're in active review, as Geoff said, on the filing. And we -- the reviewer that's working with us is the same one that reviewed the 770 device. So we think that, that familiarity is going to be helpful. But there's no update on timing at this point."

But we're confident that the trial is designed properly to get us the right answer. 
But reimbursement is certainly the hurdle. We do have CE Mark. We have approval in a lot of countries. But getting that paid for is going to be important. And in the United States, we're awaiting eagerly the proposed rule on MCIT to allow 4 years of coverage as we develop further evidence upon approval. Now that doesn't cover payment. We still work to do there. We still have to go payer by payer because a lot of the patients will fall into the non-Medicare bucket of patients. But we've been working that for a number of years, frankly, to make sure that we have the right evidence to satisfy their needs, which really, frankly, drove the need for an ON MED trial to begin with.

In terms of like our priorities, our priorities are investing in growth. And today, we announced the largest increase in R&D in our history and it's because we're seeing these large market opportunities with clear patient need where Medtronic has a right to win. And so we're looking at those holistically, investing organically in R&D, but also other growth investments like we talked about ahead of certain product launches like Guardian and the robot. So we're investing in sales and marketing and other related growth investments. 
But inorganic is a big -- it still is a priority. We did a number of a number of deals last year, tuck-in deals. And I'd say tuck-ins are still the focus. And those tuck-in deals could be up to several billion dollars. I mean the ones we did over the last 18 months have been smaller than that. But I wouldn't mistake size for impact. Some of these ones like Medicrea, which is the AI planning tool and outcomes tracking tool for spine, is a real nice piece of the puzzle for our Spine strategy. And a couple of questions here on the call today about our smart pen, the Companion Medical. So these are impactful deals. And we look to continue those. And so it's still a priority and over and above -- over buybacks. And we'll see how the year plays out. It's tough to predict, right? We're going to remain disciplined here. 
But I think the theme you -- I'd walk away with is that we're committed to investing in growth, both organically, inorganically and doing what it takes to do that and still deliver on the EPS growth expectations that we set out.

So on the Spine side, look, Matt, I know you followed this for years. The strategy of surrounding the spine procedure and preceding the spine procedure and following up the spine procedure with enabling technology from surgical planning, to navigation, interoperative imaging, the robot, this is paying off. I mean we had record sales last quarter of our capital equipment tied to spine procedures and continue to outpace the competition on the robotic sales. But more than anything, okay, more important than all of that is the surgeon feedback that we're getting has hit an inflection point. They are now talking about the outcomes that they're getting from this. 
It's the planning, the precision of the planning to get the right alignment plan in there, and then the accuracy of executing to that plan with nav and the robot and then the ability to follow it up and access images in the PACS system through Medicrea to come back and retrain or continue to evolve our algorithms and also show surgeons are you really getting that alignment that you thought. This is coming together. And we -- I think we're separating ourselves from the pack and really getting closer to what our ultimate goal here is to transform spine surgery from the art that it is today to a science and then demonstrate it with outcomes. 
So that is something we're very excited. Like you mentioned the momentum. The momentum -- the lagging -- the momentum from the enabling technology, like I said, record sales, and it's because the buzz is out there from surgeons starting to talk about the results they're getting from using this. And people that were sitting on the sidelines are jumping in and the bus is moving. The train's left the station on this one. And the feedback from our field, again, a lagging indicator, is palpable, the energy. So we're feeling really good about Spine and Robotics. And then the lessons that we've learned from spine, we are spending a lot of time, our Spine team, and Brett Wall, working with Bob White and Megan Rosengarten on the soft tissue robot. I think a lot of those lessons learned. I mean the markets aren't the same, they are different, but there are some lessons learned, and there are some synergies there that we will incorporate into our Hugo soft tissue robot launch."

So like for our operating units, it's this innovation pipeline, it's their market growth, it's their market share, as we just talked about. And this market share one is liberating for us because instead of comparing ourselves to ourselves, we're comparing ourselves to the market with the clear expectation to grow at or above the market. That clarifies a lot. 
For our regions, things like strategic account growth over and above what we're getting in the traditional med tech model of selling to the specialist physician and focused on those patients, but in addition to that, the strategic account growth.

Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 30, 2021, and our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, our portfolio executive VPs will join us, and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's event should last about an hour. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. 
During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. 
Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. First quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last 4 quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential revenue changes compare to the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the second calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated. 
Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. 
And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. 
With that, let's head into the studio and get started."

Our employees are energized by the transformation of our organizational structure and the competitive culture. And our most recent employee engagement survey results were the strongest that we've ever had. 
We continue to focus on accelerating and sustaining higher top and bottom line growth at Medtronic. In fact, we've already made a number of disciplined and targeted capital allocation decisions that drive that acceleration. We've increased our investments at the front end of major product launches in surgical robots and renal denervation, which represent large new markets for Medtronic. We're growing our R&D investments broadly across the company, complementing a long list of organic opportunities with disciplined tuck-in acquisitions, such as our recently announced intent to acquire [ Intersect ENT ]. Now we expect these actions to drive share gains in our markets today, which we've talked a lot about, and to increase our weighted average market growth rate, producing stronger returns for our shareholders. 
Now turning to the details of our first quarter results, we'll start again with a brief look at our market share performance. It's an important metric that our teams are being evaluated against, along with revenue growth, profit and free cash flow. 
We continue to see a number of our businesses winning share, driven by our innovation and increased competitiveness. And it's worth noting that when we talk about our share dynamics, we're referring to revenue share in calendar quarter Q2. 
We gained share in our 3 largest businesses. Cardiac Rhythm Management business continued to perform well above the market, adding over 3 points of share, driven by our differentiated Micra family of pacemakers, Cobalt and Crome high-power devices and our TYRX antibacterial envelopes. 
In Surgical Innovations, we gained share as our endostapling and Advanced Energy technology continues to be the preferred and trusted instruments used by surgeons all around the world. 
And in Spine, the ecosystem that we offer of spine implants, biologics and enabling technologies like the preoperative planning software, robotics, imaging and navigation, resulted in above-market growth for Medtronic. 
And it's not just our largest businesses that are winning share. We also had share gains in some of our faster-growing businesses, like TAVR, Pelvic Health and Pain Stim. As new evidence, technology and sales execution resulted in Medtronic outpacing our competition. 
In Pain Stim, we did observe gradual slowdown in permanent implants and trialing procedures in the latter parts of our quarter due to the Delta variant. And we do expect that this will affect the market during Q2. 
That said, we continue to win share and have a lot of momentum in our Intellis with DTM technology. And with the launch of the Vanta recharge-free system, our portfolio is complete, highly competitive and well positioned. 
Now while we're winning share in a number of our businesses, we still have areas where we have work to do. In Cardiovascular, we continue to lose share in our Cardiac Diagnostics business. However, we do expect these trends will reverse over the course of our fiscal year as we ramp up supply of our LINQ II insertable cardiac monitoring system. 
Now we also lost share year-over-year in neurovascular, but we were pleased with our momentum. This included our 2 new flow diverters, the pipeline flex with Shield technology in the U.S. and the pipeline vantage in Europe as well as our SaltarX3-millimeter stent retriever. 
And finally, in Diabetes, we continue to execute our turnaround strategy. But as expected, we continue to lose share in the U.S. as we wait for new product approvals. We understand the current challenges we face in Diabetes, and we believe our product pipeline and our differentiated technologies will return us to market growth as these products move through development, approval and ultimately become available to patients. 
Now speaking of new products, let's now turn to our product pipeline. Today, you're seeing the strong flow of new products launching across our businesses. We've launched over 190 products in the U.S., western Europe, Japan and China in just the last 12 months. 
We also continue to advance the innovation we have in development. We're increasing our R&D spend by more than 10% this fiscal year. This is the biggest dollar increase in R&D spend in our company's history. The investments we're making in our pipeline will play a key role in accelerating our top line growth, and we're at the front end of some large opportunities to win share, create new markets and disrupt existing markets. 
Starting with one of our largest future growth drivers, renal denervation. We're making good progress on our solution to go after this multibillion-dollar hypertension opportunity. We expect that the results of our [indiscernible] pivotal trial will be ready for a presentation at the TCT conference in November, assuming the interim look at this basin design study reaches statistical significance. The unmed clinical trial represents the final piece of a large body of evidence that we intend to submit to the FDA for approval. 
The progress on our surgical robotics business has been impressive in recent months and we have momentum on a number of important milestones and initiatives. But most notable, and something that has energized our entire company and the robotics team, the first procedures with Hugo were performed at Clinica Santa Maria in Chile by [ Dr. Rubin Olivarez ] in June. And as is said, a picture is worth a thousand words. So let's watch the short clip detailing this important milestone.

We look",725,"It's truly amazing to see our robotic technology in use, and I want to thank the hundreds of Medtronic employees that have worked tirelessly over many years as well as the surgeon and hospital leaders whose partnership help make Hugo a reality. 
We look forward to expanding the surgical robotics market by addressing the per procedure cost and utilization barriers that have limited robotic surgery to date. 
And shortly after the first geological procedures in Chile, we had the first gynecological procedure performed last month at the Pacifica Salud Hospital in Panama. We're receiving positive feedback from our early users for our approach to robotic surgery, including our thoughtful design choices. For example, as you can see by this picture, our open console design allows for natural interaction and participation of the entire surgical team. And it's just one of the many important differentiated features of Hugo. 
Looking ahead, we remain on track for CE Mark approval of Hugo following our submission in late March. And we continue to make progress towards starting our U.S. EXPAND Euro pivotal trial where the first procedures in the U.S. will occur. 
Around the globe, a number of hospital systems have expressed interest in our partners and possibility program, joining a group of pioneering hospitals that will be among the first to use Hugo. 
In cardiac rhythm, we filed for CE Mark for our Extravascular ICD this quarter and enrollment is going well in our U.S. pivotal trial. EV-ICD represents a disruptive technology in implantable defibrillator space as it can pace and shock without leads inside the heart. And they can do all of this in a single device with the same size and longevity of a traditional ICD. 
In TAVR, we continue to advance our Evolut platform, and I am pleased to share with you the news today that we just received FDA approval last week for our next-generation Evolut FX TAVR system. Now this innovative system is designed to improve the overall procedural experience through enhancements in deliverability, implant visibility and deployment stability. We're planning to start rolling out this next-gen system in the U.S. market later this fall. 
In Neuromodulation, in addition to receiving FDA approval in the quarter for our Vanta recharge-free spinal cord stimulator, we also received FDA approval for our SenSight Directional Deep Brain Stimulation Lead. Now SenSight, combined with our recently approved Percept PC system, is the only DBS system on the market that can sense and record brain activity in addition to providing normal stimulation to treat diseases like Parkinson's and essential tremor. 
We also remain on track to submit our eCAP spinal cord stimulator to the FDA later this calendar year, which has the potential to be a disruptive technology in Pain Stim. 
Now moving to our Pelvic Health business, as you know, we don't reveal all of our development programs underway at Medtronic for competitive reasons, but I'm going to unveil a new one today. We've been working in stealth mode on our next-gen InterStim recharge-free device. And earlier this month, we submitted our PMA supplement to the U.S. FDA seeking approval. Now this device has some very attractive specs. It's designed with a 10-year battery. It's got constant current. And it's full body MRI compatible at both 1.5 and 3 Tesla. We're expecting approval in the first half of next calendar year, and we can't wait to have this best-in-class recharge-free device available for patients. 
In Diabetes, the international launch of our MiniMed 780G insulin pump continues to go well. The 780G has the highest reported time in range of any insulin pump. And starting this fall, people with Diabetes in many international markets will not only have access to the 780G, but also our no-calibration 7-day Guardian 4 sensor and our 7-day extended infusion set, the longest lasting set on the market. This complete offering will be highly differentiated and ease patient burden, and we're working to bring this technology to other markets. 
In the U.S., the 780G and Guardian 4 Sensor continue to be under active review with the FDA. 
And we're expecting to submit our next-gen Synergy CGM sensor to the FDA in Q3. Synergy is disposable, easier to apply and half the size of our current sensor. 
I'll now turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and our guidance. Karen?"
31348,711327028,2384699,"Medtronic plc, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2021",2021-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Thank you, Geoff. Our first quarter organic revenue increased 19% and adjusted EPS increased 127%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn from the pandemic impact last year.

Our first quarter organic revenue increased 19% and adjusted EPS increased 127%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn from the pandemic impact last year. Our end markets are recovering and we continue to launch new technology and gain market share, which is reflected in our growth and profitability. 
Our adjusted EPS was $0.09 better than consensus, with the entire beat coming from higher revenue growth and operating profit. 
As I noted on our last earnings call, we did not adjust our first quarter results for the extra week of sales last year given the concurrent reduction of customer bulk purchases as these 2 items roughly offset each other at the total company level. That said, not all areas of the company had large quarter-end customer bulk purchase activity, diabetes, for example. As a result, I would point out that our Diabetes growth rate would be roughly 6 points higher in the first quarter had we adjusted for the extra week. 
On our cadence of recovery, the monthly improvement trends continued. Average daily sales in June were stronger than May, and July was stronger than June. That said, we did begin to see a slowdown in certain businesses in the last few weeks of July related to the spread of the Delta variant in the United States. If not for the COVID impact in July, our first quarter performance would have been even stronger. 
Turning to our P&L. We saw significant year-over-year improvement in our margins. 670 basis points on gross margin and over 1,000 basis points on operating margin. Our operating margin was better than expected as investments we initiated in the first quarter took longer to ramp but are expected to pick up starting in the second quarter. 
Turning to capital allocation, we continue to balance our investment for future growth while returning cash to our shareholders, primarily through our strong and growing dividend. 
As we've noted for several quarters, we are increasing our level of tuck-in acquisitions, having announced 7 for a total of $2.3 billion since the start of fiscal '21. 
Less than 3 weeks ago, we announced our intent to acquire Intersect ENT. Our ENT business has quietly been a strong performer for us, led by a great team with a track record of consistently outperforming the market. With the addition of Intersect's complementary products, we can accelerate the growth profile of this business for years to come. The deal is accretive to our weighted average market growth rate; initially neutral, but quickly accretive to earnings; and has expected returns well ahead of our cost of capital. 
Now turning to our guidance. As you know, it is still early in our fiscal year. We had a strong first quarter. And despite the current impact from COVID, we are optimistic about the outlook for the year. 
Given how early it is in the year, we are maintaining our revenue guidance for the full year at 9%, plus or minus. If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $100 million to $200 million, down from the prior $400 million to $500 million I gave last quarter. 
By segment, we continue to expect Cardiovascular and Neuroscience to grow 10% to 11%, medical Surgical to now grow 8% to 9% and Diabetes to be roughly flat, all on an organic basis. 
On the bottom line, we are raising the lower end of our guidance by our first quarter beat, offset by a lower expected benefit from FX. 
We now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.65 to $5.75, an increase from our prior range of $5.60 to $5.75. This includes a currency benefit of $0.05 to $0.10 at recent rates, down from the $0.10 to $0.15 benefit we signaled last quarter. 
Our second quarter is likely to reflect the current impacts from COVID, particularly in a handful of businesses in cardiovascular and neuroscience. So we expect organic growth in the quarter of around 4%, with a currency tailwind of $0 to $50 million at recent rates. 
Keep in mind that we are facing a particularly tough comp in our ventilator business, which peaked in the second quarter last year. Ex ventilator sales, we expect organic growth in the quarter around 6%. 
By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 5% to 6%; Neuroscience, 6% to 7%; and both Medical Surgical and Diabetes to be flat to up 1%, all on an organic basis. Excluding ventilator sales, Medical Surgical is expected to grow 8% to 9%. 
We expect EPS between $1.28 and $1.30, with a current tailwind of about $0.04 at recent rates. 
As previously mentioned, we do believe the near-term COVID impact to our business will be relatively less severe than prior waves given hospital preparedness and increasing vaccination rates around the globe. That said, to be conservative, our guidance does not assume that procedures canceled in the near term will be rescheduled. So to the extent those procedures are simply delayed, that should be upside. 
We are confident as ever in the strength of our underlying business, our execution and the impact of our new products. We saw that in the first quarter. And as we move past the current impact of COVID, we feel really good about the underlying strength for the rest of the year. 
Before I send it back to Geoff, I'd like to step back and acknowledge how much our employees have accomplished over the last year since the pandemic started. And our results this past quarter reflect that unwavering focus by our global team to drive our business and fulfill our mission. And for that, I'm incredibly proud. 
Back to you, Geoff."

Next, I'd like to cover a few ESG-related topics: inclusion, diversity and equity as well as product quality. First, inclusion, diversity and equity, something that is personally important to me and important to our success at Medtr",682,"Okay. Thanks, Karen. Next, I'd like to cover a few ESG-related topics: inclusion, diversity and equity as well as product quality. 
First, inclusion, diversity and equity, something that is personally important to me and important to our success at Medtronic. Now we best fulfill our mission when we have a workplace where ID&E for all of our employees is championed. While we know there is much more to be done, we've made a lot of progress here. And this is being recognized by others. 
I mentioned our DiversityInc last quarter, and we were recently recognized by several other organizations for our innovative and inclusive work environment. We were named as one of Fast Company's Best Workplaces for Innovators in 2021, as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by the Disability Equality Index, and we were one of the 15 companies awarded the Secretary of Defense Freedom Award for our efforts to support our military veteran employees. 
Next, I want to emphasize our continued focus on product quality. Striving without reserve for the greatest possible reliability and quality in our products is a key tenet of the Medtronic mission and core to our commitment to improved outcomes for patients. In fact, there is nothing more important than patient safety. 
In Q1, we made the decision to stop HVAD sales. We did this because of a growing body of clinical comparisons indicating that our device had a higher frequency of adverse events than a competitor's product. This decision was consistent with our commitment to patient safety. Importantly, we remain committed to supporting current HVAD patients, their caregivers and health care professionals. 
At Medtronic, we have a purpose, deeply rooted in our mission, and our employees translate this mission into tangible day-to-day actions, which in turn create an impact in our society. 
When I reflect on product quality and ID&E, we've made progress, but there's always room for improvement. One step is ensuring that we have the right incentives in place to drive the actions that will elevate our impact. Our Board and executive leadership have been evaluating our annual incentive plans. And as a result of this, we're planning to further strengthen our existing quality metrics and we intend to introduce new ID&E metrics into our incentive plans. These will help guide our plans and drive our work on a daily basis and ultimately hold us accountable to translate our actions into even greater impact. 
For those of you that would like to learn more about our ESG efforts underway at Medtronic, I encourage you to save the date to virtually attend our first ever ESG investor and analyst Event, which we're planning to broadcast on Wednesday, October 13. You're going to hear from leaders from across Medtronic covering important topics, including inclusion, diversity and equity and product quality and safety. 
And I'll close by noting that we are on track to accelerate our revenue growth. We're executing on our pipeline, and we're winning share in the marketplace with our leading technology. And we have some really big opportunities ahead of us, with near-term milestones in both renal denervation and surgical robotics businesses. And the energy across the organization is palpable as we operate under a new model and instill our new cultural traits, including acting boldly, competing to win, moving with speed and decisiveness in everything that we do and getting results and getting them the right way. 
And to our employees, many of whom I'm sure are watching today, thank you. I truly appreciate your efforts to deliver these results. Look, these are exciting times, and I'm really looking forward to all that we're going to accomplish over the coming months. Momentum is building, and we're creating value, and there is a lot more to come. 
With that, now let's move to Q&A. Now we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible.

Really, those businesses that are impacted by deferrable procedures, like in cardiac diagnostics, ICDs, Pain Stim, Spine, and also in those businesses that require ICU bed capacity for the procedure like in TAVR. 
That said, we expect this Delta variant infection rates to peak probably in late August to early September and the hospital and ICU capacity to improve a few weeks after that. And so by the time we exit our second quarter, we expect procedures to be back to more normal. But we've reflected all of this in our guidance for the second quarter. And we're really bullish about the underlying strength of our business, not just in the second quarter, but in the back half of the full year ahead."

So we had May was better than April, June better than May, July better than June. And it wasn't until the last few weeks of the month that we started to see the pullback. And again, it was -- it's isolated to -- where we're feeling it is more in developed countries, the United States being a big one, Japan, Australia, New Zealand. And just using the United States as an example, it's really limited to the areas geographically in the U.S. where you have lower vaccination rates. It's that simple. And where you have higher vaccination rates, we're not seeing it. 
The other thing that it's -- if you look at like a Venn diagram of Concentric circuit, it's those geographies. And then the procedures that we're seeing are just like we saw in the first wave, the ones that slowed down first, it's either the more highly electable ones, like Pain Stim or Spine or ICDs or, in our world, cardiac diagnostics, those are more elective, I would say. Or -- and I should say, it's procedures that require an ICU stay like a TAVR procedure. So those are the ones that we're seeing it, the pullback. And it's in those regions of the United States, to use that example, where vaccination rates are lower. 
And again, hospitals are better equipped. Karen already went through, we think this is going to peak here at the end of August, the kind of the hospitals -- the infection rates, if you will. Hospitalization rates will trail that by a couple of weeks. We do think this is shorter-lived and easier managed than the prior waves. 
So I mean, that's been the progression. So it hasn't quite peaked yet. And like I said, we didn't start seeing the -- I would say, the pullback until the last 2 weeks of July. And at that point, we were pretty much back to either 100%, in some cases over 100%, of pre-COVID levels in our therapies."

So there is a good proportion of the patients that are going to be commercial in stores anyway.

Yes, look, I mean, the tuck-in strategy is definitely is the one that we're focused on and it's been consistent with what we've been doing over the last couple of quarters. I think we've done 7 deals over the last 1.5 years or so for about $2.3 billion. This one, roughly $1 billion is one of our -- this is the kind of deal I would see -- I would expect from us. This one happens to be earnings neutral in the first 12 months and accretive thereafter. It's accretive to our weighted average market growth rate. The segment within ENT is growing in the mid-teens. And the returns are strong, well, well above our weighted average cost of capital. So these are kind of deals that we like to see. And they are in areas that were strong. So the ENT is one of our stronger businesses, as Karen pointed out in her opening remarks. 
So yes, so in terms of where to look beyond, I mean, that's -- it's tough to forecast. I'd tell you this, we are looking at all of our different operating units and the different segments that they serve. We spent a lot of time and resources looking at different opportunities and engaging different companies. And yes, so we've got opportunities across the portfolio, and it's difficult to predict where the next one will be. But it will -- we are still very focused on this tuck-in strategy. And I'd like to say that we're not buying growth here. We're growing what we buy. We buy these earlier-stage companies, and there tends to be a lot of synergies that drive growth, whether it be technical or clinical, or a big one would be commercial, especially outside the U.S. since a lot of these companies tend to be U.S.-based, these start-ups. So that's how to answer that. And hopefully, we can continue to keep this going because it does add to our weighted average market growth rate."

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations.  
Before we start the prepared remarks, I'm going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 30, 2021, and our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, our portfolio executive VPs will join us, and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's event should last about an hour.  
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.  
During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.  
Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. First quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last 4 quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential revenue changes compare to the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the second calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated.  
Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.  
With that, let's head into the studio and get started."

We started off fiscal 2022 with a strong first quarter, beating Street estimates on revenue, margins and EPS. We drove market share gains across a number of our businesses, including 3 of our largest: Cardiac Rhythm, Surgical Innovations and Spine. Our results reflected the recovery of elective procedures during the quarter, with most of our businesses finishing at or above pre-COVID levels.  
Now while the Delta variant is having an impact on procedure volumes in certain geographies, we believe the effects will be manageable. Health care systems are really just better prepared and vaccination rates continue to increase.  
Our new operating model and the Medtronic mindset culture enhancements are delivering results, as our first quarter performance demonstrates. Our employees are energized by the transformation of our organizational structure and the competitive culture. And our most recent employee engagement survey results were the strongest that we've ever had.  
We continue to focus on accelerating and sustaining higher top and bottom line growth at Medtronic. In fact, we've already made a number of disciplined and targeted capital allocation decisions that drive that acceleration. We've increased our investments at the front end of major product launches in surgical robots and renal denervation, which represent large new markets for Medtronic. We're growing our R&D investments broadly across the company, complementing a long list of organic opportunities with disciplined tuck-in acquisitions, such as our recently announced intent to acquire Intersect ENT. Now we expect these actions to drive share gains in our markets today, which we've talked a lot about and to increase our weighted average market growth rate, producing stronger returns for our shareholders.  
Now turning to the details of our first quarter results. We'll start again with a brief look at our market share performance. It's an important metric that our teams are being evaluated against, along with revenue growth, profit and free cash flow.  
We continue to see a number of our businesses winning share, driven by our innovation and increased competitiveness. And it's worth noting that when we talk about our share dynamics, we're referring to revenue share in calendar quarter Q2.  
We gained share in our 3 largest businesses this quarter. Our Cardiac Rhythm Management business continued to perform well above the market, adding over 3 points of share, driven by our differentiated Micra family of pacemakers, Cobalt and Crome high-power devices and our TYRX antibacterial envelopes.  
In Surgical Innovations, we gained share as our endostapling and Advanced Energy technology continues to be the preferred and trusted instruments used by surgeons all around the world.  
And in Spine, the ecosystem that we offer of spine implants, biologics and enabling technologies like the preoperative planning software, robotics, imaging and navigation, resulted in above-market growth for Medtronic.  
And it's not just our largest businesses that are winning share. We also had share gains in some of our faster-growing businesses, like TAVR, Pelvic Health and Pain Stim as new evidence, technology and sales execution resulted in Medtronic outpacing our competition.  In Pain Stim, we did observe gradual slowdown in permanent implants and trialing procedures in the latter parts of our quarter due to the Delta variant. And we do expect that this will affect the market during Q2.  
That said, we continue to win share and have a lot of momentum in our Intellis with DTM technology. And with the launch of the Vanta recharge-free system, our portfolio is complete, highly competitive and well positioned.  
Now while we're winning share in a number of our businesses, we still have areas where we have work to do. In Cardiovascular, we continue to lose share in our cardiac diagnostics business. However, we do expect these trends will reverse over the course of our fiscal year as we ramp up supply of our LINQ II insertable cardiac monitoring system.  
Now we also lost share year-over-year in Neurovascular, but we were pleased with our momentum as we ramped our recent product launches. This included our 2 new flow diverters, the Pipeline Flex with Shield technology in the U.S. and the Pipeline Vantage in Europe as well as our Solitaire X 3-millimeter stent retriever.  
And finally, in Diabetes, we continue to execute our turnaround strategy. But as expected, we continue to lose share in the U.S. as we wait for new product approvals. We understand the current challenges we face in Diabetes, and we believe our product pipeline and our differentiated technologies will return us to market growth as these products move through development, approval and ultimately become available to patients.  
Now speaking of new products, let's now turn to our product pipeline. Today, you're seeing the strong flow of new products launching across our businesses. We've launched over 190 products in the U.S., Western Europe, Japan and China in just the last 12 months. We also continue to advance the innovation we have in development. We're increasing our R&D spend by more than 10% this fiscal year. This is the biggest dollar increase in R&D spend in our company's history. The investments we're making in our pipeline will play a key role in accelerating our top line growth, and we're at the front end of some large opportunities to win share, create new markets and disrupt existing markets.  
Starting with one of our largest future growth drivers, renal denervation. We're making good progress on our solution to go after this multibillion-dollar hypertension opportunity. We expect that the results of our ON MED pivotal trial will be ready for a presentation at the TCT conference in November, assuming the interim look at this Bayesian design study reaches statistical significance. The ON MED clinical trial represents the final piece of a large body of evidence that we intend to submit to the FDA for approval.  
The progress on our Surgical Robotics business has been impressive in recent months, and we have momentum on a number of important milestones and initiatives. But most notable, and something that has energized our entire company and the robotics team, the first procedures with Hugo were performed at Clínica Santa Maria in Chile by Dr. Ruben Olivares in June. And as is said, a picture is worth a thousand words. So let's watch this short clip detailing this important milestone.  
[Presentation]"
31348,711327028,2384810,"Medtronic plc, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2021",2021-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","It's truly amazing to see our robotic technology in use, and I want to thank the hundreds of Medtronic employees that have worked tirelessly over many years as well as the surgeon and hospital leaders whose partnership help make Hugo a reality.  We look f",725,"It's truly amazing to see our robotic technology in use, and I want to thank the hundreds of Medtronic employees that have worked tirelessly over many years as well as the surgeon and hospital leaders whose partnership help make Hugo a reality.  We look forward to expanding the surgical robotics market by addressing the per procedure cost and utilization barriers that have limited robotic surgery to date.  
And shortly after the first urological procedures in Chile, we had the first gynecological procedures performed last month at the Pacifica Salud Hospital in Panama. We're receiving positive feedback from our early users for our approach to robotic surgery, including our thoughtful design choices. For example, as you can see by this picture, our open console design allows for natural interaction and participation of the entire surgical team. And it's just one of the many important differentiated features of Hugo.  
Looking ahead, we remain on track for CE Mark approval of Hugo following our submission in late March. And we continue to make progress towards starting our U.S. EXPAND Euro pivotal trial where the first procedures in the U.S. will occur.  
Around the globe, a number of hospital systems have expressed interest in our Partners in Possibility Program, joining a group of pioneering hospitals that will be among the first to use Hugo.  
In Cardiac Rhythm, we filed for CE Mark for our Extravascular ICD this quarter, and enrollment is going well in our U.S. pivotal trial. EV ICD represents a disruptive technology in implantable defibrillator space as it can pace and shock without leads inside the heart. And they can do all of this in a single device with the same size and longevity of a traditional ICD.  
In TAVR, we continue to advance our Evolut platform, and I am pleased to share with you the news today that we just received FDA approval last week for our next-generation Evolut FX TAVR system. Now this innovative system is designed to improve the overall procedural experience through enhancements in deliverability, implant visibility and deployment stability. We're planning to start rolling out this next-gen system in the U.S. market later this fall.  
In Neuromodulation, in addition to receiving FDA approval in the quarter for our Vanta recharge-free spinal cord stimulator, we also received FDA approval for our SenSight Directional Deep Brain Stimulation Lead. Now SenSight, combined with our recently approved Percept PC system, is the only DBS system on the market that can sense and record brain activity in addition to providing normal stimulation to treat diseases like Parkinson's and essential tremor.  We also remain on track to submit our ECAP spinal cord stimulator to the FDA later this calendar year, which has the potential to be a disruptive technology in Pain Stim.  
Now moving to our Pelvic Health business. As you know, we don't reveal all of our development programs underway at Medtronic for competitive reasons, but I'm going to unveil a new one today. We've been working in stealth mode on our next-gen InterStim recharge-free device. And earlier this month, we submitted our PMA supplement to the U.S. FDA, seeking approval. Now this device has some very attractive specs. It's designed with a 10-year battery. It's got constant current. And it's full body MRI compatible at both 1.5 and 3 Tesla. We're expecting approval in the first half of next calendar year, and we can't wait to have this best-in-class recharge-free device available for patients.  
In Diabetes, the international launch of our MiniMed 780G insulin pump continues to go well. The 780G has the highest reported time in range of any insulin pump. And starting this fall, people with diabetes in many international markets will not only have access to the 780G, but also our no-calibration 7-day Guardian 4 sensor and our 7-day extended infusion set, the longest-lasting set on the market. This complete offering will be highly differentiated and ease patient burden, and we're working to bring this technology to other markets.  
In the U.S., the 780G and Guardian 4 sensor continue to be under active review with the FDA. And we're expecting to submit our next-gen Synergy CGM sensor to the FDA in Q3. Synergy is disposable, easier to apply and half the size of our current sensor.  
I'll now turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and our guidance. Karen?"
31348,711327028,2384810,"Medtronic plc, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2021",2021-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Thank you, Geoff. Our first quarter organic revenue increased 19% and adjusted EPS increased 127%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn from the pandemic impact last year.

Our first quarter organic revenue increased 19% and adjusted EPS increased 127%, significant growth as we anniversary the downturn from the pandemic impact last year. Our end markets are recovering, and we continue to launch new technology and gain market share, which is reflected in our growth and profitability.  Our adjusted EPS was $0.09 better than consensus, with the entire beat coming from higher revenue growth and operating profit.  
As I noted on our last earnings call, we did not adjust our first quarter results for the extra week of sales last year given the concurrent reduction of customer bulk purchases, as these 2 items roughly offset each other at the total company level. That said, not all areas of the company had large quarter end customer bulk purchase activity, Diabetes, for example. As a result, I would point out that our Diabetes growth rate would be roughly 6 points higher in the first quarter had we adjusted for the extra week. 
On our cadence of recovery, the monthly improvement trends continued. Average daily sales in June were stronger than May, and July was stronger than June. That said, we did begin to see a slowdown in certain businesses in the last few weeks of July related to the spread of the Delta variant in the United States. If not for the COVID impact in July, our first quarter performance would have been even stronger.  
Turning to our P&L. We saw significant year-over-year improvement in our margins, 670 basis points on gross margin and over 1,000 basis points on operating margin.  Our operating margin was better than expected as investments we initiated in the first quarter took longer to ramp but are expected to pick up starting in the second quarter.  
Turning to capital allocation. We continue to balance our investment for future growth while returning cash to our shareholders, primarily through our strong and growing dividend.  As we've noted for several quarters, we are increasing our level of tuck-in acquisitions, having announced 7 for a total of $2.3 billion since the start of fiscal '21.  
Less than 3 weeks ago, we announced our intent to acquire Intersect ENT. Our ENT business has quietly been a strong performer for us, led by a great team with a track record of consistently outperforming the market. With the addition of Intersect's complementary products, we can accelerate the growth profile of this business for years to come. The deal is accretive to our weighted average market growth rate; initially neutral, but quickly accretive to earnings and has expected returns well ahead of our cost of capital.  
Now turning to our guidance. As you know, it is still early in our fiscal year. We had a strong first quarter. And despite the current impact from COVID, we are optimistic about the outlook for the year.  Given how early it is in the year, we are maintaining our revenue guidance for the full year at 9%, plus or minus. If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $100 million to $200 million, down from the prior $400 million to $500 million I gave last quarter.  
By segment, we continue to expect Cardiovascular and Neuroscience to grow 10% to 11%, Medical Surgical to now grow 8% to 9% and Diabetes to be roughly flat, all on an organic basis.  On the bottom line, we are raising the lower end of our guidance by our first quarter beat, offset by a lower expected benefit from FX.  We now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.65 to $5.75, an increase from our prior range of $5.60 to $5.75. This includes a currency benefit of $0.05 to $0.10 at recent rates, down from the $0.10 to $0.15 benefit we signaled last quarter.  
Our second quarter is likely to reflect the current impacts from COVID, particularly in a handful of businesses in Cardiovascular and Neuroscience. So we expect organic growth in the quarter of around 4%, with a currency tailwind of $0 to $50 million at recent rates.  Keep in mind that we are facing a particularly tough comp in our ventilator business, which peaked in the second quarter last year. Ex ventilator sales, we expect organic growth in the quarter around 6%.  
By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 5% to 6%; Neuroscience, 6% to 7%; and both Medical Surgical and Diabetes to be flat to up 1%, all on an organic basis.  Excluding ventilator sales, Medical Surgical is expected to grow 8% to 9%.  
We expect EPS between $1.28 and $1.30, with a current tailwind of about $0.04 at recent rates.  
As previously mentioned, we do believe the near-term COVID impact to our business will be relatively less severe than prior waves, given hospital preparedness and increasing vaccination rates around the globe. That said, to be conservative, our guidance does not assume that procedures canceled in the near term will be rescheduled. So to the extent those procedures are simply delayed, that should be upside.  
We are confident as ever in the strength of our underlying business, our execution and the impact of our new products. We saw that in the first quarter. And as we move past the current impact of COVID, we feel really good about the underlying strength for the rest of the year.  
Before I send it back to Geoff, I'd like to step back and acknowledge how much our employees have accomplished over the last year since the pandemic started. And our results this past quarter reflect that unwavering focus by our global team to drive our business and fulfill our mission. And for that, I'm incredibly proud.  
Back to you, Geoff."

Next, I'd like to cover a few ESG-related topics: inclusion, diversity and equity as well as product quality.

Next, I'd like to cover a few ESG-related topics: inclusion, diversity and equity as well as product quality.  
First, inclusion, diversity and equity, something that is personally important to me and important to our success at Medtronic. Now we best fulfill our mission when we have a workplace where ID&E for all of our employees is championed. While we know there is much more to be done, we've made a lot of progress here, and this is being recognized by others.  
I mentioned our DiversityInc award last quarter, and we were recently recognized by several other organizations for our innovative and inclusive work environment. We were named as one of Fast Company's Best Workplaces for Innovators in 2021, as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by the Disability Equality Index, and we were one of the 15 companies awarded the Secretary of Defense Freedom Award for our efforts to support our military veteran employees.  
Next, I want to emphasize our continued focus on product quality. Striving without reserve for the greatest possible reliability and quality in our products is a key tenet of the Medtronic mission and core to our commitment to improved outcomes for patients. In fact, there is nothing more important than patient safety.  
In Q1, we made the decision to stop HVAD sales. We did this because of a growing body of clinical comparisons indicating that our device had a higher frequency of adverse events than a competitor's product. This decision was consistent with our commitment to patient safety. Importantly, we remain committed to supporting current HVAD patients, their caregivers and health care professionals. 
At Medtronic, we have a purpose deeply rooted in our mission, and our employees translate this mission into tangible day-to-day actions, which in turn create an impact in our society. 
When I reflect on product quality and ID&E, we've made progress but there's always room for improvement. One step is ensuring that we have the right incentives in place to drive the actions that will elevate our impact. Our Board and executive leadership have been evaluating our annual incentive plans. And as a result of this, we're planning to further strengthen our existing quality metrics and we intend to introduce new ID&E metrics into our incentive plans. These will help guide our plans and drive our work on a daily basis and ultimately hold us accountable to translate our actions into even greater impact. 
For those of you that would like to learn more about our ESG efforts underway at Medtronic, I encourage you to save the date to virtually attend our first ever ESG investor and analyst event, which we're planning to broadcast on Wednesday, October 13. You're going to hear from leaders from across Medtronic covering important topics, including inclusion, diversity and equity and product quality and safety. 
And I'll close by noting that we are on track to accelerate our revenue growth. We're executing on our pipeline, and we're winning share in the marketplace with our leading technology. And we have some really big opportunities ahead of us, with near-term milestones in both renal denervation and Surgical Robotics businesses. And the energy across the organization is palpable as we operate under a new model and instill our new cultural traits, including acting boldly, competing to win, moving with speed and decisiveness in everything that we do and getting results and getting them the right way. 
And to our employees, many of whom I'm sure are watching today, thank you. I truly appreciate your efforts to deliver these results. Look, these are exciting times, and I'm really looking forward to all that we're going to accomplish over the coming months. Momentum is building, and we're creating value, and there is a lot more to come. 
With that, now let's move to Q&A. Now we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible.

Really, those businesses that are impacted by deferrable procedures, like in cardiac diagnostics, ICDs, Pain Stim, Spine, and also in those businesses that require ICU bed capacity for the procedure like in TAVR. 
That said, we expect this Delta variant to -- infection rates to peak probably in late August to early September and the hospital and ICU capacity to improve a few weeks after that. And so by the time we exit our second quarter, we expect procedures to be back to more normal. But we've reflected all of this in our guidance for the second quarter. And we're really bullish about the underlying strength of our business, not just in the second quarter, but in the back half and the full year ahead."

And I would also remind you that we've got ventilators coming down off of our peak in the second quarter last year. That's another about 200 basis point headwind. 
And then with our decision to no longer sell and distribute LVADs in our MCS business, that's another about 50 basis points headwind. So the true underlying strength when you take out COVID, the impact of events and MCS is around 8% for the quarter.
In terms of EPS, we're guiding for the quarter $1.28 to $1.30. That includes a currency tailwind of about $0.04.

So we had -- May was better than April, June better than May, July better than June. And it wasn't until the last few weeks of the month that we started to see the pullback. And again, it was -- it's isolated to -- where we're feeling it is more in developed countries, the United States being a big one, Japan, Australia, New Zealand. And just using the United States as an example, it's really limited to the areas geographically in the U.S. where you have lower vaccination rates. It's that simple. And where you have higher vaccination rates, we're not seeing it. 
The other thing that it's -- if you look at like a Venn diagram of concentric circles, it's those geographies. And then the procedures that we're seeing are just like we saw in the first wave, the ones that slowed down first. It's either the more highly electable ones like Pain Stim or Spine or ICDs or, in our world, cardiac diagnostics, those are more elective, I would say. Or -- and I should say, it's procedures that require an ICU stay like a TAVR procedure. So those are the ones that we're seeing it, the pullback. And it's in those regions of the United States, to use that example, where vaccination rates are lower. 
And again, hospitals are better equipped. Karen already went through, we think this is going to peak here at the end of August, the kind of the hospitals, the infection rates, if you will. Hospitalization rates will trail that by a couple of weeks. We do think this is shorter-lived and easier managed than the prior waves. 
So I mean, that's been the progression. So it hasn't quite peaked yet. And like I said, we didn't start seeing the -- I would say, the pullback until the last 2 weeks of July. And at that point, we were pretty much back to either 100%, in some cases over 100%, of pre-COVID levels in our therapies."

But on the procedure volumes, yes, like we said, we believe the cases like, if you will, the COVID cases peak some time at the end of August, early September. And then hospitalizations lag that by a few weeks. So that would peak kind of mid-September. And then we would make up those cases, hopefully, over the course of the year. But we would start getting back to those pre-COVID levels. 
I'll just point out that our guidance does not assume that we make up these cases, but that is a possibility here given the -- how quickly we recovered the cases during the prior waves that were much worse than we anticipate the Delta variant being. But that's on the procedure volumes. 
On Diabetes, you mentioned 780G in Europe. That is already approved. So I don't know if you meant to say U.S., but in Europe, the 780G is on the market and doing really well. And that's -- we're optimistic because we're seeing the performance in Europe. And the best time and range of any pump and the user feedback and the physician feedback has been off the charts positive. So we're excited about that. 
But you had a few other questions there about iCGM. And maybe I'm assuming maybe your question was 780G in the U.S. though. Maybe, Sean, do you want to take those?"

In Europe, we're seeing the impact in the U.K. And in Latin America, we're not seeing a big impact on the Delta variant at this point. So hopefully, that's helpful. 
In terms of patient sentiment and the impact around capacity availability, we do expect this impact to be short-lived. And really, it's because hospitals are better equipped, as Geoff talked about; vaccination rates are increasing around the world; and patient sentiment is understanding that we need to have life go on with a COVID variant. And so we're seeing that. And so we do expect the recovery here to be faster certainly than it was in the first wave and even in the second wave."

In terms of how much that hit in the first quarter, we expected some ramps in those investments plus others in the first quarter. And we didn't see all of those ramps in the first quarter. So we're expecting more in the second quarter just because of the fact that we're hiring lots of people and it takes a little bit of time. So we are expecting that ramp in the second quarter and in the third quarter beyond that.

Yes, look, I mean, the tuck-in strategy is definitely is the one [ is that we're focused on ] and it's been consistent with what we've been doing over the last couple of quarters. I think we've done 7 deals over the last 1.5 years or so for about $2.3 billion. This one, roughly $1 billion, is one of our -- this is the kind of deal I would see -- I would expect from us. This one happens to be earnings neutral in the first 12 months and accretive thereafter. It's accretive to our weighted average market growth rate. The segment within ENT is growing in the mid-teens. And the returns are strong, well, well above our weighted average cost of capital. So these are the kind of deals that we'd like to see there, and in areas that were strong. So the ENT is one of our stronger businesses, as Karen pointed out in her opening remarks. 
So yes, so in terms of where to look beyond, I mean, that's tough to forecast. I'd tell you this, we are looking at all of our different operating units and the different segments that they serve. We spent a lot of time and resources looking at different opportunities and engaging different companies. And yes, so we've got opportunities across the portfolio, and it's difficult to predict where the next one will be. But it will -- we are still very focused on this tuck-in strategy. 
And I'd like to say that we're not buying growth here. We're growing what we buy. We buy these earlier-stage companies, and there tends to be a lot of synergies that drive growth, whether it be technical or clinical, or a big one would be commercial, especially outside the U.S. since a lot of these companies tend to be U.S.-based, these start-ups.

Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our second quarter, which ended on October 29, 2021, and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, our portfolio executive VPs will join us and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's event should last about an hour. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. 
During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. 
Second quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last 4 quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the first quarter of fiscal '22, and  are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter of 2021 compared to the third calendar quarter of 2020, unless otherwise stated. 
Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. 
With that, let's head into the studio and get started."

This morning, we reported Q2 results, which despite a challenging market backdrop, reflects solid execution around new product launches and strong underlying earnings growth. Obviously, our end markets",2113,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported Q2 results, which despite a challenging market backdrop, reflects solid execution around new product launches and strong underlying earnings growth. Obviously, our end markets were impacted by the COVID-19 resurgence and the health care system staffing shortages particularly in the U.S., which affected our quarterly revenue growth. 
Procedure volumes were lighter than expected in markets where our technology is used in more deferrable procedures like our spine business or those that require ICU bed capacity like TAVR. Yet in markets where procedures are less deferrable, like pacing, we experienced stronger growth. 
While the U.S. market was a headwind, many of our international markets were much stronger. We delivered 6% revenue growth outside the U.S., including mid-teens growth in emerging markets. And our emerging market growth is up 9% versus pre-pandemic levels in Q2 fiscal '20. 
In the midst of these market headwinds, we focused on managing what was in our control and executed to advance our pipeline, launch new products and win share. And when you look at our sequential revenue performance, our 2% decline was slightly better than most of our large cap med tech competitors. While the pace of the recovery from pandemic headwinds is hard to predict, our markets will recover. And as that happens, Medtronic is one of the best positioned companies in health care. 
The underlying health of our business is strong, and it's getting stronger. We have an expansive pipeline of leading technology, a robust balance sheet and an expanding roster of proven top talent. Coupled with our revitalized operating model and new competitive mindset, we remain poised to accelerate and sustain growth. As I've done in prior quarters, let's start with a look at our market share performance. 
Year-over-year market share is an important metric that our teams are evaluated against in their annual incentive plans, along with revenue growth, profit and free cash flow. And right now, the majority of our businesses are winning share, driven by our innovation and increased competitiveness. And this is exactly the sort of market share performance that gives us confidence in the deep strength of our businesses. 
And to avoid any confusion about how we're performing, when we talk about our share dynamics, we'll refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter to keep it directly comparable to our competition. Share momentum in our 3 largest businesses continued. 
In the Cardiac Rhythm Management business, we extended category leadership, adding over 1 point of share year-over-year, driven by our differentiated micro family of pacemakers, cobalt and chrome high-power devices and our TYRX antibacterial envelopes. 
In Surgical Innovations, we outperformed competition with strong performances in endostapling and sutures. And our Signia powered stapling system and Tri-Staple technology continues to see great market adoption. In Cranial and Spinal Technologies, we're winning share and launching new spine implants that enhance the overall value of our ecosystem of preoperative planning software, imaging, navigation and robotic systems and powered surgical instruments, which is transforming care in spine surgery. 
Our new implants also go directly at the competition, starting this past quarter with our catalyst expandable interbodies to specifically attract Globus users. In addition to our 3 largest, a broad array of our other businesses have increased their competitiveness, are launching new products and winning share in their end markets. 
So for example, in patient monitoring, we're winning share with our Nalcor pulse oximetry sensors and our monitors. In respiratory interventions, we picked up 4 points of share in premium ventilation due to our ability to respond quickly to spikes in demand from COVID resurgence. And in Neuromodulation, we won share across our product lines, including Pain Stim and DBS as we continue to launch new products. In Pain Stim, despite the sequential slowdown in the market, we're gaining share with our Intellis with DTM technology and our Vanta recharge-free system. In DBS, we had a very strong quarter, winning over 6 points of share. We're executing on the launch of our Percept neurostimulator with BrainSense technology paired with our Sensit directional lead, and we continue to be the only company with sensing capabilities. 
Since launching SenSight in the U.S. earlier this fiscal year, we surged ahead of the competition in new implant share. Sensing has redefined what it takes to compete in DBS. Our competitors don't have it. And as a result, we're expecting a long runway of share gains as we build upon our category leadership. 
Now while the majority of our businesses are winning share, we do have a few businesses that are flat or losing share, and we're focusing our efforts and our investments to grow above the market. 
In Cardiac Diagnostics, we're focused on improving supply to reverse share declines, and we're investing in new indications and novel AI detection algorithms to expand the market and drive growth. In cardiac ablation solutions, we expect to win share as we expand the rollout of our DiamondTempt RF ablation system and drive awareness and adoption of our Arctic Front Advance Pro cryoablation as a first-line treatment for paroxysmal AF. 
In diabetes, while we lost share again this quarter, we remain pleased with the momentum we're building outside the U.S., not only with the 780G insulin pumps, but also with the positive customer feedback we've heard on our extended infusion set and fingerstick-free Guardian Sensor 4. And we expect our U.S. results to turn around as we launch these new products. 
Next, let's turn to our product pipeline. I've already talked about the impact our strong flow of new products is having in the market. We've launched over 180 products in the U.S. Western Europe, Japan and China in the last 12 months. At the same time, we continue to advance new technologies that are in development. We're heavily investing in this pipeline with a targeted R&D spend of over $2.7 billion this fiscal year, which is an increase of over 10%, the largest dollar increase in our history. 
We're expecting these investments to create new markets, disrupt existing ones and accelerate the growth profile of Medtronic. Let's start with our Simplicity renal denervation procedure for hypertension. 
While we weren't able to end our ON MED study early, we remain confident in our program and our ability to serve the millions of patients who make up this multibillion-dollar opportunity. As a reminder, our previous 3 sham-controlled simplicity studies all reached statistical significance, including the pivotal OFF MED study. And the ON MED study remains powered to detect a statistically significant and clinically relevant benefit at the final analysis. 
We expect that ON MED follow-up will complete in the second half of next calendar year, and then we'll submit the PMA to the U.S. FDA for approval. When we think about renal innovation, let's start with the patients who have indicated that they want options, like the simplicity blood pressure lowering procedure to treat their hypertension as confirmed by our patient preference study presented earlier this month at TCT. 
We believe demand will be high, and we continue to expect this to be a massive opportunity that we will lead. Another opportunity for Medtronic is surgical robotics, where we are entering the soft tissue robotics market as a second meaningful player. We achieved a major milestone when we received CE Mark for Hugo last month. And we also completed our first procedures with Hugo in our Asia Pacific region at Apollo Hospitals in India. 
The first surgeons to use Hugo in the clinical setting have told us they believe Hugo addresses the cost and utilization barriers that have held back the growth of robotic surgery. Look, demand is high, and we're building a long list of hospitals that want to join our partners and possibility program and be among the first in the world to use HUGO and participate in our global registry, which will collect clinical data to support regulatory submissions around the world. 
Our robotic program is making progress toward a broader launch, and we remain well positioned in this critical field relative to every other potential new entrant. As we prepare for this broader launch, we're working hard to ensure an outstanding customer experience. We're also focused on optimizing our supply chain, manufacturing and logistics to prepare for scaling this business. 
We're making steady progress on these activities, but not at the pace that we'd originally planned. And as a result, sales this fiscal year are likely to come in below our $50 million to $100 million target. Now that said, we still expect double-digit millions in sales this fiscal year, and we continue to expect a strong ramp in FY '23. We're off schedule, but we're not off track. And while we're disappointed in the revenue push-out for this important program, we're confident that we have line of sight to the solutions we need to be successful and to optimize the customer experience. 
Demand remains high, surgeons continue to do cases, our order pipeline continues to build, and we're looking forward to starting our U.S. IDE soon. We remain confident in the success of this program, and we believe that we're poised to meaningfully expand the soft tissue robotic market and drive growth for years to come. 
In Cardiac Rhythm, we just launched our Micra AV leadless pacemaker in Japan earlier this month. We also completed the U.S. pivotal study enrollment for our EV ICD, which follows our CE Mark submission in Q1. Just as we disrupted the pacing market with Micra, we intend to do the same in the implantable defibrillator space with our EV ICD. 
Our device can both pace and shock without any leads inside the heart and veins, and it does this in a single device that is the same size as a traditional ICD. In structural heart, we're starting the limited U.S. launch of our next-gen TAVR system, the Evolut FX this month, with a full market launch planned for fiscal Q4. Evolut FX enhances ease of use with improvements in deliverability, implant visibility and deployment stability. We're also making progress on our transcatheter mitral program. 
At TCT earlier this month, we presented very encouraging early data of our transfemoral delivery system for our Intrepid mitral valve, and we will be rolling that system into our APOLLO pivotal trial. In Diabetes, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with our Guardian 4 sensor continue to be under active review with the FDA. 
When approved and launched in the U.S., we expect the 780G system to drive growth as it will be highly differentiated and further address the burden of daily diabetes management, and for the first time ever is helping hard to manage pediatric and adolescent patients achieve outcomes mirroring well-controlled adults. The user experience has also improved markedly, and these outstanding results were achieved with our 780G paired with our Guardian 3 sensor, so we expect the experience will be even stronger with Guardian 4 and the value of our offering will be further enhanced when we bring our synergy sensor, which is now called SIMPLARA to market. 
SIMPLARA is disposable. It's easier to apply and half the size of Guardian 4, and we expect to submit it to FDA later this fiscal year. In Pelvic Health, we're awaiting FDA approval for our next-gen InterStim recharge-free device, which we expect in the first half of next calendar year. With its best-in-class battery, constant current and full-body MRI compatibility at both 1.5 and 3 Tesla, we expect this device will extend our category leadership in this space. 
In Neuromodulation, we recently submitted our ECAPs closed-loop spinal cord stimulator to the FDA. We're calling this device inceptive SCS, and we expect it to revolutionize SCS with closed-loop therapy to optimize pain relief for patients. We also continue to make progress on expanding indications for SCS into nonsurgical refractory back pain, painful diabetic neuropathy and upper limb and neck chronic pain. 
Finally, in DBS, we continue to enroll patients in our ADAPT-PD trial studying our closed-loop adaptive DBS therapy in patients with Parkinson's. We're expecting enrollment in the trial to complete later this fiscal year. Now before I turn it over to Karen, the one thing I most want to emphasize is that despite the ups and downs of the pandemic and its collateral impacts on hospital procedures, nursing and staffing shortages and the supply chain, our underlying business remains strong. 
Medtronic is advancing a pipeline of meaningful innovation that we believe will not only enhance our competitiveness, but will accelerate our total company growth going forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and our guidance. Karen?"

Our second quarter organic revenue increased 2%, reflecting the market impact of COVID and health system staffing shortages on procedure volumes, primarily in the United States. Despite the softer end markets, our team executed to delive",933,"Thank you, Geoff. Our second quarter organic revenue increased 2%, reflecting the market impact of COVID and health system staffing shortages on procedure volumes, primarily in the United States. Despite the softer end markets, our team executed to deliver strong margin improvement and earnings growth. In fact, our adjusted EPS increased 29%, significant growth reflecting the pandemic impact last year. And our adjusted EPS was $0.03 better than consensus with $0.02 from stronger operating profit and $0.01 from a lower-than-expected tax rate. 
Our second quarter revenue growth came in lower than we were expecting back in August. We did see improving trends in our average daily sales each month of the quarter as COVID hospitalizations declined. That said, the bounce back in the U.S. wasn't as fast as we had expected or had seen in prior waves. We recognize many of our customers are dealing with staffing shortages on top of increased COVID patients, and we believe that had an increasing effect on procedure volume. 
Looking down our P&L, we had strong year-over-year improvement in our margins, 360 basis points on gross margin as we continue to recover from the significant impacts from COVID last year, and 470 basis points on operating margin, given savings from our simplification program tied to our operating model. 
Converting our earnings into strong free cash flow continues to be a priority. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $2.4 billion, up 58% from last year, and we continue to target a full year conversion of 80% or greater. 
Turning to capital allocation. We continue to allocate significant capital to organic R&D, and we continue to seek attractive tuck-in acquisitions to enhance our businesses. For example, Intersect ENT, we announced our intent to acquire back in August. Intersect's assets complement our own and are accretive to our WAMGR. Plus, we believe we can accelerate their growth around the globe. 
We're also returning capital back to our shareholders with a commitment to return greater than 50% of our free cash flow primarily through our dividend. Year-to-date, we paid $1.7 billion in dividends. And as a dividend aristocrat, our attractive and growing dividend is an important component of our total shareholder return. Looking ahead, although the environment remains fluid, we are seeing some improvement in procedures and our average daily sales in the first few weeks of November. So we're encouraged that the negative impact of the pandemic and health care system staffing shortages on our markets could be moderating. 
And while our operations team has done a terrific job managing our supply chain to date, like other companies, we are dealing with an elevated risk of raw material supply shortages. As a result of these potential headwinds and given we're only midway through our fiscal year, we believe it is prudent to update our fiscal '22 organic revenue growth guidance to 7% to 8% from the prior 9%. 
If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $0 to $50 million, down from the prior $100 million to $200 million I gave last quarter. By segment, we expect Neurosciences to now grow 9% to 10%, Cardiovascular and Medical Surgical to grow 7.5% to 8.5%, and Diabetes to be down low single digits, all on an organic basis. 
Despite the headwinds we face on revenue, we will manage well what we can control, which includes expenses not directly tied to our future growth. We will continue to invest heavily in R&D and market development. And on the bottom line, we reiterate our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range of $5.65 to $5.75. This continues to include a currency benefit of $0.05 to $0.10 at recent rates. 
For the third quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% year-over-year. This assumes no real pickup in organic comp adjusted growth versus pre-pandemic levels from what we saw in the second quarter despite the improving trends we saw in September and October. While we are encouraged by those trends and by what we're seeing in November, we wanted to err on the side of caution with near-term guidance given the dynamic macro environment. 
At recent rates, we're expecting a currency headwind on third quarter revenue of $80 million to $120 million. By segment, we expect cardiovascular to grow 5% to 6%; Neuroscience, 4% to 5%; Medical Surgical, 2% to 3%; and Diabetes to be down mid-single digits, all on an organic basis. We expect EPS between $1.37 and $1.39 with a currency tailwind of $0.02 to $0.04 at recent rates. 
While we expect our markets will continue to be affected by the pandemic in the back half of our fiscal year, we remain focused on delivering solid revenue growth, strong earnings growth and investing in our pipeline to fuel our future. We also remain confident about the underlying strength and competitiveness of our business and our ability to accelerate revenue growth ahead. 
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our incredible employees around the world who have worked tirelessly to overcome the many challenges created by the pandemic. executing our operations and supply chain, helping our customers and through it all, continuing to invent, develop and deliver the health care technology of tomorrow. 
I also want to recognize a new member of our team, who many of you know. We couldn't be more excited to have Bob Hopkins, the top-rated med tech analysts over the past 3 years join our team as Head of Strategy. And we look forward to a strong contribution and influence in the years ahead. Back to you, Geoff."

And yes, it is great to have Bob here at Medtronic. For the last few quarters, I've been closing by commenting on the progress the company is making in various areas of ESG, or environmental, social and governance impacts. Part of",620,"Okay. Thank you, Karen. And yes, it is great to have Bob here at Medtronic. For the last few quarters, I've been closing by commenting on the progress the company is making in various areas of ESG, or environmental, social and governance impacts. Part of the S in ESG is our focus on inclusion, diversity and equity and high employee engagement, which I discussed last quarter, and this makes Medtronic an attractive destination for top talent. 
In the release we issued last week, you read about how Bob Hopkins and other highly sought after world-class leaders chose to join Medtronic and drive our transformation to become the undisputed global leader in health care technology. It's very important for our culture that we're bringing in new ideas and diverse perspectives to add to those of our talented leadership and employees across the company. 
On the E front of ESG, as you know, we set an aggressive goal last year to be carbon-neutral in our operations by the end of the decade. And 2 weeks ago, we upped our game, announcing our ambition to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by FY '45 across our value chain. This ambition outlined in our FY '45 decarbonization road map will focus on operational carbon neutrality, supply chain greenhouse gas emissions reductions and ongoing logistics improvements. 
To support our progress, as well as progress across our entire industry, we joined the International Leadership Committee for a net 0 NHS in the U.K. And we're taking a leadership role with the U.S. National Academy of Medicine action collaborative to decarbonize the U.S. health care sector. 
Our ESG efforts are gaining recognition as last week, Medtronic was elevated from being a constituent of the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index to joining a select group of companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. Look, we are really proud of this achievement. 
In addition, I hope many of you were able to watch our inaugural ESG investor briefing last month. And if you haven't, I encourage that you watch the replay on our Investor Relations website. Now let me close on this note. 
The lingering effects of the pandemic combined with health care system staffing shortages impacted our Q2 revenue more than we originally anticipated. We have both puts and takes on the timing of our pipeline and the supply chain dynamics pose near-term challenges. But our challenges will be manageable. We've got this. Our pipeline is delivering, and we're poised to deliver more innovation over the coming quarters and the next several years. 
We have to show you that we can deliver. But robotics is coming, R&D is coming. Closed-loop SCS is coming. And our diabetes turnaround is coming. And Evolut FX and Mitra on EV-ICD and the pending acquisition of Intersect ENT, these are all coming. We're ready to execute and capitalize on these opportunities. We're in good markets, and we're focused on innovating, winning share and maintaining and/or achieving true category leadership across our businesses. 
I know we have more to prove, but I'm confident that our organization, our talented and dedicated 90,000-plus global employees are up for the challenge. We're focused, we're hungry and ultimately, we're going to deliver on these opportunities to accelerate our growth. And as always, we remain deeply committed to creating value for you, our shareholders. And with that, let's now move to Q&A. 
Now we're going to try to get as many analysts as possible, So we ask that you limit yourself to just 1 question. And if you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Win, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?"

And you know what, I'm going to -- for the guide, I'm going to walk you through the quarters a bit to help give you and set the context. And I'm going to start with Q2 because versus -- if you look at versus pre-pandemic levels or 2 years ago, our growth in Q2 was about 1% organically. It was a little below peers, but you got to keep in mind that our inventory levels were lower back then because that was before we made the change to bulk purchasing. 
So if you adjust for that inventory issue and a little bit of a tougher comp, our Q2 growth was in the 2% to 3% range versus pre-pandemic levels. And if you look at it sequentially, our revenue from Q1 to Q2 declined less than 2%, and that was while most of our peers saw declines of 3% to 5%. So our performance in Q2, we believe, is in line, at least in line with what we're seeing from our peers. 
And then if you look at Q3 in our guidance, we're expecting that same 2% to 3% growth as we saw in Q2 versus the pre-pandemic levels. And yes, that equates to a slight deceleration from what we saw in October. And we're encouraged by what we've seen in October and into November. But given the dynamic environment, we focus on wanting to err on the side of caution with our Q3 guide. And then for Q4, we're assuming normal sequential seasonality just because it's our fiscal year-end. So you'll see sequential improvement in Q4. So hopefully, that's helpful."

We're doing so far, euro and GYN cases. And we're close to -- I think we're in any day now, like our first general surgery case. So -- and like I said, demand continues to build. So the issue that we're doing, this is more of a limited release phase. That's where we are right now. And we're focused on optimizing the user experience. And the issues that we're managing through are some supply chain issues and some initial manufacturing issues, and those are the issues that we're working through right now. And we're really focused on making sure that these initial experiences with surgeons are really good. And so that's the reason for the slower revenue this year.

So there's certainly no concern here. 
And the customer reception has been really, really excellent and continues to be despite the letter of the FDA just emphasize. And on the clinical trial front for Dan -- You are right. There are differences in the clinical trials. And we remain, as Jeff said, very confident that our NME trial is going to make a standpoint. I think what you're referring to is the RADIANCE study that was reported on the RADIANCE TRIO study, which at 6 months, they did a full titration of drugs to get patients to their goal. So that was part of their study design was after the primary endpoint of 2 months, they've added drugs on it until blood pressure went down. And that's kind of the point of real innovation in general is that you can get there without as many drugs. 
And we saw something similar in the pilot study on meds, where we were able to 4 titrate drugs after the primary endpoint and get people's blood pressure there without having to go to diuretics, which patients really hate taking. So yes, there's nothing to read through on that one. They're trial in Japan and Korea was a little different. It was more like H2 and 3, where they didn't control for medications. They had none of those types of controls. So that's more a legacy study design that didn't leverage the learnings we got from HC3."

But the  procedures have bounced back, but not as quickly as prior waves and not as fast as we hope. There's definitely -- it's definitely a fluid situation, and it's gotten a little bit harder, more difficult to predict, right? 
Before, it was more of an epidemiology discussion around COVID cases and the severity of them and the impact to ICU beds. Now you've got this  critical staffing shortage in our -- in hospitals around the world. I mean, really particularly more so in the U.S., though, particularly this nursing shortage you hear about. And that's a little -- that's been a little bit more difficult to predict. And I think that's the thing that I'd say, surprised us a bit last quarter. 
And then finally, you've got some supply chain issues, which for us have been manageable so far. But as time goes on, that gets more difficult. So we took, I think, Karen, walked through the guidance, I think we took a conservative approach here, particularly for our Q3 guide on that. But it's difficult to quantify all these things working together here. 
The COVID cases jumping back up like you've heard about in Europe, nursing shortages in the U.S. and then global supply chain issues. I think the hospitals are doing a good job managing the headwinds they have. And I think we've done a pretty good job. Our team has done a really good job on the supply chain issues. During COVID, we were able to build up inventory on some of these critical products. But as these issues drag on, it becomes more challenging, and that's why we've taken, I think, a bit of an appropriate position given the uncertainty for our Q2 guide, or Q3 guide rather, sorry."

And I've been spending a lot of time with our team on this as well as our hospital customers. Look, these -- the hospitals are basically investing more in staffing. I mean that is, I think, one of the biggest issues here is then are the biggest opportunities. They're just -- they're paying more money for the staffing to get -- to incent people to come back. 
And the other thing that I see the hospital is doing, where we're spending a lot of time with them is adoption on more remote capabilities and business models. I mean in our world, things like managing your cardiac rhythm patients using remote technologies, so you don't have to come back into the hospital and get their device checks. We're doing that remotely. And I can go down the list to other of our therapies, like another one would be, and it's not in the U.S. yet, but in the NHS and U.K., they're using our PillCam. They've accelerated the use of the rollout of PillCam to do colonoscopy, diagnostic colonoscopies for their patients because they've built up a long waiting list of people who are getting colonoscopy. 
So I see hospitals, one, and it's not a sustainable situation, but short term, providing bonuses and incentives. And two, much more rapidly adopting some of, in our case, I mean, and they're working with other industry players as well to adopt things that are more remote, and they're prioritizing therapies that have less complications that result in less hospitalizations and return hospitalization. So I mean it's not an overnight solution, but they're aggressively working this. 
I mean no one likes to cancel a TAVR case because there's nobody to monitor the ICU bed or cover the care. So nobody wants to do that. And so they're moving fast on this. And like I said, we're seeing progress here even in our results into November. But it is fluid, and that's why we've taken the approach we've taken on the guide. I don't know if you have anything to add, Karen, to that."

But yes, I think consumers have been much more engaged in health care. And this is something that's weighing into our strategy. You saw that we rebranded Medtronic here last quarter and gone to a different look in engineering in the extraordinary. That's part of a first step to us more aggressively directly reaching out to consumers and educating them about our therapies. 
I mean things like Pillcam Genius, which I just talked about, things like cryoablation as a first-line indication for AFib. They don't want to be on these regimen of drugs. And so we historically have relied on our specialist physician partners like in the case of cryoablation on AFib, it's been electrophysiologists to kind of ""build up our referral pathways in our markets."" 
Now I think given the changes in technology, the miniaturization, which leads to less invasiveness, the connectivity of our devices, the better efficacy, we're moving up in the line -- in the food chain here closer to first line, like I mentioned in AFib. And some of our businesses are already there, more of a consumer business like diabetes and pelvic health for overactive bladder. So you're going to see us more engaging consumers and directly. 
And the reason we're bullish on this is, one, like I said, the therapies have changed, less invasive, more efficacious in some cases, just a better solution clinically proven than  pharma, which is the typical first-line indication. The other thing that we're seeing getting to your question is, like I said, here's a proof point on consumers more engaging. Like on our Ardian trial, we -- this trial filled up really quickly, enrolled really quickly, all through consumers opting in through our digital marketing efforts in social media efforts in the Ardian trial, consumers self-enrolled. That's a first for us. 
And so we are seeing much more engagement from consumers and their care. And through they're using the Internet and digital platforms to get that education, and that's changing our strategy."

But like I was just with one of our bigger customers in the South of the United States like 1.5 weeks ago, and they had a couple of -- and it was a cardiologist that had a couple of TAVR cases canceled that day. And there's a huge sense of urgency because of the nursing shortage. So they have a huge sense of urgency in correcting that issue. 
And like I said, they are prioritizing moving nurses. First of all, they're getting more aggressive with their staffing strategies to attract and retain staff. They're reallocating resources around the hospital, the health system, if you will, to get more nurses into these critical care areas. They're pushing certain cases out to ASCs. We're seeing growth in surgical centers, where they need less staff to do these cases. So we're seeing them aggressively make these, I'll call it, reallocation of resources, and we're helping them as much as we can in these areas. 
So I -- look, the -- like you said, you can't defer these cases. First of all, I don't know how -- I don't like -- I've never liked the term elective, I think it's more deferrable. And you can only defer some of these cases so long as you pointed out. And so people are innovating. Hospital systems are innovating here. And I just don't -- it's really hard to predict. 
I mean like I said, last quarter, we underestimated the impact of the nursing shortage. Like I said, we're seeing improvement, but -- and we've taken a conservative guide in our fiscal Q3 in particular, but it's really difficult for us to provide much more specifics than that."

And I'm very bullish on where we stand, and I'll walk you through why. 
I mean, yes, COVID in this nursing -- the critical staffing shortage like highlighted by this nursing shores in the U.S. And just spending a lot of time talking about vaccines and vaccine mandates, yes, it is a bit of a distraction, but I am very happy about our bigger picture here. 
We've -- one, what I really like is to structurally how we've made the company smaller on the front end, if you will, with these 20 operating units and the clarity that we have into the end markets and the dynamics what the customers are really asking for, what the competitors are doing, and we've got a really good handle on our pipeline by each of these operating units. And we have gotten more aggressive in funding these businesses and holding them accountable to making the right choices and prioritizing innovation and innovating faster. 
So I feel really good about that. And my team, we spend a lot of time looking at these operating units and making these judgment calls, what is the appropriate funding? What does a good pipeline look like how should we feel about the competition. And it's not just like me sitting around talking to an operating leader, it's my team, different portfolio leaders even if it's -- the business is not in their portfolio, asking tough questions because every incremental dollar funding we put in one business is one less dollar we put in another business. So the rigor around this and the constructive debate and the diversity of thought coming from the different people, it's leading to better decisions and the energy route inside the company and around the company is palpable. 
I mean we're getting -- our employee scores remain high despite all the burnout and everything and is affecting employees, but still we've got great scores and feedback we're getting -- attracting talent like never before. We've had a 50% spike in our -- and people applying for jobs at Medtronic. The market share situation is going well. 
And so look, we've got a lot to do here. We've got some big drivers that we've got to show. We've got to bring this robot program and ramp this. Already in -- we've got to get that data back and ramp that. We've got the diabetes turnaround. We're seeing -- we can see it. You can just see it off in the horizon. You can see the products doing so well in Europe and other parts of the world. We've got to get that in the United States. 
But we're making this progress. And that's why I feel good. And culturally, you're seeing a level of competitiveness and accountability. So like this quarter, revenue didn't come in where we want it. We wanted but we still had an operational beat on EPS and we're holding EPS guidance for the rest of the year. That's the kind of company that we want to be. disappointed about the miss on revenue. There's some environmental factors. But quite honestly, I was hoping that we could overcome all of those we weren't quite able to this quarter, but just to get some color commentary on how we think about it, that's how we're thinking about it. And we're going to -- I know we're doing the right things. 
We're going to stay the course. We're going to keep making these investments, keep holding ourselves accountable to being like the undisputed technology leader and growing above the market. That's where we want to go. And so optimistic about where we're going in that direction.

Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis.  
Second quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last 4 quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the first quarter of fiscal '22 and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter of 2021 compared to the third calendar quarter of 2020, unless otherwise stated.  
Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.

This morning, we reported Q2 results, which despite a challenging market backdrop, reflects solid execution around new product launches and strong underlying earnings growth. Obviously, our end markets",2110,"Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported Q2 results, which despite a challenging market backdrop, reflects solid execution around new product launches and strong underlying earnings growth. Obviously, our end markets were impacted by the COVID-19 resurgence and the health care system staffing shortages, particularly in the U.S., which affected our quarterly revenue growth.  
Procedure volumes were lighter than expected in markets where our technology is used in more deferrable procedures like our Spine business or those that require ICU bed capacity like TAVR. Yet in markets where procedures are less deferrable, like pacing, we experienced stronger growth.  
While the U.S. market was a headwind, many of our international markets were much stronger. We delivered 6% revenue growth outside the U.S., including mid-teens growth in emerging markets. And our emerging market growth is up 9% versus pre-pandemic levels in Q2 fiscal '20.  
In the midst of these market headwinds, we focused on managing what was in our control and executed to advance our pipeline, launch new products and win share. And when you look at our sequential revenue performance, our 2% decline was slightly better than most of our large cap med tech competitors. While the pace of the recovery from pandemic headwinds is hard to predict, our markets will recover. And as that happens, Medtronic is one of the best positioned companies in health care.  
The underlying health of our business is strong, and it's getting stronger. We have an expansive pipeline of leading technology, a robust balance sheet and an expanding roster of proven top talent. Coupled with our revitalized operating model and new competitive mindset, we remain poised to accelerate and sustain growth. As I've done in prior quarters, let's start with a look at our market share performance.  
Year-over-year market share is an important metric that our teams are evaluated against in their annual incentive plans, along with revenue growth, profit and free cash flow. And right now, the majority of our businesses are winning share, driven by our innovation and increased competitiveness. And this is exactly the sort of market share performance that gives us confidence in the deep strength of our businesses.  
And to avoid any confusion about how we're performing, when we talk about our share dynamics, we'll refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter to keep it directly comparable to our competition. Share momentum in our 3 largest businesses continued.  
In the Cardiac Rhythm Management business, we extended category leadership, adding over 1 point of share year-over-year, driven by our differentiated micro family of pacemakers, cobalt and chrome high-power devices and our TYRX antibacterial envelopes.  
In Surgical Innovations, we outperformed competition with strong performances in endostapling and sutures. And our Signia-powered stapling system and Tri-Staple technology continues to see great market adoption. In Cranial & Spinal Technologies, we're winning share and launching new spine implants that enhance the overall value of our ecosystem of preoperative planning software, imaging, navigation and robotic systems and powered surgical instruments, which is transforming care in spine surgery.  
Our new implants also go directly at the competition, starting this past quarter with our Catalyft expandable interbodies to specifically attract Globus users. In addition to our 3 largest, a broad array of our other businesses have increased their competitiveness, are launching new products and winning share in their end markets.  
So for example, in Patient Monitoring, we're winning share with our Nellcor pulse oximetry sensors and our monitors. In Respiratory Interventions, we picked up 4 points of share in premium ventilation due to our ability to respond quickly to spikes in demand from COVID resurgence. And in Neuromodulation, we won share across our product lines, including Pain Stim and DBS, as we continue to launch new products. In Pain Stim, despite the sequential slowdown in the market, we're gaining share with our Intellis with DTM technology and our Vanta recharge-free system. In DBS, we had a very strong quarter, winning over 6 points of share. We're executing on the launch of our Percept neurostimulator with BrainSense technology paired with our SenSight directional lead, and we continue to be the only company with sensing capabilities.  
Since launching SenSight in the U.S. earlier this fiscal year, we surged ahead of the competition in new implant share. Sensing has redefined what it takes to compete in DBS. Our competitors don't have it. And as a result, we're expecting a long runway of share gains as we build upon our category leadership.  
Now while the majority of our businesses are winning share, we do have a few businesses that are flat or losing share, and we're focusing our efforts and our investments to grow above the market. 
In cardiac diagnostics, we're focused on improving supply to reverse share declines, and we're investing in new indications and novel AI detection algorithms to expand the market and drive growth. In Cardiac Ablation Solutions, we expect to win share as we expand the rollout of our DiamondTempt RF ablation system and drive awareness and adoption of our Arctic Front Advance Pro cryoablation as a first-line treatment for paroxysmal AF.  
In Diabetes, while we lost share again this quarter, we remain pleased with the momentum we're building outside the U.S., not only with the 780G insulin pumps, but also with the positive customer feedback we've heard on our extended infusion set and fingerstick-free Guardian Sensor 4. And we expect our U.S. results to turn around as we launch these new products.  
Next, let's turn to our product pipeline. I've already talked about the impact our strong flow of new products is having in the market. We've launched over 180 products in the U.S. Western Europe, Japan and China in the last 12 months. At the same time, we continue to advance new technologies that are in development. We're heavily investing in this pipeline with a targeted R&D spend of over $2.7 billion this fiscal year, which is an increase of over 10%, the largest dollar increase in our history.  
We're expecting these investments to create new markets, disrupt existing ones and accelerate the growth profile of Medtronic. Let's start with our Symplicity renal denervation procedure for hypertension.  
While we weren't able to end our ON MED study early, we remain confident in our program and our ability to serve the millions of patients who make up this multibillion-dollar opportunity. As a reminder, our previous 3 sham-controlled Symplicity studies all reached statistical significance, including the pivotal OFF MED study. And the ON MED study remains powered to detect a statistically significant and clinically relevant benefit at the final analysis.  
We expect that ON MED follow-up will complete in the second half of next calendar year, and then we'll submit the PMA to the U.S. FDA for approval. When we think about renal denervation, let's start with the patients who have indicated that they want options, like the Symplicity blood pressure lowering procedure to treat their hypertension as confirmed by our patient preference study presented earlier this month at TCT.  
We believe demand will be high, and we continue to expect this to be a massive opportunity that we will lead. Another opportunity for Medtronic is surgical robotics, where we are entering the soft tissue robotics market as a second meaningful player. We achieved a major milestone when we received CE Mark for Hugo last month. And we also completed our first procedures with Hugo in our Asia Pacific region at Apollo Hospitals in India.  
The first surgeons to use Hugo in the clinical setting have told us they believe Hugo addresses the cost and utilization barriers that have held back the growth of robotic surgery. Look, demand is high, and we're building a long list of hospitals that want to join our partners and possibility program and be among the first in the world to use Hugo and participate in our global registry, which will collect clinical data to support regulatory submissions around the world.  
Our robotic program is making progress toward a broader launch, and we remain well positioned in this critical field relative to every other potential new entrant. As we prepare for this broader launch, we're working hard to ensure an outstanding customer experience. We're also focused on optimizing our supply chain, manufacturing and logistics to prepare for scaling this business.  
We're making steady progress on these activities, but not at the pace that we'd originally planned. And as a result, sales this fiscal year are likely to come in below our $50 million to $100 million target. Now that said, we still expect double-digit millions in sales this fiscal year, and we continue to expect a strong ramp in FY '23. We're off schedule, but we're not off track. And while we're disappointed in the revenue push-out for this important program, we're confident that we have line of sight to the solutions we need to be successful and to optimize the customer experience.  
Demand remains high. Surgeons continue to do cases. Our order pipeline continues to build, and we're looking forward to starting our U.S. IDE soon. We remain confident in the success of this program, and we believe that we're poised to meaningfully expand the soft tissue robotic market and drive growth for years to come.  
In Cardiac Rhythm, we just launched our Micra AV leadless pacemaker in Japan earlier this month. We also completed the U.S. pivotal study enrollment for our EV ICD, which follows our CE Mark submission in Q1. Just as we disrupted the pacing market with Micra, we intend to do the same in the implantable defibrillator space with our EV ICD.  
Our device can both pace and shock without any leads inside the heart and veins, and it does this in a single device that is the same size as a traditional ICD. In structural heart, we're starting the limited U.S. launch of our next-gen TAVR system, the Evolut FX, this month with a full market launch planned for fiscal Q4. Evolut FX enhances ease of use with improvements in deliverability, implant visibility and deployment stability. We're also making progress on our transcatheter mitral program. 
At TCT earlier this month, we presented very encouraging early data of our transfemoral delivery system for our Intrepid mitral valve, and we will be rolling that system into our APOLLO pivotal trial. In Diabetes, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with our Guardian 4 sensor continue to be under active review with the FDA. 
When approved and launched in the U.S., we expect the 780G system to drive growth as it will be highly differentiated and further address the burden of daily diabetes management, and for the first time ever is helping hard-to-manage pediatric and adolescent patients achieve outcomes mirroring well-controlled adults. The user experience has also improved markedly, and these outstanding results were achieved with our 780G paired with our Guardian 3 sensor, so we expect the experience will be even stronger with Guardian 4. And the value of our offering will be further enhanced when we bring our Synergy sensor, which is now called SIMPLERA to market. 
SIMPLERA is disposable. It's easier to apply and half the size of Guardian 4, and we expect to submit it to FDA later this fiscal year. In Pelvic Health, we're awaiting FDA approval for our next-gen InterStim recharge-free device, which we expect in the first half of next calendar year. With its best-in-class battery, constant current and full-body MRI compatibility at both 1.5 and 3 Tesla, we expect this device will extend our category leadership in this space. 
In Neuromodulation, we recently submitted our ECAPs closed-loop spinal cord stimulator to the FDA. We're calling this device inceptive SCS, and we expect it to revolutionize SCS with closed-loop therapy to optimize pain relief for patients. We also continue to make progress on expanding indications for SCS into nonsurgical refractory back pain, painful diabetic neuropathy and upper limb and neck chronic pain. 
Finally, in DBS, we continue to enroll patients in our ADAPT-PD trial studying our closed-loop adaptive DBS therapy in patients with Parkinson's. We're expecting enrollment in the trial to complete later this fiscal year. 
Now before I turn it over to Karen, the one thing I most want to emphasize is that despite the ups and downs of the pandemic and its collateral impacts on hospital procedures, nursing and staffing shortages and the supply chain, our underlying business remains strong. 
Medtronic is advancing a pipeline of meaningful innovation that we believe will not only enhance our competitiveness, but will accelerate our total company growth going forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and our guidance. Karen?"
31348,711327079,2447639,"Medtronic plc, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2021",2021-11-23,"Earnings Calls","Medtronic plc","Executives","Thank you, Geoff. Our second quarter organic revenue increased 2%, reflecting the market impact of COVID and health system staffing shortages on procedure volumes, primarily in the United States.

Our second quarter organic revenue increased 2%, reflecting the market impact of COVID and health system staffing shortages on procedure volumes, primarily in the United States. Despite the softer end markets, our team executed to deliver strong margin improvement and earnings growth. In fact, our adjusted EPS increased 29%, significant growth reflecting the pandemic impact last year. And our adjusted EPS was $0.03 better than consensus with $0.02 from stronger operating profit and $0.01 from a lower-than-expected tax rate. 
Our second quarter revenue growth came in lower than we were expecting back in August. We did see improving trends in our average daily sales each month of the quarter as COVID hospitalizations declined. That said, the bounce back in the U.S. wasn't as fast as we had expected or had seen in prior waves. We recognize many of our customers are dealing with staffing shortages on top of increased COVID patients, and we believe that had an increasing effect on procedure volume. 
Looking down our P&L, we had strong year-over-year improvement in our margins, 360 basis points on gross margin as we continue to recover from the significant impacts from COVID last year, and 470 basis points on operating margin, given savings from our simplification program tied to our operating model. 
Converting our earnings into strong free cash flow continues to be a priority. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $2.4 billion, up 58% from last year, and we continue to target a full year conversion of 80% or greater. 
Turning to capital allocation. We continue to allocate significant capital to organic R&D, and we continue to seek attractive tuck-in acquisitions to enhance our businesses. For example, Intersect ENT, we announced our intent to acquire back in August. Intersect's assets complement our own and are accretive to our WAMGR. Plus, we believe we can accelerate their growth around the globe. 
We're also returning capital back to our shareholders with a commitment to return greater than 50% of our free cash flow primarily through our dividend. Year-to-date, we paid $1.7 billion in dividends. And as a dividend aristocrat, our attractive and growing dividend is an important component of our total shareholder return. Looking ahead, although the environment remains fluid, we are seeing some improvement in procedures and our average daily sales in the first few weeks of November. So we're encouraged that the negative impact of the pandemic and health care system staffing shortages on our markets could be moderating. 
And while our operations team has done a terrific job managing our supply chain to date, like other companies, we are dealing with an elevated risk of raw material supply shortages. As a result of these potential headwinds and given we're only midway through our fiscal year, we believe it is prudent to update our fiscal '22 organic revenue growth guidance to 7% to 8% from the prior 9%. 
If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $0 to $50 million, down from the prior $100 million to $200 million I gave last quarter. By segment, we expect Neurosciences to now grow 9% to 10%, Cardiovascular and Medical Surgical to grow 7.5% to 8.5%, and Diabetes to be down low single digits, all on an organic basis. 
Despite the headwinds we face on revenue, we will manage well what we can control, which includes expenses not directly tied to our future growth. We will continue to invest heavily in R&D and market development. And on the bottom line, we reiterate our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range of $5.65 to $5.75. This continues to include a currency benefit of $0.05 to $0.10 at recent rates. 
For the third quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% year-over-year. This assumes no real pickup in organic comp adjusted growth versus pre-pandemic levels from what we saw in the second quarter despite the improving trends we saw in September and October. While we are encouraged by those trends and by what we're seeing in November, we wanted to err on the side of caution with near-term guidance given the dynamic macro environment. 
At recent rates, we're expecting a currency headwind on third quarter revenue of $80 million to $120 million. By segment, we expect cardiovascular to grow 5% to 6%; Neuroscience, 4% to 5%; Medical Surgical, 2% to 3%; and Diabetes to be down mid-single digits, all on an organic basis. We expect EPS between $1.37 and $1.39 with a currency tailwind of $0.02 to $0.04 at recent rates. 
While we expect our markets will continue to be affected by the pandemic in the back half of our fiscal year, we remain focused on delivering solid revenue growth, strong earnings growth and investing in our pipeline to fuel our future. We also remain confident about the underlying strength and competitiveness of our business and our ability to accelerate revenue growth ahead. 
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our incredible employees around the world who have worked tirelessly to overcome the many challenges created by the pandemic, executing our operations and supply chain, helping our customers and through it all, continuing to invent, develop and deliver the health care technology of tomorrow. 
I also want to recognize a new member of our team, who many of you know. We couldn't be more excited to have Bob Hopkins, the top-rated med tech analyst over the past 3 years, join our team as Head of Strategy. And we look forward to a strong contribution and influence in the years ahead. Back to you, Geoff."

Thank you, Karen. And yes, it is great to have Bob here at Medtronic. For the last few quarters, I've been closing by commenting on the progress the company is making in various areas of ESG, or environmental, social and governance impacts. Part of the S in ESG is our focus on inclusion, diversity and equity and high employee engagement, which I discussed last quarter, and this makes Medtronic an attractive destination for top talent. 
In the release we issued last week, you read about how Bob Hopkins and other highly sought after world-class leaders chose to join Medtronic and drive our transformation to become the undisputed global leader in health care technology. It's very important for our culture that we're bringing in new ideas and diverse perspectives to add to those of our talented leadership and employees across the company. 
On the E front of ESG, as you know, we set an aggressive goal last year to be carbon-neutral in our operations by the end of the decade. And 2 weeks ago, we upped our game, announcing our ambition to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by FY '45 across our value chain. This ambition outlined in our FY '45 decarbonization road map will focus on operational carbon neutrality, supply chain greenhouse gas emissions reductions and ongoing logistics improvements. 
To support our progress, as well as progress across our entire industry, we joined the International Leadership Committee for a net 0 NHS in the U.K. And we're taking a leadership role with the U.S. National Academy of Medicine action collaborative to decarbonize the U.S. health care sector. 
Our ESG efforts are gaining recognition as last week, Medtronic was elevated from being a constituent of the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index to joining a select group of companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. Look, we are really proud of this achievement. 
In addition, I hope many of you were able to watch our inaugural ESG investor briefing last month. And if you haven't, I encourage that you watch the replay on our Investor Relations website. Now let me close on this note. 
The lingering effects of the pandemic, combined with health care system staffing shortages, impacted our Q2 revenue more than we originally anticipated. We have both puts and takes on the timing of our pipeline and the supply chain dynamics pose near-term challenges. But our challenges will be manageable. We've got this. Our pipeline is delivering, and we're poised to deliver more innovation over the coming quarters and the next several years. 
We have to show you that we can deliver. But robotics is coming. R&D is coming. Closed-loop SCS is coming. And our diabetes turnaround is coming. And Evolut FX and MITRA on EV-ICD and the pending acquisition of Intersect ENT, these are all coming. We're ready to execute and capitalize on these opportunities. We're in good markets, and we're focused on innovating, winning share and maintaining and/or achieving true category leadership across our businesses. 
I know we have more to prove, but I'm confident that our organization, our talented and dedicated 90,000-plus global employees are up for the challenge. We're focused, we're hungry, and ultimately, we're going to deliver on these opportunities to accelerate our growth. And as always, we remain deeply committed to creating value for you, our shareholders. And with that, let's now move to Q&A. 
Now we're going to try to get as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to just one question. And if you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call.

And you know what, I'm going to -- for the guide, I'm going to walk you through the quarters a bit to help give you and set the context. And I'm going to start with Q2 because versus -- if you look at versus pre-pandemic levels or 2 years ago, our growth in Q2 was about 1% organically. It was a little below peers, but you got to keep in mind that our inventory levels were lower back then because that was before we made the change to bulk purchasing. 
So if you adjust for that inventory issue and a little bit of a tougher comp, our Q2 growth was in the 2% to 3% range versus pre-pandemic levels. And if you look at it sequentially, our revenue from Q1 to Q2 declined less than 2%, and that was while most of our peers saw declines of 3% to 5%. So our performance in Q2, we believe, is in line, at least in line with what we're seeing from our peers. 
And then if you look at Q3 in our guidance, we're expecting that same 2% to 3% growth as we saw in Q2 versus the pre-pandemic levels. And yes, that equates to a slight deceleration from what we saw in October. And we're encouraged by what we've seen in October and into November. But given the dynamic environment, we focus on wanting to err on the side of caution with our Q3 guide. And then for Q4, we're assuming normal sequential seasonality just because it's our fiscal year-end. So you'll see sequential improvement in Q4. So hopefully, that's helpful."

So the issue that we're doing, this is more of a limited release phase. That's where we are right now. And we're focused on optimizing the user experience. And the issues that we're managing through are some supply chain issues and some initial manufacturing issues, and those are the issues that we're working through right now.

But the actual rate of perforation that we've seen in the continued access study, the continued [indiscernible] study, which we just reported out to your results at the ESC is actually below what we showed in the preclinical work, in the pre-approval trial, and the overall complication rates for leadless pacemaking are about 30% lower at 2 years than what we see with transvenous. So there's certainly no concern here. And the customer reception has been really, really excellent and continues to be despite the letter of the FDA just emphasized. 
And on the clinical trial front for Ardian, you are right. There are differences in the clinical trials. And we remain, as Geoff said, very confident that our ON MED trial is going to make a standpoint. I think what you're referring to is the RADIANCE study that was reported on the RADIANCE TRIO study, which at 6 months, they did a full titration of drugs to get patients to their goal. So that was part of their study design was after the primary endpoint of 2 months, they've added drugs on it until blood pressure went down. And that's kind of the point of renal denervation in general, is that you can get there without as many drugs. 
And we saw something similar in the pilot study for ON MED, where we were able to forward titrate drugs after the primary endpoint and get people's blood pressure there without having to go to diuretics, which patients really hate taking. So yes, there's nothing to read through on that one. Their trial began in Japan and Korea was a little different. It was more like HTN-3, where they didn't control for medications. They had none of those types of controls. So that's more a legacy study design that didn't leverage the learnings that we got from HTN-3."

And I don't see ourselves as like a GE or a J&J that like dramatically different businesses. But it's -- I do think it's an opportunity for us over time. Sean, do you want to take the diabetes one?"

I think we're making excellent progress there. But do remember that when we launch a new product in Diabetes, and there's a training element to that, that takes some time, so it pushes the revenue outward before it starts to gain traction. What we see in the U.S. as well, we're growing pump share right now globally. We do have a lot of patients that came out of the installed base. We have to kind of rebuild that installed base to get momentum going, and that's really going to be driven by the 780 with Guardian 4 Sensor launch."

We didn't quantify that, and it got better into November. But the procedures have bounced back, but not as quickly as prior waves and not as fast as we hope. There's definitely -- it's definitely a fluid situation, and it's gotten a little bit harder, more difficult to predict, right? 
Before, it was more of an epidemiology discussion around COVID cases and the severity of them and the impact to ICU beds. Now you've got this critical staffing shortage in our -- in hospitals around the world. I mean, really particularly more so in the U.S., though, particularly this nursing shortage you hear about. And that's a little -- that's been a little bit more difficult to predict. And I think that's the thing that I'd say surprised us a bit last quarter. 
And then finally, you've got some supply chain issues, which for us have been manageable so far. But as time goes on, that gets more difficult. So we took, I think, Karen, walked you through the guidance, I think we took a conservative approach here, particularly for our Q3 guide on that. But it's difficult to quantify all these things working together here. 
The COVID cases jumping back up like you've heard about in Europe, nursing shortages in the U.S. and then global supply chain issues. I think the hospitals are doing a good job managing the headwinds they have. And I think we've done a pretty good job. Our team has done a really good job on the supply chain issues. During COVID, we were able to build up inventory on some of these critical products. But as these issues drag on, it becomes more challenging, and that's why we've taken, I think, a bit of an appropriate position given the uncertainty for our Q2 guide -- or Q3 guide rather, sorry."

And I've been spending a lot of time with our team on this as well as our hospital customers. Look, these -- the hospitals are basically investing more in staffing. I mean that is, I think, one of the biggest issues here is them are the biggest opportunities. They're just -- they're paying more money for the staffing to get -- to incent people to come back. 
And the other thing that I see the hospital is doing, where we're spending a lot of time with them is adoption on more remote capabilities and business models. I mean in our world, things like managing your cardiac rhythm patients using remote technologies, so you don't have to come back into the hospital and get their device checks. We're doing that remotely. And I can go down the list to other of our therapies, like another one would be, and it's not in the U.S. yet, but in the NHS and U.K., they're using our PillCam. They've accelerated the use of the rollout of PillCam to do colonoscopy, diagnostic colonoscopies for their patients because they've built up a long waiting list of people who are getting colonoscopy. 
So I see hospitals, one, and it's not a sustainable situation, but short term, providing bonuses and incentives. And two, much more rapidly adopting some of, in our case, I mean, and they're working with other industry players as well to adopt things that are more remote, and they're prioritizing therapies that have less complications that result in less hospitalizations and return hospitalization. So I mean it's not an overnight solution, but they're aggressively working this. 
I mean no one likes to cancel a TAVR case because there's nobody to monitor the ICU bed or cover the care. So nobody wants to do that. And so they're moving fast on this. And like I said, we're seeing progress here even in our results into November. But it is fluid, and that's why we've taken the approach we've taken on the guide.

But yes, I think consumers have been much more engaged in health care. And this is something that's weighing into our strategy. You saw that we rebranded Medtronic here last quarter and gone to a different look in engineering in the extraordinary. That's part of a first step to us more aggressively directly reaching out to consumers and educating them about our therapies. 
I mean things like Pillcam Genius, which I just talked about, things like cryoablation as a first-line indication for AFib. They don't want to be on these regimen of drugs. And so we historically have relied on our specialist physician partners like in the case of cryoablation on AFib, it's been electrophysiologists to kind of ""build up our referral pathways in our markets."" 
Now I think given the changes in technology, the miniaturization, which leads to less invasiveness, the connectivity of our devices, the better efficacy, we're moving up in the line -- in the food chain here closer to first line, like I mentioned in AFib. And some of our businesses are already there, more of a consumer business like diabetes and pelvic health for overactive bladder. So you're going to see us more engaging consumers and directly. 
And the reason we're bullish on this is, one, like I said, the therapies have changed, less invasive, more efficacious in some cases, just a better solution clinically proven than pharma, which is the typical first-line indication. The other thing that we're seeing getting to your question is, like I said, here's a proof point on consumers more engaging. Like on our Ardian trial, we -- this trial filled up really quickly, enrolled really quickly, all through consumers opting in through our digital marketing efforts in social media efforts in the Ardian trial, consumers self-enrolled. That's a first for us. 
And so we are seeing much more engagement from consumers and their care. And through -- they're using the Internet and digital platforms to get that education, and that's changing our strategy."

But like I was just with one of our bigger customers in the South of the United States like 1.5 weeks ago, and they had a couple of -- and it was a cardiologist that had a couple of TAVR cases canceled that day. And there's a huge sense of urgency because of the nursing shortage. So they have a huge sense of urgency in correcting that issue. 
And like I said, they are prioritizing moving nurses. First of all, they're getting more aggressive with their staffing strategies to attract and retain staff. They're reallocating resources around the hospital, the health system, if you will, to get more nurses into these critical care areas. They're pushing certain cases out to ASCs. We're seeing growth in surgical centers, where they need less staff to do these cases. So we're seeing them aggressively make these, I'll call it, reallocation of resources, and we're helping them as much as we can in these areas. 
So I -- look, the -- like you said, you can't defer these cases. First of all, I don't know how -- I don't like -- I've never liked the term elective, I think it's more deferrable.

I mean, yes, COVID in this nursing -- the critical staffing shortage like highlighted by this nursing shortage in the U.S. And just spending a lot of time talking about vaccines and vaccine mandates, yes, it is a bit of a distraction, but I am very happy about our bigger picture here. 
We've -- one, what I really like is to structurally how we've made the company smaller on the front end, if you will, with these 20 operating units and the clarity that we have into the end markets and the dynamics, what the customers are really asking for, what the competitors are doing. And we've got a really good handle on our pipeline by each of these operating units. And we have gotten more aggressive in funding these businesses and holding them accountable to making the right choices and prioritizing innovation and innovating faster. 
So I feel really good about that. And my team, we spend a lot of time looking at these operating units and making these judgment calls, what is the appropriate funding? What does a good pipeline look like how should we feel about the competition. And it's not just like me sitting around talking to an operating unit leader, it's my team, different portfolio leaders, even if it's -- the business is not in their portfolio, asking tough questions because every incremental dollar funding we put in one business is one less dollar we put in another business. So the rigor around this and the constructive debate and the diversity of thought coming from the different people, it's leading to better decisions and the energy route inside the company and around the company is palpable. 
I mean we're getting -- our employee scores remain high despite all the burnout and everything and is affecting employees, but still we've got great scores and feedback. We're getting -- attracting talent like never before. We've had a 50% spike in our -- and people applying for jobs at Medtronic. The market share situation is going well. 
And so look, we've got a lot to do here. We've got some big drivers that we've got to show. We've got to bring this robot program and ramp this. Already in -- we've got to get that data back and ramp that. We've got the diabetes turnaround. We're seeing -- we can see it. You can just see it off in the horizon. You can see the products doing so well in Europe and other parts of the world. We've got to get that in the United States. 
But we're making this progress. And that's why I feel good. And culturally, you're seeing a level of competitiveness and accountability. So like this quarter, revenue didn't come in where we wanted, but we still had an operational beat on EPS and we're holding EPS guidance for the rest of the year. That's the kind of company that we want to be. Disappointed about the miss on revenue. There's some environmental factors. But quite honestly, I was hoping that we could overcome all of those. We weren't quite able to this quarter, but just so you get some color commentary on how we think about it, that's how we're thinking about it. And we're going to -- I know we're doing the right things. 
We're going to stay the course. We're going to keep making these investments, keep holding ourselves accountable to being like the undisputed technology leader and growing above the market. That's where we want to go. And so optimistic about where we're going in that direction.

And that is despite the challenges that we've had from COVID, our R&D investment is not coming down. And we said at the beginning of the year, we were increasing that 10%, and we still fully intend to do that. 
So we're offsetting our headwinds in a different way when it comes to delivering the bottom line. Also, on gross margin, yes, our gross margin was better than expected. We're really pleased with that. We're -- we've got a very concerted effort to improve our operations and to lead to better gross margin. 
We're focused on getting our gross margin back to pre-COVID levels. And from there, at least sustaining it and hopefully improving it. And if you look at just the year-over-year, we're still focused on that 2.5 to 3 points of improvement in gross margin this fiscal year. And when I think about longer term, I would just say to you that nothing has changed from our focus on delivering that 5%-plus revenue growth and that 8%-plus bottom line growth. And I would say that includes next fiscal year in FY '23, even given some of these headwinds that we've talked about today."
