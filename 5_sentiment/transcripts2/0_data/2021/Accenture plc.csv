Today, we are proud to announce outstanding financial results for the second quarter of fiscal '21 and our return to pre-COVID level financial results a quarter earlier than we expected and with",492,"Thank you, Angie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. 
Today, we are proud to announce outstanding financial results for the second quarter of fiscal '21 and our return to pre-COVID level financial results a quarter earlier than we expected and with a tough compare. 
Let's first go back 12 months ago, on March 19, only 8 days after the pandemic was declared, when we were all together to announce our outstanding fiscal year '20 Q2 financial results. Results you may not remember, because at the time, we were all focused on the go-forward potential impact of the pandemic. 
In Q2 of fiscal year '20, we had 8% revenue growth in local currency, our then highest bookings ever of $14.2 billion, and strong underlying profitability and free cash flow. We also announced that 18 clients that quarter had bookings over $100 million. 
With this backdrop of fiscal year '20 Q2, the significance of this Q2's results in fiscal year '21 becomes even more clear. We have delivered 5.4% revenue growth in local currency, which includes a reduction of 2 percentage points from a decline in revenue from reimbursable travel costs. Meaning, apples-to-apples, 5.4% is in the zone of fiscal year '20 Q2 revenue when you exclude the travel costs related revenue. 
We have delivered bookings of $16 billion, beating our previous record set in Q2 last year by $1.8 billion. And we have delivered strong profitability and free cash flow. This quarter, 18 clients had bookings over $100 million and we continued to take market share faster than pre-COVID. In H1, we have accelerated our investment in B&A, with approximately $1.1 billion of capital deployed. And we are increasing our programmatic D&A investment to at least $2 billion for FY '21, from the $1.7 billion we previously communicated. 
And for the last 12 months, we have remained consistent. We gave guidance every quarter, which we met or beat. We deliberately invested in our people and preserved our talent to continue to serve our clients as demand came back. And we continued to significantly invest in our business and our communities. And throughout, we have lived our core values, including maintaining without pause our commitment to make more progress on diversity and inclusion and sustainability. 
These financial results reflect these choices, the strength of our core values and the power of our laser focus on creating client value and being a trusted partner, as well as our incredibly talented people, strong ecosystem relationships, and the resilience of our growth strategy as well as the substantial investments we have made, year in and year out, since we set out to be the leader in digital cloud and security and continuous innovation. They also reflect the operational rigor and discipline that long has been a hallmark of our success. 
I want to thank our people for their hard work and continued dedication to our clients and for delivering on our commitments. 
KC, over to you."

We were very pleased with our overall results in the second quarter, which exceeded our expectations and reflects strong momentum across our business. We are part",1111,"Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. 
We were very pleased with our overall results in the second quarter, which exceeded our expectations and reflects strong momentum across our business. We are particularly pleased with our record new bookings and strong revenue growth, which demonstrates our leading position in the market as a trusted partner to deliver value for our clients. 
Based on the strength of our second quarter results and the confidence in the second half of the fiscal year, we are increasing all elements of our full year outlook, which I will cover in more detail later in our call. 
Now let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter. 
Revenues grew 5.4% in local currency and continued to include a reduction of approximately 2 percentage points from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Q2 revenues were nearly $140 million above our guided range, driven by broad-based over-delivery across all dimensions: markets, services and industries, as our business built back even faster than anticipated. We also continued to extend our leadership position, with growth significantly above the market. We saw a broad improvement in industry trends. Approximately 50% of our revenues came from 7 industries that were less impacted by the pandemic, which, in aggregate, accelerated this quarter to low double-digit growth. At the same time, we saw continued improvement from clients in highly impacted industries, which collectively represents over 20% of our revenues and declined mid-single digits. 
Operating margin was 13.7%, an increase of 30 basis points for the quarter and 40 basis points year-to-date, reflecting strong underlying profitability, as we continued to invest in our business and our people, including the onetime bonus we just announced. We continued to benefit from lower spend on travel, meetings and events. And we delivered very strong EPS of $2.03, up 10% over fiscal '20, after adjusting both years for gains on an investment. And finally, we generated significant free cash flow of $2.4 billion in the quarter and $4 billion year-to-date. 
We continue to execute on our strategic capital allocation objective, with roughly $3.1 billion returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases year-to-date. 
We've made investments of $1.1 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 19 transactions in the first half of the year. And we expect to invest at least $2 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. 
With that, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. 
New bookings were a record at $16 billion, representing a 13 billion -- a 13% growth in U.S. dollar over previous record in Q2 of last year. We had very strong overall book-to-bill of 1.3 in the quarter and 1.2 year-to-date. Consulting bookings were $8 billion, a record high, with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Outsourcing bookings were also a record at $8 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.4. 
Similar to last quarter, our bookings were driven by both technology services and operations. We were pleased with the strength of our bookings in strategy and consulting, with a book-to-bill of 1.2. 
Turning now to revenues. 
Revenues for the quarter were $12.1 billion, an 8% increase in U.S. dollars and 5.4% in local currency, including a reduction of approximately 2% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $6.4 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 1% local currency, including a reduction of approximately 3% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Outsourcing revenues were $5.6 billion, up 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. 
Taking a closer look at our service dimensions. Both operations and technology services grew double-digits. As expected, strategy and consulting services declined high single-digits. And we expect strategy and consulting to return to growth in Q3. 
Turning to our geographic markets. The industry dynamics that I mentioned earlier continued to play out in a similar manner across all 3 markets. 
In North America, revenue growth was 7% in local currency. In Europe, revenues grew 3% in local currency, driven by mid-single-digit growth in Italy and the U.K. In growth markets, we delivered 6% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Japan. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.7% compared with 30.2% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.4% compared with 10.4% for the second quarter last year. General and administrative expenses was 7.6% compared to 6 point -- excuse me, 6.6% compared to 6.4% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $1.7 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin, up 30 basis points compared with Q2 last year. 
Before I continue, as a reminder, in Q2 last year, we recognized an investment gain, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.07. This quarter, we again recognized an investment gain, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.21. 
The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.5% compared with the adjusted effective tax rate of 17.1% for the second quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.03 compared with an adjusted EPS of $1.84 in the second quarter last year. This reflects a 10% year-over-year increase. Days service outstanding were 34 days compared to 38 days last quarter and 39 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.4 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.5 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $93 million. Our cash balance at February 28 was $9.2 billion compared with $8.4 billion at August 31. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.6 million shares for $1.2 billion at an average price of $255.29 per share. As of February 28, we had approximately $5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share for a total of $561 million. This represented a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share, to be paid on May 14, a 10% increase over last year. 
So at the halfway point of fiscal '21, we feel really good about our results to date and our positioning for the remainder of the year, realizing that the pace of recovery is hard to accurately predict. 
Now let me turn it back to Julie."

We continued to see compressed transformation, where companies have to simultaneously transform multiple parts of their enterprise and reskill their people in what previously would have been sequential p",1653,"Thank you, KC. 
Let me start with the environment. We continued to see compressed transformation, where companies have to simultaneously transform multiple parts of their enterprise and reskill their people in what previously would have been sequential programs. They're doing so to replatform their businesses in the cloud, address cost pressures, build resilience and security, adjust their operations and customer experiences, and find new sources of growth. 
COVID has hit a giant fast forward button to the future. And we believe the demand to innovate at unprecedented speed and scale with rapid adoption of cloud, AI and other disruptive technologies is accelerating. 
For digital leaders, we see them no longer strictly competing for market share, but to build their vision of the future faster than the competition. And for digital laggards, they are determined to not simply catch up, but to leapfrog. 
While COVID has accelerated the demand, the reality is that the extent of transformation ahead is enormous. The move from approximately 20% to 80% in the cloud alone is a huge undertaking. And it is just the start, as companies will then continue to invest to grow and innovate on their new cloud foundations, which leads me to the role we are playing. 
In Q2, our engines of growth across Accenture have lowered to the [ life ] to meet these needs of our clients, and we see strong momentum going into Q3. I will share some color and examples. 
We called the once in a digital era replatforming of businesses into the cloud in September 2020, when we created Accenture Cloud First to bring industry cloud and state-of-the-art change management and transformation together. We saw this quarter's strong double-digit growth in cloud overall as well as the subset of Accenture Cloud First, which growth was even higher. Intelligent platform services, which is essential to building the digital core of our clients, is back to high single-digit growth as companies resume this critical aspect of their transformation. Applied intelligence, with our data and AI solutions, and security, both sizable, but still in the early stages of the scale we expect long-term, both had strong double-digit growth in Q2. Operations grew double-digits as companies seek to digitize their enterprises, leveraging our deep industry and functional expertise in AI-driven SynOps platform. Interactive improved and grew high single-digits, as companies continue to shift to digital channels need cost efficiencies around sales and marketing to invest in new capabilities, seek more data-driven marketing campaigns, and compete for customers and employees on the experience they provide. 
Industry X, which is helping diversify our sources of revenue in the enterprise, grew strong double-digits, driven by the need for product and engineers to accelerate the time to market of smarter and more sustainable products, and the need to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of manufacturing facilities, and the ability to interconnect machines and operate remotely. 
These engines of growth are multi-service, bringing the best of Accenture's strategy in consulting, interactive technology and operation services together to create value. We are distinctive because no other competitor has our scale and breadth of services which allows us to seamlessly serve the different dimensions of compressed transformations. We also are able to give our clients speed and cost levers through our managed services to digitize using our assets and platforms and address cost pressures. 
Furthermore, our distinctive capabilities in industry, innovation and investment are clear differentiators. Our strong strategy and consulting practitioners bring deep industry expertise to all functions of the enterprise and help bring together our services to deliver to our clients, often informed by cross-industry insights, such as for payments and omnichannel engagement. 
Our ability and commitment to consistently invest in acquisitions, R&D and our people is unmatched in our industry. And our clients know that through our investment and focus on innovation, we will help future-proof them, such as our innovation in emerging technologies, like the Work Accenture Labs is doing, testing applications using neuromorphic computing, where circuits are modeled after systems in the human brain and nervous system to deliver new AI capabilities, and our 360-degree value strategy, which seeks to bring talent upskilling, diversity and inclusion, and sustainability to our work, is resonating with our clients as they seek to make progress as they transform. 
2 great examples of compressed transformation, strong leaders and our 360-degree value strategy are AIG and Shiseido. We are partnering with AIG, a leading global insurance organization, to help them drive their AIG 200 Program, which is designed to achieve underwriting excellence, modernize their operating infrastructure, enhance user and customer experience, and become a more unified company. This quarter, we acquired AIG's Shared Services operations, which we will transform to serve AIG to create a modern digital shared services platform with end-to-end processes that will improve the user experience using our SynOps platform. And consistent with our 360-degree value strategy, we are investing in upskilling our new employees. 
We have entered into a strategic partnership with Shiseido, a leading global beauty company headquartered in Japan. Shiseido has launched a fundamental business transformation aiming to become a global leader in premium skin beauty by 2030 under its new medium to long-term strategy, Win 2023 and Beyond. We are partnering with Shiseido to accelerate digital transformation and create personalized and seamless customer experiences, design, develop and implement a cloud-based system that will help it adopt processes that enable continuous financial reporting that are forecasting accuracy and more precise inventory management. We are helping them use AI, analytics and automation to create new business value and helping their employees gain high level digital skills. 
We are working with Spec Savers, the U.K. base leader in optometry, audiology and other health care services, to reimagine and transform their entire IT organization through our living systems approach. We are leveraging new ways of working in agile foundations to capture efficiencies and reduce costs, while positioning the company for growth and diversification to drive business resilient. 
With our managed security services, we are helping a central bank in Asia to strengthen their resilience against cyber threats and builds in the flexibility to securely grow their payment transactions from millions to billions at speed and scale. 
Our Industry X team is helping Formula One relaunch its F1 TV Grand Prix racing product. By using the cloud-based Accenture video solution, live streams from 20 trackside and onboard cameras and a growing range of connected devices, we are continuously innovating to embed intelligence in their platform to deliver the best possible viewer experience. 
Now let me turn to Accenture's greatest and undeniable competitive advantage, our nearly 537,000 people. They are at the heart of our outstanding results. 
Fundamental to our core values is to care deeply for our people, and we place significant importance on providing a meaningful employee experience. For almost every person around the world, living and working during the pandemic has been challenging. To help our people succeed both professionally and personally during this time, we have put in place many programs. For example, we are partnering with Bright Horizons in the U.S. through development of an innovative program for school aged children to receive proctoring for their virtual studies and homework. We have extended telemedicine to parents of our employees in India. And we are providing industry-leading mental wellness programs, including Thriving Mind, a holistic well-being program that teaches us about the science behind stress and how to recharge your brain's battery. We are proud that more than 160,000 of our people have completed the program with impressive results, including nearly 9 out of 10 participants reported feeling significantly better able to handle challenges in the workplace. 
Equally important is our focus on vibrant career paths. We have maintained pay increases, bonuses and promotions, both in our normal December time period as well as an added round of promotions in February, enabling us to promote in total at the same level as the prior year. Additionally, we will expand our regular midyear promotions this coming June to include managing directors, a first in our company's history, as one more way, we continue to create new opportunities for our people. 
And today, we are announcing a special onetime bonus for all of our people below managing director to recognize the contributions and dedication to our clients during this difficult year. 
Continuous learning also is a defining feature of Accenture. We continued to invest in our people and their market-leading skills, with a 28% increase in training hours and 25% increase in hours per person just this quarter. 
And coming back to our ability to attract talent. We know that people want to work for companies that not only create value, but also lead with values. We are proud this quarter to have been named for the 14th consecutive year on Ethisphere's World Plus Ethical Companies list and for the 19th consecutive year on Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies. 
Our strategic decision to preserve our talent last year, including our recorders -- recruiters, provided a strong base to meet the surge in demand we have experienced. Recruiting, hiring and managing supply and demand has always been a core competency. And we are confident in our ability to attract talent and continue to meet the increased demand. We increased hiring approximately 50% both year-over-year and since last quarter. And we've onboarded over 100,000 people virtually over the last 12 months, with new innovative approaches. 
I would like to recognize the extraordinary leadership and efforts of our Chief Leadership and Human Resources Officer, Ellen Schuck, and her out standing team around the globe for how they have helped care for our people throughout the pandemic, guided us through health and safety of COVID, are ensuring that we are continuously reskilling our people, and have helped us manage and realize the incredible expansion of our talent to meet the needs of our clients. 
Over to you, KC, for a look ahead."

Let me now turn to our business outlook. 
For the third quarter of fiscal '21, we expect revenues to be in the range of $12.55 billion to $12.95 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about positive 4.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal '20 and reflects an estimated 10% to 13% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '21, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately positive 3% compared to fiscal '20. 
For the full fiscal '21, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% growth in local currency over fiscal '20, including approximately negative 1% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel, based on a 2% reduction in the first half of the year and no material impact in the second half of the year. 
For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '21 to be 15% to 15.1%, a 30 to 40 basis point expansion of our fiscal '20 results. We continue to expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal '20. 
For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '21 to be in the range of $8.67 to $8.85. We now expect adjusted full year diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.32 to $8.50 or 12% to 14% growth over adjusted fiscal '20 results. 
For the full fiscal '21, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $7.65 billion to $8.15 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to adjusted net income ratio of 1.3 to 1.4. 
Finally, we now expect to return at least $5.8 billion, an increase of $500 million, through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

I was thinking the last time you guys raised your margin outlook, especially against such strong bookings and investments like Cloud First, you talked about.

So what's different this time to allow you to do that, to raise margins modestly against some good momentum here? And I'll ask my follow-up just together with this, which is, given the big bookings, thinking about contract execution, do you feel good about sort of the level of expectations you need to deliver here to keep this momentum going? Because I know you put a lot of hard work into driving up the bookings here, but I'm curious if there's anything different to consider here with contract execution looking ahead."

So in terms of operating margin, let me just cover with you what's the driver this year of our 30 to 40 basis points operating margin expansion. And you're right. It is unusual for us to expand our operating margin halfway through",413,"Okay. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. So in terms of operating margin, let me just cover with you what's the driver this year of our 30 to 40 basis points operating margin expansion. And you're right. It is unusual for us to expand our operating margin halfway through the year. And so implied in our guidance for the year, there's obviously continued healthy margin expansion in the back half. That's in addition, Tien-Tsin, to the 40 basis points that we've already done year-to-date. And then as I mentioned, which does include the impact of the onetime bonus that we're doing for employees below managing director. 
And I'll just maybe highlight a few things in terms of drivers for the expansion this year. I mean, as always, we first look to strong revenue growth. So -- and we have that again this year. And that's coming along with increased contract profitability. We do have increased contract profitability coming through in our gross margin in the first half of the year. And that's really the first lever that we always look at. 
Within this year uniquely is -- are a couple of things. One is utilization. So we are getting some additional margin expansion this year based on our higher utilization rate. We talked about that last quarter, that we're looking to bring that down to more normal levels. It did go up this quarter, and we're still working on that. But clearly, in the first half of the year and into the second half, there will be some benefit to operating margin expansion on that. 
And the second part is due to the lower travel events and meetings spend this year. So we are going to benefit from that overall for the full year. But that benefit really is in the first half of the year. As the baseline last year in the back half is, as you know, we really didn't travel or have meetings, so it's not a benefit that we'll have in the back half of the year. 
And so I think, overall, the key thing though in operating margin is that we always look to drive strong underlying profitability because we want to ensure that we're investing first in our business because we want to drive long-term shareholder value. And so that's really the critical part that we're able to continue to invest in our business and in our people and in acquisitions, but while at the same time expanding operating margin significantly."

And Tien-Tsin, why don't I take the -- I'll take the question about execution. We're very confident about our ability to execute. And let me just remind you that one of the things that's really benefiting us is just our absolute excellent performance when the pandemic started, and we had to move all of our people from our centers, while our clients were having to move remotely. As you'll recall, I shared that we closed the books for 70 public companies, and we did so without missing a beat. That we, on average, pre-pandemic, have a new release every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day, on the technology, say, 7 days a week, and we have continued with that execution.

Great question. 
One of the things that we look back on internally as a leadership team was that we actually were very bold in our ambition in my first year as CEO to actually put that new model in place only 6 months into the fiscal year and change our P&L in the middle of the fiscal year. And we look back and use it as a lesson as to speed matters because as you think about our execution during the last 12 months, we did so with a new leadership team and a new way of working. And what it really demonstrated was we made the right strategic move. Driving the move from industry to geography were a few things. And remember, what we did was we also put digital everywhere. So we simplified because digital is now the core of our business. But the first thing is what we call the Client Proximity Imperative. We had such scale in all of our markets. We wanted to put our leaders really closer to our clients, while at the same time really enhancing the ability to move innovation around the world. And we did that by massively simplifying. And so we -- at the one hand, where -- we made a geographic P&L. But on the other hand, we made critical changes to actually make it easier to move innovation around the world. 
And secondly, we felt as if the ability to simplify and then have teams come together across our services would really unlock value. And of course, you did that before we had COVID, but we've seen the acceleration of the need for that because our clients are really looking for ability to bring outcomes. And so just think about the work that we are doing right now. Like I take BBVA, which you may know, it's a customer-centric global financial services company headquartered in Spain. And we have worked with them to move -- they wanted to increase their digital sales. And that brings together operation, all of our interactive capabilities, like paid media, search engine optimization, analytics and marketing operation, plus our deep industry experience. And with our support over the last 12 months, they've grown their digital sales more than 50% and they saw an increase in digital customers by more than 50%. The ability to bring those services together seamlessly to deliver those outcomes has really been enabled by that growth model that both simplified, recognize that the core of our business is now digital cloud and security, and enable us to really meet the needs of the client globally. 
In terms of growth markets, there's really nothing different there. I mean the geographic model helps us both focus on the opportunity in each of the markets, while at the same time, really connecting the innovation and being able to serve global clients better."

So maybe let's start with context overall and what we're seeing in the overall market and the business environment. So as we've been saying and we continue to see that the business environment does remain competitive. And in some areas, we experienced pricing pressure, but we are seeing signs of stability, right? So that's probably the first key point. 
In terms of the pricing that we have across our different markets or services, as you know, the pricing can vary depending on what it is that we're selling and in what markets that we're doing that commercial arrangement. But what is important, what stays the same is that we always look to make sure that we are doing a smart commercial arrangement that benefits both our clients and Accenture. And that's a key part of our 360-degree value. But as it relates to what we're actually delivering in terms of profitability, I do want to highlight that within our operating margin and within gross margin, we haven't expanded the delivery of client profitability and contract profitability.

But let me just -- so instead of trying to look ahead to next year and thinking about it, let's maybe just focus on how we are looking at our business right now. So if you think about the last 6 years when we started digital, we rotated our business so that now the core of our business is digital, cloud, security, and all of our services, meaning not just -- that's not from a technical perspective. And so think about what we have built are engines of growth as the core of our business, which is what we went through when you think about cloud, Industry X, applied intelligence, operation, the things we went through on our script today. And so we have these engines of growth which we continue to invest in. And I think what's really important in the way we think about our business is we're -- for example, cloud, we already scaled. We told you last quarter, it was $12 million in FY '20, but it's growing double-digits because we're at the very early stages of it. And when you think about Accenture Cloud First, we brought together, right, all of our services, from strategy and consulting, to experience, to cloud, industry experience, because not only are companies having to migrate to the cloud, but they need to create value, like we're working with an American entertainment company, where we're helping them use -- leverage the cloud to accelerate the time to market of new video services, right? So it's not about the migration. It's about the value. 
And so think about our business as having built these engines of growth, some of which already have massive scale and are continuing. And then others, like Industry X, Industry X is a way that we're going to continue to diversify our revenue sources for resilience over the long term. We made 2 acquisitions this quarter, assault Solutions and Mortal Consulting Group, to help build our manufacturing and supply chain. We're going to continue to invest there. We think about that as the next interactive, right, in terms of building this new area. And we're at this amazing tipping point right now where we're seeing an acceleration of digitization in manufacturing and in product engineering. And so we continue to think about how do we both make sure these growth engines is going, but never have to have another rotation because we're always investing. 
And I mean, the last point I would just say is our capacity to invest in acquisitions has been a huge differentiator in building the business we have today, as being the core of our business is now these engines of growth. And we continue to execute on that in all of our major strategic areas and the next scale plays. And I'd call out the 2 we made this quarter in cloud, for example, Infinity Works and even house."

And this really is a big driver of how well we're doing now because in this -- when you have compressed transformation where the companies need to do so much at the same time, there's a really sharp focus on, what do I need to do? How do I source the talent? Right? And that conversation has absolutely gone faster. But also, how can I digitize every part of the organization? And what Accenture has, which is very unique, is this investment we've been making for years in the SynOps platform, for example, in operations, and in technology, things like My Wizard and My Concerto, which builds in best-of-class AI, machine learning, rapid testing. And these are platforms that we continuously invest in. 
And so when you -- happening is here is that we're helping them digitize. We're helping them focus on, what do they really need to have in-house versus can leverage in order to go faster. 
But one thing I want to be really, really clear about is, although our strategy and consulting business continued to have a high single-digit decline, it was better than we expected, strategy and consulting is absolutely essential to all of these results, including outsourcing. Because what we are bringing to them, right? It's not simply always at a lower cost. It's increase is in sales through our marketing operations, like the BBVA example I gave, right? It's manufacturing. At AIG, which I talked about, it's insurance, right, as well as deep process skills. It is helping them transform the ways they're working by being integrated with us where we're bringing modern ways of working and digital. 
And so this is what distinguishes us as a company for our clients. It's not  -- you for guys, it's type of work, outsourcing versus consulting, which is basically managed services, it's project work. For our clients, it's our ability to bring all these services together, which is why I emphasize that each of the examples I gave in my script, and I gave you many more, really are polling all of these things together for an outcome.

Today, we are proud to announce outstanding financial results for the second quarter of fiscal '21 and our return to pre-COVID level financial results a quarter earlier than we expected and with a tough compare.  
Let's first go back 12 months ago. On March 19, only 8 days after the pandemic was declared, when we were all together to announce our outstanding fiscal year '20 Q2 financial results, results you may not remember because, at the time, we were all focused on the go-forward potential impact of the pandemic. In Q2 of fiscal year '20, we had 8% revenue growth in local currency, our then highest bookings ever of $14.2 billion and strong underlying profitability and free cash flow. We also announced that 18 clients that quarter had bookings over $100 million.  
With this backdrop of fiscal year '20 Q2, the significance of this Q2's results in fiscal year '21 becomes even more clear. We have delivered 5.4% revenue growth in local currency, which includes a reduction of 2 percentage points from a decline in revenue from reimbursable travel costs; meaning apples to apples, 5.4% is in the zone of fiscal year '20 Q2 revenue when you exclude the travel costs-related revenue. We have delivered bookings of $16 billion, beating our previous record set in Q2 last year by $1.8 billion, and we have delivered strong profitability and free cash flow. This quarter, 18 clients had bookings over $100 million, and we continued to take market share faster than pre COVID. 
In H1, we have accelerated our investment in V&A with approximately $1.1 billion of capital deployed, and we are increasing our programmatic V&A investment to at least $2 billion for FY '21 from the $1.7 billion we previously communicated. And for the last 12 months, we have remained consistent. We gave guidance every quarter which we met or beat. We deliberately invested in our people and preserved our talent to continue to serve our clients as demand came back, and we continued to significantly invest in our business and our communities. And throughout, we have lived our core values, including maintaining without pause our commitment to make more progress on diversity and inclusion and sustainability.  
These financial results reflect these choices, the strength of our core values and the power of our laser-focus on creating client value and being a trusted partner as well as our incredibly talented people, strong ecosystem relationships and the resilience of our growth strategy as well as the substantial investments we have made year in and year out since we set out to be the leader in digital, cloud and security and continuous innovation. They also reflect the operational rigor and discipline that long has been a hallmark of our success. I want to thank our people for their hard work and continued dedication to our clients and for delivering on our commitments.  
KC, over to you."
972190,706143483,2239525,"Accenture plc, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 18, 2021",2021-03-18,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our overall results in the second quarter, which exceeded our expectations and reflects strong momentum across our business. We are partic",1113,"Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our overall results in the second quarter, which exceeded our expectations and reflects strong momentum across our business. We are particularly pleased with our record new bookings and strong revenue growth, which demonstrate our leading position in the market as a trusted partner to deliver value for our clients. Based on the strength of our second quarter results and the confidence in the second half of the fiscal year, we are increasing all elements of our full year outlook, which I will cover in more detail later in our call.  
Now let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 5.4% in local currency and continued to include a reduction of approximately 2 percentage points from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Q2 revenues were nearly $140 million above our guided range, driven by broad-based over-delivery across all dimensions, markets, services and industries, as our business built back even faster than anticipated. 
We also continued to extend our leadership position with growth significantly above the market. We saw broad improvement in industry trends. Approximately 50% of our revenues came from 7 industries that were less impacted by the pandemic, which, in aggregate, accelerated this quarter to low double-digit growth. At the same time, we saw continued improvement from clients in highly impacted industries, which collectively represents over 20% of our revenues and declined mid-single digits.  
Operating margin was 13.7%, an increase of 30 basis points for the quarter and 40 basis points year-to-date, reflecting strong underlying profitability as we continued to invest in our business and our people, including the onetime bonus we just announced. We continued to benefit from lower spend on travels, meetings and events. And we delivered very strong EPS of $2.03, up 10% over fiscal '20, after adjusting both years for gains on an investment. And finally, we generated significant free cash flow of $2.4 billion in the quarter and $4 billion year-to-date.  
We continue to execute on our strategic capital allocation objective, with roughly $3.1 billion returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases year-to-date. We've made investments of $1.1 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 19 transactions in the first half of the year, and we expect to invest at least $2 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year.  
With that, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were a record at $16 billion, representing a 13 billion -- a 13% growth in U.S. dollar over previous record in Q2 of last year. We had very strong overall book-to-bill of 1.3 in the quarter and 1.2 year-to-date. 
Consulting bookings were $8 billion, a record high, with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Outsourcing bookings were also a record at $8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.4. Similar to last quarter, our bookings were driven by both technology services and operations. We were pleased with the strength of our bookings in strategy and consulting with a book-to-bill of 1.2.  
Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $12.1 billion, an 8% increase in U.S. dollars and 5.4% in local currency, including a reduction of approximately 2% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $6.4 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 1% in local currency, including a reduction of approximately 3% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Outsourcing revenues were $5.6 billion, up 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency.  
Taking a closer look at our service dimensions. Both operations and technology services grew double digits. As expected, strategy and consulting services declined high single digits, and we expect strategy and consulting to return to growth in Q3.  
Turning to our geographic markets. The industry dynamics that I mentioned earlier continued to play out in a similar manner across all 3 markets. In North America, revenue growth was 7% in local currency. In Europe, revenues grew 3% in local currency, driven by mid-single-digit growth in Italy and the U.K. In growth markets, we delivered 6% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Japan.  
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.7% compared with 30.2% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.4% compared with 10.4% for the second quarter last year. General and administrative expenses was 7.6% compared to 6 point -- excuse me, 6.6% compared to 6.4% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $1.7 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin, up 30 basis points compared with Q2 last year.  
Before I continue, as a reminder, in Q2 last year, we recognized an investment gain, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.07. This quarter, we again recognized an investment gain, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.21. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.5% compared with the adjusted effective tax rate of 17.1% for the second quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.03 compared with an adjusted EPS of $1.84 in the second quarter last year. This reflects a 10% year-over-year increase. 
Days service outstanding were 34 days compared to 38 days last quarter and 39 days in the second quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.4 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.5 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $93 million. Our cash balance at February 28 was $9.2 billion compared with $8.4 billion at August 31.  
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.6 million shares for $1.2 billion at an average price of $255.29 per share. As of February 28, we had approximately $5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share for a total of $561 million. This represented a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share to be paid on May 14, a 10% increase over last year.  
So at the halfway point of fiscal '21, we feel really good about our results to date and our positioning for the remainder of the year, realizing that the pace of recovery is hard to accurately predict. Now let me turn it back to Julie."

Let me start with the environment. We continued to see compressed transformation, where companies have to simultaneously transform multiple parts of their enterprise and reskill their people in what previously would have been sequential programs. They're doing so to replatform their businesses in the cloud, address cost pressures, build resilience and security, adjust their operations and customer experiences and find new sources of growth.  
COVID has hit a giant fast-forward button to the future, and we believe the demand to innovate at unprecedented speed and scale with rapid adoption of cloud, AI and other disruptive technologies is accelerating. For digital leaders, we see them no longer strictly competing for market share but to build their vision of the future faster than the competition. And for digital laggards, they are determined to not simply catch up but to leapfrog.  
While COVID has accelerated the demand, the reality is that the extent of transformation ahead is enormous. The move from approximately 20% to 80% in the cloud alone is a huge undertaking. And it is just the start as companies will then continue to invest to grow and innovate on their new cloud foundations, which leads me to the role we are playing.  
In Q2, our engines of growth across Accenture have roared to life to meet these needs of our clients, and we see strong momentum going into Q3. I will share some color and examples.  
We called the ""once in a digital era"" replatforming of businesses into the cloud in September 2020, when we created Accenture Cloud First to bring industry, cloud and state-of-the-art change management and transformation together. We saw this quarter's strong double-digit growth in cloud overall as well as the subset of Accenture Cloud First which growth was even higher. Intelligent platform services, which is essential to building the digital core of our clients, is back to high single-digit growth as companies resume this critical aspect of their transformation. 
Applied intelligence with our data and AI solutions and security, both sizable but still in the early stages of the scale we expect long term, both had strong double-digit growth in Q2. Operations grew double-digits as companies seek to digitize their enterprises, leveraging our deep industry and functional expertise in AI-driven SynOps platform. Interactive improved and grew high single digits, as companies continue to shift to digital channels, meet cost efficiencies around sales and marketing to invest in new capabilities, seek more data-driven marketing campaigns and compete for customers and employees on the experience they provide. Industry X, which is helping diversify our sources of revenue in the enterprise, grew strong double digits, driven by the need for product engineers to accelerate the time to market of smarter and more sustainable products and the need to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of manufacturing facilities and the ability to interconnect machines and operate remotely. 
These engines of growth are multiservice, bringing the best of Accenture's strategy in consulting, interactive technology and operation services together to create value. We are distinctive because no other competitor has our scale and breadth of services which allows us to seamlessly serve the different dimensions of compressed transformations. We also are able to give our clients speed and cost levers through our managed services to digitize using our assets and platforms and address cost pressures. Furthermore, our distinctive capabilities in industry, innovation and investment are clear differentiators. Our strong strategy and consulting practitioners bring deep industry expertise to all functions of the enterprise and help bring together our services to deliver to our clients, often informed by cross-industry insights such as for payments and omnichannel engagement.  
Our ability and commitment to consistently invest in acquisitions, R&D and our people is unmatched in our industry. And our clients know that through our investments and focus on innovation, we will help future-proof them, such as our innovation in emerging technologies like the work Accenture Labs is doing, testing applications using neuromorphic computing, where circuits are modeled after systems in the human brain and nervous system to deliver new AI capabilities. And our 360-degree value strategy, which seeks to bring talent upskilling, diversity and inclusion and sustainability to our work, is resonating with our clients as they seek to make progress as they transform.  
Two great examples of compressed transformation, strong leaders and our 360-degree value strategy are AIG and Shiseido. We are partnering with AIG, a leading global insurance organization, to help them drive their AIG 200 program, which is designed to achieve underwriting excellence, modernize their operating infrastructure, enhance user and customer experience and become a more unified company. This quarter, we acquired AIG's shared services operations, which we will transform to serve AIG to create a modern digital shared services platform with end-to-end processes that will improve the user experience using our SynOps platform. And consistent with our 360-degree value strategy, we are investing in upskilling our new employees.  
We have entered into a strategic partnership with Shiseido, a leading global beauty company headquartered in Japan. Shiseido has launched a fundamental business transformation aiming to become a global leader in premium skin beauty by 2030 under its new medium- to long-term strategy WIN 2023 and Beyond. We are partnering with Shiseido to accelerate digital transformation and create personalized and seamless customer experiences; design, develop and implement a cloud-based system that will help it adopt processes that enable continuous financial reporting, better forecasting accuracy and more precise inventory management. We are helping them use AI, analytics and automation to create new business value and helping their employees gain high-level digital skills.
We are working with Specsavers, the U.K.-based leader in optometry, audiology and other health care services, to reimagine and transform their entire IT organization through our Living Systems approach. We are leveraging new ways of working and agile foundations to capture efficiencies and reduce costs while positioning the company for growth and diversification to drive business resilience. With our managed security services, we are helping a central bank in Asia strengthen their resilience against cyber threats and build in the flexibility to securely grow their payment transactions from millions to billions at speed and scale.  
Our Industry X team is helping Formula 1 relaunch its F1 TV Grand Prix Racing product by using the cloud-based Accenture video solution, live streams from 20 trackside and onboard cameras and a growing range of connected devices. We are continuously innovating to embed intelligence in their platform to deliver the best possible viewer experience.  
Now let me turn to Accenture's greatest and undeniable competitive advantage, our nearly 537,000 people. They are at the heart of our outstanding results. Fundamental to our core values is to care deeply for our people, and we place significant importance on providing a meaningful employee experience. 
For almost every person around the world, living and working during the pandemic has been challenging. To help our people succeed both professionally and personally during this time, we have put in place many programs. For example, we are partnering with Bright Horizons in the U.S. through development of an innovative program for school-aged children to receive proctoring for their virtual studies and homework. We have extended telemedicine to parents of our employees in India. And we are providing industry-leading mental wellness programs, including Thriving Mind, a holistic well-being program that teaches us about the science behind stress and how to recharge your brain's battery. We are proud that more than 160,000 of our people have completed the program with impressive results, including nearly 9 out of 10 participants reported feeling significantly better able to handle challenges in the workplace.  
Equally important is our focus on vibrant career paths. We have maintained pay increases, bonuses and promotions, both in our normal December time period as well as an added round of promotions in February, enabling us to promote in total at the same level as the prior year. Additionally, we will expand our regular midyear promotions this coming June to include managing directors, a first in our company's history, as one more way we continue to create new opportunities for our people. And today, we are announcing a special onetime bonus for all of our people below managing director to recognize the contributions and dedication to our clients during this difficult year.  
Continuous learning also is a defining feature of Accenture. We continued to invest in our people and their market-leading skills with a 28% increase in training hours and 25% increase in hours per person just this quarter.  
And coming back to our ability to attract talent. We know that people want to work for companies that not only create value but also lead with values. We are proud this quarter to have been named for the 14th consecutive year on Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies list and for the 19th consecutive year on Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies.  
Our strategic decision to preserve our talent last year, including our recorders -- recruiters, provided a strong base to meet the surge in demand we have experienced. Recruiting, hiring and managing supply and demand has always been a core competency, and we are confident in our ability to attract talent and continue to meet the increased demand. We increased hiring approximately 50% both year-over-year and since last quarter, and we've onboarded over 100,000 people virtually over the last 12 months with new innovative approaches.  
I would like to recognize the extraordinary leadership and efforts of our Chief Leadership and Human Resources Officer, Ellyn Shook, and her outstanding team around the globe for how they have helped care for our people throughout the pandemic, guided us through health and safety of COVID, are ensuring that we are continuously reskilling our people and have helped us manage and realize the incredible expansion of our talent to meet the needs of our clients.  
Over to you, KC, for a look ahead."

For the third quarter of fiscal '21, we expect revenues to be in the range of $12.55 billion to $12.95 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about positive 4.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal '20 and reflects an estimated 10% to 13% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '21, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately positive 3% compared to fiscal '20. For the full fiscal '21, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% growth in local currency over fiscal '20, including approximately negative 1% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel, based on a 2% reduction in the first half of the year and no material impact in the second half of the year.  
For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '21 to be 15% to 15.1%, a 30 to 40 basis point expansion of our fiscal '20 results. We continue to expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal '20.  
For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '21 to be in the range of $8.67 to $8.85. We now expect adjusted full year diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.32 to $8.50 or 12% to 14% growth over adjusted fiscal '20 results.  
For the full fiscal '21, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $7.65 billion to $8.15 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to adjusted net income ratio of 1.3 to 1.4. Finally, we now expect to return at least $5.8 billion, an increase of $500 million, through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

So in terms of operating margin, let me just cover with you what's the driver this year of our 30 to 40 basis points operating margin expansion. And you're right, it is unusual for us to expand our operating margin halfway through",413,"Okay. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. So in terms of operating margin, let me just cover with you what's the driver this year of our 30 to 40 basis points operating margin expansion. And you're right, it is unusual for us to expand our operating margin halfway through the year. And so implied in our guidance for the year is obviously continued healthy margin expansion in the back half. That's in addition, Tien-Tsin, to the 40 basis points that we've already done year-to-date and then, as I've mentioned, which does include the impact of the onetime bonus that we're doing for employees below managing director.  
And I'll just maybe highlight a few things in terms of drivers for the expansion this year. I mean as always, we first look to strong revenue growth. So -- and we have that again this year, and that's coming along with increased contract profitability. We do have increased contract profitability coming through in our gross margin in the first half of the year, and that's really the first lever that we always look at.  
Within this year uniquely is -- are a couple of things. One is utilization. So we are getting some additional margin expansion this year based on our higher utilization rate. We talked about that last quarter, that we're looking to bring that down to more normal levels. It did go up this quarter, and we're still working on that. But clearly, in the first half of the year and into the second half, there will be some benefit to operating margin expansion on that.  
And the second part is due to the lower travel events and meetings spend this year. So we are going to benefit from that overall for the full year, but that benefit really is in the first half of the year. As the baseline last year in the back half is -- as you know, we really didn't travel or have meetings, so it's not a benefit that we'll have in the back half of the year.  
And so I think, overall, the key thing though in operating margin is that we always look to drive strong underlying profitability because we want to ensure that we're investing first in our business because we want to drive long-term shareholder value. And so that's really the critical part that we're able to continue to invest in our business and in our people and in acquisitions while, at the same time, expanding operating margin significantly."

And Tien-Tsin, why don't I take the -- I'll take the question about execution. We're very confident about our ability to execute. And let me just remind you that one of the things that's really benefiting us is just our absolute excellent performance when the pandemic started and we had to move all of our people from our centers while our clients were having to move remotely. 
As you'll recall, I shared that we closed the books for 70 public companies and we did so without missing a beat; that we, on average, pre pandemic, have a new release every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day on the technology, say, 7 days a week and we have continued with that execution. And in fact, one of the things that we believe is driving our growth is that we enhanced our standing with our clients because of how we've been able to execute while, at the same time, we helped many of them move online. 
So we feel very good. 
Our centers and our people across the globe in terms of delivery are just amazing. And I should thank them because, at the end of the day, that's what really matters for our people, and we really just have exceptional people."

One of the things that we look back on internally as a leadership team was that we actually were very bold in our ambition in my first year as CEO to actually put that new model in place only 6 months into the fiscal year and change",484,"Sure. Great question. One of the things that we look back on internally as a leadership team was that we actually were very bold in our ambition in my first year as CEO to actually put that new model in place only 6 months into the fiscal year and change our P&L in the middle of the fiscal year. And we look back and often use it as a lesson as to speed matters because, as you think about our execution during the last 12 months, we did so with a new leadership team and a new way of working. And what it really demonstrated was we made the right strategic move. 
Driving the move from industry to geography were a few things. And remember, what we did was we also put digital everywhere, so we simplified because digital is now the core of our business. But the first thing is what we call the client proximity imperative. We had such scale in all of our markets. We wanted to put our leaders really closer to our clients while, at the same time, really enhancing the ability to move innovation around the world. And we did that by massively simplifying. And so we -- at the one hand, we're -- we made a geographic P&L.. But on the other hand, we made critical changes to actually make it easier to move innovation around the world.  
And secondly, we felt as if the ability to simplify and then have teams come together across our services would really unlock value. And of course, we did that before we had COVID, but we've seen the acceleration of the need for that because our clients are really looking for the ability to bring outcomes. And so just think about the work that we are doing right now. 
Like I take BBVA, which you may know is a customer-centric global financial services company headquartered in Spain. And we have worked with them to move -- they wanted to increase their digital sales, and that brings together operation -- all of our interactive capabilities like paid media, search engine optimization, analytics and marketing operation, plus our deep industry experience. And with our support over the last 12 months, they've grown their digital sales more than 50%, and they saw an increase in digital customers by more than 50%. The ability to bring those services together seamlessly to deliver those outcomes has really been enabled by that growth model to both simplify, recognize that the core of our business is now digital cloud and security and enable us to really meet the needs of the client globally.  
In terms of growth markets, there's really nothing different there. I mean the geographic model helps us both focus on the opportunity in each of the markets while, at the same time, really connecting the innovation and being able to serve global clients better."

So maybe let's start with context overall and what we're seeing in the overall market and the business environment. So as we've been saying, we continue to see that the business environment does remain competitive. And in some areas, we experienced pricing pressure, but we are seeing signs of stability, right? So that's probably the first key point. 
In terms of the pricing that we have across our different markets or services, as you know, the pricing can vary depending on what it is that we're selling and in what markets that -- we're doing that commercial arrangement. But what is important, what stays the same is that we always look to make sure that we are doing a smart commercial arrangement that benefits both our clients and Accenture. And that's a key part of our 360-degree value. But as it relates to what we're actually delivering in terms of profitability, I do want to highlight that within our operating margin and within gross margin, we haven't expanded the delivery of client profitability and contract profitability.

But let me just -- so instead of trying to look ahead to next year and thinking about next year, let's maybe just focus on how we are looking at our business right now. So if you think about the last 6 years, when we started digital, we rotated our business so that now the core of our business is digital, cloud, security and all of our services, meaning not just from a technical perspective. And so think about what we have built are engines of growth as the core of our business, which is what we went through when you think about cloud, Industry X, applied intelligence, operation, the things we went through on our script today. 
And so we have these engines of growth which we continue to invest in. And I think what's really important in the way we think about our business is we're -- for example, cloud, we already scaled. We told you last quarter it was $12 million in FY '20, but it's growing double-digits because we're at the very early stages of it. And when you think about Accenture Cloud First, we brought together, right, all of our services from strategy and consulting to experience, to cloud, industry experience because not only are companies having to migrate to the cloud but they need to create value. Like we're working with an American entertainment company where we're helping them use -- leverage the cloud to accelerate the time to market of new video services, right? So it's not about the migration, it's about the value. 
And so think about our business as having built these engines of growth, some of which already have massive scale and are continuing. And then others like Industry X -- Industry X is the way that we're going to continue to diversify our revenue sources for resilience over the long term. We made 2 acquisitions this quarter, SALT Solutions and Myrtle  Consulting Group, to help build our manufacturing and supply chain. We're going to continue to invest there. 
We think about that as the next Interactive, right, in terms of building this new area. And we're at this amazing tipping point right now where we're seeing an acceleration of digitization in manufacturing and in product engineering. And so we continue to think about how do we both make sure these growth engines are going but never have to have another rotation because we're always investing. 
And I mean the last point I would just say is our capacity to invest in acquisitions has been a huge differentiator in building the business we have today, as being the core of our business is now these engines of growth. And we continue to execute on that in all of our major strategic areas and the next scale plays. And I'd call out the 2 we made this quarter in cloud, for example, Infinity Works and Edenhouse."

And this really is a big driver of how well we're doing now because in this -- when you have compressed transformation where the companies need to do so much at the same time, there's a really sharp focus on: What do I need to do? How do I source the talent, right? And that conversation has absolutely gone faster. 
But also, how can I digitize every part of the organization? And what Accenture has, which is very unique, is this investment we've been making for years in the SynOps platform, for example, in operations and in technology, things like myWizard and myConcerto, which builds in best-of-class AI, machine learning, rapid testing. And these are platforms that we continuously invest in. And so when you -- what's happening here is that we're helping them digitize. We're helping them focus on what do they really need to have in-house versus can leverage in order to go faster. 
But one thing I want to be really, really clear about is although our strategy and consulting business continued to have a high single-digit decline, it was better than we expected. Strategy and consulting is absolutely essential to all of these results, including outsourcing, because what we are bringing to them, right, is not simply always at a lower cost. It's increases in sales through our marketing operations like the BBVA example I gave, right? It's manufacturing. At AIG, which I talked about, it's insurance, right, as well as deep process skills. It is helping them transform the ways they're working by being integrated with us where we're bringing modern ways of working and digital.  
And so this is what distinguishes us as a company for our clients. It's not  -- for you guys, it's type of work, outsourcing versus consulting, which is basically managed services, it's project work. For our clients, it's our ability to bring all these services together, which is why I emphasize that each of the examples I gave in my script, and I gave you many more, really are pulling all of these things together for an outcome. And when you're going through compressed transformation, that's more important than ever."

So we've talked about the industry is more impacted by the pandemic, and Resources clearly has one of those, which is energy, and that continued to be under pressure. And I would also say that our clients in the chemicals industry also have been feeling some pressure as well. But you've -- we've seen stability in our utilities portfolio, which is good. And go forward, as we look into Q3, we do see an improvement in the Resources growth rate."

On average, we've done about 20% of our operating cash flow to V&A, and that's -- our updated guidance of about up to $2 billion -- at least $2 billion puts us in that same zone. 
So -- but it's not just being able to acquire. It's successful integration. And so you can see that, that typically provides about 2% of inorganic contribution. In this year, it's going to be more in the 2.5% zone. So we really are very focused on that as a key part of our strategy, and we will look to continue to invest. And as we've said, we can always -- we can do more than the $2 billion if the opportunity presents itself, but it is a key part of our investment portfolio."

We had another outstanding quarter, reflecting our laser focus on creating 360-degree client value and the importance of our scale, experience, industry knowledge and trust to the world's leading companies and governments as they continue to digitally transform their enterprises. 
We had a record 20 clients with bookings over $100 million and a total of $15.4 billion in bookings. We delivered 16% revenue growth in local currency, 3% above the top of our guided range, with outstanding profitability and free cash flow. We estimate that we continue to take significant market share. 
Our growth was broad-based across geographic markets and industries, with 11 out of 13 industries growing double digits this quarter, and reflects our ability to bring together our unmatched breadth of services from strategy and consulting to interactive technology and operations to create the solutions which achieve the value at speed that makes a difference to our clients. 
We continue to meet our clients' strong demand, adding a net 32,000 talented people this quarter alone. We offer an employee value proposition that allows us to attract top talent, develop our people with world-class training and provide them with vibrant career paths. We are pleased with our record 117,000 promotions year-to-date, including almost 1,200 promotions to Managing Director. 
And while delivering these results, we have raised the bar again in terms of investments. We now expect to invest about $4 billion in strategic acquisitions this fiscal year with 39 acquisitions closed or announced year-to-date. This includes announcing this quarter 2 acquisitions with purchase prices over $1 billion each, the acquisition by Accenture Federal Services of Novetta in the U.S., an advanced analytics company, which we expect to close in August; and of Umlaut, a world-class engineering services company headquartered in Germany, which we expect to close in Q1. These 39 acquisitions are well balanced with 10 in North America, 17 in Europe and 12 in growth markets. 
Our level of investment demonstrates as well how scale, experience and trust matters, scale in terms of our financial capacity, experience in terms of our track record of the successful integration of approximately 200 companies since 2013 and the trust we have earned in the market that attracts leading companies to want to join the Accenture family. We invest in acquisitions to scale in areas where we see a big market opportunity, to add skills and new capabilities and to further deepen our industry and functional expertise, all to drive continued innovation and the next waves of growth. 
Finally, because we believe strongly in our commitment to share success with our communities, we recently announced that we would donate $100 for every 1 of our then 540,000 employees, or $54 million, to urgently address the needs of our communities due to the pandemic, including $25 million for India.

As you heard in Julie's comments, we are extremely pleased with our results in the third quarter which continue to reflect very strong momentum across all dimensions of our business. Based on the strength of our third quarter results and the confidence we have in our fourth quarter to continue to extend our market leadership position, we are increasing our full year outlook, which I will cover in more detail later in the call. 
Before I get into the details, let me summarize the major headlines of our third quarter results, which reflect continued superior execution against our 3 financial imperatives. 
Revenue increased nearly $2.3 billion, reflecting growth of 16% in local currency. Results were approximately $300 million above the top end of our guided range, driven by broad-based overperformance across the business with double-digit growth in all 3 markets, 4 of 5 industry groups and in technology services and operations. As we expected, both Strategy and Consulting and the Resources Industry Group returned to growth. These results demonstrate the power of our business model and our unique ability to seamlessly integrate our services at scale. We estimate that our growth continues to significantly outpace the market. 
Operating margin was 16%, an increase of 40 basis points for the quarter. Importantly, we no longer have the margin expansion tailwind from lower travel as we anniversaried the benefit of the compare this quarter. We continue to absorb significant investments in our people and our business as we are always focused on positioning our business for the future. And we delivered very strong EPS of $2.40, up 26% over fiscal '20. 
Finally, we delivered strong free cash flow of $2.2 billion in the quarter and $6.2 billion year-to-date while also continuing all elements of our capital allocation program, including returning roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders this quarter via dividends and share repurchases. 
We've made investments of $1.5 billion in acquisitions through Q3, and we now expect to invest about $4 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year which does not include the Umlaut acquisition, which we anticipate to close in FY '22. 
I want to take a moment to highlight that, as you can see from our results and guidance this year, we are able to step up our acquisition spend and continue to expand operating margin. And while I won't comment on the specifics of FY '22 until September, based on our current line of sight, you should think of next year's inorganic contribution in the range of 4%, and we expect margin -- modest margin expansion as we continue to run our business with rigor and discipline. 
With that, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $15.4 billion for the quarter with a very strong book-to-bill of 1.2. Consulting bookings were $8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. 
We were very pleased with our new bookings, which represents 39% growth in U.S. dollars and reflect a record 20 clients with bookings over $100 million. Each service dimension, Strategy and Consulting, Technology Services and Operations delivered double-digit bookings growth in local currency. 
Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $13.3 billion, a 21% increase in U.S. dollars and a 16% increase in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $7.3 billion, up 21% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6 billion, up 20% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency. 
Taking a closer look at our service dimensions. Operations grew very strong double digits. Technology Services grew strong double digits. And Strategy and Consulting grew high single digits. 
Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 18% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Public Service, Software and Platforms and Consumer Goods, Retail and Travel Services. 
In Europe, revenues grew 14% local currency. We saw double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail and Travel Services and Industrial and high single-digit growth in Banking and Capital Markets. Looking closer at the countries, Europe was driven by double-digit growth in the U.K., Italy and Germany. 
In growth markets, we delivered 15% revenue growth in local currency, led by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail and Travel Services, Banking and Capital Markets and Public Service. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan and Brazil. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.2% compared with 32.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.6% compared with 10.2% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.6% compared to 6.3% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.1 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 16% operating margin, up 40 basis points compared with Q3 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.5% for the third quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.40 compared to EPS of $1.90 in the third quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 36 days compared to 34 days last quarter and 41 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $158 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $10 billion compared with $8.4 billion at August 31. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3 million shares for $835 million at an average purchase price of $276.98 per share. As of May 31, we had approximately $4.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. 
Also in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share for a total of $559 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share to be paid on August 13, also a 10% increase over last year. 
So in summary, we are extremely pleased with our results to date and are now focused on Q4 and closing out a very strong year. 
Now let me turn it back to Julie."

The dynamics in the market we are seeing are not only a recovery from the lower spending pattern at the onset of the pandemic, but a more sustained growth in demand as companies race to modernize and accelerate",1541,"Thanks, KC. I'll start with the environment. The dynamics in the market we are seeing are not only a recovery from the lower spending pattern at the onset of the pandemic, but a more sustained growth in demand as companies race to modernize and accelerate their digital initiatives with compressed transformation. 
Pre COVID, our research showed a digital achievement gap, with leaders growing 2x faster than laggards, and we estimate that gap has now widened to 5x, with leaders stepping up their investment in technology and innovation and lead laggards taking accelerated steps to catch up. Cloud is an even more critical enabler as companies are increasing their focus on enterprise-wide transformation and rapidly moving to digital and cloud-powered models. 
These needs of our clients are driving strong momentum in our business with an acceleration of continued strong double-digit growth across applied intelligence, cloud, Industry X, Intelligent Operations and Security, with interactive and intelligent platform services returning to strong double-digit growth this quarter. These strategic priorities are multiservice and are powered by our unparalleled technology ecosystem relationships. 
Let me share some color to bring this demand to life. I want to particularly highlight cloud, which continues to have very strong double-digit growth rates as well as the subset of Accenture Cloud First, where growth was even stronger and has exceeded our expectations when we formed Cloud First last September. With our Cloud First services, we are helping agencies served by [ Concept ], Italy's national procurement agency, to deliver on Italy's national recovery and resilience plan. We're developing and running industry-specific, cloud-based platforms to standardize and improve their efficiency and speed, reducing the time to launch new contracts and ultimately providing much improved services for Italy citizens. 
We are using our intelligent platform services to help DuPont, a company with a rich history of business reinvention, reimagine its financial structure to coordinate operations across its large geographic footprint. After going through a strategic and deliberate restructuring through M&A, we will now help DuPont implement a central finance processing suite that will help them to consolidate their multiple financial systems in chart of accounts into 1 and close the books faster. This will provide real-time view of results for all of the business units, all in the cloud, giving DuPont more agility, speed and certainty in a complex and volatile market. 
We are helping Jaguar Land Rover transform its global marketing model to deliver a more personalized customer experience with creativity and technology at its core. We were selected for our technology capabilities, data-led performance and experience-led approach. We will use the strength of the experience, creative and digital capabilities of interactive and the marketing delivery capabilities of operations with our SynOps platform, which we already use as part of Jaguar Land Rover's warranty operations. SynOps will deliver AI-powered insights and highly automated production around the world. 
Security is top of mind for our clients as the threat landscape expands. Our very strong double-digit growth is driven by the breadth and depth of our services from advisory to cyber defense to manage security. For example, facing ever-increasing cyber threats and continued financial pressures as a result of COVID-19, Accenture is helping a [ U.K ]. bank by bringing together the full breadth of these capabilities to provide innovative solutions to support the bank's future security strategy. 
Across many of these examples are our implied intelligence services. We were excited this quarter to announce Accenture Federal Services' agreement to acquire Novetta, an advanced analytics company serving U.S. federal organizations that is demonstrating what's possible with analytics, machine learning, cyber and cloud engineering. This will augment our already strong capabilities and scale in these critical areas, providing even more diversification across our federal business, specifically in the national security space which is seeing substantial growth. 
I want to give a special recognition to our colleagues serving the public sector around the world throughout the pandemic. Your 7 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth reflect your absolute commitment to the important missions of government serving their citizens. 
Turning now to Industry X, our digital engineering and manufacturing services. We believe that product development, design engineering, manufacturing and the supply chain make up the next big digital transformation frontier. The impact of COVID-19 is accelerating the need to transform these core operations. And for nearly a decade, we have been investing to build the unique capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to combine the power of data and digital with traditional engineering services. We are very pleased with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Umlaut which will add more than 4,200 industry-leading engineers and consultants across 17 countries and expand our capabilities across a range of industries, including automotive, aerospace and defense, telecommunications, energy and utilities. 
Some recent examples of our Industry X services include helping a German telecom company continuously develop and enhance their Internet television service by utilizing embedded engineering in their set-top boxes and managing new features on the platform; helping a large media conglomerate accelerate their primary revenue streams in digital products and advertising with our product and platform engineering expertise to design, build, test and deploy new products, services and features; and working with a global automotive OEM to execute online remote software updates for their in-car computer systems to allow seamless deployment of new software versions. 
We are also working with an American multinational manufacturer of confectionery pet food and other food products to deploy a digital twin platform to optimize production in its manufacturing facilities, improve margins and reduce waste. 
We're working with a large electric company in Japan to help their power plants -- to help bring their power plants into the future by digitizing their operations and standards across each department; and with a large oil and gas company to build their internal digital capability to substantially reduce time to market for new digital solutions that extends to its customers while supporting the company's key safety and sustainability goals throughout the use of a digital factory. 
Taking a step back, the examples I have provided today all required deep industry knowledge and innovation. Our breadth and depth across industries enables us to tailor industry solutions while bringing cross-industry expertise as we help our clients facing industry convergence and by using the lessons of other industries. 
We were proud this quarter that Fast Company recognized us for our innovation across multiple initiatives in its world-changing ideas awards. Our cross-industry expertise is one of the powerful sources of our ability to innovate. 
For example, using our deep banking industry and technical expertise, we rapidly developed for a commercial bank, which was not a traditional small business administration lender, a program under the U.S. Paycheck Protection Program that allowed them to make loans to thousands of small businesses struggling with the impacts of the pandemic. 
We then pivoted to apply this approach to [ stand up ] Facebook's small business grant program for black-owned businesses, enabling the distribution of 10,000 grants to black-owned businesses in the U.S. This grant program is an important part of Facebook's overall commitment to invest $200 million in building programs and tools for black-owned businesses. 
Finally, let me turn to our incredible people. Their health and safety remain our top priority. We are supporting our people by facilitating vaccinations, including standing up clinics in many of our offices such as in India, where already 50,000 of our people, their families and contractors have been vaccinated. We have been focused on taking the lessons as an almost 100% remote workforce during the pandemic to a new way of working, moving from a remote or hybrid model to an omni-connected experience. People will work in the office from home and at client sites, and it is likely many of our clients will be doing the same. So our approach focuses on the experience of connecting to continue to serve our clients in a differentiated way and create an environment that our people feel a sense of belonging. 
The rich diversity and ingenuity of our people, from our Board of Directors to our new hires, helps us deliver 360-degree value for the benefit of all. We now have more than 250,000 women representing approximately 46% of our workforce. 
As you may recall, shortly after the murder of George Floyd in the U.S., on this call, I shared with you our commitment to take 3 actions in the U.S. setting external goals to increase representation, training our people and making a bigger impact in our communities. One year later, I am pleased to report that we not only took each action but have made measurable progress, including increasing our representation, having 95% of our U.S. people complete our new anti-racism training and making substantial new investments in our communities. You can find a full progress update on our website because we believe transparency and accountability are hallmarks of good governance and essential to building trust. 
As we see the rise or continuation of all kinds of hate crimes against diverse communities, including violence against Asians, the LGBTI community, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, I want to reaffirm my and Accenture's unwavering commitment to equality and justice for all and 0 tolerance for racism, bigotry and hate of any kind. 
KC, back to you."

For the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, we expect revenues to be in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be positive 4% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 and reflects an estimated 17% to 21% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '21, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately positive 3.5% compared to fiscal '20. 
For the full fiscal '21, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 10% to 11% growth in local currency over fiscal '20, including approximately negative 1% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel based on a 2% reduction in the first half of the year and no material impact in the second half of the year. Importantly, organic revenue is the driver of the increase to our updated guidance as we still expect the inorganic contribution to remain at about 2.5% for the full year. 
For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '21 to be 15.1%, a 40 basis point expansion over fiscal '20 results. 
We now expect our annual effective -- our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal '20. 
For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '21 to be in the range of $9.07 to $9.16. 
We now expect adjusted full year diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.71 to $8.80 or 17% to 18% growth over adjusted fiscal '20 results. 
For the full fiscal '21, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.65 billion to $9.15 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.4 to 1.5. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $5.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.

And -- and in terms of -- when you look at it, there was very strong bookings in both consulting and outsourcing as well as all 3 geographic markets. And if you look at specifically on our [ B&A ], which also was represented across all of those dimensions, there will be a slight impact in our bookings based on the backlog that we bring in from those acquisitions, but it's not overall significant. 
But let me just peel it back in terms of when you look underneath that $15.4 billion, I'd say there's really kind of 3 things I'd point out. First was that there was really a good mix of all categories of our sales. As Julie mentioned, we had a record 20 clients over $100 million of sales. And that, as you know, positions us really well for the future. But if you go all the way down through the categories, all the way through our smaller deals, they represented very well and that can help us with revenue in the current quarter. 
The second thing that I would point out is that our bookings were very broad-based across all of our services, and that included strategy and consulting. 
And the third thing was that it was aligned to our strategic priorities, as we pointed out, driven by cloud, Industry X and security, for example. 
So with those points, I would -- I'll hand it back to you to ask the second question or if there's any other color that you want..."

So Novetta being both investment in public sector but primarily all about [ invest ], analytics, machine learning, cyber and cloud engineering. And also importantly, diversification for our federal business because they are in the national intelligence space. 
And Umlaut is in engineering, which was just an opportunity as a company that we know very well, that really is giving us an opportunity to accelerate our scale in Industry X. And we've seen the digitization of manufacturing and engineering be a major priority post COVID. We've been investing for nearly a decade in this space. We predicted this would happen, as you can see by the number -- the amount of work that we're already doing. And this was a great opportunity for a company that we know well. 
And our strategy continues to be we're going to make acquisitions to scale and big market opportunities to add new skills and opportunities. As you know, that we built a lot of interactive through acquisitions. For example, those were new skills and capabilities. And then to deepen industry and functional knowledge. And so this is a continuation of that. 
And I think the advantage we have is our financial capacity to make investments and to increase our investment for the benefit of our clients and all of our stakeholders when we see the right opportunities. And we're going to continue to have that discipline around making strategic acquisitions."

Ashwin, I'll take this, and maybe I'll frame up a few things for you and hand it over to Julie as well. So let me just maybe frame up how we were thinking about, you mentioned the demand in overall business and think about the quarter and our year-to-date from a financial perspective. And these results are really exceptional when you think about it in the context of our historical performance. So I'll start there. 
I mean clearly we're benefiting from an easier compare in a strong market demand, and we see that continuing. But even with that, bookings at $44 billion, growing 25% year-to-date, and that's off a base of record sales through Q3 of last year. And then you couple that with 54 clients with bookings over $100 million through Q3, which is more in the first 9 months of this year than the whole of last year FY '20 and FY '19. 
And I mentioned that, as you talk about things in different ways we may need to manage differently, just to talk about the scale in our bookings. If you look at the scale and revenue, we grew record $2.3 billion in revenue this quarter year-over-year. And you think about our industries, where we're clearly the leader with the breadth and depth of industries, we had 11 of those 13 growing double digits. And as I mentioned before in our guidance, the increase in our full year outlook, it's driven by organic revenue, given that inorganic contribution is staying pretty much the same. 
And then you end it all with profitability of 40 basis points expansion this quarter. We had very strong profitability, and we're no longer benefiting from a travel tailwind, and we continue to invest at scale in our business and our people. 
So with that, let me hand it over more to Julie to round out some of the questions you had on demand and [indiscernible] and attrition."

So Ashwin, it's a great question around managing our business. And so I want to just take you all back to right before the pandemic, remember back then, and on March 1 we put in a new growth model, we call the next-gen growth model. And that was designed for helping us manage our business as we saw the scale increasing, right? And that change in growth model was focused on being able to have more of our leaders closer to our clients. We changed the P&L, as you recall, to the geographic. And so we've already put in place a model that is designed to allow us to continue to scale. And so this, for us, was anticipated, and it's exciting to see how we are very uniquely positioned as our clients' needs have accelerated, because that's what's driving the demand, right? The needs of our clients have accelerated post COVID to do compressed transformation, and we have the right operating model in place. 
As we think about attrition, it's ticked up to pre-COVID letter -- levels in a hot market, although not the highest we've ever seen. And so as you said, it's an industry phenomenon and we're comfortable. I mean, our core competency is about managing supply and demand, but more importantly, our core competency is being a great company to work for. And as you saw with our numbers this quarter, we hired net 32,000 incredible people. And that is just a testament to our ability to attract great talent as well as continue to train our people. We've trained over 100,000 people since the pandemic started, pivoting to the areas of our clients' needs.

But the areas that have been not as digitized over the last several years as companies have pivoted has been in core operations, manufacturing and supply chain. 
Now we predicted this, just as we predicted back in 2013 that someday everybody would be a digital business. And so we've been investing. We've already made, I don't know, 7, 8, 9 acquisitions over the last several years to build these capabilities. And you saw that with all the examples that we did in the script. And so this is about rapidly scaling with some of the best engineers in the world, right, because we see the market opportunity, but most importantly, the need from our clients.

I think it's too early and we're not going to kind of back into sort of giving sort of a view of FY '22, but what we would say is we do believe that what you're seeing right now in demand isn't just like a recovery because spending decreased, but actually sustained demand, and that we are incredibly well positioned to capture that because clients are looking for outcomes and the breadth of our services. They're turning to us because we can give them solutions, not just individual services. They want the innovation that we're bringing, the things like our SynOps platform. They are very appreciative and focused on the fact that we care about the 360-degree value so that we're helping improve their own skills as well as achieving their goals. And finally, and I think something that is really critical right now and why we are so well positioned, is they see us a company that creates value and leads with values. And so trust really matters when you are doing major transformation. 
And I'll give you one example. We've had over 80 clients in the last 12 months just come and sit down with us to learn more about our diversity supplier program, because it really matters to them and they see us as a leader, right? These are the things that make us an incredibly attractive and trusted partner.

And just coming back to the same point on [ B&A ]. So let me just give you a little bit more color on B&A coupled with what I talked about a little bit earlier, and of course I'm not going to give any specific guidance for FY '22 until September. But we do expect to have a higher level of inorganic contribution next year, probably around something closer to 4%. And that's really due to the fact that we're deploying about $4 billion in FY '21. A larger portion of that is closer to the later part of the year, and we expect to benefit from more of that revenue in FY '22. 
We also expect at this time to deploy somewhere around $4 billion in FY '22. That's including Umlaut, which we expect to close next year, early in the year. 
And of course, as Julie said, we always -- we've always said we have the ability to do more, but that's our line of sight today. But -- and it's up to us to manage our -- all the levers that we have at our disposal, to continue within the perimeters of clients and our overhead and structural costs to make sure that we continue to drive modest margin expansion while investing at scale in our business and our people."

And what we're providing them is both cost efficiencies, but really outcomes of actual insights that come from being able to digitize. And then you add on top of that where we have more clients thinking about having us take over. We have a strong pipeline and taking over more people because we have such a great employee value proposition. And so they're starting -- when we think about the future of work, think about it, we're seeing more of our clients really see it as a combination of their own employees, automation or bots and then partners like Accenture that really integrate with their own employees, and we're just the leader here.

We had another outstanding quarter, reflecting our laser focus on creating 360-degree client value and the importance of our scale, experience, industry knowledge and trust to the world's leading companies and governments as they continue to digitally transform their enterprises.  
We had a record 20 clients with bookings over $100 million and a total of $15.4 billion in bookings. We delivered 16% revenue growth in local currency, 3% above the top of our guided range, with outstanding profitability and free cash flow. We estimate that we continue to take significant market share.  
Our growth was broad-based across geographic markets and industries, with 11 out of 13 industries growing double digits this quarter and reflects our ability to bring together our unmatched breadth of services from strategy and consulting to interactive technology and operations to create the solutions which achieve the value at speed that makes a difference to our clients.  
We continue to meet our clients' strong demand, adding a net 32,000 talented people this quarter alone. We offer an employee value proposition that allows us to attract top talent, develop our people with world-class training and provide them with vibrant career paths. We are pleased with our record 117,000 promotions year-to-date, including almost 1,200 promotions to Managing Director.  
And while delivering these results, we have raised the bar again in terms of investments. We now expect to invest about $4 billion in strategic acquisitions this fiscal year, with 39 acquisitions closed or announced year-to-date. This includes announcing this quarter 2 acquisitions with purchase prices over $1 billion each, the acquisition by Accenture Federal Services of Novetta in the U.S., an advanced analytics company, which we expect to close in August; and of umlaut, a world-class engineering services company headquartered in Germany, which we expect to close in Q1. These 39 acquisitions are well balanced with 10 in North America, 17 in Europe and 12 in growth markets.  
Our level of investment demonstrates as well how scale, experience and trust matters: scale in terms of our financial capacity, experience in terms of our track record of the successful integration of approximately 200 companies since 2013 and the trust we have earned in the market that attracts leading companies to want to join the Accenture family. We invest in acquisitions to scale in areas where we see a big market opportunity, to add skills and new capabilities and to further deepen our industry and functional expertise, all to drive continued innovation and the next waves of growth.  
Finally, because we believe strongly in our commitment to share success with our communities, we recently announced that we would donate $100 for every 1 of our then 540,000 employees, or $54 million, to urgently address the needs of our communities due to the pandemic, including $25 million for India.

As you heard in Julie's comments, we are extremely pleased with our results in the third quarter, which continue to reflect very strong momentum across all dimensions of our business. Based on the strength of our third quarter results and the confidence we have in our fourth quarter to continue to extend our market leadership position, we are increasing our full year outlook, which I will cover in more detail later in the call.  
Before I get into the details, let me summarize the major headlines of our third quarter results, which reflect continued superior execution against our 3 financial imperatives.  
Revenue increased nearly $2.3 billion, reflecting growth of 16% in local currency. Results were approximately $300 million above the top end of our guided range, driven by broad-based overperformance across the business with double-digit growth in all 3 markets, 4 of 5 industry groups and in technology services and operations. As we expected, both strategy and consulting and the resources industry group returned to growth. These results demonstrate the power of our business model and our unique ability to seamlessly integrate our services at scale. We estimate that our growth continues to significantly outpace the market.  
Operating margin was 16%, an increase of 40 basis points for the quarter. Importantly, we no longer have the margin expansion tailwind from lower travel as we anniversaried the benefit of the compare this quarter. We continue to absorb significant investments in our people and our business as we are always focused on positioning our business for the future. And we delivered very strong EPS of $2.40, up 26% over fiscal '20.  
Finally, we delivered strong free cash flow of $2.2 billion in the quarter and $6.2 billion year-to-date while also continuing all elements of our capital allocation program, including returning roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders this quarter via dividends and share repurchases.  
We've made investments of $1.5 billion in acquisitions through Q3, and we now expect to invest about $4 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year which does not include the umlaut acquisition, which we anticipate to close in FY '22.  
I want to take a moment to highlight that, as you can see from our results and guidance this year, we are able to step up our acquisition spend and continue to expand operating margin. And while I won't comment on the specifics of FY '22 until September, based on our current line of sight, you should think of next year's inorganic contribution in the range of 4%, and we expect margin -- modest margin expansion as we continue to run our business with rigor and discipline.  
With that, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $15.4 billion for the quarter with a very strong book-to-bill of 1.2. Consulting bookings were $8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2.  
We were very pleased with our new bookings, which represents 39% growth in U.S. dollars and reflect a record 20 clients with bookings over $100 million. Each service dimension, strategy and consulting, technology services and operations delivered double-digit bookings growth in local currency.  
Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $13.3 billion, a 21% increase in U.S. dollars and a 16% increase in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $7.3 billion, up 21% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6 billion, up 20% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency.  
Taking a closer look at our service dimensions. Operations grew very strong double digits, technology services grew strong double digits and strategy and consulting grew high single digits.  
Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 18% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Public Service, Software & Platforms and Consumer Goods, Retail and Travel Services.  
In Europe, revenues grew 14% local currency. We saw double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail and Travel Services and Industrial and high single-digit growth in Banking and Capital Markets. Looking closer at the countries, Europe was driven by double-digit growth in the U.K., Italy and Germany.  
In Growth Markets, we delivered 15% revenue growth in local currency, led by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail and Travel Services, Banking and Capital Markets and Public Service. From a country perspective, Growth Markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan and Brazil.  
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.2% compared with 32.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.6% compared with 10.2% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.6% compared to 6.3% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.1 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 16% operating margin, up 40 basis points compared with Q3 last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.5% for the third quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.40 compared to EPS of $1.90 in the third quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 36 days compared to 34 days last quarter and 41 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $158 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $10 billion compared with $8.4 billion at August 31.  
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3 million shares for $835 million at an average purchase price of $276.98 per share. As of May 31, we had approximately $4.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.  
Also in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share for a total of $559 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share to be paid on August 13, also a 10% increase over last year.  
So in summary, we are extremely pleased with our results to date and are now focused on Q4 and closing out a very strong year.  Now let me turn it back to Julie."

I'll start with the environment. The dynamics in the market we are seeing are not only a recovery from the lower spending pattern at the onset of the pandemic, but a more sustained growth in demand as companies race to modernize and accelerate their digital initiatives with compressed transformation.  
Pre COVID, our research showed a digital achievement gap, with leaders growing 2x faster than laggards, and we estimate that gap has now widened to 5x, with leaders stepping up their investment in technology and innovation and lead progress taking accelerated steps to catch up.  
Cloud is an even more critical enabler as companies are increasing their focus on enterprise-wide transformation and rapidly moving to digital- and cloud-powered models. These needs of our clients are driving strong momentum in our business with an acceleration of continued strong double-digit growth across applied intelligence, cloud, Industry X, intelligent operations and security, with Interactive and Intelligent Platform Services returning to strong double-digit growth this quarter. These strategic priorities are multiservice and are powered by our unparalleled technology ecosystem relationships.  
Let me share some color to bring this demand to life. I want to particularly highlight cloud, which continues to have very strong double-digit growth rates as well as the subset of Accenture Cloud First, where growth was even stronger and has exceeded our expectations when we formed Cloud First last September. With our Cloud First services, we are helping agencies served by Consip, Italy's national procurement agency, to deliver on Italy's National Recovery and Resilience Plan. We're developing and running industry-specific cloud-based platforms to standardize and improve their efficiency and speed, reducing the time to launch new contracts and ultimately providing much improved services for Italy citizens.  
We are using our Intelligent Platform Services to help DuPont, a company with a rich history of business reinvention, reimagine its financial structure to coordinate operations across its large geographic footprint. After going through a strategic and deliberate restructuring through M&A, we will now help DuPont implement a central finance processing suite that will help them to consolidate their multiple financial systems and chart of accounts into one and close the books faster. This will provide real-time view of results for all of the business units, all in the cloud, giving DuPont more agility, speed and certainty in a complex and volatile market.  
We are helping Jaguar Land Rover transform its global marketing model to deliver a more personalized customer experience with creativity and technology at its core. We were selected for our technology capabilities, data-led performance and experience-led approach. We will use the strength of the experience, creative and digital capabilities of interactive and the marketing delivery capabilities of operations with our SynOps platform, which we already use as part of Jaguar Land Rover's warranty operations. SynOps will deliver AI-powered insights and highly automated production around the world.  
Security is top of mind for our clients as the threat landscape expands. Our very strong double-digit growth is driven by the breadth and depth of our services, from advisory to cyber defense to manage security. For example, facing ever-increasing cyber threats and continued financial pressures as a result of COVID-19, Accenture is helping a [ U.K. eye bank ] by bringing together the full breadth of these capabilities to provide innovative solutions to support the bank's future security strategy.  
Across many of these examples are our implied intelligence services. We were excited this quarter to announce Accenture Federal Services' agreement to acquire Novetta, an advanced analytics company serving U.S. federal organizations that is demonstrating what's possible with analytics, machine learning, cyber and cloud engineering. This will augment our already strong capabilities and scale in these critical areas, providing even more diversification across our federal business, specifically in the national security space which is seeing substantial growth.  
I want to give a special recognition to our colleagues serving the public sector around the world throughout the pandemic. Your 7 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth reflect your absolute commitment to the important missions of government serving their citizens.  
Turning now to Industry X, our digital engineering and manufacturing services. We believe that product development, design engineering, manufacturing and the supply chain make up the next big digital transformation frontier. The impact of COVID-19 is accelerating the need to transform these core operations. And for nearly a decade, we have been investing to build the unique capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to combine the power of data and digital with traditional engineering services. We are very pleased with the announcement of our agreement to acquire umlaut, which will add more than 4,200 industry-leading engineers and consultants across 17 countries and expand our capabilities across a range of industries, including automotive, aerospace and defense, telecommunications, energy and utilities.  
Some recent examples of our Industry X services include helping a German telecom company continuously develop and enhance their Internet television service by utilizing embedded engineering in their set-top boxes and managing new features on the platform; helping a large media conglomerate accelerate their primary revenue streams in digital products and advertising with our product and platform engineering expertise to design, build, test and deploy new products, services and features; and working with a global automotive OEM to execute online remote software updates for their in-car computer systems to allow seamless deployment of new software versions.  
We are also working with an American multinational manufacturer of confectionery pet food and other food products to deploy a digital twin platform to optimize production in its manufacturing facilities, improve margins and reduce waste.  
We're working with a large electric company in Japan to help their power plants -- to help bring their power plants into the future by digitizing their operations and standards across each department; and with a large oil and gas company to build their internal digital capability to substantially reduce time to market for new digital solutions that extends to its customers while supporting the company's key safety and sustainability goals throughout the use of a digital factory.  
Taking a step back. The examples I have provided today all require deep industry knowledge and innovation. Our breadth and depth across industries enables us to tailor industry solutions while bringing cross-industry expertise as we help our clients facing industry convergence and by using the lessons of other industries.  
We were proud this quarter that Fast Company recognized us for our innovation across multiple initiatives in its World Changing Ideas Awards. Our cross-industry expertise is one of the powerful sources of our ability to innovate.  
For example, using our deep banking industry and technical expertise, we rapidly developed for a commercial bank which was not a traditional small business administration lender, a program under the U.S. Paycheck Protection Program that allowed them to make loans to thousands of small businesses struggling with the impacts of the pandemic. We then pivoted to apply this approach to stand-up Facebook's Small Business Grants Program for Black-owned businesses, enabling the distribution of 10,000 grants to Black-owned businesses in the U.S. This grants program is an important part of Facebook's overall commitment to invest $200 million in building programs and tools for Black-owned businesses.  
Finally, let me turn to our incredible people. Their health and safety remain our top priority. We are supporting our people by facilitating vaccinations, including standing up clinics in many of our offices such as in India, where already 50,000 of our people, their families and contractors have been vaccinated. We have been focused on taking the lessons as an almost 100% remote workforce during the pandemic to a new way of working, moving from a remote or hybrid model to an omni-connected experience. People will work in the office, from home and at client sites, and it is likely many of our clients will be doing the same. So our approach focuses on the experience of connecting to continue to serve our clients in a differentiated way and create an environment that our people feel a sense of belonging.  
The rich diversity and ingenuity of our people, from our Board of Directors to our new hires, helps us deliver 360-degree value for the benefit of all. We now have more than 250,000 women, representing approximately 46% of our workforce. As you may recall, shortly after the murder of George Floyd in the U.S., on this call, I shared with you our commitment to take 3 actions in the U.S.: setting external goals to increase representation, training our people and making a bigger impact in our communities. One year later, I am pleased to report that we not only took each action but have made measurable progress, including increasing our representation, having 95% of our U.S. people complete our new anti-racism training and making substantial new investments in our communities. You can find a full progress update on our website because we believe transparency and accountability are hallmarks of good governance and essential to building trust.  
As we see the rise or continuation of all kinds of hate crimes against diverse communities, including violence against Asians, the LGBTI community, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, I want to reaffirm my and Accenture's unwavering commitment to equality and justice for all and zero tolerance for racism, bigotry and hate of any kind.  
KC, back to you."

For the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, we expect revenues to be in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be positive 4% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 and reflects an estimated 17% to 21% growth in local currency.  
For the full fiscal year '21, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately positive 3.5% compared to fiscal '20.  
For the full fiscal '21, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 10% to 11% growth in local currency over fiscal '20, including approximately negative 1% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel based on a 2% reduction the first half of the year and no material impact in the second half of the year.  
Importantly, organic revenue is the driver of the increase to our updated guidance as we still expect the inorganic contribution to remain at about 2.5% for the full year.  For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '21 to be 15.1%, a 40 basis point expansion over fiscal '20 results.  We now expect our annual effective -- our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal '20.  
For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '21 to be in the range of $9.07 to $9.16.  We now expect adjusted full year diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.71 to $8.80 or 17% to 18% growth over adjusted fiscal '20 results.  
For the full fiscal '21, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.65 billion to $9.15 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.4 to 1.5. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $5.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.

And again, that grew 39% in U.S. dollars. Really strong book-to-bill, 1.2%. And in terms of when you look at it, there was very strong bookings in both consulting and outsourcing as well as all 3 geographic markets. And if you look at specifically on our V&A, which also was represented across all of those dimensions, there will be a slight impact in our bookings based on the backlog that we bring in from those acquisitions, but it's not overall significant. 
But let me just peel it back in terms of when you look underneath that $15.4 billion, I'd say there's really kind of 3 things I'd point out. First was that there was really a good mix of all categories of our sales. As Julie mentioned, we had a record 20 clients over $100 million of sales. And that, as you know, positions us really well for the future. But if you go all the way down through the categories, all the way through our smaller deals, they represented very well and that can help us with revenue in the current quarter. 
The second thing that I would point out is that our bookings were very broad-based across all of our services, and that included strategy and consulting. 
And the third thing was that it was aligned to our strategic priorities, as we pointed out, driven by cloud, Industry X and security, for example. 
So with those points, I would -- I'll hand it back to you to ask the second question or if there's any other color that you want."

And look, so we've always said we have the capacity to do larger acquisitions, but we're very disciplined about what we will acquire. And so these were opportunities that were very aligned to our strategic priorities. 
So Novetta being both investment in public sector but primarily all about advanced analytics, machine learning, cyber and cloud engineering. And so also importantly, diversification for our federal business because they are in the national intelligence space. 
And umlaut is in engineering, which was just an opportunity as a company that we know very well, that really is giving us an opportunity to accelerate our scale in Industry X. And we've seen the digitization of manufacturing and engineering be a major priority post COVID. We've been investing for nearly a decade in this space. We predicted this would happen, as you can see by the number, the amount of work that we're already doing. And this was a great opportunity for a company that we know well. 
And our strategy continues to be we're going to make acquisitions to scale in big market opportunities to add new skills and opportunities, as you know, that we built a lot of interactive through acquisitions. For example, those were new skills and capabilities and then to deepen industry and functional knowledge. And so this is a continuation of that. 
And I think the advantage we have is our financial capacity to make investments and to increase our investment for the benefit of our clients and all of our stakeholders when we see the right opportunities. And we're going to continue to have that discipline around making strategic acquisitions."

Ashwin, I'll take this, and maybe I'll frame up a few things for you and hand it over to Julie as well. So let me just maybe frame up how we were thinking about, you mentioned the demand in overall business and think about the quarter and our year-to-date from a financial perspective. And these results are really exceptional when you think about it in the context of our historical performance, so I'll start there. 
I mean clearly we're benefiting from an easier compare in a strong market demand, and we see that continuing. But even with that, bookings at $44 billion, growing 25% year-to-date, and that's off a base of record sales through Q3 of last year. And then you couple that with 54 clients with bookings over $100 million through Q3, which is more in the first 9 months of this year than the whole of last year FY '20 and FY '19. 
And I mentioned that, as you talk about things in different ways, we may need to manage differently just to talk about the scale in our bookings. If you look at the scale and revenue, we grew record $2.3 billion in revenue this quarter year-over-year. And you think about our industries, where we're clearly the leader with the breadth and depth of industries, we had 11 of those 13 growing double digits. And as I mentioned before in our guidance, the increase in our full year outlook, it's driven by organic revenue, given that inorganic contribution is staying pretty much the same. 
And then you end it all with profitability of 40 basis points expansion this quarter. We had very strong profitability and we're no longer benefiting from a travel tailwind, and we continue to invest at scale in our business and our people. 
So with that, let me hand it over more to Julie to round out some of the questions you had on demand and attrition."

And so I want to just take you all back to right before the pandemic, remember back then. And on March 1, we put in a new growth model we called the next-gen growth model. And that was designed for helping us manage our business as we saw the scale increasing, right? And that change in up in growth model was focused on being able to have more of our leaders closer to our clients. We changed the P&L, as you recall, to the geographic. And so we've already put in place a model that is designed to allow us to continue to scale. And so this, for us, was anticipated, and it's exciting to see how we are very uniquely positioned as our clients' needs have accelerated because that's what's driving the demand, right? The needs of our clients have accelerated post COVID to do compressed transformation, and we have the right operating model in place. 
As we think about attrition, it's ticked up to pre-COVID letter -- levels in a hot market, although not the highest we've ever seen. And so as you said, it's an industry phenomenon and we're comfortable. I mean our core competency is about managing our supply and demand, but more importantly, our core competency is being a great company to work for. And as you saw with our numbers this quarter, we hired net 32,000 incredible people. And that is just a testament to our ability to attract great talent as well as continue to train our people. We've trained over 100,000 people since the pandemic started, pivoting to the areas of our clients' needs.

Now we predicted this, just as we predicted back in 2013, that someday everybody would be a digital business. And so we've been investing. We've already made, I don't know, 7, 8, 9 acquisitions over the last several years to build these capabilities. And you saw that with all the examples that we did in the script. And so this is about rapidly scaling with some of the best engineers in the world, right, because we see the market opportunity, but most importantly, the need from our clients.

I think it's too early and we're not going to kind of back into sort of giving sort of a view of FY '22, but what we would say is we do believe that what you're seeing right now in demand isn't just like a recovery because spending decreased, but actually sustained demand and that we are incredibly well positioned to capture that because clients are looking for outcomes and the breadth of our services. They're turning to us because we can give them solutions, not just individual services. They want the innovation that we're bringing, the things like our SynOps platform. They are very appreciative and focused on the fact that we care about the 360-degree value so that we're helping improve their own skills as well as achieving their goals. And finally, and I think something that is really critical right now and why we are so well positioned, is they see us a company that creates value and leads with values. And so trust really matters when you are doing major transformation. 
And I'll give you one example. We've had over 80 clients in the last 12 months just come and sit down with us to learn more about our diversity supplier program, because it really matters to them and they see us as a leader, right? These are the things that make us an incredibly attractive and trusted partner.

You know us well, managing our pyramid, increasing the use of automation and just overall delivery efficiency. So that's the first part on wages as it relates to operating margin. 
And just coming back to the same point on V&A. So let me just give you a little bit more color on V&A, coupled with what I talked about a little bit earlier, and of course I'm not going to give any specific guidance for FY '22 until September. But we do expect to have a higher level of inorganic contribution next year, probably around something closer to 4%. And that's really due to the fact that we're deploying about $4 billion in FY '21. A larger portion of that is closer to the later part of the year, and we expect to benefit from more of that revenue in FY '22. 
We also expect at this time to deploy somewhere around $4 billion in FY '22. That's including umlaut, which we expect to close next year, early in the year. 
And of course, as Julie said, we always have -- we've always said we have the ability to do more, but that's our line of sight today. But -- and it's up to us to manage our -- all the levers that we have at our disposal, to continue within the perimeters of clients and our overhead and structural costs to make sure that we continue to drive modest margin expansion while investing at scale in our business and our people."

Before diving into our results, thank you to our 624,000 incredibly talented people around the world, including over 8,500 Managing Directors. This past fiscal year, your hard work and dedication to creating value that matters for our clients was unwavering despite the ongoing and sometimes quite extreme challenges of COVID. 
We've had a truly extraordinary year as reflected in our outstanding financial results and in the 360-degree value we delivered beyond our financials. From the over 120,000 promotions and over 31 million training hours, an increase of 43% for our people, to increasing our workforce by approximately 118,000 people creating significant employment opportunities in our communities, to achieving 46% women on our way to our goal of gender parity by 2025, to our top 3 ranking in the Refinitiv Global Diversity and Inclusion Index for the fourth consecutive year, to the #1 position with our largest ecosystem partners, to the exciting accomplishment of 50% renewable energy now powering our offices and centers globally, to the donation of $54 million in COVID surge release. 
In December, we will publish our first ever annual 360-degree value report to more fully describe the FY '21 value we created in all directions and we'll report against 3 additional key ESG frameworks, SASB, TCFD, and WEFIBC. 
We believe that the trust we have from our clients and partners, our continuous innovation and our ability to consistently attract the best people, including the 56,000 net new hires this past quarter are directly linked to our commitment to measuring our success by how well we create this 360-degree value for all our stakeholders, clients, people, partners, shareholders and communities and on our culture of shared success. 
Here are some key financial highlights of the year, which position us strongly as we begin FY '22. FY '21 demonstrated our leadership in helping our clients achieve compressed transformation, with 72 clients with bookings greater than $100 million compared to 53 last year. And 229 Diamond clients, our largest client relationships compared to 216 last year. 
With a 20% increase in bookings to $59 billion, we have strong momentum across all dimensions of our business across geographic markets, industries and services, reaching revenues of $50.5 billion, a significant milestone, representing 11% growth, we added $6.2 billion in revenue this year, gaining significant market share with 40 basis points of operating margin expansion, demonstrating yet again our ability to grow profitably and at scale. 
We achieved this profitable growth while investing at a higher level than ever before with $4.2 billion in acquisitions, $1.1 billion in R&D in assets, platforms and industry solutions, including growing our portfolio of patents and pending patents to more than 8,200 and total training investment of $900 million. And according to Brand Z, our brand value increased 56% to over $64 billion, ranking us #27 on the prestigious Brand Z Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands List. 
Finally, I want to highlight cloud and our ability to move with agility to serve our clients' needs and capture momentum in the market. At the beginning of FY '21, after investing in cloud for a decade, we saw that the pandemic would dramatically accelerate our clients' move to the cloud. More than technology, the move to the cloud would be about the adoption of a new operating system for the future enterprise, a dynamic continuum of capabilities from public to edge to everything in between, opening up radically new ways for companies to work, compete and drive value. 
Just over 1 year ago, we created Accenture Cloud First to capitalize on this momentum, bringing together all of our capabilities from migration to cloud native development, data, AI, industry talent and change. Accenture Cloud First was the biggest driver of our overall cloud business growth from $12 billion to $18 billion, a 44% increase. 
KC, over to you."

We were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which completes an outstanding year for Accenture and reflect broad-based momentum across all dimensions of our busines",1122,"Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which completes an outstanding year for Accenture and reflect broad-based momentum across all dimensions of our business. Once again, our results reflect our relentless focus to deliver across our 3 key imperatives for driving superior stakeholder value. 
So let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights of the quarter. Revenue growth of 21% in local currency, at the top end of our guided range, reflects double-digit growth across all markets, all industry groups and all services. We also continue to extend our leadership position at an accelerated pace with growth significantly above the market. 
Operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 30 basis points for the quarter, reflecting 40 basis points of expansion for the full year. We delivered this expansion while investing significantly in our business and in our people to position us for long-term market leadership. We delivered very strong EPS of $2.20, which represents growth 29% compared to adjusted EPS last year. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2.2 billion, which was driven by continued strong growth and profitability. 
Now let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $15 billion for the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were $8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.1 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. We were very pleased with our new bookings, which represents 7% growth in U.S. dollars with 18 clients with bookings over $100 million. We were also pleased with the strength of bookings across all services with a book-to-bill 1 in strategy and consulting, 1.2 in technology services, and 1.1 in operations. 
Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $13.4 billion, a 24% increase in U.S. dollars and 21% in local currency, slightly above our FX-adjusted range, as the FX tailwind was 3% compared to the 4% estimated last quarter. 
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $7.3 billion, up 29% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6.1 billion, up 19% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. 
Taking a closer look at our service dimensions. Strategy and consulting, technology services, and operations all grew very strong double digits. 
Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 22% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, software and platforms and public service. In Europe, revenues grew 18% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, industrial and banking and capital markets. 
Looking closer at the countries. Europe was driven by double-digit growth in the U.K., Germany, France and Italy. In growth markets, we delivered 21% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, banking and capital markets and high tech. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan, Australia and Brazil. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.3% compared to 31.8% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.3% compared with 10.6% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 7.4% compared to 6.8% for the same quarter last year. 
Operating income was $2 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.6% operating margin, up 30 basis points compared with Q4 last year. As a reminder, in Q4 last year, we recorded an investment gain that impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.29 for the quarter. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 28.4% for the fourth quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.20 compared with adjusted EPS of $1.70 in the fourth quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 38 days compared to 36 days last quarter and 35 days in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $236 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $8.2 billion compared with $8.4 billion at August 31 last year. 
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3 million shares for $915 million at an average price of $305.61 per share. Also, in August, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share for a total of $558 million. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share to be paid on November 15, a 10% increase over last year and approved $3 billion of additional share repurchase authority. 
Now I would like to take a moment to summarize our outstanding year. We are extremely pleased with the performance of our business in fiscal year '21, greatly exceeding all aspects of our original outlook that we provided last September. We delivered $59 billion in new bookings, a 20% increase in U.S. dollars over last year, which positions us well as we begin fiscal year '22. 
Revenues increased a record $6.2 billion, hitting the $50 billion mark, reflecting growth of 11% in local currency for the full year. This result, which is more than double the revenue growth we anticipated at the beginning of the year, showcases our agility and ability to quickly scale to deliver value and outcomes for our clients. 
Operating margin of 15.1% reflected a 40 basis point expansion over fiscal year '20, above the top end of our original guided range, even after making continued significant investments in our business and our people. Adjusted earnings per share were $8.80 reflecting 18% growth over adjusted FY '20 EPS and was well above our revenue growth. As a reminder, we adjusted earnings in both years to exclude gains on investment. 
Free cash flow of $8.4 billion was significantly above our original guided range, reflecting a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.5, driven by strong profitability. And finally, we significantly exceeded our original guidance for capital allocation by returning $5.9 billion of cash to shareholders while investing roughly $4.2 billion across 46 acquisitions to acquire critical skills and capabilities in strategic high-growth areas of the market. 
So again, FY '21 was truly an outstanding year. Momentum continues into fiscal '22, and we are laser-focused on capturing the market opportunities, coupled with the disciplined execution that you and we expect of us. 
Now let me turn it back to Julie."

Turning to the demand environment. Compressed transformation underpinned by cloud and digital continues to drive strong double-digit growth across our business, including for Applied Intelligence, cloud, Industry X, Intelligent Operations, interactive, Intelligent Platform Services, security and transformational change management. 
Technology is the single biggest driver of change in companies today, and the depth breadth and scale of our technology capabilities across our services is unmatched. We see this environment shaping up for FY '22 to be more of the same. While digital leaders seeking to widen their competitive advantage and companies seeking to reprog their cloud and digital transformation are driving momentum in our business. The vast majority of companies are early in their transformation. And whether digital leader, leapfrogger, laggard or in between, all face multiyear journeys ahead of them because the replatforming in the cloud and use of new technologies across the enterprise is a once-in-a-digital era profound transformation. 
Simultaneously, we have ongoing exponential technology change that is accelerating and will create new opportunities, disruptions and change for our clients. In addition, growth in parts of our business are, by their very nature, continuously evolving. For example, Interactive, now a $12.5 billion business growing 15%, continues to set a new standard for customer experience, connections, sales and marketing at the intersection of data, creativity and technology and is tied to the ever-changing needs and preferences of B2C and B2B customers. 
Similarly, security, now a $4.4 billion business growing 29%, is driven by needs related to an ever-expanding digital threat landscape. And with our managed services is providing much needed protection and talent to our clients. 
Our clients value the depth and breadth of our services for the entire enterprise, across strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations and industry and functional expertise across 13 industries, plus the ability to deliver tangible outcomes as well as our strong track record of investing ahead of our clients to anticipate their needs to drive our next wave of growth, such as our early moves in digital, cloud and security. 
There remain entire parts of the enterprise for which digitization and the move to the cloud has only just begun. In particular, both the things companies make and the way they make things are being dramatically changed by technology. And that is the focus of our Industry X business, which we believe is the next big digital frontier. In fact, a 2021 Gartner survey of Board of Directors indicates that 93% expect that the #1 business priority that will see transformational improvement from digital technology is manufacturing, distribution and supply chain. 
We have invested for nearly a decade in Industry X and are now at approximately $5 billion in revenue, growing 36%. We look forward to welcoming the 4,200 industry-leading engineers and consultants of umlaut when the acquisition closes in October. 
Similarly, sustainability is a critical area for which technology is still evolving. We believe that every business must be a sustainable business, and yet companies are at very early stages of figuring out how to make this shift. 
Last year, building on years of investment and experience, we launched our sustainability services under our new Chief Responsibility Officer and Global Sustainability Services lead. We have continued to accelerate our focus in this expanding and changing market, and are proud of the work we are doing with leading partners like Mastercard as we enhance its ability to track and analyze the carbon emissions of their suppliers and help decarbonize the U.K. energy system with clients such as National Grid. 
We do see a shift in the nature of the demand for our managed services across IT, security and operations with these services emerging as one of our most strategic differentiators. As companies simultaneously seek greater resilience, face a war for talent, the need to rapidly digitize and cost pressures, strategic managed services are increasingly a C-suite priority with the extent of the trusted partner of choice and increasingly integrated as a part of their talent strategy. 
Table stakes from managed services are efficiency, resiliency and reliability. We further differentiate in our managed services because they are uniquely informed by our strong strategy and consulting capabilities and deep industry and functional advertise. And they benefit from our strong level of investment for digital platforms like SynOps and myWizard. And the seamless integration with our ecosystem partners, as well as due to the incredible pool of talented people our clients can access quickly when partnering with us. 
For example, we are partnering with Olympus, a leading manufacturer of optical and digital precision technology to help them drive their transformation to become a global medical technology company. As part of this partnership, we have acquired their Japanese IT subsidiary company, which we will transform to deliver significant IT cost savings to Olympus as well as upskill their people, combining their knowledge with our talent and technology to lead Olympus' digital transformation. 
Now let me bring to life some more of the demand we are seeing. All of these examples bring together the diverse capabilities across Accenture to create tangible value. We are a leader in cloud because we're able to serve our clients across the cloud continuum and create business value. 
We are partnering with Kubota, a Japanese multinational company, providing solutions leveraging a diverse range of products, technologies and services in the fields of food, water and the environment to accelerate Kubota's digital transformation by creating solutions that will enhance the productivity and safety of food, promote circularity of water resources and waste and improve urban and living environments. We will help create innovative sustainability solutions and a platform applying leading-edge digital technologies, including AI and IoT. First data held across the group will be centralized for using maintenance and use. We're also modernizing replacing or migrating legacy applications to the cloud and strengthening their global computer security incident response team. 
We are partnering with Jabil, a U.S.-based global manufacturing services company to further enhance their IT infrastructure capabilities through providing infrastructure managed services for digital workplace, network, cloud, and data center support. 
We're helping [ Finya ], a Finnish insurer offering casualty, motor and health and accident services to implement a cloud-based policy administration system to improve customer service, using data and automation to make sales, claims, payments and policy management processes more user-friendly. This will allow the company to quickly respond to changing market and customer lands and meet its goal of providing the best customer experience in the industry. 
Compressed transformation is occurring across industries. We're partnering with Unilever, one of the world's largest consumer goods companies in their digital transformation. Together, we are setting a new industry standard by reinventing technology delivery with cutting-edge automation, delivering cloud migration at scale, the largest ERP migration to the cloud and the industry and shifting to technology solutions that support their growth strategy. 
With McCormick, a global leader in flavor in the food industry, where we are partnering on a strategic transformation program, encompassing finance, supply and logistics, and plant maintenance. The new cloud-based platform and innovative data-driven approach will help standardize processes, increase efficiencies and support their goal of doubling in size quickly. 
We're helping a European financial institution build the bank of the future and helping them become a next level innovator, one that is leveraging technology and sustainability to transform multiple parts of their business drive hyper-personalized customer experience and create new lines of business like wealth management and insurance, which is expected to triple digital sales by 2023 and improve their already stellar cost-to-income ratio. At the same time, we're helping them deliver on their ESG initiatives, including inclusive financing, green software and carbon data-free data centers. 
At Accenture, we're enabling new experience in growth and cost transformation across the enterprise and across industries. And the key enabler to these innovative scaled service is the power of our operations capabilities. We are helping Open Fiber, an Italian telecommunications company design and orchestrate construction of an ultra broadband network, which will deliver fiber to 20 million households across Italy. Digitization and automation will help the construction site to proceed faster and more efficiently. 
With Interactive, we're helping MediaMarkt Saturn Retail Group, Europe's leading consumer electronics retailer, transform their digital content capabilities with a state-of-the-art marketing operation. Automation and data insights enabled by SynOps will help deliver more engaging and personalized content while driving millions in savings. 
Our industry expertise continues to be a core competitive and manage, allowing us to be deep industry and cross-industry knowledge enterprise-wide for our clients. I want to recognize, in particular, our software and platform industry, which is approximately $4 billion in revenue. In Q4, this group celebrated 20 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, serving as a leading partner to our clients in this hyper growth industry. 
KC, back to you."

For the first quarter of fiscal '22, we expect revenue to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about positive 0.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '21, and reflects an estimated 18% to 22% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '22, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results, in U.S. dollars, will be approximately negative 0.5% compared to fiscal '21. For the full fiscal '22, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 12% to 15% growth in local currency over fiscal '21, which includes an inorganic contribution of about 5% as we continue to expect to invest about $4 billion in acquisitions. 
For operating margin, we expect fiscal year '22 to be 15.2% to 15.4%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '21 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal '21. 
For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '22 to be in the range of $9.90 to $10.18, or 13% to 16% growth over adjusted fiscal '21 results. For the full fiscal '22, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. 
Finally, we expect to return at least $6.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

Accenture has, I would argue, a very special culture, and you're bringing in a lot of new people over the course of the last 12 months and the forward next 12 months. How do you think about the risk of a simulation of these deals? And how do you manage this process? You have a very good track record over the last 10 years, but there is a lot of M&A on the table that you're bringing in the company.

And so this step-up in acquisitions comes based on years of experience, including and fine-tuning integration. So that's number one. 
Secondly, our acquisitions happen globally. And then as I've talked about this year, they're pretty evenly balanced. And why is that important? When we switched to our model earlier this year of a geographic-focused model, from a P&L perspective. One of the reasons is to allow us as well to be super core people. And most of these acquisitions are not global, right? 
Some market, umlaut, but like, for example, Project Nevada in the federal business, very local. And the vast majority are in 1 or 2 markets. Like -- and so the integration, it's not like you have this enormous company that's trying to integrate lots of people all over the globe at the same time. We have senior leaders accountable for the acquisitions. 
And so we really get the right balance, and we have our own -- and so for example, when we look at this, we look at market by market, how many acquisitions are we doing in this market? So how does that enable us make sure that we can spend the time. 
So this is a finely tuned approach for integration. And of course, we bring on people in acquisition or not, all the time. And so focus on culture is just part of who we are."

And I talked to -- first of all, and I talked a little bit about this in the script, we are still very early in the transformation of companies in building just their digital core. So for example, if you look at something like SAP, their stats that they point out, you sort of have less than 20% of companies who've actually both bought and begun implementing S/4HANA, right? And we see the move to the cloud, you've got sort of maybe today, roughly 25% to 30% of workloads. 
So there's a lot of work, which is a multiyear journey, in actually building the digital core and then, at the same time, transforming the way they work. And so we've got multiyear ahead. And even when you look at who's doing compressed transformation, you have this core of leaders and leapfroggers, but the vast majority of companies are not yet engaged in compressed transformation. 
So just from a multiyear outlook on the fundamentals of replatforming and moving to a digital-enabled enterprises still in early stages. When you add on top of that, there are a whole part of the enterprise where even the technologies are really new. 
So Industry X is a great example of that. We see that as the next digital frontier. And we're still very, very early. And so that will be kind of its own wave as we look forward. And then areas like sustainability. Again, technology is early. Every industry has to find its way on sustainability. 
And so as we think about our own growth strategy, it starts with what our clients need. So we continue to diversify the parts of the enterprise that we're serving and that enables -- that's what our clients need, and that enables next waves of growth for us. And we continue to innovate and anticipate, like in sustainability, what our clients need. And so when you kind of take this, you see both from serving the enterprise, the maturity of -- to that and then you add on top of that, that there are areas that are evergreen. Like Interactive, it's all about clients, the growth agenda. It's always going to change. Manufacturing will be the same. Security grows as the digital landscape grows. 
So hopefully, that gives you a flavor of how we're thinking about both our next waves of growth and just the resiliency of the diversity of what we do."

So we have industry specific, we have marketing services to that. 
Then, of course, there are powerful IT services, we've been doing outsourcing for years, right -- term application outsourcing is an industry term. And then we have our managed services and security. We bought Symantec last year. And so this is a core part when you think about our revenue between consulting and outsourcing. 
And the point that's happening now is that we've always done this, but what we're seeing is -- I just had a call with a CEO the other day, who's like he started the call was like Julie, I'm really having a hard time hiring people in digital, right? And how are you seeing companies help. And we talked about how by strategically outsourcing like in security, in marketing, you can access the digital talent, and it becomes part of their own talent strategy to address the war for talent, while at the same time, digitizing faster. 
I have another client that said, look, you had 50 things that my IT department was about to build in order for us to automate and transform, and I get it through your SynOps platform. The same, too, on the IT and infrastructure side. And of course, infrastructure managed services in the cloud, growing area as well from the move to the cloud. 
So I think the shift that we're calling out, Lisa, though, is just how strategic this is at a time of compressed transformation because it's meeting the needs of the war on talent and the need to digitize and the need to move fast at the same time."

They can just be a little bit lumpy, but it was a very strong performance. But let me just maybe talk a little bit about overall bookings as we head into '22. 
We do feel really good about the momentum in our business. And as Julie went through, we have 72 clients with bookings over $100 million this year. And you can see that then helping us as we head into FY '22, Bryan, with the 18% to 22% that we have in Q1. And you also see that in our 12% to 15% revenue range that we have for fiscal '22. 
I think it's important to also note that it does include about 5% inorganic contribution. But at the top end of our revenue range, again, driven by bookings, it's going to represent about 10% organic growth at the upper end. And while we do benefit from an easier compare in the first half, it does continue to imply strong organic growth in the second half. 
And if you look at why is that, when you peel back bookings, again, pleased with the $15 billion that we had in Q4, strong book-to-bill is 1.1. It is $60 billion for the whole year with double-digit growth in consulting. And I think it's important to also note, in consulting bookings, we had $8 billion for the last 3 quarters, which is terrific. And outsourcing, which for the entire year, kind of very strong book-to-bill of 1.2 in all 3 markets, and services. 
And when you peel it back, there's really 3 things, again, just peeling back bookings for you, there are 3 things that I would also note. One is that, yes, we did have a lot of larger bookings that help us for -- position us well to the future throughout FY '22. But we had a nice mix all the way through to the small deals, which benefit near-term revenue. 
The second thing is that the bookings were very broad-based across all of our services, and that includes strategy and consulting, which is really good as well. 
And lastly, their line as Julie talked quite a bit about our strategic priorities: Cloud, industry action security, for example."

And when you think about the actions we've taken, like, a record number of 120,000 promotions, the training that we're providing people that's really valued. And then, frankly, things like the way that we have approached vaccines, right? So we've now vaccinated 85,000 of our people and their families directly in addition to what we're supporting through -- like in the U.S., through our carriers. 
And as I talked a little bit about in the script, what we find is people really care about the fact that they are working for a company that focuses on financials and all of the other, what we call, 360-degree value. So what we're doing in sustainability, being a leader that we're going to be carbon neutral by 2025, really matters. 
And so we continue to look at how can we help our people be net better off, succeed personally and professionally and be proud of the company that not only creates value, but leads with values."

And I guess, do you think you need to kind of sustain the recent pace of hiring going forward? 
And I guess, the -- my second question, I'll just throw it in at the same time, is back to V&A. You talked about the kind of the inorganic contribution and integration. But is this kind of the recent pace that we've seen? Is this also something that you expect to need to sustain and want to sustain on a go-forward basis, whether in terms of number of deals or amount that you're spending, et cetera?"

And we were able to accelerate some of our hiring. 
And we plan to continue to do so in quarter 1 in order to have the talented people that we need to match demand in the market. And so that's to your first question on hiring.

And I just -- I think it's just to remember, taking a step back, on 2 things.

And we're able to do that. And I think that's a huge differentiator for us. 
And secondly, we made a decision last year, and we've made a decision this year in V&A to really invest and take advantage of our ability to invest to serve our clients. And when I go to clients, one of the things that we talk about is, and clients really value, is that when they're partnering with us, they're partnering not just for the capabilities we have today, but because we have a track record of investing year in and year out in creating and anticipating their needs. And we point to the kinds of acquisitions like in umlaut, like in Nevada, like Infinity Works and clouds that we're doing it in markets all around the world to benefit them. 
And so we believe this is really setting us up last year and this year, right, for those next waves of growth, and it's truly differentiating in the eyes of our clients."

And I don't mean to imply that getting revenue growth is easy, but if you have to worry less about revenue growth, given the investments you've already made, do you have the opportunity to change your financial model to accelerate, get higher gross margins, better G&A leverage, thoughts on moving to a more nonlinear model with solutions, maybe especially important given that you're at 620,000 people?"

I think, Ashwin, our financial model really remains the same in terms of the 3 key imperatives that you hear us go through each year, which is grow faster than the market takes share; modest margin expansion while investing at scale in our business and our people. So in the last part, maybe just talk about margins. 
So we are very proud of the 10 to 30 that we have this year. That does imply, obviously, that we will continue to get efficiencies in how we run our business, both in terms of how we deliver to our clients as well as within the SG&A and how we run our own organization."

I'm glad you acknowledged that revenue growth is not easy. So thank you for that. But I -- just taking a step back just to make sure because I think over the last decade, we've seen a real shift in the professional services industry. The nature of the exponential technology change, and the need to help clients move faster and do so more efficiently has meant that you need to be able to invest significantly. 
So as we think about moving forward, like the investments we've done to build SynOps, like to -- and continue to evolve it, to build industry solutions, as you mentioned, require us to continuously innovate, invest. You saw that in our IP patent portfolio. 
And so what I would say is it's not that you sort of say, here's the revenue and then can you just fundamentally shift because there is significant cost. Having all aspects of our business grow like this is not simply because there's demand. It's the solutions we're bringing them. 
And as I've talked about in prior earnings call, it isn't linear today even because we've automated so much of what we do when you look at something like our operations business, you look at myWizard, and we continue to do so. And that's really part of the business now. 
And so I think it's important to kind of understand what's helping drive the demand for our services and our -- the way we're gaining market share is not simply because there's a lot of demand in the market, but the solutions we're bringing. And this is our big differentiator because we can go all the way from strategy to operations, right? 
All of the examples we're giving involve multiple aspects of our services and you can't just build that overnight either, right? So the fact that we're becoming integrated in talent strategy, in our outsourcing, in our -- also called managed services, is about being trusted. And the fact that we could deliver during the pandemic and be a trusted partner puts us in a very different place than others who might be trying to build these capabilities."

Before diving into our results, thank you to our 624,000 incredibly talented people around the world, including over 8,500 Managing Directors. This past fiscal year, your hard work and dedication to creating value that matters for our clients was unwavering despite the ongoing and sometimes quite extreme challenges of COVID.  
We've had a truly extraordinary year as reflected in our outstanding financial results and in the 360-degree value we delivered beyond our financials. From the over 120,000 promotions and over 31 million training hours, an increase of 43% for our people; to increasing our workforce by approximately 118,000 people, creating significant employment opportunities in our communities; to achieving 46% women on our way to our goal of gender parity by 2025; to our top 3 ranking in the Refinitiv Global Diversity and Inclusion Index for the fourth consecutive year; to the #1 position with our largest ecosystem partners; to the exciting accomplishment of 50% renewable energy now powering our offices and centers globally; to the donation of $54 million in COVID surge relief.  
In December, we will publish our first-ever annual 360-degree value report to more fully describe the FY '21 value we created in all directions, and we'll report against 3 additional key ESG frameworks: SASB, TCFD, and WEF IBC.  
We believe that the trust we have from our clients and partners, our continuous innovation and our ability to consistently attract the best people, including the 56,000 net new hires this past quarter are directly linked to our commitment to measuring our success by how well we create this 360-degree value for all our stakeholders, clients, people, partners, shareholders and communities and on our culture of shared success.  
Here are some key financial highlights of the year, which position us strongly as we begin FY '22. FY '21 demonstrated our leadership in helping our clients achieve compressed transformation, with 72 clients with bookings greater than $100 million compared to 53 last year and 229 Diamond clients, our largest client relationship compared to 216 last year.  
With a 20% increase in bookings to $59 billion, we have strong momentum across all dimensions of our business across geographic markets, industries and services, reaching revenues of $50.5 billion, a significant milestone, representing 11% growth. We added $6.2 billion in revenue this year, gaining significant market share, with 40 basis points of operating margin expansion, demonstrating yet again our ability to grow profitably and at scale.  
We achieved this profitable growth while investing at a higher level than ever before, with $4.2 billion in acquisitions, $1.1 billion in R&D in assets, platforms and industry solutions, including growing our portfolio of patents and pending patents to more than 8,200 and total training investment of $900 million. And according to BrandZ, our brand value increased 56% to over $64 billion, ranking us #27 on the prestigious BrandZ's Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands list.  
Finally, I want to highlight cloud and our ability to move with agility to serve our clients' needs and capture momentum in the market. At the beginning of FY '21, after investing in cloud for a decade, we saw that the pandemic would dramatically accelerate our clients' move to the cloud. More than technology, the move to the cloud would be about the adoption of a new operating system for the future enterprise, a dynamic continuum of capabilities from public to edge to everything in between, opening up radically new ways for companies to work, compete and drive value.  
Just over 1 year ago, we created Accenture Cloud First to capitalize on this momentum, bringing together all of our capabilities from migration to cloud-native development, data, AI, industry talent and change. Accenture Cloud First was the biggest driver of our overall cloud business growth, from $12 billion to $18 billion, a 44% increase.  
KC, over to you."

We were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which completes an outstanding year for Accenture and reflect broad-based momentum across all dimensions of our busines",1121,"Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which completes an outstanding year for Accenture and reflect broad-based momentum across all dimensions of our business. Once again, our results reflect our relentless focus to deliver across our 3 key imperatives for driving superior stakeholder value.  
So let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights of the quarter. Revenue growth of 21% in local currency, at the top end of our guided range, reflects double-digit growth across all markets, all industry groups and all services. We also continue to extend our leadership position at an accelerated pace, with growth significantly above the market.  
Operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 30 basis points for the quarter, reflecting 40 basis points of expansion for the full year. We delivered this expansion while investing significantly in our business and in our people to position us for long-term market leadership.  
We delivered very strong EPS of $2.20, which represents 29% growth compared to adjusted EPS last year. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2.2 billion, which was driven by continued strong growth and profitability.  
Now let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $15 billion for the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were $8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.1 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2.  We were very pleased with our new bookings, which represents 7% growth in U.S. dollars, with 18 clients with bookings over $100 million.  We were also pleased with the strength of bookings across all services, with a book-to-bill 1 in strategy and consulting, 1.2 in technology services, and 1.1 in operations.  
Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $13.4 billion, a 24% increase in U.S. dollars and 21% in local currency, slightly above our FX-adjusted range, as the FX tailwind was 3% compared to the 4% estimated last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $7.3 billion, up 29% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6.1 billion, up 19% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency.  
Taking a closer look at our service dimensions. Strategy and consulting, technology services and operations all grew very strong double digits.  
Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 22% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail and Travel Services, Software & Platforms and Public Service. In Europe, revenues grew 18% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail and Travel Services, Industrial and Banking & Capital Markets.  
Looking closer at the countries. Europe was driven by double-digit growth in the U.K., Germany, France and Italy. In growth markets, we delivered 21% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail and Travel Services, Banking & Capital Markets and high-tech. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan, Australia and Brazil.  
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.3% compared with 31.8% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.3% compared with 10.6% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 7.4% compared to 6.8% for the same quarter last year.  
Operating income was $2 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.6% operating margin, up 30 basis points compared with Q4 last year. As a reminder, in Q4 last year, we recorded an investment gain that impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.29 for the quarter. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results.  
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 28.4% for the fourth quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.20 compared with adjusted EPS of $1.70 in the fourth quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 38 days compared to 36 days last quarter and 35 days in the fourth quarter of last year.  
Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $236 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $8.2 billion compared with $8.4 billion at August 31 last year.  
With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3 million shares for $915 million at an average price of $305.61 per share. Also in August, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share for a total of $558 million. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share to be paid on November 15, a 10% increase over last year and approved $3 billion of additional share repurchase authority.  
Now I would like to take a moment to summarize our outstanding year. We are extremely pleased with the performance of our business in fiscal year '21, greatly exceeding all aspects of our original outlook that we provided last September. We delivered $59 billion in new bookings, a 20% increase in U.S. dollars over last year, which positions us well as we begin fiscal year '22.  
Revenues increased a record $6.2 billion, hitting the $50 billion mark, reflecting growth of 11% in local currency for the full year. This result, which is more than double the revenue growth we anticipated at the beginning of the year, showcases our agility and ability to quickly scale to deliver value and outcomes for our clients.  
Operating margin of 15.1% reflected a 40 basis point expansion over fiscal year '20, above the top end of our original guided range, even after making continued significant investments in our business and our people. Adjusted earnings per share were $8.80, reflecting 18% growth over adjusted FY '20 EPS and was well above our revenue growth. As a reminder, we adjusted earnings in both years to exclude gains on investment.  
Free cash flow of $8.4 billion was significantly above our original guided range, reflecting a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.5, driven by strong profitability. And finally, we significantly exceeded our original guidance for capital allocation by returning $5.9 billion of cash to shareholders, while investing roughly $4.2 billion across 46 acquisitions to acquire critical skills and capabilities in strategic, high-growth areas of the market.  
So again, FY '21 was truly an outstanding year. Momentum continues into fiscal '22, and we are laser-focused on capturing the market opportunities, coupled with the disciplined execution that you and we expect of us.  
Now let me turn it back to Julie."
972190,1680493454,2400506,"Accenture plc, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 23, 2021",2021-09-23,"Earnings Calls","Accenture plc","Executives","Thanks, KC. Turning to the demand environment. Compressed transformation underpinned by cloud and digital continues to drive strong double-digit growth across our business, including for Applied Intelligence, cloud, Industry X, intelligent operations, Int",1461,"Thanks, KC. Turning to the demand environment. Compressed transformation underpinned by cloud and digital continues to drive strong double-digit growth across our business, including for Applied Intelligence, cloud, Industry X, intelligent operations, Interactive, Intelligent Platform Services, security and transformational change management.  
Technology is the single biggest driver of change in companies today, and the depth, breadth and scale of our technology capabilities across our services is unmatched. We see the demand environment shaping up for FY '22 to be more of the same, while digital leaders seeking to widen their competitive advantage and companies seeking to leapfrog their cloud and digital transformation, are driving momentum in our business. The vast majority of companies are early in their transformation. And whether digital leader, leapfrogger, laggard or in between, all face multiyear journeys ahead of them because the replatforming in the cloud and use of new technologies across the enterprise is a once-in-a-digital era profound transformation.  
Simultaneously, we have ongoing exponential technology change that is accelerating and will create new opportunities, disruptions and change for our clients. In addition, growth in parts of our business are, by their very nature, continuously evolving. For example, Interactive, now a $12.5 billion business growing 15%, continues to set a new standard for customer experience, connections, sales and marketing at the intersection of data, creativity and technology and is tied to the ever-changing needs and preferences of B2C and B2B customers.  
Similarly, security, now a $4.4 billion business growing 29%, is driven by needs related to an ever-expanding digital threat landscape, and with our managed services is providing much-needed protection and talent to our clients.  
Our clients value the depth and breadth of our services for the entire enterprise, across strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations and industry and functional expertise across 13 industries, plus the ability to deliver tangible outcomes as well as our strong track record of investing ahead of our clients to anticipate their needs to drive our next waves of growth, such as our early moves in digital, cloud and security.  
There remain entire parts of the enterprise for which digitization and the move to the cloud has only just begun. In particular, both the things companies make and the way they make things are being dramatically changed by technology. And that is the focus of our Industry X business, which we believe is the next big digital frontier. In fact, a 2021 Gartner survey of Board of Directors indicates that 93% expect that the #1 business priority that will see transformational improvement from digital technology is manufacturing, distribution and supply chain.  
We have invested for nearly a decade in Industry X and are now at approximately $5 billion in revenue, growing 36%. We look forward to welcoming the 4,200 industry-leading engineers and consultants of umlaut when the acquisition closes in October.  
Similarly, sustainability is a critical area for which technology is still evolving. We believe that every business must be a sustainable business, and yet companies are at very early stages of figuring out how to make this shift.  
Last year, building on years of investment and experience, we launched our sustainability services under our new Chief Responsibility Officer and Global Sustainability Services lead. We have continued to accelerate our focus in this expanding and changing market, and are proud of the work we are doing with leading partners like Mastercard as we enhance its ability to track and analyze the carbon emissions of their suppliers and help decarbonize the U.K. energy system with clients such as National Grid.  
We do see a shift in the nature of the demand for our managed services across IT, security and operations, with these services emerging as one of our most strategic differentiators. As companies simultaneously seek greater resilience, face a war for talent, the need to rapidly digitize and cost pressures, strategic managed services are increasingly a C-suite priority, with Accenture as the trusted partner of choice and increasingly integrated as a part of their talent strategy.  
Table stakes from managed services are efficiency, resiliency and reliability. We further differentiate in our managed services because they are uniquely informed by our strong strategy and consulting capabilities and deep industry and functional expertise. And they benefit from our strong level of investment for digital platforms like SynOps and myWizard, and the seamless integration with our ecosystem partners as well as due to the incredible pool of talented people our clients can access quickly when partnering with us.  
For example, we are partnering with Olympus, a leading manufacturer of optical and digital precision technology to help them drive their transformation to become a global medical technology company. As part of this partnership, we have acquired their Japanese IT subsidiary company, which we will transform to deliver significant IT cost savings to Olympus as well as upskill their people, combining their knowledge with our talent and technology to lead Olympus' digital transformation.  
Now let me bring to life some more of the demand we are seeing. All of these examples bring together the diverse capabilities across Accenture to create tangible value. We are a leader in cloud because we're able to serve our clients across the cloud continuum and create business value.  
We are partnering with Kubota, a Japanese multinational company, providing solutions leveraging a diverse range of products, technologies and services in the fields of food, water and the environment to accelerate Kubota's digital transformation by creating solutions that will enhance the productivity and safety of food, promote circularity of water resources and waste and improve urban and living environments. We will help create innovative sustainability solutions and a platform applying leading-edge digital technologies, including AI and IoT. Diverse data held across the group will be centralized for easing maintenance and use. We're also modernizing, replacing or migrating legacy applications to the cloud and strengthening their global computer security incident response team.  
We are partnering with Jabil, a U.S.-based global manufacturing services company to further enhance their IT infrastructure capabilities through providing infrastructure managed services for digital workplace, network, cloud and data center support.  
We're helping Fennia, a Finnish insurer offering casualty, motor and health and accident services to implement a cloud-based policy administration system to improve customer service using data and automation to make sales, claims, payments and policy management processes more user-friendly. This will allow the company to quickly respond to changing market and customer demands and meet its goal of providing the best customer experience in the industry.  
Compressed transformation is occurring across industries. We're partnering with Unilever, one of the world's largest consumer goods companies in their digital transformation. Together, we are setting a new industry standard by reinventing technology delivery with cutting-edge automation, delivering cloud migration at scale, the largest ERP migration to the cloud and the industry and shifting to technology solutions that support their growth strategy.  
With McCormick, a global leader in flavor in the food industry, where we are partnering on a strategic transformation program, encompassing finance, supply chain, logistics and plant maintenance. The new cloud-based platform and innovative data-driven approach will help standardize processes, increase efficiencies and support their goal of doubling in size quickly.  
We're helping a European financial institution build the bank of the future and helping them become a next-level innovator, one that is leveraging technology and sustainability to transform multiple parts of their business, drive hyper-personalized customer experience and create new lines of business like wealth management and insurance, which is expected to triple digital sales by 2023 and improve their already stellar cost-to-income ratio.  At the same time, we're helping them deliver on their ESG initiatives, including inclusive financing, green software and carbon data-free data centers.  
At Accenture, we're enabling new experience in growth and cost transformation across the enterprise and across industries. And the key enabler to these innovative scaled service is the power of our operations capabilities. We are helping Open Fiber, an Italian telecommunications company, design and orchestrate construction of an ultra broadband network, which will deliver fiber to 20 million households across Italy. Digitization and automation will help the construction site to proceed faster and more efficiently.  
With Interactive, we're helping MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group, Europe's leading consumer electronics retailer, transform their digital content capabilities with a state-of-the-art marketing operation. Automation and data insights enabled by SynOps will help deliver more engaging and personalized content while driving millions in savings.  
Our industry expertise continues to be a core competitive advantage, allowing us to breathe deep industry and cross-industry knowledge enterprise-wide for our clients. I want to recognize, in particular, our software and platform industry, which is approximately $4 billion in revenue. In Q4, this group celebrated 20 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, serving as a leading partner to our clients in this hyper-growth industry.  
KC, back to you."

For the first quarter of fiscal '22, we expect revenues to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about positive 0.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '21, and reflects an estimated 18% to 22% growth in local currency. 
For the full fiscal year '22, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars, will be approximately negative 0.5% compared to fiscal '21. For the full fiscal '22, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 12% to 15% growth in local currency over fiscal '21, which includes an inorganic contribution of about 5% as we continue to expect to invest about $4 billion in acquisitions. 
For operating margin, we expect fiscal year '22 to be 15.2% to 15.4%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '21 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal '21. 
For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '22 to be in the range of $9.90 to $10.18, or 13% to 16% growth over adjusted fiscal '21 results. For the full fiscal '22, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. 
Finally, we expect to return at least $6.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

How do you think about the risk of a simulation of these deals? And how do you manage this process? You have a very good track record over the last 10 years, but there is a lot of M&A on the table that you're bringing in the company.

And so this step-up in acquisitions comes based on years of experience, including in fine-tuning integration. So that's number one. 
Secondly, our acquisitions happen globally. And then as I've talked about this year, they're pretty evenly balanced. And why is that important? When we switched to our model earlier this year of a geographic-focused model from a P&L perspective, one of the reasons is to allow us as well to be super close to our people. And most of these acquisitions are not global, right? 
Some are like an umlaut, but like, for example, Project Novetta in the federal business, very local. And the vast majority are in 1 or 2 markets. Like there -- and so the integration, it's not like you have this enormous company that's trying to integrate lots of people all over the globe at the same time. We have senior leaders accountable for the acquisitions. 
And so we really get the right balance, and we have our own. And so for example, when we look at this, we look at market by market, how many acquisitions are we doing in this market? So how does that enable us make sure that we can spend the time?
So this is a finely tuned approach for integration. And of course, we bring on people in acquisition or not, all the time. And so this focus on culture is just part of who we are."

So first of all, and I talked a little bit about this in the script, we are still very early in the transformation of companies in building just their digital core. So for example, if you look at something like SAP, their stats that they point out, you sort of have less than 20% of companies who've actually both bought and begun implementing S/4HANA, right? And we see the move to the cloud, you've got sort of maybe today, roughly 25% to 30% of workload. 
So there's a lot of work, which is a multiyear journey, in actually building the digital core and then, at the same time, transforming the way they work. And so we've got multiyear ahead. And even when you look at who's doing compressed transformation, you have this core of leaders and leapfroggers, but the vast majority of companies are not yet engaged in compressed transformation. 
So just from a multiyear outlook on the fundamentals of replatforming and moving to a true digital-enabled enterprises still in early stages. When you add on top of that, there are whole parts of the enterprise where even the technologies are really new. 
So Industry X is a great example of that. We see that as the next digital frontier, and we're still very, very early. And so that will be kind of its own wave as we look forward. And then areas like sustainability. Again, technology is early. Every industry has to find its way on sustainability. 
And so as we think about our own growth strategy, it starts with what our clients need. So we continue to diversify the parts of the enterprise that we're serving, and that enables -- that's what our clients need, and that enables next waves of growth for us. And we continue to innovate and anticipate, like in sustainability, what our clients need. And so when you kind of take this, you see both from serving the enterprise, the maturity of -- to that and then you add on top of that, that there are areas that are evergreen. Like Interactive, it's all about clients, the growth agenda. It's always going to change. Manufacturing will be the same. Security grows as the digital landscape grows. 
So hopefully, that gives you a flavor of how we're thinking about both our next waves of growth and just the resiliency of the diversity of what we do."

So managed services is just another term for outsourcing. And so if you think about our operations business, which is now about $8 billion, right, so all the managed services we provide -- or everything from finance and accounting to industry-specific, like we called out in the script, the stuff we're doing in telecom, we're doing things in insurance and both health and P&C. So we have industry specific, we have marketing services to [ move that ]. 
Then, of course, those are powerful IT services, we've been doing outsourcing for years, right, term application outsourcing is an industry term. And then we have our managed services and security. We bought Symantec last year. And so this is a core part when you think about our revenue between consulting and outsourcing. 
And the point that's happening now is that we've always done this, but what we're seeing is -- I just had a call with a CEO the other day, who's like, he started the call with like, ""Julie, I'm really having a hard time hiring people in digital, right, and how are you seeing companies' health?"" And we talked about how by strategically outsourcing like in security, in marketing, you can access the digital talent and it becomes part of their own talent strategy to address the war for talent, while at the same time, digitizing faster. 
I have another client that said, ""Look, you had 50 things that my IT department was about to build in order for us to automate and transform, and I get it through your SynOps platform. The same, too, on the IT and infrastructure side."" And of course, infrastructure managed services in the cloud, growing area as well from the move to the cloud. 
So I think the shift we were calling out, Lisa though, is just how strategic this is at a time of compressed transformation because it's meeting the needs of the war on talent and the need to digitize and the need to move fast at the same time."

They can just be a little bit lumpy, but it was a very strong performance. But let me just maybe talk a little bit about overall bookings as we head into '22. 
We do feel really good about the momentum in our business. And as Julie went through, we had 72 clients with bookings over $100 million this year. And you can see that then helping us as we head into FY '22, Bryan, with the 18% to 22% that we have in Q1. And you also see that in our 12% to 15% revenue range that we have for fiscal '22. 
I think it's important to also note that it does include about 5% inorganic contribution. But at the top end of our revenue range, again, driven by bookings, it's going to represent about 10% organic growth at the upper end. And while we do benefit from an easier compare in the first half, it does continue to imply strong organic growth in the second half. 
And if you look at why is that, when you peel back bookings, again, pleased with the $15 billion that we had in Q4, strong book-to-bill of 1.1. It is $60 billion for the whole year with double-digit growth in consulting. And I think it's important to also note, in consulting bookings, we had $8 billion for the last 3 quarters, which is terrific. And outsourcing, which for the entire year, kind of very strong book-to-bill of 1.2 in all 3 markets and services. 
And when you peel it back, there's really 3 things. Again, just peeling back bookings for you, there are 3 things that I would also note. One is that, yes, we did have a lot of larger bookings that help us for -- position us well for the future throughout FY '22. But we had a nice mix all the way through to the smaller deals, which benefit near-term revenue. 
The second thing is that the bookings were very broad-based across all of our services, and that includes strategy and consulting, which is really good as well. 
And lastly, their line, as Julie talked quite a bit about our strategic priorities: cloud, Industry X and security, for example."

And when you think about the actions we've taken, like a record number of 120,000 promotions, the training that we're providing people that's really valued. And then, frankly, things like the way that we have approached vaccines, right? So we've now vaccinated 85,000 of our people and their families directly in addition to what we're supporting through -- like in the U.S., through our carriers. 
And as I talked a little bit about in the script, what we find is people really care about the fact that they are working for a company that focuses on financials and all of the other, what we call, 360-degree value. So what we're doing in sustainability, being a leader that we're going to be carbon-neutral by 2025, really matters.

And we're able to do that. And I think that's a huge differentiator for us. 
And secondly, we made a decision last year, and we've made a decision this year in V&A to really invest and take advantage of our ability to invest to serve our clients. And when I go to clients, one of the things that we talk about is, and clients really value, is that when they're partnering with us, they're partnering not just for the capabilities that we have today, but because we have a track record of investing year in and year out in creating and anticipating their needs. And we point to the kinds of acquisitions like in umlaut, like in Novetta, like Infinity Works and cloud that we're doing it in markets all around the world to benefit them.

I'm glad you acknowledged that revenue growth is not easy. So thank you for that. But I -- just taking a step back just to make sure because I think over the last decade, we've seen a real shift in the professional services industry. The nature of the exponential technology change, and the need to help clients move faster and do so more efficiently, has meant that you need to be able to invest significantly. 
So as we think about moving forward, like the investments we've done to build SynOps, like to -- and continue to evolve it, to build industry solutions, as you mentioned, require us to continuously innovate, invest. And you saw that in our IP patent portfolio. 
And so what I would say is it's not that you sort of say, here's the revenue and then can you just fundamentally shift because there is significant cost. Having all aspects of our business grow like this is not simply because there's demand, it's the solutions we're bringing them. 
And as I've talked about in prior earnings club, it isn't linear today even because we've automated so much of what we do when you look at something like our operations business, you look at myWizard, and we continue to do so. And that's really part of the business now. 
And so I think it's important to kind of understand what's helping drive the demand for our services are -- the way we're gaining market share is not simply because there's a lot of demand in the market, but the solutions we're bringing. And this is our big differentiator because we can go all the way from strategy to operations, right? 
All of the examples we're giving involve multiple aspects of our services, and you can't just build that overnight either, right? So the fact that we're becoming integrated in talent strategy, in our outsourcing, in our -- also called managed services, is about being trusted. And the fact that we could deliver during the pandemic and be a trusted partner puts us in a very different place than others who might be trying to build these capabilities."

Some technologies have just really been coming online in the last year or 2 that are cloud-based.

We're doing so for Alstom. Alstom, a global leader in transportation. We're doing the same in a power company [ specifically ].
The range of what we're doing is both broad-based in terms of industry. And so we do think of this as really a big growth driver for the future, but not sizing it today."

I would like to start by thanking our 674,000 people around the world for your extraordinary work and commitment to our clients. Our results again this quarter reflect how you are living our purpose every day to deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity. As more and more companies embrace compressed transformation, our clients are turning to us as their trusted partner as reflected in our outstanding growth of 27% this quarter. We added 15 new Diamond clients, bringing the total to 244. Diamond clients are our largest relationships, and to give some context, we added 13 Diamonds in all of FY '21. 
We also had record bookings of $16.8 billion, 30% growth year-over-year with 20 clients with bookings over $100 million, and we expanded operating margin 20 basis points in Q1 with adjusted EPS growth of 28%, while we continue to invest in our business and people, including $1.7 billion in acquisitions. And in just the first quarter, we invested $250 million in learning for our people with 8.6 million training hours for approximately 14 hours per person. 
The extraordinary demand we see in the market reflects the imperative of digital transformation. Companies are making critical decisions about who will be their strategic partner, and they are selecting us, because of our talented people, our deep industry and technology capabilities and our commitment to both create value and lead with value. We predicted back in 2013 that every business would be a digital business. And we have executed a clear strategy to rotate our business to anticipate and be ready to serve our clients and when the pandemic hit, we were ready. With capabilities at scale reflected in 70% of our revenue at that time being from digital cloud and security with strong relationships with the world's leading technology companies, which, in some cases, go back decades. With a focus on growing our people through learning, allowing us to rapidly reskill with an unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity and equality and caring for our people professionally and personally, making us a talent magnet in a tight labor market, adding 50,000 talented individuals in Q1. And it is our breadth of capabilities across strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations, which is unique in our industry that allows us to work side-by-side with our clients to deliver results, and we believe our goal to create 360-degree value for our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities is an essential part of our success. 
Certainly, our commitment to creating vibrant career paths for our people is an important part of this value, and we just completed our annual promotion process. I want to congratulate our 1,030 new promotes to Managing Director, 143 new appointments to Senior Managing Directors and the more than 90,000 people we promoted around the world in Q1 overall. 
Today, we launched our 360 value reporting experience, a new way to show our progress and the value we create in all directions for all of our stakeholders. More on that later. 
KC, over to you."

Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations setting a new bookings record at $16.8 billion,",943,"Thank you, Julie. Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations setting a new bookings record at $16.8 billion, with consulting bookings exceeding the previous record by more than $1 billion. Our results reflected strong double-digit revenue growth across all dimensions of our business, all markets, services and industry groups, and we saw improved pricing in many parts of our business. Based on the strength of our first quarter results and the demand we see in the market, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and EPS outlook. 
Now let me summarize a few of the highlights of the quarter. Revenues grew 27% in local currency, increasing more than $3.2 billion over Q1 last year and more than $600 million above our guided range, with broad-based over-delivery across all markets, services and industries with all 13 industry groups growing double digits. We continue to extend our leadership position with growth we estimate to be more than 5x the market which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Operating margin of 16.3% for the quarter an increase -- was an increase of 20 basis points. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our people and our business, including acquisitions. We delivered very strong EPS of $2.78, up 28% over adjusted fiscal '21 results. 
Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $349 million and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested approximately $1.7 billion in acquisitions, and we continue to expect to invest approximately $4 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. 
With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were a record at $16.8 billion for the quarter, representing 30% growth in U.S. dollars and were $800 million higher than our previous record with an overall book-to-bill of 1.1. 
Consulting bookings were a record at $9.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were very pleased with our bookings this quarter, which reflected 20 clients with bookings over $100 million. All of our service dimensions, strategy consulting, technology services and operations as well as our geographic markets delivered strong double-digit bookings growth in U.S. dollars. 
Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15 billion, a 27% increase in U.S. dollars and in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, up 33% in U.S. dollars and 32% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6.6 billion, up 21% in U.S. dollars and in local currency. 
Taking a closer look at our service dimensions. Strategy and Consulting, Technology Services and operations all grew very strong double digits. 
Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 26% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Public Service, Software and platforms and consumer goods, retail and travel services. In Europe, revenues grew 28% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, industrial and banking and capital markets. 
Looking closer to the countries, Europe was driven by double-digit growth in Germany, U.K., France and Italy. In Growth Markets, we delivered 30% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, banking and capital markets and public service. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan and Australia. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9% compared with 33.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.7% compared with 10.4% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were 6.9% compared to 6.6% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.4 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 16.3% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with Q1 last year. 
Before I continue, as a reminder, we recognized an investment gain in Q1 last year, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.15. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.4% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.7% for the first quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.78 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.17 in the first quarter last year. 
Days service outstanding were 42 days compared to 38 days last quarter and 38 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $349 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $531 million, net of property and equipment additions of $182 million. 
Our cash balance at November 30 was $5.6 billion compared with $8.2 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.4 million shares for $845 million at an average price of $346.90 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $5.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share for a total of $630 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share to be paid on February 15, a 10% increase over last year. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 results, and we are off to a very strong start in FY '22. Now let me turn it back to Julie."

As we expected across industries and the globe, technology continues to be the single biggest driver of change, accelerating, disrupting and creating new opportunities. More companies are embracing compressed transformation underpinned by cloud and digital and are moving to build their digital core and use technology to transform how they operate and to find new ways to compete and grow. As you would expect with 27% revenue growth, we are seeing broad-based demand across all market services and industries with double-digit growth across all our strategic growth priorities, including Applied Intelligence, cloud, Industry X.0, interactive, intelligent operations, intelligent platform services, security and transformational change management. 
Let me bring this demand to life. First, compressed transformation is occurring across the globe, and the key enabler is the cloud across the continuum from public to hybrid to increasingly the edge and the move to leading SaaS platforms, along with the convergence of cloud and data. For example, we are working with a leading global supplier of tires and mobility solutions to migrate to the cloud, modernize its IT platforms, use data to accelerate growth and value and shift to a digital supply chain. We created a state-of-the-art system to track inventory, sales, warranty information and returns, all in the cloud, all in real time and have already helped to increase customer satisfaction, 35% with improved cost optimization and increased revenue of NEXT. We're also helping Mount Sinai Health System, New York City's largest academic medical system transform, modernize and increase its resilience by migrating its clinical systems, nonclinical systems and clinical data to a stable, secure cloud-based infrastructure to proactively detect and prevent threats, adapt to business and regulatory changes together with the potential to save millions over the next 5 years, savings that can be reinvested to fund strategic, innovative programs and help reskill teams. 
Our deep industry expertise is helping companies find new solutions and paths to grow and helping their customers. For example, we are collaborating with OPay, a leading finished financial group to use automation, advanced analytics and other emerging technologies to increase business agility, reduce costs and deliver enhanced customer and employee experiences. OPay will adopt the Intelligent Automation platform, Accenture myWizard to enable the company to extract greater value from its technology investment. We are working with Tuga, a leading utilities provider in Germany to create and operate a game-changing meter-to-cash IT platform in the cloud. It will help reduce operating costs by up to 40%, accelerate time to market and free up resources for energy transition and innovations like smart metering, helping customers make environmentally conscious decisions and energy providers stay responsive and reliable. 
And as we talked about last quarter, our sustainability services are focused on helping our clients across the industries move from commitment to action at scale. We see these services is critical to our clients' agendas. I'm pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement to acquire Zest Group, a Dutch sustainability services company with 140 employees that specializes in energy transition services and sourcing renewables and other clean energy sources. We look forward to welcoming them and working together to help clients move at speed to achieve net 0 carbon. We continue to help our clients to enter the next digital frontier of Industry X.0. We're excited to have completed the acquisition of umlaut and are seeing the power of our combination already. Together, we're working with a global technology leader to transform from a traditional engineering platform to a more agile model-based engineering platform that uses simulation and analysis from design and development all the way through the product life cycle. We are also working with an American wireless operator to help improve daily operations and transform their network security by combining our deep security risk assessment and communications industry skills. 
Of course, growth is at the heart of every client's agenda, and interactive is helping our clients capture new growth with their customers with our unique combination of creativity, technology, data, AI and industry expertise. For example, we are applying our digital global capabilities to help Capri Holdings Limited, a global fashion luxury group, consisting of the iconic brands, Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, translate its rich in-store luxury shopping experience to a digital experience that aligns with shifting customer behaviors and accelerate sustainable growth. 
As a strategic partner with Volkswagen Group, a German motor vehicle manufacturer, we're helping Audi and VW to pave the way for sustainable growth with precise continuous commerce and rich experiences along the entire car buying journey. We are combining the power of AI and predictive analytics to deliver the right experiences at the right time to accelerate revenue growth through an expanded digital commerce ecosystem. We're also working with BLI, a Brazilian logistics solutions company and Toronto, its new platform business to provide a digital one-stop shop for self-employed truckers to enhance their growth to improve logistics by offering options from our profitable freight products as well as to provide them access to critical services such as insurance, loans and health care, all by combining data analytics and AI. 
We see an increasing demand to create the platforms that power the digital products and experiences our clients seek for their customers. We're helping Cielo, a leader in electronic payments in Latin America become more competitive by migrating to the cloud, which will accelerate new product development and enable cutting-edge technologies. This will make it easier to launch innovative products, reduce time to market by 2/3 and lower cost all while enhancing their customers' experience. And of course, security is critical to all our clients. We were proud to be selected by the Department of Homeland Securities, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the U.S., Americas Risk Adviser defending against today's threats with advanced cyber services to help the Department of Homeland Security protect federal civilian executive branch systems against cyber attacks like ransomware, botnets and malware campaigns. 
Even as companies undergo compressed transformation, exponential technology changes continue. We are investing to anticipate the future and we are working with our clients to innovate and take advantage of emerging technologies to compete and win. Our R&D is powered by Accenture Labs and Ventures and extends across every part of our business so that we can quickly translate research into real results for our clients. For example, we are working with ESPN to explore how emerging technologies can enable new ways for fans to experience sports of the ESPN Edge Innovation Center, leveraging the years of early investments we have made in extended reality. We've been a key participant in shaping the innovation in enterprise blockchain technologies across the globe with applications in financial markets, supply chain and digital identity, which now are creating value for our clients. From partnering with the digital dollar foundation to explore a U.S. central bank digital currency to working with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited to build a new integrated settlement platform using digital asset modeling language smart contract. 
And while the Metaverse has recently burst into the public eye, we've been an early innovator in applying the technology. In fact, we often innovate on cutting-edge technologies by deploying them at Accenture first. We are proud to have the largest enterprise metaverse through what we call the nth floor and are deploying over 60,000 virtual reality headsets and have created one Accenture Park, a virtual campus for onboarding and immersive learning, including meeting rooms and collaborative experiences. 
Our VR environments provide our people with a human connection and learning experiences in an immersive digital world. We are also working with clients to help explore and shape their early forays into the metaverse through new digital experiences enabled by virtual reality and responding to their interest in new products enabled by NFT or non-fungible token, new ways to conduct commerce as the metaverse take shape. 
Many of these client examples reflect our goal to create 360-degree value. This goal reflects our growth strategy, our purpose, our core values and our culture of shared success. It is also how we operate Accenture, and we measure our success by how well we are achieving this goal for all our stakeholders. And today, we are proud to present our new 360-degree value reporting experience, a new way to share our progress, which is available on our website. With this comprehensive digital tool, you'll find all our reporting and data in 1 place measuring how we're doing. We've expanded our ESG reporting with 3 additional ESG framework, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, SASB, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure, TCFD, and the World Economic Forum International Business Council, WEF IBC metrics. While continuing to report against the Global Reporting Initiative, GRI standards, the UNGC 10 principles and the Carbon Disclosure Project, CDP, because we believe the transparency builds trust and helps us all make more progress.

For the second quarter of fiscal '22, we expect revenues to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 4% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '21 and reflects an estimated 22% to 26% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '22, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 3% compared to fiscal '21. For the full fiscal '22, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 19% to 22% growth in local currency over fiscal '21, which continues to assume an inorganic contribution of 5%. 
For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year '22 to be 15.2% to 15.4%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '21 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal '21. For earnings per share, we now expect our full year diluted EPS for fiscal '22 to be in the range of $10.32 to $10.60 or 17% to 20% growth over adjusted fiscal '21 results.

Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $6.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

So the first thing I would say is that overall, in terms of our revenue production this quarter, everyone did better. It really was broad-based over-delivery across all of our markets all of our industries and our services. And when you peel that back, you really start with bookings. So we have broad-based over-delivery also in our bookings. And so you see that flowing through our revenue production tension. And on that bookings production, while we had 20 clients with bookings over $100 million it really was broad-based growth in our bookings across the larger deals, all the way down through midsize and smaller deals. And then so that also really did help us drive more revenue. And importantly, we were able to meet this demand because we have the people able here to work on the external demand coming from the bookings. 
So we are really very pleased with the overall broad-based delivery in the first quarter. And that is why we see that coming into the second quarter and then a big part, obviously, of our full year revenue increase."

So we are -- we've been -- and we've seen that trend for at least the last 12 months that it's more important formally in our RFPs. But we also see it in the conversations we're having with clients that they are asking a lot about this. They are very much focused. And so when we talk about it, it's important to them. And so when we launched this strategy around 360-degree value, over a year ago now, it was based on the conversations we're already having with clients, right? We launched it because our clients were saying we have to achieve this. And the biggest issues, I think, is a world that we look for is how do you move from commitment to action. 
And so there's -- and part of that is therefore, clients also want to partner with companies that are equally committed. And it matters to them things like 50% of our centers around the world are using renewable energy, right? It matters to them the work that we're doing on green IT software so that eventually we'll be able to have much more sustainable software development. So it's definitely a buyer value. We see it formally. We see it informally. And we see it in terms of what they're trying to do, which is why our sustainability services are also so important.

So just to take you back to March 1st of 2020, when we announced our next-gen growth model, 1 of the solicit reasons we reorganized at the time, focused on geographies we said was to enable us to scale. And so that's enabled us because we're still fundamentally a people business is also driven by a lot of assets, but you need to be able to be close to clients and people. And so that change really allowed us to be where we are now, where we're scaling. But it also, in addition to the scaling piece helps us be more agile. Like you'll remember, we put that into place, and we created Accenture Cloud first 4 months later, right, which has been a huge success, and it's the agility by simplifying our structure at the same time. So first, it's how we manage their business in terms of an organizational perspective and having simplified our business. 
The second piece is the focus on employee experience. Our -- 1 of our 8 Leadership Essentials is caring for our people personally and professionally. And this is a very important part of how we are able to scale and drive our culture. And you'll see in our attrition it again is at the lower end of the pyramid in India, and we have a significantly lower attrition at the executive and above, and that is very much, we believe, because of how we focus on our people and the last piece, which is our culture. You noticed that we talked about the metaverse and what we've launched in our script today, that's another way of how we're driving our culture. We are constantly innovative innovating. So in a world where people can't have as many physical experiences today, we created this immersive experience which connects people, right, which builds connections. And so the focus on being smart about how we manage our people and staying close to them and our clients, our leadership and how we promote and develop and then constantly innovating to build the connections and the culture, and we call it omniconnections are absolutely critical when you're scaling."

It's occurring in all industries, and it's across the globe, and our clients are all experiencing a tight labor market. So for us, as it relates to inflation and wages, we see for our business that we will continue to have wage increases in the market for certain skills and that varies by geographies, and we expect it really to continue. 
So then what are we doing? It's not so different from what other clients are doing is that we're focused on pricing to absorb our higher labor costs. And 1 of the things that we can point out, Lisa, is that we were very pleased with the improved pricing that we had this quarter on our record bookings, but we have more work to do. And so one of the things that I wanted to just point out that it's going to take some time for the improved pricing to flow through our P&L. And that's going to lag the higher compensation that we see, it may even result for us in some operating margin contraction in Q2, although we expect to continue to expand margin by 10 to 30 basis points for the full year. So I mean that's just maybe a bit of a glimpse on what it means for us as we run our own P&L, and I'll hand it over to Julie to give some thoughts on what she's seeing in talking with our clients."

And we just think you have a couple of calls I had just this past week, clients that we've been working with for some time thinking about their cloud journey, I wouldn't call me up Monday and say, okay, we're going to pull forward Wave 2. We've got to go faster. It's harder than we thought. We need to go faster. And so there's this -- as companies are kind of getting into it, they're seeing -- that they want to go even faster, they're also seeing the impact of those who've come ahead. I was recently talking to the CEO of a big company where we're doing a major cloud and data platform. And his point to us is in, okay, now I get it. I can only go so fast. But can you go faster because I now see what I can really do 1 side replatform, right? 
And so this embracing more change and speed, we do think is helping drive this demand. And we predicted the sort of remember, we talked about compressed transformation that it's really only been in about 1/3 of industries and that it was going to continue to expand. But the point is the first round of compressed transformation is just the first round. And as you begin to see the power of what it is to be in the cloud, the next set of opportunities are being seen by the clients. And so I do think it's mostly around a recognition of the value of replatforming and the need for speed competitively."

Because look, the supply chain problems, there's kind of the immediate issues, but there's the longer-term issues like the ports are not up to snuff in most of the markets around the world, right? There's fundamental shifts going on in terms of how do you get -- how do you build resilience, which has been moving from sort of cost to resilience. And so the work of supply chain is multiyear, but I think it's important just -- I always go back to kind of where we were. The new technologies have really only come online, some of the newer platforms like Blue Yonder, Luminate or SAP. As for supply chain work in the last couple of years, right? And so they're just starting to really get the momentum and the implementation. And so I would say the digital supply chain work is very, very early innings. And the same with manufacturing. That's why we call it the next frontier. It's a big focus. I mean I think Gartner had a survey that said 93% or 91% of directors believe it's the biggest transformation opportunity, but we're in very, very early innings still."

I would like to start by thanking our 674,000 people around the world for your extraordinary work and commitment to our clients. Our results again this quarter reflect how you are living our purpose every day to deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity. As more and more companies embrace compressed transformation, our clients are turning to us as their trusted partner as reflected in our outstanding growth of 27% this quarter. We added 15 new Diamond clients, bringing the total to 244. Diamond clients are our largest relationships, and to give some context, we added 13 Diamonds in all of FY '21. 
We also had record bookings of $16.8 billion, 30% growth year-over-year with 20 clients with bookings over $100 million, and we expanded operating margin 20 basis points in Q1 with adjusted EPS growth of 28%, while we continue to invest in our business and people, including $1.7 billion in acquisitions. And in just the first quarter, we invested $250 million in learning for our people with 8.6 million training hours for approximately 14 hours per person. 
The extraordinary demand we see in the market reflects the imperative of digital transformation. Companies are making critical decisions about who will be their strategic partner, and they are selecting us because of our talented people, our deep industry and technology capabilities and our commitment to both create value and lead with values. We predicted back in 2013 that every business would be a digital business. And we have executed a clear strategy to rotate our business to anticipate and be ready to serve our clients and when the pandemic hit, we were ready. 
With capabilities at scale reflected in 70% of our revenue at that time being from digital cloud and security; with strong relationships with the world's leading technology companies, which, in some cases, go back decades; with a focus on growing our people through learning, allowing us to rapidly reskill; with an unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity and equality; and caring for our people professionally and personally, making us a talent magnet in a tight labor market, adding 50,000 talented individuals in Q1. And it is our breadth of capabilities across Strategy and Consulting, Interactive, Technology and Operations, which is unique in our industry that allows us to work side-by-side with our clients to deliver results, and we believe our goal to create 360-degree value for our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities is an essential part of our success. 
Certainly, our commitment to creating vibrant career paths for our people is an important part of this value, and we just completed our annual promotion process. I want to congratulate our 1,030 new promotes to Managing Director, 143 new appointments to Senior Managing Directors and the more than 90,000 people we promoted around the world in Q1 overall. 
Today, we launched our 360 (sic) [ 360-degree ] Value Reporting Experience, a new way to show our progress and the value we create in all directions for all of our stakeholders. More on that later.

Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations setting a new bookings record at $16.8 billion, with consulting bookings exceeding the previous record by more than $1 billion. Our results reflected strong double-digit revenue growth across all dimensions of our business, all markets, services and industry groups, and we saw improved pricing in many parts of our business. Based on the strength of our first quarter results and the demand we see in the market, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and EPS outlook. 
Now let me summarize a few of the highlights of the quarter. Revenues grew 27% in local currency, increasing more than $3.2 billion over Q1 last year and more than $600 million above our guided range, with broad-based over-delivery across all markets, services and industries with all 13 industry groups growing double digits. We continue to extend our leadership position with growth we estimate to be more than 5x the market which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Operating margin of 16.3% for the quarter, an increase -- was an increase of 20 basis points. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our people and our business, including acquisitions. We delivered very strong EPS of $2.78, up 28% over adjusted fiscal '21 results. 
Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $349 million and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested approximately $1.7 billion in acquisitions, and we continue to expect to invest approximately $4 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. 
With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were a record at $16.8 billion for the quarter, representing 30% growth in U.S. dollars and were $800 million higher than our previous record with an overall book-to-bill of 1.1. 
Consulting bookings were a record at $9.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were very pleased with our bookings this quarter, which reflected 20 clients with bookings over $100 million. All of our service dimensions, strategy consulting, technology services and operations as well as our geographic markets delivered strong double-digit bookings growth in U.S. dollars. 
Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15 billion, a 27% increase in U.S. dollars and in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, up 33% in U.S. dollars and 32% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6.6 billion, up 21% in U.S. dollars and in local currency. 
Taking a closer look at our service dimensions. Strategy and Consulting, Technology Services and Operations all grew very strong double digits. 
Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 26% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Public Service, Software & Platforms and Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. In Europe, revenues grew 28% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Industrial and Banking & Capital Markets. 
Looking closer to the countries, Europe was driven by double-digit growth in Germany, U.K., France and Italy. In Growth Markets, we delivered 30% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan and Australia. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9% compared with 33.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.7% compared with 10.4% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were 6.9% compared to 6.6% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.4 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 16.3% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with Q1 last year. 
Before I continue, as a reminder, we recognized an investment gain in Q1 last year, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.15. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.4% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.7% for the first quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.78 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.17 in the first quarter last year. 
Days service outstanding were 42 days compared to 38 days last quarter and 38 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $349 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $531 million, net of property and equipment additions of $182 million. 
Our cash balance at November 30 was $5.6 billion compared with $8.2 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.4 million shares for $845 million at an average price of $346.90 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $5.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share for a total of $630 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share to be paid on February 15, a 10% increase over last year. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 results, and we are off to a very strong start in FY '22. Now let me turn it back to Julie."

As we expected across industries and the globe, technology continues to be the single biggest driver of change, accelerating, disrupting and creating new opportunities. More companies are embracing compressed transformation underpinned by cloud and digital and are moving to build their digital core and use technology to transform how they operate and to find new ways to compete and grow. As you would expect with 27% revenue growth, we are seeing broad-based demand across all market services and industries with double-digit growth across all our strategic growth priorities, including Applied Intelligence, Cloud, Industry X, Interactive, Intelligent Operations, Intelligent Platform Services, Security and transformational change management. 
Let me bring this demand to life. First, compressed transformation is occurring across the globe, and the key enabler is the cloud across the continuum from public to hybrid to increasingly the edge and the move to leading SaaS platforms, along with the convergence of cloud and data. For example, we are working with a leading global supplier of tires and mobility solutions to migrate to the cloud, modernize its IT platforms, use data to accelerate growth and value and shift to a digital supply chain. We created a state-of-the-art system to track inventory, sales, warranty information and returns, all in the cloud, all in real time and have already helped to increase customer satisfaction, 35%, with improved cost optimization and increased revenue up next. 
We're also helping Mount Sinai Health System, New York City's largest academic medical system, transform, modernize and increase its resilience by migrating its clinical systems, nonclinical systems and clinical data to a stable, secure cloud-based infrastructure to proactively detect and prevent threats, adapt to business and regulatory changes together with the potential to save millions over the next 5 years, savings that can be reinvested to fund strategic, innovative programs and help reskill teams. 
Our deep industry expertise is helping companies find new solutions and paths to grow and helping their customers. For example, we are collaborating with OPay, a leading Finnish financial group to use automation, advanced analytics and other emerging technologies to increase business agility, reduce costs and deliver enhanced customer and employee experiences. OPay will adopt the intelligent automation platform, Accenture myWizard, to enable the company to extract greater value from its technology investment. 
We are working with [ Tuga ], a leading utilities provider in Germany, to create and operate a game-changing meter-to-cash IT platform in the cloud. It will help reduce operating costs by up to 40%, accelerate time to market and free up resources for energy transition and innovations like smart metering, helping customers make environmentally conscious decisions and energy providers stay responsive and reliable. 
And as we talked about last quarter, our sustainability services are focused on helping our clients across the industries move from commitment to action at scale. We see these services as critical to our clients' agendas. I'm pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement to acquire Zestgroup, a Dutch sustainability services company with 140 employees that specializes in energy transition services and sourcing renewables and other clean energy sources. We look forward to welcoming them and working together to help clients move at speed to achieve net zero carbon. 
We continue to help our clients to enter the next digital frontier of Industry X. We're excited to have completed the acquisition of umlaut and are seeing the power of our combination already. Together, we're working with a global technology leader to transform from a traditional engineering platform to a more agile model-based engineering platform that uses simulation and analysis from design and development all the way through the product life cycle. We are also working with an American wireless operator to help improve daily operations and transform their network security by combining our deep security risk assessment and communications industry skills. 
Of course, growth is at the heart of every client's agenda, and Interactive is helping our clients capture new growth with their customers with our unique combination of creativity, technology, data, AI and industry expertise. For example, we are applying our digital global capabilities to help Capri Holdings Limited, a global fashion luxury group, consisting of the iconic brands, Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, translate its rich in-store luxury shopping experience to a digital experience that aligns with shifting customer behaviors and accelerate sustainable growth. 
As a strategic partner with Volkswagen Group, a German motor vehicle manufacturer, we're helping Audi and VW to pave the way for sustainable growth with precise, continuous commerce and rich experiences along the entire car-buying journey. We are combining the power of AI and predictive analytics to deliver the right experiences at the right time to accelerate revenue growth through an expanded digital commerce ecosystem. 
We're also working with VLI, a Brazilian logistics solutions company in Toronto, its new platform business to provide a digital one-stop shop for self-employed truckers to enhance their growth to improve logistics by offering options from our profitable freight products as well as to provide them access to critical services such as insurance, loans and health care, all by combining data analytics and AI. 
We see an increasing demand to create the platforms that power the digital products and experiences our clients seek for their customers. We're helping Cielo, a leader in electronic payments in Latin America, become more competitive by migrating to the cloud, which will accelerate new product development and enable cutting-edge technologies. This will make it easier to launch innovative products, reduce time to market by 2/3 and lower cost, all while enhancing their customers' experience. 
And of course, security is critical to all our clients. We were proud to be selected by the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, in the U.S., America's risk adviser defending against today's threats with advanced cyber services to help the Department of Homeland Security protect federal civilian executive branch systems against cyber attacks like ransomware, botnets and malware campaigns. 
Even as companies undergo compressed transformation, exponential technology changes continue. We are investing to anticipate the future and we are working with our clients to innovate and take advantage of emerging technologies to compete and win. Our R&D is powered by Accenture labs and ventures and extends across every part of our business so that we can quickly translate research into real results for our clients. For example, we are working with ESPN to explore how emerging technologies can enable new ways for fans to experience sports at the ESPN Edge Innovation Center, leveraging the years of early investments we have made in extended reality. 
We've been a key participant in shaping the innovation in enterprise blockchain technologies across the globe with applications in financial markets, supply chain and digital identity, which now are creating value for our clients. From partnering with the Digital Dollar Foundation to explore a U.S. central bank digital currency to working with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited to build a new integrated settlement platform using digital asset modeling language smart contract. 
And while the metaverse has recently burst into the public eye, we've been an early innovator in applying the technology. In fact, we often innovate on cutting-edge technologies by deploying them at Accenture first. We are proud to have the largest enterprise metaverse through what we call The Nth Floor and are deploying over 60,000 virtual reality headsets and have created One Accenture Park, a virtual campus for onboarding and immersive learning, including meeting rooms and collaborative experiences. 
Our VR environments provide our people with a human connection and learning experiences in an immersive digital world. We are also working with clients to help explore and shape their early forays into the metaverse through new digital experiences enabled by virtual reality and responding to their interest in new products enabled by NFT, or non-fungible tokens, new ways to conduct commerce as the metaverse take shape. 
Many of these client examples reflect our goal to create 360-degree value. This goal reflects our growth strategy, our purpose, our core values and our culture of shared success. It is also how we operate Accenture, and we measure our success by how well we are achieving this goal for all our stakeholders. And today, we are proud to present our new 360-degree Value Reporting Experience, a new way to share our progress, which is available on our website. With this comprehensive digital tool, you'll find all our reporting and data in 1 place measuring how we're doing. We've expanded our ESG reporting with 3 additional ESG framework: the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, SASB; the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, TCFD; and the World Economic Forum International Business Council, WEF IBC, metrics while continuing to report against the Global Reporting Initiative, GRI, standards; the UN GC 10 principles; and the Carbon Disclosure Project, CDP, because we believe that transparency builds trust and helps us all make more progress.

For the second quarter of fiscal '22, we expect revenues to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 4% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '21 and reflects an estimated 22% to 26% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '22, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 3% compared to fiscal '21. For the full fiscal '22, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 19% to 22% growth in local currency over fiscal '21, which continues to assume an inorganic contribution of 5%. 
For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year '22 to be 15.2% to 15.4%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '21 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal '21. For earnings per share, we now expect our full year diluted EPS for fiscal '22 to be in the range of $10.32 to $10.60 or 17% to 20% growth over adjusted fiscal '21 results. 
For the full fiscal '22, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $8.2 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $6.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

So we have broad-based over-delivery also in our bookings. And so you see that flowing through our revenue production, Tien-Tsin. And on that bookings production, while we had 20 clients with bookings over $100 million, it really was broad-based growth in our bookings across the larger deals, all the way down through midsize and smaller deals. And then so that also really did help us drive more revenue. And importantly, we were able to meet this demand because we have the people able here to work on the external demand coming from the bookings. 
So we are really very pleased with the overall broad-based delivery in the first quarter. And that is why we see that coming into the second quarter and then a big part, obviously, of our full year revenue increase."

So we are -- we've been -- and we've seen that trend for at least the last 12 months that it's more important formally in our RFPs. But we also see it in the conversations we're having with clients that they are asking a lot about this. They are very much focused. And so when we talk about it, it's important to them. And so when we launched this strategy around 360-degree value, over a year ago now, it was based on the conversations we're already having with clients, right? We launched it because our clients were saying we have to achieve this. And the biggest issues, I think, as a world that we look for is how do you move from commitment to action.  
And so there's -- and part of that is therefore, clients also want to partner with companies that are equally committed. And it matters to them, things like 50% of our centers around the world are using renewable energy, right? It matters to them, the work that we're doing on green IT software so that eventually we'll be able to have much more sustainable software development. So it's definitely a buyer value. We see it formally. We see it informally. And we see it in terms of what they're trying to do, which is why our sustainability services are also so important.

And I think there's 3 things to focus on. One is how we manage the business. So just to take you back to March 1, 2020, when we announced our next-gen growth model, one of the solicit reasons we reorganized at the time, focused on geographies we said was to enable us to scale. And so that's enabled us because we're still fundamentally a people business that's also driven by a lot of assets, but you need to be able to be close to clients and people. And so that change really allowed us to be where we are now, where we're scaling. But it also, in addition to the scaling piece, helps us be more agile. Like you'll remember, we put that into place, and we created Accenture Cloud First 4 months later, right, which has been a huge success, and it's the agility by simplifying our structure at the same time. So first, it's how we manage their business in terms of an organizational perspective and having simplified our business. 
The second piece is the focus on employee experience. Our -- 1 of our 8 leadership essentials is caring for our people personally and professionally. And this is a very important part of how we are able to scale and drive our culture. And you'll see in our attrition, it again is at the lower end of the pyramid in India, and we have a significantly lower attrition at the executive and above, and that is very much, we believe, because of how we focus on our people. 
And the last piece, which is our culture. You noticed that we talked about the metaverse and what we've launched in our script today, that's another way of how we're driving our culture. We are constantly innovative -- innovating. So in a world where people can't have as many physical experiences today, we created this immersive experience which connects people, right, which builds connections. And so the focus on being smart about how we manage our people and staying close to them and our clients, our leadership and how we promote and develop and then constantly innovating to build the connections and the culture, and we call it omni connections, are absolutely critical when you're scaling."

Maybe I'll start and then, Julie, you can add in, in terms of what we're seeing with our clients. But Lisa, maybe we would start with inflation, and I'll take it maybe from a wage increase perspective. So to state the obvious, wage inflation is on all our minds. It's occurring in all industries, and it's across the globe, and our clients are all experiencing a tight labor market. So for us, as it relates to inflation and wages, we see for our business that we will continue to have wage increases in the market for certain skills and that varies by geographies, and we expect it really to continue. 
So then what are we doing? It's not so different from what other clients are doing, it's that we're focused on pricing to absorb our higher labor costs. And one of the things that we can point out, Lisa, is that we were very pleased with the improved pricing that we had this quarter on our record bookings, but we have more work to do. And so one of the things that I wanted to just point out is that it's going to take some time for the improved pricing to flow through our P&L. And that's going to lag the higher compensation that we see, it may even result for us in some operating margin contraction in Q2, although we expect to continue to expand margin by 10 to 30 basis points for the full year. So I mean that's just maybe a bit of a glimpse on what it means for us as we run our own P&L, and I'll hand it over to Julie to give some thoughts on what she's seeing in talking with our clients."

And so you are continuing to see more and more companies doing the compressed transformation, the willingness to take on more at the same time and even to do that faster. I was just thinking of a couple of calls I had just this past week, clients that we've been working with for some time thinking about their cloud journey, one called me up Monday and say, ""Okay, we're going to pull forward wave 2. We've got to go faster. It's harder than we thought. We need to go faster."" And so there's this -- as companies are kind of getting into it, they're seeing that they want to go even faster. They're also seeing the impact of those who've come ahead. I was recently talking to the CEO of a big company where we're doing a major cloud and data platform. And his point to us is like, okay, now I get it. I can only go so fast. But can you go faster because I now see what I can really do 1 site replatformed, right? 
And so this embracing more change and speed, we do think is helping drive this demand. And we predicted the sort of -- remember, we talked about compressed transformation, that it's really only been in about 1/3 of industries and that it was going to continue to expand. But the point is the first round of compressed transformation is just the first round. And as you begin to see the power of what it is to be in the cloud, the next set of opportunities are being seen by the clients. And so I do think it's mostly around a recognition of the value of replatforming and the need for speed competitively."

And so when cloud is very strong double-digit growth, it's obviously adding big dollars, but across each of the strategic priorities. So obviously, we have different scale. But look, you have to look at the cloud, right, because the cloud is the enabler. Think about it as this, cloud's the enabler, data is the driver and then AI will be the differentiator for our clients. And so you saw many, many of the examples really bringing these things together, right, so that you've got to get to the cloud, you got to get a handle on your data, right, and then be able to use AI, and we saw that in many of the examples that I gave in the script today. 
And so the first big step is of course replatforming in the cloud, both through migration and SaaS products. So just if you kind of have that mental model, I think it's helpful. And then that goes across the organization."

So if you look at platforms like Oracle, SAP and they're moving to the cloud. Those are all well below 50% of their installed base having moved, right? The sort of move to the cloud itself, the percentages are still around 30%-ish, maybe a little bit more in terms of workloads that have moved to the cloud, right? So as you just sort of look at kind of where are we just technically, right, you see a lot of ways. 
Then you look at our own research where we talk about leaders and leapfroggers. And what we see is that about 10% on average of every company are really leaders and performing much better than the bottom 25%, but that's only still a part of their organization. They're still working on lots of compressed transformation. You've got these leapfroggers that are coming from behind, that's about -- we estimate about 1/3 are really doing compressed transformation. And those -- and compressed transformation is wave on wave, like once you get to the cloud, then what do you do with the data? So we continue to see this as really being a multiyear journey. And I will tell you that a lot of people will talk about the pandemic accelerated years of transformation into months, that's only in thinking right? It is really hard to replatform, right? 
And then -- and it's really hard to move, get your data under control and then be able to do that. Once you do it, it opens up so much. But there's a lot of hard work for our clients ahead and we're privileged to get to be their partner."

There's fundamental shifts going on in terms of how do you get -- how do you build resilience, which has been moving from sort of cost to resilience. 
And so the work of supply chain is multiyear, but I think it's important just -- I always go back to kind of where we were. The new technologies have really only come online, some of the newer platforms like Blue Yonder's Luminate or SAP's S/4 supply chain work in the last couple of years, right? And so they're just starting to really get the momentum and the implementation. And so I would say the digital supply chain work is very, very early innings. And the same with manufacturing.

I would like to start by thanking our 674,000 people around the world for your extraordinary work and commitment to our clients. Our results again this quarter reflect how you are living our purpose every day to deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity. As more and more companies embrace compressed transformation, our clients are turning to us as their trusted partner as reflected in our outstanding growth of 27% this quarter. We added 15 new Diamond clients, bringing the total to 244. Diamond clients are our largest relationships, and to give some context, we added 13 Diamonds in all of FY '21. 
We also had record bookings of $16.8 billion, 30% growth year-over-year with 20 clients with bookings over $100 million, and we expanded operating margin 20 basis points in Q1 with adjusted EPS growth of 28%, while we continue to invest in our business and people, including $1.7 billion in acquisitions. And in just the first quarter, we invested $250 million in learning for our people with 8.6 million training hours for approximately 14 hours per person. 
The extraordinary demand we see in the market reflects the imperative of digital transformation. Companies are making critical decisions about who will be their strategic partner, and they are selecting us because of our talented people, our deep industry and technology capabilities and our commitment to both create value and lead with values. We predicted back in 2013 that every business would be a digital business. And we have executed a clear strategy to rotate our business to anticipate and be ready to serve our clients and when the pandemic hit, we were ready. 
With capabilities at scale reflected in 70% of our revenue at that time being from digital cloud and security; with strong relationships with the world's leading technology companies, which, in some cases, go back decades; with a focus on growing our people through learning, allowing us to rapidly reskill; with an unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity and equality; and caring for our people professionally and personally, making us a talent magnet in a tight labor market, adding 50,000 talented individuals in Q1. And it is our breadth of capabilities across Strategy and Consulting, Interactive, Technology and Operations, which is unique in our industry that allows us to work side-by-side with our clients to deliver results, and we believe our goal to create 360-degree value for our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities is an essential part of our success. 
Certainly, our commitment to creating vibrant career paths for our people is an important part of this value, and we just completed our annual promotion process. I want to congratulate our 1,030 new promotes to Managing Director, 143 new appointments to Senior Managing Directors and the more than 90,000 people we promoted around the world in Q1 overall. 
Today, we launched our 360 (sic) [ 360-degree ] Value Reporting Experience, a new way to show our progress and the value we create in all directions for all of our stakeholders. More on that later.

Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations setting a new bookings record at $16.8 billion,",943,"Thank you, Julie. Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations setting a new bookings record at $16.8 billion, with consulting bookings exceeding the previous record by more than $1 billion. Our results reflected strong double-digit revenue growth across all dimensions of our business, all markets, services and industry groups, and we saw improved pricing in many parts of our business. Based on the strength of our first quarter results and the demand we see in the market, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and EPS outlook. 
Now let me summarize a few of the highlights of the quarter. Revenues grew 27% in local currency, increasing more than $3.2 billion over Q1 last year and more than $600 million above our guided range, with broad-based over-delivery across all markets, services and industries with all 13 industry groups growing double digits. We continue to extend our leadership position with growth we estimate to be more than 5x the market which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Operating margin of 16.3% for the quarter, an increase -- was an increase of 20 basis points. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our people and our business, including acquisitions. We delivered very strong EPS of $2.78, up 28% over adjusted fiscal '21 results. 
Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $349 million and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested approximately $1.7 billion in acquisitions, and we continue to expect to invest approximately $4 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. 
With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were a record at $16.8 billion for the quarter, representing 30% growth in U.S. dollars and were $800 million higher than our previous record with an overall book-to-bill of 1.1. 
Consulting bookings were a record at $9.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were very pleased with our bookings this quarter, which reflected 20 clients with bookings over $100 million. All of our service dimensions, strategy consulting, technology services and operations as well as our geographic markets delivered strong double-digit bookings growth in U.S. dollars. 
Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15 billion, a 27% increase in U.S. dollars and in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, up 33% in U.S. dollars and 32% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6.6 billion, up 21% in U.S. dollars and in local currency. 
Taking a closer look at our service dimensions. Strategy and Consulting, Technology Services and Operations all grew very strong double digits. 
Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 26% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Public Service, Software & Platforms and Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. In Europe, revenues grew 28% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Industrial and Banking & Capital Markets. 
Looking closer to the countries, Europe was driven by double-digit growth in Germany, U.K., France and Italy. In Growth Markets, we delivered 30% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan and Australia. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9% compared with 33.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.7% compared with 10.4% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were 6.9% compared to 6.6% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.4 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 16.3% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with Q1 last year. 
Before I continue, as a reminder, we recognized an investment gain in Q1 last year, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.15. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.4% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.7% for the first quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.78 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.17 in the first quarter last year. 
Days service outstanding were 42 days compared to 38 days last quarter and 38 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $349 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $531 million, net of property and equipment additions of $182 million. 
Our cash balance at November 30 was $5.6 billion compared with $8.2 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.4 million shares for $845 million at an average price of $346.90 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $5.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share for a total of $630 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share to be paid on February 15, a 10% increase over last year. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 results, and we are off to a very strong start in FY '22. Now let me turn it back to Julie."

As we expected across industries and the globe, technology continues to be the single biggest driver of change, accelerating, disrupting and creating new opportunities. More companies are embracing comp",1491,"Thank you, KC. Starting with the demand environment. As we expected across industries and the globe, technology continues to be the single biggest driver of change, accelerating, disrupting and creating new opportunities. More companies are embracing compressed transformation underpinned by cloud and digital and are moving to build their digital core and use technology to transform how they operate and to find new ways to compete and grow. As you would expect with 27% revenue growth, we are seeing broad-based demand across all market services and industries with double-digit growth across all our strategic growth priorities, including Applied Intelligence, Cloud, Industry X, Interactive, Intelligent Operations, Intelligent Platform Services, Security and transformational change management. 
Let me bring this demand to life. First, compressed transformation is occurring across the globe, and the key enabler is the cloud across the continuum from public to hybrid to increasingly the edge and the move to leading SaaS platforms, along with the convergence of cloud and data. For example, we are working with a leading global supplier of tires and mobility solutions to migrate to the cloud, modernize its IT platforms, use data to accelerate growth and value and shift to a digital supply chain. We created a state-of-the-art system to track inventory, sales, warranty information and returns, all in the cloud, all in real time and have already helped to increase customer satisfaction, 35%, with improved cost optimization and increased revenue up next. 
We're also helping Mount Sinai Health System, New York City's largest academic medical system, transform, modernize and increase its resilience by migrating its clinical systems, nonclinical systems and clinical data to a stable, secure cloud-based infrastructure to proactively detect and prevent threats, adapt to business and regulatory changes together with the potential to save millions over the next 5 years, savings that can be reinvested to fund strategic, innovative programs and help reskill teams. 
Our deep industry expertise is helping companies find new solutions and paths to grow and helping their customers. For example, we are collaborating with OPay, a leading Finnish financial group to use automation, advanced analytics and other emerging technologies to increase business agility, reduce costs and deliver enhanced customer and employee experiences. OPay will adopt the intelligent automation platform, Accenture myWizard, to enable the company to extract greater value from its technology investment. 
We are working with [ Tuga ], a leading utilities provider in Germany, to create and operate a game-changing meter-to-cash IT platform in the cloud. It will help reduce operating costs by up to 40%, accelerate time to market and free up resources for energy transition and innovations like smart metering, helping customers make environmentally conscious decisions and energy providers stay responsive and reliable. 
And as we talked about last quarter, our sustainability services are focused on helping our clients across the industries move from commitment to action at scale. We see these services as critical to our clients' agendas. I'm pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement to acquire Zestgroup, a Dutch sustainability services company with 140 employees that specializes in energy transition services and sourcing renewables and other clean energy sources. We look forward to welcoming them and working together to help clients move at speed to achieve net zero carbon. 
We continue to help our clients to enter the next digital frontier of Industry X. We're excited to have completed the acquisition of umlaut and are seeing the power of our combination already. Together, we're working with a global technology leader to transform from a traditional engineering platform to a more agile model-based engineering platform that uses simulation and analysis from design and development all the way through the product life cycle. We are also working with an American wireless operator to help improve daily operations and transform their network security by combining our deep security risk assessment and communications industry skills. 
Of course, growth is at the heart of every client's agenda, and Interactive is helping our clients capture new growth with their customers with our unique combination of creativity, technology, data, AI and industry expertise. For example, we are applying our digital global capabilities to help Capri Holdings Limited, a global fashion luxury group, consisting of the iconic brands, Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, translate its rich in-store luxury shopping experience to a digital experience that aligns with shifting customer behaviors and accelerate sustainable growth. 
As a strategic partner with Volkswagen Group, a German motor vehicle manufacturer, we're helping Audi and VW to pave the way for sustainable growth with precise, continuous commerce and rich experiences along the entire car-buying journey. We are combining the power of AI and predictive analytics to deliver the right experiences at the right time to accelerate revenue growth through an expanded digital commerce ecosystem. 
We're also working with VLI, a Brazilian logistics solutions company in Toronto, its new platform business to provide a digital one-stop shop for self-employed truckers to enhance their growth to improve logistics by offering options from our profitable freight products as well as to provide them access to critical services such as insurance, loans and health care, all by combining data analytics and AI. 
We see an increasing demand to create the platforms that power the digital products and experiences our clients seek for their customers. We're helping Cielo, a leader in electronic payments in Latin America, become more competitive by migrating to the cloud, which will accelerate new product development and enable cutting-edge technologies. This will make it easier to launch innovative products, reduce time to market by 2/3 and lower cost, all while enhancing their customers' experience. 
And of course, security is critical to all our clients. We were proud to be selected by the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, in the U.S., America's risk adviser defending against today's threats with advanced cyber services to help the Department of Homeland Security protect federal civilian executive branch systems against cyber attacks like ransomware, botnets and malware campaigns. 
Even as companies undergo compressed transformation, exponential technology changes continue. We are investing to anticipate the future and we are working with our clients to innovate and take advantage of emerging technologies to compete and win. Our R&D is powered by Accenture labs and ventures and extends across every part of our business so that we can quickly translate research into real results for our clients. For example, we are working with ESPN to explore how emerging technologies can enable new ways for fans to experience sports at the ESPN Edge Innovation Center, leveraging the years of early investments we have made in extended reality. 
We've been a key participant in shaping the innovation in enterprise blockchain technologies across the globe with applications in financial markets, supply chain and digital identity, which now are creating value for our clients. From partnering with the Digital Dollar Foundation to explore a U.S. central bank digital currency to working with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited to build a new integrated settlement platform using digital asset modeling language smart contract. 
And while the metaverse has recently burst into the public eye, we've been an early innovator in applying the technology. In fact, we often innovate on cutting-edge technologies by deploying them at Accenture first. We are proud to have the largest enterprise metaverse through what we call The Nth Floor and are deploying over 60,000 virtual reality headsets and have created One Accenture Park, a virtual campus for onboarding and immersive learning, including meeting rooms and collaborative experiences. 
Our VR environments provide our people with a human connection and learning experiences in an immersive digital world. We are also working with clients to help explore and shape their early forays into the metaverse through new digital experiences enabled by virtual reality and responding to their interest in new products enabled by NFT, or non-fungible tokens, new ways to conduct commerce as the metaverse take shape. 
Many of these client examples reflect our goal to create 360-degree value. This goal reflects our growth strategy, our purpose, our core values and our culture of shared success. It is also how we operate Accenture, and we measure our success by how well we are achieving this goal for all our stakeholders. And today, we are proud to present our new 360-degree Value Reporting Experience, a new way to share our progress, which is available on our website. With this comprehensive digital tool, you'll find all our reporting and data in 1 place measuring how we're doing. We've expanded our ESG reporting with 3 additional ESG framework: the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, SASB; the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, TCFD; and the World Economic Forum International Business Council, WEF IBC, metrics while continuing to report against the Global Reporting Initiative, GRI, standards; the UN GC 10 principles; and the Carbon Disclosure Project, CDP, because we believe that transparency builds trust and helps us all make more progress. 
Back to you, KC."

For the second quarter of fiscal '22, we expect revenues to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 4% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '21 and reflects an estimated 22% to 26% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '22, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 3% compared to fiscal '21. For the full fiscal '22, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 19% to 22% growth in local currency over fiscal '21, which continues to assume an inorganic contribution of 5%. 
For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year '22 to be 15.2% to 15.4%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '21 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal '21. For earnings per share, we now expect our full year diluted EPS for fiscal '22 to be in the range of $10.32 to $10.60 or 17% to 20% growth over adjusted fiscal '21 results. 
For the full fiscal '22, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $8.2 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. 
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $6.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.

So we have broad-based over-delivery also in our bookings. And so you see that flowing through our revenue production, Tien-Tsin. And on that bookings production, while we had 20 clients with bookings over $100 million, it really was broad-based growth in our bookings across the larger deals, all the way down through midsize and smaller deals. And then so that also really did help us drive more revenue. And importantly, we were able to meet this demand because we have the people able here to work on the external demand coming from the bookings. 
So we are really very pleased with the overall broad-based delivery in the first quarter. And that is why we see that coming into the second quarter and then a big part, obviously, of our full year revenue increase."

So we are -- we've been -- and we've seen that trend for at least the last 12 months that it's more important formally in our RFPs. But we also see it in the conversations we're having with clients that they are asking a lot about this. They are very much focused. And so when we talk about it, it's important to them. And so when we launched this strategy around 360-degree value, over a year ago now, it was based on the conversations we're already having with clients, right? We launched it because our clients were saying we have to achieve this. And the biggest issues, I think, as a world that we look for is how do you move from commitment to action.  
And so there's -- and part of that is therefore, clients also want to partner with companies that are equally committed. And it matters to them, things like 50% of our centers around the world are using renewable energy, right? It matters to them, the work that we're doing on green IT software so that eventually we'll be able to have much more sustainable software development. So it's definitely a buyer value. We see it formally. We see it informally. And we see it in terms of what they're trying to do, which is why our sustainability services are also so important.

And I think there's 3 things to focus on. One is how we manage the business. So just to take you back to March 1, 2020, when we announced our next-gen growth model, one of the solicit reasons we reorganized at the time, focused on geographies we said was to enable us to scale. And so that's enabled us because we're still fundamentally a people business that's also driven by a lot of assets, but you need to be able to be close to clients and people. And so that change really allowed us to be where we are now, where we're scaling. But it also, in addition to the scaling piece, helps us be more agile. Like you'll remember, we put that into place, and we created Accenture Cloud First 4 months later, right, which has been a huge success, and it's the agility by simplifying our structure at the same time. So first, it's how we manage their business in terms of an organizational perspective and having simplified our business. 
The second piece is the focus on employee experience. Our -- 1 of our 8 leadership essentials is caring for our people personally and professionally. And this is a very important part of how we are able to scale and drive our culture. And you'll see in our attrition, it again is at the lower end of the pyramid in India, and we have a significantly lower attrition at the executive and above, and that is very much, we believe, because of how we focus on our people. 
And the last piece, which is our culture. You noticed that we talked about the metaverse and what we've launched in our script today, that's another way of how we're driving our culture. We are constantly innovative -- innovating. So in a world where people can't have as many physical experiences today, we created this immersive experience which connects people, right, which builds connections. And so the focus on being smart about how we manage our people and staying close to them and our clients, our leadership and how we promote and develop and then constantly innovating to build the connections and the culture, and we call it omni connections, are absolutely critical when you're scaling."

Maybe I'll start and then, Julie, you can add in, in terms of what we're seeing with our clients. But Lisa, maybe we would start with inflation, and I'll take it maybe from a wage increase perspective. So to state the obvious, wage inflation is on all our minds. It's occurring in all industries, and it's across the globe, and our clients are all experiencing a tight labor market. So for us, as it relates to inflation and wages, we see for our business that we will continue to have wage increases in the market for certain skills and that varies by geographies, and we expect it really to continue. 
So then what are we doing? It's not so different from what other clients are doing, it's that we're focused on pricing to absorb our higher labor costs. And one of the things that we can point out, Lisa, is that we were very pleased with the improved pricing that we had this quarter on our record bookings, but we have more work to do. And so one of the things that I wanted to just point out is that it's going to take some time for the improved pricing to flow through our P&L. And that's going to lag the higher compensation that we see, it may even result for us in some operating margin contraction in Q2, although we expect to continue to expand margin by 10 to 30 basis points for the full year.

And what we really see our clients doing is because there's a lot of uncertainty about how inflation is going to develop in 2022 is being laser-focused on cost efficiencies and growth, right? Because for many industries, they can't pass on the improved pricing or they're like us, right, it takes a while to be able to do that. And so it is helping as well drive some of the demand for both things -- helping them grow, but also do that efficiently."

I was just thinkin",304,"Sure. I think a big aspect of it is embracing the need for speed. And so you are continuing to see more and more companies doing the compressed transformation, the willingness to take on more at the same time and even to do that faster. I was just thinking of a couple of calls I had just this past week, clients that we've been working with for some time thinking about their cloud journey, one called me up Monday and say, ""Okay, we're going to pull forward wave 2. We've got to go faster. It's harder than we thought. We need to go faster."" And so there's this -- as companies are kind of getting into it, they're seeing that they want to go even faster. They're also seeing the impact of those who've come ahead. I was recently talking to the CEO of a big company where we're doing a major cloud and data platform. And his point to us is like, okay, now I get it. I can only go so fast. But can you go faster because I now see what I can really do 1 site replatformed, right? 
And so this embracing more change and speed, we do think is helping drive this demand. And we predicted the sort of -- remember, we talked about compressed transformation, that it's really only been in about 1/3 of industries and that it was going to continue to expand. But the point is the first round of compressed transformation is just the first round. And as you begin to see the power of what it is to be in the cloud, the next set of opportunities are being seen by the clients. And so I do think it's mostly around a recognition of the value of replatforming and the need for speed competitively."

And so when cloud is very strong double-digit growth, it's obviously adding big dollars, but across each of the strategic priorities. So obviously, we have different scale. But look, you have to look at the cloud, right, because the cloud is the enabler. Think about it as this, cloud's the enabler, data is the driver and then AI will be the differentiator for our clients. And so you saw many, many of the examples really bringing these things together, right, so that you've got to get to the cloud, you got to get a handle on your data, right, and then be able to use AI, and we saw that in many of the examples that I gave in the script today. 
And so the first big step is of course replatforming in the cloud, both through migration and SaaS products. So just if you kind of have that mental model, I think it's helpful. And then that goes across the organization."

So if you look at platforms like Oracle, SAP and they're moving to the cloud. Those are all well below 50% of their installed base having moved, right? The sort of move to the cloud itself, the percentages are still around 30%-ish, maybe a little bit more in terms of workloads that have moved to the cloud, right? So as you just sort of look at kind of where are we just technically, right, you see a lot of ways. 
Then you look at our own research where we talk about leaders and leapfroggers. And what we see is that about 10% on average of every company are really leaders and performing much better than the bottom 25%, but that's only still a part of their organization. They're still working on lots of compressed transformation. You've got these leapfroggers that are coming from behind, that's about -- we estimate about 1/3 are really doing compressed transformation. And those -- and compressed transformation is wave on wave, like once you get to the cloud, then what do you do with the data? So we continue to see this as really being a multiyear journey. And I will tell you that a lot of people will talk about the pandemic accelerated years of transformation into months, that's only in thinking right? It is really hard to replatform, right? 
And then -- and it's really hard to move, get your data under control and then be able to do that. Once you do it, it opens up so much. But there's a lot of hard work for our clients ahead and we're privileged to get to be their partner."

Because look, the supply chain problems, there's kind of the immediate issues, but there's the longer-term issues like the ports are not up to snuff in most of the markets around the world, right? There's fundamental shifts going on in terms of how do you get -- how do you build resilience, which has been moving from sort of cost to resilience. 
And so the work of supply chain is multiyear, but I think it's important just -- I always go back to kind of where we were. The new technologies have really only come online, some of the newer platforms like Blue Yonder's Luminate or SAP's S/4 supply chain work in the last couple of years, right? And so they're just starting to really get the momentum and the implementation. And so I would say the digital supply chain work is very, very early innings. And the same with manufacturing. That's why we call it the next frontier. It's a big focus.
