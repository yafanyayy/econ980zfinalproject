If there's one thing that pandemic has taught us, it's the importance of adapting in real time. In 2020, our world changed quickly and rapidly. As a cohesive leadership team, we had to prepare for a lot of unknowns and uncertainties where our offices were closed, our contract manufacturers were shutting down and supply chain constraints resulted in longer lead times. 
2020 created a new norm as we found many virtual ways of communicating with our customers, including access to our products for their business continuity. With vaccines emerging, we certainly hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these unprecedented times. 
I am so proud of our employees and how we've handled this and thank our partners and customers as well for placing their trust in us. Back to some Q4 2020 specifics. We delivered revenues of $648.5 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49. A care services and software and support renewals contributed approximately 20% of our revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins at 65% was influenced by software and services mix and a higher enterprise contribution for the quarter and the year. 
We've registered a record number of new customer logos and million dollar customers, a direct result of our momentum in the enterprise vertical and campus this quarter. We now have surpassed 7,200 cumulative customers over the past decade. In Q4 2020, Cloud Titans was our largest vertical. Enterprise was second, followed by financials in third place, and the providers, both service provider and cloud specialty providers tied for fourth place. In terms of sector trends, we see Cloud Titans at approximately 36%; Enterprises, including financials at approximately 36%; and providers at approximately 28%, consistent with effective ranges we have provided. 
Microsoft was the only greater than 10% customer concentration at 21.5% for the year 2020. In terms of geographical mix, international contribution was slightly higher at 26%, with the Americas at 74% for Q4 2020. Despite a turbulent 2020, especially with Cloud Titans, we believe Arista is going to emerge stronger with more diversified products and customers. We reiterate our multiyear growth part based on 3 major product line evolutions: one, our core cloud and data center products built on a highly differentiated Arista EOS, these spine architecture, and our cloud-first principle based on the 5 As. We expect this to contribute approximately 60% to 65% range in the future. Our second market is the network adjacencies, with routing replacing routers and our entry into the cognitive campus workspaces. We expect these 2 adjacencies together to contribute approximately in the range of 10% to 15%, as a compelling alternative to incumbent legacy networks. 
Our third category is network software and services based on subscription models, such as Arista Acare, CloudVision, multi-cloud EOS router, Big Switch DANZ monitoring fabric, or DMS, and advanced net of detection and response with the recent Awake Security acquisition. We predict that these subscription-based network services and software will contribute approximately in the 25% range. Please note that perpetual software licenses are not included here and are generally counted in our core or adjacent product lines. 
As we look ahead, analyst research has shown that customers believe that COVID-19 has actually increased the value and relevance of the network in the post-pandemic era. And in our opinion, we concur. The networking industry is undergoing a metamorphosis from point silos or places in the network to a seamless cognitive cloud network that is data-driven. Arista's helping customers with their digital transformation to this data-centric cloud-first paradigm. As we experience the explosion of users, devices, IoT, OT, more video, more mobility of workloads and workflows, the boundary between all the locations, whether it's your office, cloud, home, teleworker and transit and user is really blurring into elastic workspaces. 
We believe Arista is well positioned to address the data-driven networks for this client-to-cloud workspaces. We are powering some of the world's largest data centers and cloud providers as a trusted partner. And this expertise that we have gained has helped us modernize networking to a software-driven cognitive experience. A good example of this is Arista's Q4 2020 introduction of DMF or DANZ monitoring fabric for contextual observability based on our Big Switch acquisition that we did earlier in 2020. Our Zero Trust Vision that we launched this month also cements the relevance of a differentiated network protection and security. Our holistic Zero Trust network requires the union of network segmentation, situational awareness and visibility and network detection and response security. A key part of our strategy is to bring these cloud-first principles to every aspect of our cloud network. So we bring it to routing, observability and security functions, and it must be inherently designed as a part of the Arista state and AI-driven network architecture and foundation. 
So with this, I'd like to invite Ken Duda, our Founder and Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, to share some of our latest innovations on security. Ken?"

A Zero Trust framework for security is top of mind at Arista. For so many years, networking vendors have focused, first and foremost, on providing connectivity that is making sure everything can talk to everything else. This was fine in the 1980s, but it makes no sense today where security is a greater concern than ever for many of our customers, more important than connectivity itself. 
Arista is addressing the needs of security-conscious operators by integrating security directly into our network devices so that the network is secure from day 1 without bolt-on security products. You've already heard about the Awake acquisition and progress in AI-driven network detection and response. 
I'd like to go a little deeper on this call into another innovative Arista security feature called Macro Segmentation Service groups, or MSG. With MSG, the operator Assigns endpoints to segments. Based on the type of device that's connecting, the user of that device and/or the applications they are using. The operator then specifies a segmentation policy. Specifying which pairs of segments are permitted to communicate. For example, the policy might permit corporate engineering laptops to connect to manufacturing applications, but not to the finance applications and not even to one another. 
MSSG enforces that policy uniformly, whether wired or wireless, whether on the campus or in the data center, on-premises or working remotely. The operator can change the policy, including reassigning an endpoint to a different segment without requiring any other changes to the network. In particular, the policy is completely independent of network address assignment, which can be quite important. 
For example, if the user device behaves suspiciously, it can be reassigned to an untrusted segment without triggering any network change events on the device so that the compromised device can be quarantined and investigated without tipping off the adversary that they have been detected. 
Arista's MSSG works with 100% standards-based packets without adding any proprietary headers, trailers, encapsulations, et cetera, and is thus, easy to deploy incrementally into existing networks. Finally, enforcement is implemented entirely in hardware for high-performance without relying on expensive switch TCAMs for classification, which has led to scale problems in competing solutions. Our view is that MSSG is an example of a larger trend in networking, where Moore's Law is enabling a larger and larger feature set to be integrated into mainstream switching and routing devices. This integration is essential to move beyond security as an afterthought and provide solutions that are secure off the shelf. And I'm delighted in the role, Arista is able to play in helping customers address the challenges of building and operating a modern network, not just from a performance and scale perspective, but including so many other aspects such as visibility, manageability, monitoring, provisioning, process automation and, of course, security. Thanks. Back to you, Jayshree."

Clearly, customers are fatigued with the proprietary and silo networking you just mentioned. And just as we all modernize the cloud network, security must turn from a noun to an adjective to build secure networks. Ken, your world-class engineering team has mastered the art of quality and software architecture with best-in-class agility and programmability, credit to you for founding and building this innovation and greatness in Arista, and I can't wait to see more of it. 
In addition to our campus workspaces progress that I spoke about last time, next-generation routing is another key adjacent market. Our investments in simplification of Arista's routing stack has been going on for many years with standards-based EVPN VXLAN, BGP and segment routing, and these are yielding good traction in cloud service provider and enterprise customer wins. 
To give you context on this, just in 2020 alone, we introduced 6 EOS software releases across 40 platforms and delivered over 800 features in routing. The result of these investments we have made in our routing, innovation and footprint have brought us over 200 customers in 2020. In summary, Arista demonstrates a stark contrast to the current fatigue of silos and different operating systems for WAN, campus, cloud, data center, each one generating its own disparate data silos. 
We are building upon our cloud networking heritage to unify data sets consistently and harnessing and archiving data across one software stack EUS and one CloudVision. The networking industry is truly ripe for this transition and change to data-driven networking. Simply put, a good enough mediocre network is no longer good enough and acceptable. And this is why we believe that we're poised for multiyear inflection ahead. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for the financial specifics. Ita?"

This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2020 results and our guidance for Q1 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q4 were $648.5 million, up 17.4% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $615 million to $635 million. 
While we continue to strive for improvements on the supply chain front, shipments remained somewhat constrained in the quarter, with some COVID second and third wave-related disruptions. Service and software support renewals represented approximately 20% of total revenue, down slightly from 21% last quarter. International revenues for the quarter came in at $165.7 million or 26% of total revenue, up from 25% in the third quarter. While the shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, is largely due to the location of deployments by our third -- by our Cloud Titan customers, we did see some incremental improvement in our in region businesses this quarter. 
Overall gross margins in Q4 were a healthy 65%. At the upper end of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65%, reflecting a heavier mix of shipments to our enterprise and financial customers in the period. Operating expenses for the quarter were $178.1 million or 27.5% of revenue, up from last quarter at $159.4 million. We continue to increase operating expense investments during the quarter as our top line performance for the year continued to improve. R&D spending came in at $110.2 million or 17% of revenue, up from $106.1 million last quarter. 
This reflected increased employee costs, somewhat offset by lower new product introduction spending in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $54.9 million or 8.5% of revenue, up from $43.1 million last quarter with increased variable compensation and other headcount-related charges. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. Our G&A costs came in at $13 million or 2% of revenue, up from last quarter at approximately $10.2 million, reflecting normal fourth quarter compliance-related activities. 
Our operating income for the quarter was $243.5 million or 37.6% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.4 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.3%. Other income and expense included $2.5 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amounts. 
The favorable tax rate included the release of some tax reserves for which the statute of limitations expired in the period. This was a onetime effect, and the rate will likely return to a more structural rate of 21.9% in future periods. Overall, this resulted in net income for the quarter of $197.7 million or 30.5% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.3 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter, of $2.49, up approximately 9% from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the year at approximately $2.87 billion. 
To recap on our uses of cash for the year, we generated $735 million of cash from operations and returned approximately $395 million or 54% of this to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In addition, we used approximately $227 million or 31% to fund cash consideration for 2 acquisitions, which closed during the year, retaining the balance of approximately $113 million in the business. 
To date, we have repurchased $661 million or 3.2 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years commencing in Q2 '19. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate. Turning to the operational cash performance for the fourth quarter. We generated $186.9 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments in working capital. DSOs came in at 55 days, up from 46 days in Q3, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.8x, down from 2x last quarter. Inventory increased to $480 million in the quarter, up from $438 million in the prior period as we continue to buffer certain components and products. 
Our total deferred revenue balance was $651 million, up from $562 million in Q3. This increase largely reflected typical fourth quarter service renewal activity and a small amount of deferred product revenue related to new product deployments. The level of services deferred revenue is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Accounts payable days were 54 days, down from 70 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 million. Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. We saw good diversification of the business in fiscal 2020, with expected declines in Cloud Titan revenue, somewhat offset by growth in our other market sectors. Looking to 2021, we expect continued growth with our enterprise and provider customers, combined with the solid cloud type contribution. From a product perspective, we expect strength in adjacencies and software and services continue to make these areas a more meaningful contributor to the business over time. 
We believe the combination of these trends, combined with favorable year-over-year comparatives allowed for a top line growth rate for the year, which is in line with annual consensus growth rates of 14% to 15%. You should also note that our second half 2020 top line recovery will likely result in some deceleration in quarterly year-over-year growth rates as we move through 2021. On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65% with customer mix remaining the key driver. 
Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to making go forward results based investments in the business. This includes continued go-to-market expansion to support enterprise and campus growth and investments in R&D to support innovation across the business. Finally, our outlook discussion above and our guidance for Q1 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This is, however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. 
With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows: revenues of approximately $630 million to $650 million, gross margin 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9% with diluted shares of approximately 80 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles?"

But protecting the network is only one aspect of the data center or campus. You have to make sure you work with different types of firewall vendors. You have to protect the cloud and the multi-cloud zones, you have to protect the devices and the identity. So Macro Segmentation has multiple fronts. 
We enforce a lot of roles to our partnerships with firewall vendors, in particular, Palo Alto networks as well as others. We enforce rules on the post with our partnership with VMware, especially and then more recently, we've also done with our macro segmentation that Ken talked about, more and more identity mapping and enforcement with our partners like Forescout as well as Aruba, ClearPass and Okta. So the first thing I want to say is security is too important for just Arista to do. We'll be securing and protecting the network and working with these partners. 
Looking ahead, we see other forms of security, too. And I'd love for Ken or Anshul to comment because whether it is securing the networks and segmentation and the many forms we talked about, but also more and more in the data center encryption capabilities and privacy, whether it's network-wide or how to pop and in the campus, bringing security all the way down to our wireless.

Well, as you know, cloud has been tough for us and pretty volatile. The visibility on Cloud Titan was very difficult last year. On the other hand, as we've been telling you, we're starting to make good penetration in both Tier 2, Tier 3 service providers as well as our Tier 2 cloud providers. So that has come up nicely to make up for some of the volatility in our Titans. 
In terms of a question, one of the things we felt in Q4, we did achieve was we were firing on all 5 verticals in all 3 sectors. But because we had so much volatility in Titans, overall in the year, we were down. And Anshul, you may want to add to that is that, in our view, there is no reflection on the strength and an intimacy of our preferred partnership with our Cloud Titans. But we did have some delays in their qualification of 400-gig and in spite of all the new products we had, decisions took longer to happen. Anshul, do you want to comment on that?"

So specific to Wifi, we view this as a very important component of our overall cognitive workspaces portfolio, but we are not competing directly with Cisco or Aruba or anybody else on the controller based traditional WiFi architecture. 
So our approach to WiFi has been very much like our approach to optics. We're not an optical vendor, but we view WiFi and optics as an accessory to provide that cognitive inference, AI-driven architecture so that you can seamlessly connect across wired and WiFi. So CloudVision supports wired and WiFi. We have a unified edge that supports wired and Wifi. Our WiFi will lead to migration as customers may need into LTE or 4G or 5G. So to us, WiFi is almost a technology and a feature, not a market segment, but it's critical to bringing our wired, wireless, unified leaf spine architecture that we extended from the data center into the campus. So I think our competitors are looking at it more traditionally, and we're looking at modern workspaces. As for SD-WAN, we've been very clear that we are not in that market space. We look at some of the SD-WAN attributes of features and an extension of our WAN routing.

And anybody planning 800-gig is typically doing so in a much longer term, especially for optics, right? So in general, if you just step back and look at 400-gig, the calls have shifted out by a year, and we expect production mainly in the second half. So we're still in the world of 100, 200 and 400-gig, I believe, this year. But Ansul, do you have some more?"

Fahad, your question is right on point, but it is a sort of a futuristic discussion because this is not something that's going to happen in the next 1 or 2 years. Customers always like to collapse layers in the network because that is significant saving on cost and power. At the same time, their business teams would like to larger clusters, which results in adding layer. And as a result of that, we have a balanced that as you may know, our largest switch can support 230 terabits of throughput in a single switch. And for some of these large Cloud Titans, that's still not big enough. They would like bigger to Save one more layer of the network. So we're constantly engaged in these discussions as we move from 50-gig SerDes, which is where we are today in the [ 200-gig ] cord to 100-gig SerDes. Some of these architectural points will come up. But I think, by the end, this really hits, it may be when 224-gigs SerDes come out, that's at least 6 years out, maybe 5. It's very hard to predict that. And that's when I think you'll see some of these changes."

However, we will complement that so while on adjacencies will rely on our 7,000 or more customers. In the case of campus, we're spending a lot of time and energy on how to augment that with channels and partner distribution. 
And in the case of software and subscription services, it's not always connected. So Anshul and the team are putting a fair amount of effort on not really just hiring salespeople, but creating systems engineering expertise. So building that expertise for DMS, building that for a week is an important aspect because often, they may be the same customer, but they may be a different decision maker.

No, I think that we're very well aware of those directions, and we're maximizing our relevance there in a couple of ways.

You need low latency from physical edge to physical edge, regardless of where the Kubernetes quester sort of are deployed. And you need to be able to deploy them in a lot of different places, like you mentioned with edge compute. 
Also some enterprises need to be on-premises for various reasons to want the same application architecture they use in the cloud as well. And so there's a need to have this same sort of repeatable rollout process of the underlying infrastructure for those Kubernetes-based environments, whether it's on-prem, edge compute or in the cloud.

So the trends are not exact revenue for Q4, but it is our best indicator of how we think the year ahead will roll out. So we'll keep updating it every quarter to give you an idea of not how it's rolling out, but how it's actually turning out. So there's 3 sectors in that, right? The first sector is Cloud Titans because it's big enough. You just have to look at that number, individual of others. 
The second is enterprise and financials together, which is the other 36; and the third is specialty cloud and service providers together. So if you look at Q4, we believe all of the 3 sectors contributed strongly to the number. And if you look ahead, obviously, as Anshul has pointed out, the cloud titans are vital to our growth, but they're operating off a large base. 
So we should be able to grow faster in the other sectors and still carry a large number in Cloud Titans."

If there's one thing the pandemic has taught us, it's the importance of adapting in real time. In 2020, our world changed quickly and rapidly. As a cohesive leadership team, we had to prepare for a lot of unknowns and uncertainties where our offices were closed, our contract manufacturers were shutting down and supply chain constraints resulted in longer lead times. 2020 created new norms as we found many virtual ways of communicating with our customers, including access to our products for their business continuity. With vaccines emerging, we certainly hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these unprecedented times. I am so proud of our employees and how we've handled this and thank our partners and customers as well for placing their trust in us.
Back to some Q4 2020 specifics. We delivered revenues of $648.5 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49. A-Care services and software and support renewals contributed approximately 20% of our revenue. 
Our non-GAAP gross margins at 65% was influenced by software and services mix and a higher enterprise contribution for the quarter and the year. 
We've registered a record number of new customer logos and million dollar customers, a direct result of our momentum in the enterprise vertical and campus this quarter. We now have surpassed 7,200 cumulative customers over the past decade. In Q4 2020, Cloud Titans was our largest vertical. Enterprise was second, followed by financials in third place, and the providers, both service provider and cloud specialty providers tied for fourth place. In terms of sector trends, we see Cloud Titans at approximately 36%; enterprises, including financials at approximately 36%; and providers at approximately 28%, consistent with effective ranges we have provided. Microsoft was the only greater than 10% customer concentration at 21.5% for the year 2020. In terms of geographical mix, international contribution was slightly higher at 26%; with the Americas at 74% for Q4 2020. 
Despite a turbulent 2020, especially with Cloud Titans, we believe Arista is going to emerge stronger with more diversified products and customers. We reiterate our multiyear growth part based on 3 major product line evolutions: one, our core cloud and data center products built on a highly differentiated Arista EOS, leaf/spine architecture, and our cloud-first principle based on the 5 As. We expect this to contribute approximately 60% to 65% range in the future. 
Our second market is the network adjacencies, with routing replacing routers and our entry into the cognitive campus workspaces. We expect these 2 adjacencies together to contribute approximately in the range of 10% to 15%, as a compelling alternative to incumbent legacy networks.
Our third category is network software and services based on subscription models, such as Arista A-Care, CloudVision, multi-cloud EOS router, Big Switch DANZ monitoring fabric, or DMS, and advanced network detection and response with the recent Awake Security acquisition. We predict that these subscription-based network services and software will contribute approximately in the 25% range. Please note that perpetual software licenses are not included here and are generally counted in our core or adjacent product lines. 
As we look ahead, analyst research has shown that customers believe that COVID-19 has actually increased the value and relevance of the network in the post-pandemic era. And in our opinion, we concur. The networking industry is undergoing a metamorphosis from point silos or places in the network to a seamless cognitive cloud network that is data-driven. Arista's helping customers with their digital transformation to this data-centric cloud-first paradigm. As we experience the explosion of users, devices, IoT, OT, more video, more mobility of workloads and workflows, the boundary between all the locations, whether it's your office, cloud, home, teleworker and transit and user is really blurring into elastic workspaces. 
We believe Arista is well positioned to address the data-driven networks for this client-to-cloud workspaces. We are powering some of the world's largest data centers and cloud providers as a trusted partner. And this expertise that we have gained has helped us modernize networking to a software-driven cognitive experience. A good example of this is Arista's Q4 2020 introduction of DMF, or DANZ monitoring fabric for contextual observability based on our Big Switch acquisition that we did earlier in 2020. Our Zero Trust Vision that we launched this month also cements the relevance of a differentiated network protection and security. Our holistic Zero Trust network requires the union of network segmentation, situational awareness and visibility and network detection and response security. A key part of our strategy is to bring these cloud-first principles to every aspect of our cloud network. So we bring it to routing, observability and security functions, and it must be inherently designed as a part of the Arista state and AI-driven network architecture and foundation. 
So with this, I'd like to invite Ken Duda, our Founder and Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, to share some of our latest innovations on security. Ken?"

A Zero Trust framework for security is top of mind at Arista. For so many years, networking vendors have focused, first and foremost, on providing connectivity that is making sure everything can talk to everything else. This was fine in the 1980s, but it makes no sense today where security is a greater concern than ever for many of our customers, more important than connectivity itself. 
Arista is addressing the needs of security-conscious operators by integrating security directly into our network devices so that the network is secure from day 1 without bolt-on security products. You've already heard about the Awake acquisition and progress in AI-driven network detection and response. 
I'd like to go a little deeper on this call into another innovative Arista security feature called Macro Segmentation Service Groups, or MSSG. With MSSG, the operator assigns endpoints to segments. Based on the type of device that's connecting, the user of that device and/or the applications they are using. The operator then specifies a segmentation policy. Specifying which pairs of segments are permitted to communicate. For example, the policy might permit corporate engineering laptops to connect to manufacturing applications, but not to the finance applications and not even to one another. MSSG enforces that policy uniformly, whether wired or wireless, whether on the campus or in the data center, on-premises or working remotely. The operator can change the policy, including reassigning an endpoint to a different segment without requiring any other changes to the network. In particular, the policy is completely independent of network address assignment, which can be quite important. 
For example, if the user device behaves suspiciously, it can be reassigned to an untrusted segment without triggering any network change events on the device so that the compromised device can be quarantined and investigated without tipping off the adversary that they have been detected. 
Arista's MSSG works with 100% standards-based packets without adding any proprietary headers, trailers, encapsulations, et cetera, and is thus, easy to deploy incrementally into existing networks. Finally, enforcement is implemented entirely in hardware for high performance without relying on expensive switch TCAMs for classification, which has led to scale problems in competing solutions. Our view is that MSSG is an example of a larger trend in networking, where Moore's Law is enabling a larger and larger feature set to be integrated into mainstream switching and routing devices. This integration is essential to move beyond security as an afterthought and provide solutions that are secure off the shelf. And I'm delighted in the role Arista is able to play in helping customers address the challenges of building and operating a modern network, not just from a performance and scale perspective, but including so many other aspects such as visibility, manageability, monitoring, provisioning, process automation and, of course security.
Thanks. Back to you, Jayshree."

Clearly, customers are fatigued with the proprietary and silo networking you just mentioned. And just as we all modernize the cloud network, security must turn from a noun to an adjective to build secure networks. Ken, your world-class engineering team has mastered the art of quality and software architecture with best-in-class agility and programmability, credit to you for founding and building this innovation and greatness in Arista, and I can't wait to see more of it. 
In addition to our campus workspaces progress that I spoke about last time, next-generation routing is another key adjacent market. Our investments in simplification of Arista's routing stack has been going on for many years with standards-based EVPN, VXLAN, BGP and segment routing, and these are yielding good traction in cloud service provider and enterprise customer wins. 
To give you context on this, just in 2020 alone, we introduced 6 EOS software releases across 40 platforms and delivered over 800 features in routing. The result of these investments we have made in our routing, innovation and footprint have brought us over 200 customers in 2020. In summary, Arista demonstrates a stark contrast to the current fatigue of silos and different operating systems for WAN, campus, cloud, data center, each one generating its own disparate data silos. 
We are building upon our cloud networking heritage to unify data sets consistently and harnessing and archiving data across one software stack EUS and one CloudVision. The networking industry is truly ripe for this transition and change to data-driven networking. Simply put, a good enough mediocre network is no longer good enough and acceptable. And this is why we believe that we're poised for multiyear inflection ahead.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for the financial specifics. Ita?"

This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2020 results and our guidance for Q1 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release.
Total revenues in Q4 were $648.5 million, up 17.4% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $615 million to $635 million. 
While we continue to strive for improvements on the supply chain front, shipments remained somewhat constrained in the quarter, with some COVID second and third wave-related disruptions. Service and software support renewals represented approximately 20% of total revenue, down slightly from 21% last quarter. International revenues for the quarter came in at $165.7 million or 26% of total revenue, up from 25% in the third quarter. While the shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, is largely due to the location of deployments by our third -- by our Cloud Titan customers, we did see some incremental improvement in our in-region businesses this quarter. 
Overall gross margins in Q4 were a healthy 65%. At the upper end of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65%, reflecting a heavier mix of shipments to our enterprise and financials customers in the period. Operating expenses for the quarter were $178.1 million or 27.5% of revenue, up from last quarter at $159.4 million. We continue to increase operating expense investments during the quarter as our top line performance for the year continued to improve. 
R&D spending came in at $110.2 million or 17% of revenue, up from $106.1 million last quarter. This reflected increased employee costs, somewhat offset by lower new product introduction spending in the period.
Sales and marketing expense was $54.9 million or 8.5% of revenue, up from $43.1 million last quarter, with increased variable compensation and other headcount-related charges. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. 
Our G&A costs came in at $13 million or 2% of revenue, up from last quarter at approximately $10.2 million, reflecting normal fourth quarter compliance-related activities. 
Our operating income for the quarter was $243.5 million or 37.6% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.4 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.3%. Other income and expense included $2.5 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amounts. 
The favorable tax rate included the release of some tax reserves for which the statute of limitations expired in the period. This was a onetime effect, and the rate will likely return to our more structural rate of 21.9% in future periods.
Overall, this resulted in net income for the quarter of $197.7 million or 30.5% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.3 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter, of $2.49, up approximately 9% from the prior year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the year at approximately $2.87 billion.
To recap on our uses of cash for the year, we generated $735 million of cash from operations and returned approximately $395 million or 54% of this to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In addition, we used approximately $227 million or 31% to fund cash consideration for 2 acquisitions, which closed during the year, retaining the balance of approximately $113 million in the business. 
To date, we have repurchased $661 million or 3.2 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years commencing in Q2 '19. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate. 
Turning to the operational cash performance for the fourth quarter. We generated $186.9 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments in working capital. DSOs came in at 55 days, up from 46 days in Q3, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.8x, down from 2x last quarter. Inventory increased to $480 million in the quarter, up from $438 million in the prior period as we continue to buffer certain components and products. 
Our total deferred revenue balance was $651 million, up from $562 million in Q3. This increase largely reflected typical fourth quarter service renewal activity and a small amount of deferred product revenue related to new product deployments. The level of services deferred revenue is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Accounts payable days were 54 days, down from 70 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 million.
Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. We saw good diversification of the business in fiscal 2020, with expected declines in Cloud Titan revenue, somewhat offset by growth in our other market sectors. Looking to 2021, we expect continued growth with our enterprise and provider customers, combined with the solid Cloud Titan contribution. From a product perspective, we expect strength in adjacencies and software and services continue to make these areas a more meaningful contributor to the business over time. 
We believe a combination of these trends, combined with favorable year-over-year comparatives allowed for a top line growth rate for the year, which is in line with annual consensus growth rates of 14% to 15%. You should also note that our second half 2020 top line recovery will likely result in some deceleration in quarterly year-over-year growth rates as we move through 2021. On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver. 
Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to making go-forward results-based investments in the business. This includes continued go-to-market expansion to support enterprise and campus growth and investments in R&D to support innovation across the business.
Finally, our outlook discussion above and our guidance for Q1 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This is, however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. 
With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows: revenues of approximately $630 million to $650 million, gross margin of 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9% with diluted shares of approximately 80 million shares.
I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles?"

But protecting the network is only one aspect of the data center or campus. You have to make sure you work with different types of firewall vendors. You have to protect the cloud and the multi-cloud zones, you have to protect the devices and the identity. So Macro Segmentation has multiple fronts. 
We enforce a lot of roles to our partnerships with firewall vendors, in particular, Palo Alto networks as well as others. We enforce rules on the host with our partnership with VMware, especially. And then more recently, we've also done with our Macro Segmentation that Ken talked about, more and more identity mapping and enforcement with our partners like Forescout as well as Aruba, ClearPass and Okta. So the first thing I want to say is security is too important for just Arista to do. We'll be securing and protecting the network and working with these partners.

But I would say the third thing that's also clicking is our best-of-breed product capability. It's one thing to invest in it, but customers are really resonating with a single OS CloudVision being a huge differentiator, we just crossed over 1,000 CloudVision customers since we started shipping this product a few years ago. So I think the ability to not just build a great network, but to operate it, and for them to experience that quality of experience has made it much more complete. So I would say, great products, great go-to-market and then a high-quality operation and experience."

On the other hand, as we've been telling you, we're starting to make good penetration in both Tier 2, Tier 3 service providers as well as our Tier 2 cloud providers. So that has come up nicely to make up for some of the volatility in our Titans. 
In terms of your question, one of the things we felt in Q4, we did achieve was we were firing on all 5 verticals and on all 3 sectors. But because we had so much volatility in Titans, overall in the year, we were down. And Anshul, you may want to add to that is that, in our view, there is no reflection on the strength and an intimacy of our preferred partnership with our Cloud Titans. But we did have some delays in their qualification of 400-gig and in spite of all the new products we had, decisions took longer to happen.

So specific to WiFi, we view this as a very important component of our overall cognitive workspaces portfolio, but we are not competing directly with Cisco or Aruba or anybody else on the controller-based traditional WiFi architecture. So our approach to WiFi has been very much like our approach to optics. We're not an optical vendor, but we view WiFi and optics as an accessory to provide that cognitive inference, AI-driven architecture so that you can seamlessly connect across wired and WiFi. So CloudVision supports wired and WiFi. We have a unified edge that supports wired and WiFi. Our WiFi will lead to migration as customers may need into LTE or 4G or 5G. So to us, WiFi is almost a technology and a feature, not a market segment, but it's critical to bringing our wired, wireless, unified leaf/spine architecture that we extended from the data center into the campus. So I think our competitors are looking at it more traditionally, and we're looking at modern workspaces. 
As for SD-WAN, we've been very clear that we are not in that market space. We look at some of the SD-WAN attributes as features and an extension of our WAN routing.

Many enterprise customers are looking at us as the thought leader on how they should proceed with their workloads in the cloud. So I think by virtue of being consultative with them, what we're finding is some workloads move to the cloud, but many of them end up creating more data center capability that they need for some of their premise workloads. 
So this enterprise number that we are sharing absolutely includes more than campus. It includes existing customers, land and expand as well as new logos. We had one of our best ever quarters on not only new customer logos but million dollar customers. So you can imagine that wasn't just campus, and so there was a lot of data center in there."

Fahad, your question is right on point, but it is a sort of a futuristic discussion because this is not something that's going to happen in the next 1 or 2 years. Customers always like to collapse layers in the network because that is significant saving on cost and power. At the same time, their business teams would like larger clusters, which results in adding layers. And as a result of that, you have a balance there. Then as you may know, our largest switch can support 230 terabits of throughput in a single switch. And for some of these large Cloud Titans, that's still not big enough. They would like bigger to save one more layer of the network. So we're constantly engaged in these discussions. As we move from 50-gig SerDes, which is where we are today, in a 400-gig world, to 100-gig SerDes, some of these architectural points will come up. But I think, by the end this really hits, it may be when 224-gigs SerDes come out, that's at least 6 years out, maybe 5. But it's really hard to predict that.

So while on adjacencies will rely on our 7,000 or more customers. In the case of campus, we're spending a lot of time and energy on how to augment that with channels and partner distribution. 
And in the case of software and subscription services, it's not always connected. So Anshul and the team are putting a fair amount of effort on not really just hiring salespeople, but creating systems engineering expertise. So building that expertise for DMS, building that for a wake is an important aspect because often, they may be the same customer, but they may be a different decision maker.

No, I think that we're very well aware of those directions, and we're maximizing our relevance there in a couple of ways. The first is, what's required for that whole computing model for scaling out your application horizontally across Kubernetes is a uniform physical networking fabric. You need low latency from physical edge to physical edge, regardless of where the Kubernetes questers are deployed. And you need to be able to deploy them in a lot of different places, like you mentioned with edge compute. Also some enterprises need to be on-premises for various reasons to want the same application architecture that they use in the cloud as well. And so there's a need to have this same sort of repeatable rollout process of the underlying infrastructure for those Kubernetes-based environments, whether it's on-prem, edge compute or in the cloud.

The second is enterprise and financials together, which is the other 36; and the third is specialty cloud and service providers together. So if you look at Q4, we believe all of the 3 sectors contributed strongly to the number. And if you look ahead, obviously, as Anshul has pointed out, the Cloud Titans are vital to our growth, but they're operating off a large base. So we should be able to grow faster in the other sectors and still carry a large number in Cloud Titans."

If there's one thing the pandemic has taught us, it's the importance of adapting in real time. In 2020, our world changed quickly and rapidly. As a cohesive leadership team, we had to prepare for a lot of unknowns and uncertainties where our offices were closed, our contract manufacturers were shutting down and supply chain constraints resulted in longer lead times. 2020 created new norms as we found many virtual ways of communicating with our customers, including access to our products for their business continuity. With vaccines emerging, we certainly hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these unprecedented times. I am so proud of our employees and how we've handled this and thank our partners and customers as well for placing their trust in us.
Back to some Q4 2020 specifics. We delivered revenues of $648.5 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49. A-Care services and software and support renewals contributed approximately 20% of our revenue. 
Our non-GAAP gross margins at 65% was influenced by software and services mix and a higher enterprise contribution for the quarter and the year. 
We've registered a record number of new customer logos and million dollar customers, a direct result of our momentum in the enterprise vertical and campus this quarter. We now have surpassed 7,200 cumulative customers over the past decade. In Q4 2020, Cloud Titans was our largest vertical. Enterprise was second, followed by financials in third place, and the providers, both service provider and cloud specialty providers tied for fourth place. In terms of sector trends, we see Cloud Titans at approximately 36%; enterprises, including financials at approximately 36%; and providers at approximately 28%, consistent with effective ranges we have provided. Microsoft was the only greater than 10% customer concentration at 21.5% for the year 2020. In terms of geographical mix, international contribution was slightly higher at 26% (sic) [ 24% ]; with the Americas at 74% (sic) [ 76% ] for Q4 2020. 
Despite a turbulent 2020, especially with Cloud Titans, we believe Arista is going to emerge stronger with more diversified products and customers. We reiterate our multiyear growth part based on 3 major product line evolutions: one, our core cloud and data center products built on a highly differentiated Arista EOS, leaf/spine architecture, and our cloud-first principle based on the 5 As. We expect this to contribute approximately 60% to 65% range in the future. 
Our second market is the network adjacencies, with routing replacing routers and our entry into the cognitive campus workspaces. We expect these 2 adjacencies together to contribute approximately in the range of 10% to 15%, as a compelling alternative to incumbent legacy networks.
Our third category is network software and services based on subscription models, such as Arista A-Care, CloudVision, multi-cloud EOS router, Big Switch DANZ monitoring fabric, or DMF, and advanced network detection and response with the recent Awake Security acquisition. We predict that these subscription-based network services and software will contribute approximately in the 25% range. Please note that perpetual software licenses are not included here and are generally counted in our core or adjacent product lines. 
As we look ahead, analyst research has shown that customers believe that COVID-19 has actually increased the value and relevance of the network in the post-pandemic era. And in our opinion, we concur. The networking industry is undergoing a metamorphosis from point silos or places in the network to a seamless cognitive cloud network that is data-driven. Arista's helping customers with their digital transformation to this data-centric cloud-first paradigm. As we experience the explosion of users, devices, IoT, OT, more video, more mobility of workloads and workflows, the boundary between all the locations, whether it's your office, cloud, home, teleworker and transit and user is really blurring into elastic workspaces. 
We believe Arista is well positioned to address the data-driven networks for this client-to-cloud workspaces. We are powering some of the world's largest data centers and cloud providers as a trusted partner. And this expertise that we have gained has helped us modernize networking to a software-driven cognitive experience. A good example of this is Arista's Q4 2020 introduction of DMF, or DANZ monitoring fabric for contextual observability based on our Big Switch acquisition that we did earlier in 2020. Our Zero Trust vision that we launched this month also cements the relevance of a differentiated network protection and security. Our holistic Zero Trust network requires the union of network segmentation, situational awareness and visibility and network detection and response security. A key part of our strategy is to bring these cloud-first principles to every aspect of our cloud network. So we bring it to routing, observability and security functions, and it must be inherently designed as a part of the Arista state and AI-driven network architecture and foundation. 
So with this, I'd like to invite Ken Duda, our Founder and Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, to share some of our latest innovations on security. Ken?"

A Zero Trust framework for security is top of mind at Arista. For so many years, networking vendors have focused, first and foremost, on providing connectivity, that is making sure everything can talk to everything else. This was fine in the 1980s, but it makes no sense today where security is a greater concern than ever for many of our customers, more important than connectivity itself. 
Arista is addressing the needs of security-conscious operators by integrating security directly into our network devices so that the network is secure from day 1 without bolt-on security products. You've already heard about the Awake acquisition and progress in AI-driven network detection and response. 
I'd like to go a little deeper on this call into another innovative Arista security feature called Macro Segmentation Service Groups, or MSSG. With MSSG, the operator assigns endpoints to segments. Based on the type of device that's connecting, the user of that device and/or the applications they are using. The operator then specifies a segmentation policy. Specifying which pairs of segments are permitted to communicate. For example, the policy might permit corporate engineering laptops to connect to manufacturing applications, but not to the finance applications and not even to one another. MSSG enforces that policy uniformly, whether wired or wireless, whether on the campus or in the data center, on-premises or working remotely. The operator can change the policy, including reassigning an endpoint to a different segment without requiring any other changes to the network. In particular, the policy is completely independent of network address assignment, which can be quite important. 
For example, if the user device behaves suspiciously, it can be reassigned to an untrusted segment without triggering any network change events on the device so that the compromised device can be quarantined and investigated without tipping off the adversary that they have been detected. 
Arista's MSSG works with 100% standards-based packets without adding any proprietary headers, trailers, encapsulations, et cetera, and is thus, easy to deploy incrementally into existing networks. Finally, enforcement is implemented entirely in hardware for high performance without relying on expensive switch TCAMs for classification, which has led to scale problems in competing solutions. Our view is that MSSG is an example of a larger trend in networking, where Moore's Law is enabling a larger and larger feature set to be integrated into mainstream switching and routing devices. This integration is essential to move beyond security as an afterthought and provide solutions that are secure off the shelf. And I'm delighted in the role Arista is able to play in helping customers address the challenges of building and operating a modern network, not just from a performance and scale perspective, but including so many other aspects such as visibility, manageability, monitoring, provisioning, process automation and, of course security.
Thanks. Back to you, Jayshree."

Clearly, customers are fatigued with the proprietary and silo networking you just mentioned. And just as we all modernize the cloud network, security must turn from a noun to an adjective to build secure networks. Ken, your world-class engineering team has mastered the art of quality and software architecture with best-in-class agility and programmability, credit to you for founding and building this innovation and greatness in Arista, and I can't wait to see more of it. 
In addition to our campus workspaces progress that I spoke about last time, next-generation routing is another key adjacent market. Our investments in simplification of Arista's routing stack has been going on for many years with standards-based EVPN, VXLAN, BGP and segment routing, and these are yielding good traction in cloud service provider and enterprise customer wins. 
To give you context on this, just in 2020 alone, we introduced 6 EOS software releases across 40 platforms and delivered over 800 features in routing. The result of these investments we have made in our routing, innovation and footprint have brought us over 200 customers in 2020. In summary, Arista demonstrates a stark contrast to the current fatigue of silos and different operating systems for WAN, campus, cloud, data center, each one generating its own disparate data silos. 
We are building upon our cloud networking heritage to unify data sets consistently and harnessing and archiving data across one software stack EOS and one CloudVision. The networking industry is truly ripe for this transition and change to data-driven networking. Simply put, a good enough mediocre network is no longer good enough and acceptable. And this is why we believe that we're poised for multiyear inflection ahead.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for the financial specifics. Ita?"

This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2020 results and our guidance for Q1 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release.
Total revenues in Q4 were $648.5 million, up 17.4% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $615 million to $635 million. 
While we continue to strive for improvements on the supply chain front, shipments remained somewhat constrained in the quarter, with some COVID second and third wave-related disruptions. Service and software support renewals represented approximately 20% of total revenue, down slightly from 21% last quarter. International revenues for the quarter came in at $165.7 million or 26% of total revenue, up from 25% in the third quarter. While the shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, is largely due to the location of deployments by our third -- by our Cloud Titan customers, we did see some incremental improvement in our in-region businesses this quarter. 
Overall gross margins in Q4 were a healthy 65%, at the upper end of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65%, reflecting a heavier mix of shipments to our enterprise and financials customers in the period. Operating expenses for the quarter were $178.1 million or 27.5% of revenue, up from last quarter at $159.4 million. We continue to increase operating expense investments during the quarter as our top line performance for the year continued to improve. 
R&D spending came in at $110.2 million or 17% of revenue, up from $106.1 million last quarter. This reflected increased employee costs, somewhat offset by lower new product introduction spending in the period.
Sales and marketing expense was $54.9 million or 8.5% of revenue, up from $43.1 million last quarter, with increased variable compensation and other headcount-related charges. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. 
Our G&A costs came in at $13 million or 2% of revenue, up from last quarter at approximately $10.2 million, reflecting normal fourth quarter compliance-related activities. 
Our operating income for the quarter was $243.5 million or 37.6% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.4 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.3%. Other income and expense included $2.5 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amounts. 
The favorable tax rate included the release of some tax reserves for which the statute of limitations expired in the period. This was a onetime effect, and the rate will likely return to our more structural rate of 21.9% in future periods.
Overall, this resulted in net income for the quarter of $197.7 million or 30.5% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.3 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter, of $2.49, up approximately 9% from the prior year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the year at approximately $2.87 billion.
To recap on our uses of cash for the year, we generated $735 million of cash from operations and returned approximately $395 million or 54% of this to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In addition, we used approximately $227 million or 31% to fund cash consideration for 2 acquisitions, which closed during the year, retaining the balance of approximately $113 million in the business. 
To date, we have repurchased $661 million or 3.2 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years commencing in Q2 '19. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate. 
Turning to the operational cash performance for the fourth quarter. We generated $186.9 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments in working capital. DSOs came in at 55 days, up from 46 days in Q3, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.8x, down from 2x last quarter. Inventory increased to $480 million in the quarter, up from $438 million in the prior period as we continue to buffer certain components and products. 
Our total deferred revenue balance was $651 million, up from $562 million in Q3. This increase largely reflected typical fourth quarter service renewal activity and a small amount of deferred product revenue related to new product deployments. The level of services deferred revenue is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Accounts payable days were 54 days, down from 70 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 million.
Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. We saw good diversification of the business in fiscal 2020, with expected declines in Cloud Titan revenue, somewhat offset by growth in our other market sectors. Looking to 2021, we expect continued growth with our enterprise and provider customers, combined with the solid Cloud Titan contribution. From a product perspective, we expect strength in adjacencies and software and services continue to make these areas a more meaningful contributor to the business over time. 
We believe a combination of these trends, combined with favorable year-over-year comparatives allowed for a top line growth rate for the year, which is in line with annual consensus growth rates of 14% to 15%. You should also note that our second half 2020 top line recovery will likely result in some deceleration in quarterly year-over-year growth rates as we move through 2021. On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver. 
Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to making go-forward results-based investments in the business. This includes continued go-to-market expansion to support enterprise and campus growth and investments in R&D to support innovation across the business.
Finally, our outlook discussion above and our guidance for Q1 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This is, however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. 
With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows: revenues of approximately $630 million to $650 million, gross margin of 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9% with diluted shares of approximately 80 million shares.
I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles?"

But protecting the network is only one aspect of the data center or campus. You have to make sure you work with different types of firewall vendors. You have to protect the cloud and the multi-cloud zones, you have to protect the devices and the identity. So Macro Segmentation has multiple fronts. 
We enforce a lot of roles to our partnerships with firewall vendors, in particular, Palo Alto Networks as well as others. We enforce rules on the host with our partnership with VMware, especially. And then more recently, we've also done with our Macro Segmentation that Ken talked about, more and more identity mapping and enforcement with our partners like Forescout as well as Aruba ClearPass and Okta. So the first thing I want to say is security is too important for just Arista to do. We'll be securing and protecting the network and working with these partners.

So that has come up nicely to make up for some of the volatility in our Titans. 
In terms of answering your question, one of the things we felt in Q4, we did achieve was we were firing on all 5 verticals and on all 3 sectors. But because we had so much volatility in Titans, overall in the year, we were down. And Anshul, you may want to add to that is that, in our view, there is no reflection on the strength and the intimacy of our preferred partnership with our Cloud Titans.

So specific to WiFi, we view this as a very important component of our overall cognitive workspaces portfolio, but we are not competing directly with Cisco or Aruba or anybody else on the controller-based traditional WiFi architecture. So our approach to WiFi has been very much like our approach to optics. We're not an optical vendor, but we view WiFi and optics as an accessory to provide that cognitive inference, AI-driven architecture so that you can seamlessly connect across wired and WiFi. So CloudVision supports wired and WiFi. We have a unified edge that supports wired and WiFi. Our WiFi will lead to migration as customers may need into LTE or 4G or 5G. So to us, WiFi is almost a technology and a feature, not a market segment, but it's critical to bringing our wired, wireless, unified leaf/spine architecture that we extended from the data center into the campus. So I think our competitors are looking at it more traditionally, and we're looking at modern workspaces. 
As for SD-WAN, we've been very clear that we are not in that market space. We look at some of the SD-WAN attributes as features and an extension of our WAN routing.

The supply chain, some of the suppliers into that supply chain, saw that as well, right? So it's just -- I don't know that it's that's different to where we have been. And as we head into Q1, I think we're in a similar position. So there's no great disruption to the numbers, I think, coming out of changes in that environment. We just didn't make maybe as much progress as we would have liked, right? So we're continuing to just stay close to customers and prioritize, but we're also trying to make sure we don't lose business as part of that."

So this enterprise number that we are sharing absolutely includes more than campus. It includes existing customers, land and expand as well as new logos. We had one of our best ever quarters on not only new customer logos but million dollar customers. So you can imagine that wasn't just campus, and so there was a lot of data center in there."

Fahad, your question is right on point, but it is a sort of a futuristic discussion because this is not something that's going to happen in the next 1 or 2 years. Customers always like to collapse layers in the network because that is significant saving on cost and power. At the same time, their business teams would like larger clusters, which results in adding layers. And as a result of that, you have to balance that. Then as you may know, our largest switch can support 230 terabits of throughput in a single switch. And for some of these large Cloud Titans, that's still not big enough. They would like bigger to save one more layer of the network. So we're constantly engaged in these discussions. As we move from 50-gig SerDes, which is where we are today, in a 400-gig world, to 100-gig SerDes, some of these architectural points will come up. But I think, by the time this really hits, it may be when 224-gigs SerDes come out, that's at least 6 years out, maybe 5. But it's really hard to predict that.

And in the case of software and subscription services, it's not always connected. So Anshul and the team are putting a fair amount of effort on not really just hiring salespeople, but creating systems engineering expertise.

No, I think that we're very well aware of those directions, and we're maximizing our relevance there in a couple of ways.

You need low latency from physical edge to physical edge, regardless of where the Kubernetes clusters are deployed. And you need to be able to deploy them in a lot of different places, like you mentioned with edge compute. Also some enterprises need to be on-premises for various reasons but want the same application architecture that they use in the cloud as well.

And so 100-gig will continue to be relevant as we augment with 400-gig, both in our high-end cloud and enterprise and service providers."

The second is enterprise and financials together, which is the other 36%; and the third is specialty cloud and service providers together.

If there's one thing the pandemic has taught us, it's the importance of adapting in real time. In 2020, our world changed quickly and rapidly. As a cohesive leadership team, we had to prepare for a lot of unknowns and uncertainties where our offices were closed, our contract manufacturers were shutting down and supply chain constraints resulted in longer lead times. 2020 created new norms as we found many virtual ways of communicating with our customers, including access to our products for their business continuity. With vaccines emerging, we certainly hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these unprecedented times. I am so proud of our employees and how we've handled this and thank our partners and customers as well for placing their trust in us.
Back to some Q4 2020 specifics. We delivered revenues of $648.5 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49. A-Care services and software and support renewals contributed approximately 20% of our revenue. 
Our non-GAAP gross margins at 65% was influenced by software and services mix and a higher enterprise contribution for the quarter and the year. 
We've registered a record number of new customer logos and million dollar customers, a direct result of our momentum in the enterprise vertical and campus this quarter. We now have surpassed 7,200 cumulative customers over the past decade. In Q4 2020, Cloud Titans was our largest vertical. Enterprise was second, followed by financials in third place, and the providers, both service provider and cloud specialty providers tied for fourth place. In terms of sector trends, we see Cloud Titans at approximately 36%; enterprises, including financials at approximately 36%; and providers at approximately 28%, consistent with effective ranges we have provided. Microsoft was the only greater than 10% customer concentration at 21.5% for the year 2020. In terms of geographical mix, international contribution was slightly higher at 26% (sic) [ 24% ]; with the Americas at 74% (sic) [ 76% ] for Q4 2020. 
Despite a turbulent 2020, especially with Cloud Titans, we believe Arista is going to emerge stronger with more diversified products and customers. We reiterate our multiyear growth part based on 3 major product line evolutions: one, our core cloud and data center products built on a highly differentiated Arista EOS, leaf/spine architecture, and our cloud-first principle based on the 5 As. We expect this to contribute approximately 60% to 65% range in the future. 
Our second market is the network adjacencies, with routing replacing routers and our entry into the cognitive campus workspaces. We expect these 2 adjacencies together to contribute approximately in the range of 10% to 15%, as a compelling alternative to incumbent legacy networks.
Our third category is network software and services based on subscription models, such as Arista A-Care, CloudVision, multi-cloud EOS router, Big Switch DANZ monitoring fabric, or DMF, and advanced network detection and response with the recent Awake Security acquisition. We predict that these subscription-based network services and software will contribute approximately in the 25% range. Please note that perpetual software licenses are not included here and are generally counted in our core or adjacent product lines. 
As we look ahead, analyst research has shown that customers believe that COVID-19 has actually increased the value and relevance of the network in the post-pandemic era. And in our opinion, we concur. The networking industry is undergoing a metamorphosis from point silos or places in the network to a seamless cognitive cloud network that is data-driven. Arista's helping customers with their digital transformation to this data-centric cloud-first paradigm. As we experience the explosion of users, devices, IoT, OT, more video, more mobility of workloads and workflows, the boundary between all the locations, whether it's your office, cloud, home, teleworker and transit and user is really blurring into elastic workspaces. 
We believe Arista is well positioned to address the data-driven networks for this client-to-cloud workspaces. We are powering some of the world's largest data centers and cloud providers as a trusted partner. And this expertise that we have gained has helped us modernize networking to a software-driven cognitive experience. A good example of this is Arista's Q4 2020 introduction of DMF, or DANZ monitoring fabric for contextual observability based on our Big Switch acquisition that we did earlier in 2020. Our Zero Trust vision that we launched this month also cements the relevance of a differentiated network protection and security. Our holistic Zero Trust network requires the union of network segmentation, situational awareness and visibility and network detection and response security. A key part of our strategy is to bring these cloud-first principles to every aspect of our cloud network. So we bring it to routing, observability and security functions, and it must be inherently designed as a part of the Arista state and AI-driven network architecture and foundation. 
So with this, I'd like to invite Ken Duda, our Founder and Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, to share some of our latest innovations on security. Ken?"

A Zero Trust framework for security is top of mind at Arista. For so many years, networking vendors have focused, first and foremost, on providing connectivity, that is making sure everything can talk to everything else. This was fine in the 1980s, but it makes no sense today where security is a greater concern than ever for many of our customers, more important than connectivity itself. 
Arista is addressing the needs of security-conscious operators by integrating security directly into our network devices so that the network is secure from day 1 without bolt-on security products. You've already heard about the Awake acquisition and progress in AI-driven network detection and response. 
I'd like to go a little deeper on this call into another innovative Arista security feature called Macro Segmentation Service Groups, or MSSG. With MSSG, the operator assigns endpoints to segments. Based on the type of device that's connecting, the user of that device and/or the applications they are using. The operator then specifies a segmentation policy. Specifying which pairs of segments are permitted to communicate. For example, the policy might permit corporate engineering laptops to connect to manufacturing applications, but not to the finance applications and not even to one another. MSSG enforces that policy uniformly, whether wired or wireless, whether on the campus or in the data center, on-premises or working remotely. The operator can change the policy, including reassigning an endpoint to a different segment without requiring any other changes to the network. In particular, the policy is completely independent of network address assignment, which can be quite important. 
For example, if the user device behaves suspiciously, it can be reassigned to an untrusted segment without triggering any network change events on the device so that the compromised device can be quarantined and investigated without tipping off the adversary that they have been detected. 
Arista's MSSG works with 100% standards-based packets without adding any proprietary headers, trailers, encapsulations, et cetera, and is thus, easy to deploy incrementally into existing networks. Finally, enforcement is implemented entirely in hardware for high performance without relying on expensive switch TCAMs for classification, which has led to scale problems in competing solutions. Our view is that MSSG is an example of a larger trend in networking, where Moore's Law is enabling a larger and larger feature set to be integrated into mainstream switching and routing devices. This integration is essential to move beyond security as an afterthought and provide solutions that are secure off the shelf. And I'm delighted in the role Arista is able to play in helping customers address the challenges of building and operating a modern network, not just from a performance and scale perspective, but including so many other aspects such as visibility, manageability, monitoring, provisioning, process automation and, of course security.
Thanks. Back to you, Jayshree."

Clearly, customers are fatigued with the proprietary and silo networking you just mentioned. And just as we all modernize the cloud network, security must turn from a noun to an adjective to build secure networks. Ken, your world-class engineering team has mastered the art of quality and software architecture with best-in-class agility and programmability, credit to you for founding and building this innovation and greatness in Arista, and I can't wait to see more of it. 
In addition to our campus workspaces progress that I spoke about last time, next-generation routing is another key adjacent market. Our investments in simplification of Arista's routing stack has been going on for many years with standards-based EVPN, VXLAN, BGP and segment routing, and these are yielding good traction in cloud service provider and enterprise customer wins. 
To give you context on this, just in 2020 alone, we introduced 6 EOS software releases across 40 platforms and delivered over 800 features in routing. The result of these investments we have made in our routing, innovation and footprint have brought us over 200 customers in 2020. In summary, Arista demonstrates a stark contrast to the current fatigue of silos and different operating systems for WAN, campus, cloud, data center, each one generating its own disparate data silos. 
We are building upon our cloud networking heritage to unify data sets consistently and harnessing and archiving data across one software stack EOS and one CloudVision. The networking industry is truly ripe for this transition and change to data-driven networking. Simply put, a good enough mediocre network is no longer good enough and acceptable. And this is why we believe that we're poised for multiyear inflection ahead.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for the financial specifics. Ita?"

This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2020 results and our guidance for Q1 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release.
Total revenues in Q4 were $648.5 million, up 17.4% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $615 million to $635 million. 
While we continue to strive for improvements on the supply chain front, shipments remained somewhat constrained in the quarter, with some COVID second and third wave-related disruptions. Service and software support renewals represented approximately 20% of total revenue, down slightly from 21% last quarter. International revenues for the quarter came in at $165.7 million or 26% of total revenue, up from 25% in the third quarter. While the shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, is largely due to the location of deployments by our third -- by our Cloud Titan customers, we did see some incremental improvement in our in-region businesses this quarter. 
Overall gross margins in Q4 were a healthy 65%, at the upper end of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65%, reflecting a heavier mix of shipments to our enterprise and financials customers in the period. Operating expenses for the quarter were $178.1 million or 27.5% of revenue, up from last quarter at $159.4 million. We continue to increase operating expense investments during the quarter as our top line performance for the year continued to improve. 
R&D spending came in at $110.2 million or 17% of revenue, up from $106.1 million last quarter. This reflected increased employee costs, somewhat offset by lower new product introduction spending in the period.
Sales and marketing expense was $54.9 million or 8.5% of revenue, up from $43.1 million last quarter, with increased variable compensation and other headcount-related charges. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. 
Our G&A costs came in at $13 million or 2% of revenue, up from last quarter at approximately $10.2 million, reflecting normal fourth quarter compliance-related activities. 
Our operating income for the quarter was $243.5 million or 37.6% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.4 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.3%. Other income and expense included $2.5 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amounts. 
The favorable tax rate included the release of some tax reserves for which the statute of limitations expired in the period. This was a onetime effect, and the rate will likely return to our more structural rate of 21.9% in future periods.
Overall, this resulted in net income for the quarter of $197.7 million or 30.5% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.3 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter, of $2.49, up approximately 9% from the prior year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the year at approximately $2.87 billion.
To recap on our uses of cash for the year, we generated $735 million of cash from operations and returned approximately $395 million or 54% of this to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In addition, we used approximately $227 million or 31% to fund cash consideration for 2 acquisitions, which closed during the year, retaining the balance of approximately $113 million in the business. 
To date, we have repurchased $661 million or 3.2 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years commencing in Q2 '19. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate. 
Turning to the operational cash performance for the fourth quarter. We generated $186.9 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments in working capital. DSOs came in at 55 days, up from 46 days in Q3, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.8x, down from 2x last quarter. Inventory increased to $480 million in the quarter, up from $438 million in the prior period as we continue to buffer certain components and products. 
Our total deferred revenue balance was $651 million, up from $562 million in Q3. This increase largely reflected typical fourth quarter service renewal activity and a small amount of deferred product revenue related to new product deployments. The level of services deferred revenue is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Accounts payable days were 54 days, down from 70 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 million.
Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. We saw good diversification of the business in fiscal 2020, with expected declines in Cloud Titan revenue, somewhat offset by growth in our other market sectors. Looking to 2021, we expect continued growth with our enterprise and provider customers, combined with the solid Cloud Titan contribution. From a product perspective, we expect strength in adjacencies and software and services continue to make these areas a more meaningful contributor to the business over time. 
We believe a combination of these trends, combined with favorable year-over-year comparatives allowed for a top line growth rate for the year, which is in line with annual consensus growth rates of 14% to 15%. You should also note that our second half 2020 top line recovery will likely result in some deceleration in quarterly year-over-year growth rates as we move through 2021. On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver. 
Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to making go-forward results-based investments in the business. This includes continued go-to-market expansion to support enterprise and campus growth and investments in R&D to support innovation across the business.
Finally, our outlook discussion above and our guidance for Q1 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This is, however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. 
With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows: revenues of approximately $630 million to $650 million, gross margin of 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9% with diluted shares of approximately 80 million shares.
I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles?"

But protecting the network is only one aspect of the data center or campus. You have to make sure you work with different types of firewall vendors. You have to protect the cloud and the multi-cloud zones, you have to protect the devices and the identity. So Macro Segmentation has multiple fronts. 
We enforce a lot of roles to our partnerships with firewall vendors, in particular, Palo Alto Networks as well as others. We enforce rules on the host with our partnership with VMware, especially. And then more recently, we've also done with our Macro Segmentation that Ken talked about, more and more identity mapping and enforcement with our partners like Forescout as well as Aruba ClearPass and Okta. So the first thing I want to say is security is too important for just Arista to do. We'll be securing and protecting the network and working with these partners. 
Looking ahead, we see other forms of security, too. And I'd love for Ken or Anshul to comment because whether it is securing the networks and segmentation and the many forms we talked about, but also more and more in the data center encryption capabilities and privacy, whether it's network-wide or [ hop to pop ], and in the campus, bringing security all the way down to our wireless. So Ken or Anshul, do you want to say something more about that?"

In terms of answering your question, one of the things we felt in Q4, we did achieve was we were firing on all 5 verticals and on all 3 sectors. But because we had so much volatility in Titans, overall in the year, we were down. And Anshul, you may want to add to that is that, in our view, there is no reflection on the strength and the intimacy of our preferred partnership with our Cloud Titans.

So specific to WiFi, we view this as a very important component of our overall cognitive workspaces portfolio, but we are not competing directly with Cisco or Aruba or anybody else on the controller-based traditional WiFi architecture. So our approach to WiFi has been very much like our approach to optics. We're not an optical vendor, but we view WiFi and optics as an accessory to provide that cognitive inference, AI-driven architecture so that you can seamlessly connect across wired and WiFi. So CloudVision supports wired and WiFi. We have a unified edge that supports wired and WiFi. Our WiFi will lead to migration as customers may need into LTE or 4G or 5G. So to us, WiFi is almost a technology and a feature, not a market segment, but it's critical to bringing our wired, wireless, unified leaf/spine architecture that we extended from the data center into the campus. So I think our competitors are looking at it more traditionally, and we're looking at modern workspaces. 
As for SD-WAN, we've been very clear that we are not in that market space. We look at some of the SD-WAN attributes as features and an extension of our WAN routing.

But I think we had hoped, as we talked this time last quarter, we had hoped to see more of a recovery in the fourth quarter than we did just because we saw more COVID-related disruptions around -- we lost some manufacturing capacity on and off because of COVID activities in different locations. The supply chain, some of the suppliers into that supply chain, saw that as well, right? So it's just -- I don't know that it's that's different to where we have been. And as we head into Q1, I think we're in a similar position. So there's no great disruption to the numbers, I think, coming out of changes in that environment. We just didn't make maybe as much progress as we would have liked, right? So we're continuing to just stay close to customers and prioritize, but we're also trying to make sure we don't lose business as part of that."

So this enterprise number that we are sharing absolutely includes more than campus. It includes existing customers, land and expand as well as new logos. We had one of our best ever quarters on not only new customer logos but million dollar customers. So you can imagine that wasn't just campus, and so there was a lot of data center in there."

Fahad, your question is right on point, but it is a sort of a futuristic discussion because this is not something that's going to happen in the next 1 or 2 years. Customers always like to collapse layers in the network because that is significant saving on cost and power. At the same time, their business teams would like larger clusters, which results in adding layers. And as a result of that, you have to balance that. Then as you may know, our largest switch can support 230 terabits of throughput in a single switch. And for some of these large Cloud Titans, that's still not big enough. They would like bigger to save one more layer of the network. So we're constantly engaged in these discussions. As we move from 50-gig SerDes, which is where we are today, in a 400-gig world, to 100-gig SerDes, some of these architectural points will come up. But I think, by the time this really hits, it may be when 224-gigs SerDes come out, that's at least 6 years out, maybe 5. But it's really hard to predict that.

And in the case of software and subscription services, it's not always connected.

No, I think that we're very well aware of those directions, and we're maximizing our relevance there in a couple of ways.

You need low latency from physical edge to physical edge, regardless of where the Kubernetes clusters are deployed. And you need to be able to deploy them in a lot of different places, like you mentioned with edge compute. Also some enterprises need to be on-premises for various reasons but want the same application architecture that they use in the cloud as well.

If there's one thing the pandemic has taught us, it's the importance of adapting in real time. In 2020, our world changed quickly and rapidly. As a cohesive leadership team, we had to prepare for a lot of unknowns and uncertainties where our offices were closed, our contract manufacturers were shutting down and supply chain constraints resulted in longer lead times. 2020 created new norms as we found many virtual ways of communicating with our customers, including access to our products for their business continuity. With vaccines emerging, we certainly hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these unprecedented times. I am so proud of our employees and how we've handled this and thank our partners and customers as well for placing their trust in us.
Back to some Q4 2020 specifics. We delivered revenues of $648.5 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49. A-Care services and software and support renewals contributed approximately 20% of our revenue. 
Our non-GAAP gross margins at 65% was influenced by software and services mix and a higher enterprise contribution for the quarter and the year. 
We've registered a record number of new customer logos and million dollar customers, a direct result of our momentum in the enterprise vertical and campus this quarter. We now have surpassed 7,200 cumulative customers over the past decade. In Q4 2020, Cloud Titans was our largest vertical. Enterprise was second, followed by financials in third place, and the providers, both service provider and cloud specialty providers tied for fourth place. In terms of sector trends, we see Cloud Titans at approximately 36%; enterprises, including financials at approximately 36%; and providers at approximately 28%, consistent with the sector ranges we have provided. Microsoft was the only greater than 10% customer concentration at 21.5% for the year 2020. In terms of geographical mix, international contribution was slightly higher at 26% (sic) [ 24% ]; with the Americas at 74% (sic) [ 76% ] for Q4 2020. 
Despite a turbulent 2020, especially with Cloud Titans, we believe Arista is going to emerge stronger with more diversified products and customers. We reiterate our multiyear growth path based on 3 major product line evolutions: one, our core cloud and data center products built on a highly differentiated Arista EOS, leaf/spine architecture, and our cloud-first principle based on the 5 As. We expect this to contribute approximately 60% to 65% range in the future. 
Our second market is the network adjacencies, with routing replacing routers and our entry into the cognitive campus workspaces. We expect these 2 adjacencies together to contribute approximately in the range of 10% to 15%, as a compelling alternative to incumbent legacy networks.
Our third category is network software and services based on subscription models, such as Arista A-Care, CloudVision, multi-cloud EOS router, Big Switch DANZ monitoring fabric, or DMF, and advanced network detection and response with the recent Awake Security acquisition. We predict that these subscription-based network services and software will contribute approximately in the 25% range. Please note that perpetual software licenses are not included here and are generally counted in our core or adjacent product lines. 
As we look ahead, analyst research has shown that customers believe that COVID-19 has actually increased the value and relevance of the network in the post-pandemic era. And in our opinion, we concur. The networking industry is undergoing a metamorphosis from point silos or places in the network to a seamless cognitive cloud network that is data-driven. Arista's helping customers with their digital transformation to this data-centric cloud-first paradigm. As we experience the explosion of users, devices, IoT, OT, more video, more mobility of workloads and workflows, the boundary between all the locations, whether it's your office, cloud, home, teleworker and transit end user is really blurring into elastic workspaces. 
We believe Arista is well positioned to address the data-driven networks for this client-to-cloud workspaces. We are powering some of the world's largest data centers and cloud providers as a trusted partner. And this expertise that we have gained has helped us modernize networking to a software-driven cognitive experience. A good example of this is Arista's Q4 2020 introduction of DMF, or DANZ monitoring fabric for contextual observability based on our Big Switch acquisition that we did earlier in 2020. Our Zero Trust vision that we launched this month also cements the relevance of a differentiated network protection and security. Our holistic Zero Trust network requires the union of network segmentation, situational awareness and visibility and network detection and response security. A key part of our strategy is to bring these cloud-first principles to every aspect of our cloud network. So we bring it to routing, observability and security functions, and it must be inherently designed as a part of the Arista state and AI-driven network architecture and foundation. 
So with this, I'd like to invite Ken Duda, our Founder and Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, to share some of our latest innovations on security. Ken?"

A Zero Trust framework for security is top of mind at Arista. For so many years, networking vendors have focused, first and foremost, on providing connectivity, that is making sure everything can talk to everything else. This was fine in the 1980s, but it makes no sense today where security is a greater concern than ever for many of our customers, more important than connectivity itself. 
Arista is addressing the needs of security-conscious operators by integrating security directly into our network devices so that the network is secure from day 1 without bolt-on security products. You've already heard about the Awake acquisition and progress in AI-driven network detection and response. 
I'd like to go a little deeper on this call into another innovative Arista security feature called Macro Segmentation Service Groups, or MSSG. With MSSG, the operator assigns endpoints to segments. Based on the type of device that's connecting, the user of that device and/or the applications they are using. The operator then specifies a segmentation policy. Specifying which pairs of segments are permitted to communicate. For example, the policy might permit corporate engineering laptops to connect to manufacturing applications, but not to the finance applications and not even to one another. MSSG enforces that policy uniformly, whether wired or wireless, whether on the campus or in the data center, on-premises or working remotely. The operator can change the policy, including reassigning an endpoint to a different segment without requiring any other changes to the network. In particular, the policy is completely independent of network address assignment, which can be quite important. 
For example, if the user device behaves suspiciously, it can be reassigned to an untrusted segment without triggering any network change events on the device so that the compromised device can be quarantined and investigated without tipping off the adversary that they have been detected. 
Arista's MSSG works with 100% standards-based packets without adding any proprietary headers, trailers, encapsulations, et cetera, and is thus, easy to deploy incrementally into existing networks. Finally, enforcement is implemented entirely in hardware for high performance without relying on expensive switch TCAMs for classification, which has led to scale problems in competing solutions. Our view is that MSSG is an example of a larger trend in networking, where Moore's Law is enabling a larger and larger feature set to be integrated into mainstream switching and routing devices. This integration is essential to move beyond security as an afterthought and provide solutions that are secure off the shelf. And I'm delighted in the role Arista is able to play in helping customers address the challenges of building and operating a modern network, not just from a performance and scale perspective, but including so many other aspects such as visibility, manageability, monitoring, provisioning, process automation and, of course security.
Thanks. Back to you, Jayshree."

Clearly, customers are fatigued with the proprietary and silo networking you just mentioned. And just as we all modernize the cloud network, security must turn from a noun to an adjective to build secure networks. Ken, your world-class engineering team has mastered the art of quality and software architecture with best-in-class agility and programmability, credit to you for founding and building this innovation and greatness in Arista, and I can't wait to see more of it. 
In addition to our campus workspaces progress that I spoke about last time, next-generation routing is another key adjacent market. Our investments in simplification of Arista's routing stack has been going on for many years with standards-based EVPN, VXLAN, BGP and segment routing, and these are yielding good traction in cloud service provider and enterprise customer wins. 
To give you context on this, just in 2020 alone, we introduced 6 EOS software releases across 40 platforms and delivered over 800 features in routing. The result of these investments we have made in our routing, innovation and footprint have brought us over 200 customers in 2020. In summary, Arista demonstrates a stark contrast to the current fatigue of silos and different operating systems for WAN, campus, cloud, data center, each one generating its own disparate data silos. 
We are building upon our cloud networking heritage to unify data sets consistently and harnessing and archiving data across one software stack EOS and one CloudVision. The networking industry is truly ripe for this transition and change to data-driven networking. Simply put, a good enough mediocre network is no longer good enough and acceptable. And this is why we believe that we're poised for multiyear inflection ahead.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ita for the financial specifics. Ita?"

This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2020 results and our guidance for Q1 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release.
Total revenues in Q4 were $648.5 million, up 17.4% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $615 million to $635 million. 
While we continue to strive for improvements on the supply chain front, shipments remained somewhat constrained in the quarter, with some COVID second and third wave-related disruptions. Service and software support renewals represented approximately 20% of total revenue, down slightly from 21% last quarter. International revenues for the quarter came in at $165.7 million or 26% of total revenue, up from 25% in the third quarter. While the shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, is largely due to the location of deployments by our third -- by our Cloud Titan customers, we did see some incremental improvement in our in-region businesses this quarter. 
Overall gross margins in Q4 were a healthy 65%, at the upper end of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65%, reflecting a heavier mix of shipments to our enterprise and financials customers in the period. Operating expenses for the quarter were $178.1 million or 27.5% of revenue, up from last quarter at $159.4 million. We continue to increase operating expense investments during the quarter as our top line performance for the year continued to improve. 
R&D spending came in at $110.2 million or 17% of revenue, up from $106.1 million last quarter. This reflected increased employee costs, somewhat offset by lower new product introduction spending in the period.
Sales and marketing expense was $54.9 million or 8.5% of revenue, up from $43.1 million last quarter, with increased variable compensation and other headcount-related charges. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. 
Our G&A costs came in at $13 million or 2% of revenue, up from last quarter at approximately $10.2 million, reflecting normal fourth quarter compliance-related activities. 
Our operating income for the quarter was $243.5 million or 37.6% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.4 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.3%. Other income and expense included $2.5 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amounts. 
The favorable tax rate included the release of some tax reserves for which the statute of limitations expired in the period. This was a onetime effect, and the rate will likely return to our more structural rate of 21.9% in future periods.
Overall, this resulted in net income for the quarter of $197.7 million or 30.5% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.3 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter, of $2.49, up approximately 9% from the prior year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the year at approximately $2.87 billion.
To recap on our uses of cash for the year, we generated $735 million of cash from operations and returned approximately $395 million or 54% of this to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In addition, we used approximately $227 million or 31% to fund cash consideration for 2 acquisitions, which closed during the year, retaining the balance of approximately $113 million in the business. 
To date, we have repurchased $661 million or 3.2 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years commencing in Q2 '19. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate. 
Turning to the operational cash performance for the fourth quarter. We generated $186.9 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments in working capital. DSOs came in at 55 days, up from 46 days in Q3, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.8x, down from 2x last quarter. Inventory increased to $480 million in the quarter, up from $438 million in the prior period as we continue to buffer certain components and products. 
Our total deferred revenue balance was $651 million, up from $562 million in Q3. This increase largely reflected typical fourth quarter service renewal activity and a small amount of deferred product revenue related to new product deployments. The level of services deferred revenue is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Accounts payable days were 54 days, down from 70 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 million.
Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. We saw good diversification of the business in fiscal 2020, with expected declines in Cloud Titan revenue, somewhat offset by growth in our other market sectors. Looking to 2021, we expect continued growth with our enterprise and provider customers, combined with the solid Cloud Titan contribution. From a product perspective, we expect strength in adjacencies and software and services continue to make these areas a more meaningful contributor to the business over time. 
We believe a combination of these trends, combined with favorable year-over-year comparatives allowed for a top line growth rate for the year, which is in line with annual consensus growth rates of 14% to 15%. You should also note that our second half 2020 top line recovery will likely result in some deceleration in quarterly year-over-year growth rates as we move through 2021. On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver. 
Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to making go-forward results-based investments in the business. This includes continued go-to-market expansion to support enterprise and campus growth and investments in R&D to support innovation across the business.
Finally, our outlook discussion above and our guidance for Q1 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This is, however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. 
With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows: revenues of approximately $630 million to $650 million, gross margin of 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9% with diluted shares of approximately 80 million shares.
I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles?"

But protecting the network is only one aspect of the data center or campus. You have to make sure you work with different types of firewall vendors. You have to protect the cloud and the multi-cloud zones, you have to protect the devices and the identity. So Macro Segmentation has multiple fronts. 
We enforce a lot of roles to our partnerships with firewall vendors, in particular, Palo Alto Networks as well as others. We enforce rules on the host with our partnership with VMware, especially. And then more recently, we've also done with our Macro Segmentation that Ken talked about, more and more identity mapping and enforcement with our partners like Forescout as well as Aruba ClearPass and Okta. So the first thing I want to say is security is too important for just Arista to do. We'll be securing and protecting the network and working with these partners. 
Looking ahead, we see other forms of security, too. And I'd love for Ken or Anshul to comment because whether it is securing the network through segmentation and the many forms we talked about, but also more and more in the data center encryption capabilities and privacy, whether it's network-wide or [ hop to pop ], and in the campus, bringing security all the way down to our wireless. So Ken or Anshul, do you want to say something more about that?"

So that has come up nicely to make up for some of the volatility in our Titans. 
In terms of answering your question, one of the things we felt in Q4, we did achieve was we were firing on all 5 verticals and on all 3 sectors. But because we had so much volatility in Titans, overall in the year, we were down. And Anshul, you may want to add to that is that, in our view, there is no reflection on the strength and the intimacy of our preferred partnership with our Cloud Titans.

So specific to WiFi, we view this as a very important component of our overall cognitive workspaces portfolio, but we are not competing directly with Cisco or Aruba or anybody else on the controller-based traditional WiFi architecture. So our approach to WiFi has been very much like our approach to optics. We're not an optical vendor, but we view WiFi and optics as an accessory to provide that cognitive inference, AI-driven architecture so that you can seamlessly connect across wired and WiFi. So CloudVision supports wired and WiFi. We have a unified edge that supports wired and WiFi. Our WiFi will lead to migration as customers may need into LTE or 4G or 5G. So to us, WiFi is almost a technology and a feature, not a market segment, but it's critical to bringing our wired, wireless, unified leaf/spine architecture that we extended from the data center into the campus. So I think our competitors are looking at it more traditionally, and we're looking at modern workspaces. 
As for SD-WAN, we've been very clear that we are not in that market space. We look at some of the SD-WAN attributes as features and an extension of our WAN routing.

So this enterprise number that we are sharing absolutely includes more than campus. It includes existing customers, land and expand as well as new logos.

Fahad, your question is right on point, but it is a sort of a futuristic discussion because this is not something that's going to happen in the next 1 or 2 years. Customers always like to collapse layers in the network because that is significant saving on cost and power. At the same time, their business teams would like larger clusters, which results in adding layers. And as a result of that, you have to balance that. Then as you may know, our largest switch can support 230 terabits of throughput in a single switch. And for some of these large Cloud Titans, that's still not big enough. They would like bigger to save one more layer of the network. So we're constantly engaged in these discussions. As we move from 50-gig SerDes, which is where we are today, in a 400-gig world, to 100-gig SerDes, some of these architectural points will come up. But I think, by the time this really hits, it may be when 224-gigs SerDes come out, that's at least 6 years out, maybe 5. But it's really hard to predict that.

And you need to be able to deploy them in a lot of different places, like you mentioned with edge compute. Also some enterprises need to be on-premises for various reasons but want the same application architecture that they use in the cloud as well.

Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope you're all being safe and vaccinated in these pandemic times.

I hope you're all being safe and vaccinated in these pandemic times. At Arista, we're especially deeply concerned by the heightened COVID crisis in India. We're taking steps to assist our local teams as best we can and know. 
Back to Q1 2021 specifics. We delivered revenues of $667.6 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.50. A-Care services, EOS renewals and subscription software contributed approximately 21.4% of the revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins at 64.7% was influenced by software and services mix as well as higher enterprise and cloud tightened contributions for the quarter. 
We continue to experience good customer traction and growth with new customer logos and increasing million dollar customers in the enterprises. In the quarter, Cloud Titans was our largest vertical, enterprise was a close second, followed by financials and specialty cloud providers tied at third place and service providers at fourth place. International contribution is 25%, and the Americas were at 75% in the quarter. 
In terms of sector and product trends, we will report the specifics annually. They are consistent with the ranges we have already provided in our Investor Relations. To reiterate, our Cloud Titans are in the 35% to 39% range, the enterprises are in the 35% to 39% range also, and the providers in the 25% to 30% range. 
Our product line forecast annually is expected to be 60% to 65% for core data center, 10% to 15% for adjacent campus and routing and 20% to 25% for software and services. In light of the industry-wide chip and supply chain shortages, I'd like to shed more light on this topic, especially as it pertains to Arista. 
First and foremost, we are pleased with the healthy demand we are experiencing, and Arista is resonating well with customers and prospects as they are driving our multiyear growth projections. We share a preferred status with many of our top 100 and more customers and work intimately with them. However, the supply chain has never been so constrained in Arista history. 
To put this in perspective, we now have to plan for many components with 52-week lead times. COVID has resulted in substrate and wafer shortages and reduced assembly capacity. Our contract manufacturers have experienced significant volatility due to country-specific COVID orders. Naturally, we're working more closely with our strategic suppliers to improve planning and delivery. 
Customer demand and visibility, though, has improved in the past few months. We are working with our customers to understand the timing of their deployment needs. We do not believe at this time that our customers are pre-ordering. However, we do think they're exercising prudent planning for second half of 2021 and even into 2022. 
With this as a backdrop, we believe supply chain will remain a pain point for the balance of this year as a result of all these shortages. Therefore, Arista is taking decisive steps to invest in increased inventory and manufacturing capacity. 
I now announce why customers, especially risk-averse enterprises, choose Arista. Arista's recent enterprise momentum spans many vertical markets and includes a suite of data center, campus, routing and software products. Our customers are aligned with our software-driven, data-centric approach to building their cloud architecture, their cloud operations and their cloud experience. 
A key part of our enterprise correction is addressing the CIO's pain points to build a cloud-first and a data-driven network, spanning client to cloud networking. Historically, disparate functions and data sets into routers, security, switches and network management functions can now be integrated by Arista into a seamless network architecture with programmability, state and AI-driven characteristics. 
Let me try to illustrate a few enterprise examples to highlight this. A recent data center customer win was in the hospitality sector. They chose us because of our single EOS software image across multiple leases and spine platforms. Using CloudVision for automation, for 0 touch provisioning, easy uprates telemetry and compliance was only feasible because of Arista. Arista's deep buffer spine switches also enhanced their availability. 
A second example is in the international retail customer for data center and routing applications. $1 million customer, this was based on EDPN and VXLAN modern deep design and once again leveraged CloudVision and EOS for improved automation, programmability and change control. NetOps and DevOps automation with ansible integration was another key deliverable for their distribution center. 
Our third enterprise win was in campus in Europe. The 720XP is differentiated as a POE platform with multi-gig capability across campus workspaces for both chassis and 1 RU form factors. The 7050CX spine and spline brought low power, low footprint and high-density as an alternative to the chassis. 
The campus customer also implemented unified wired and Wi-Fi cognitive capabilities, and this played a key role. Migrating from manual operations, once again, CloudVision with streaming telemetry was a key factor. 
In all these 3 examples, there were some common themes. The customer was very fatigued with legacy issues and embraced our U.S. software and our CloudVision as key differentiators and advantages. They also have much confidence in Arista's support, quality and continued innovation. They embrace our strategy and built upon our differentiated state-driven and programmable software foundation to deliver our cognitive 5As of agility, availability, analytics automation and AI and API-driven architectures. 
Switching to our popular Cloud Titans, we are pleased to also state that we now see increased visibility across 10-gig -- sorry, 100-gig, 200 and 400-gig demand from our Cloud Titan customers. While this business can be volatile, we have enjoyed a preferred partnership status with many of them deploying us in diverse use cases and deployments, consistent with the overall CapEx reported recently. 
I'd like to invite Anshul, our Chief Operating Officer, to elaborate more on this. Anshul?"

This analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in Q1 were $667.6 million, up 27.6% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $630 million to $650 million. Shipments remained somewhat constrained in the period as we continue to carefully navigate industry-wide supply chain constraints and COVID-related disruptions. 
Services and subscription software contributed approximately 21.4% of revenue in the first quarter. International revenues for the quarter came in at $165.7 million or 25% of total revenue, down slightly from 26% in the fourth quarter. This shift in geographical mix was largely due to the location of deployments by our larger Cloud Titan and Specialty Cloud customers. 
Overall gross margin in Q1 was 64.7%, above the midpoint of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65%, reflecting a balanced customer mix for the quarter. 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $180.9 million or 27.1% of revenue, up from last quarter at $178.1 million. R&D spending came in at $110 million or 16.5% of revenue, consistent with last quarter at $110.2 million. This reflected increased employee-related costs, offset by lower new product introduction spending in the period. 
Sales and marketing expense was $59.5 million or 8.9% of revenue, up from $54.9 million last quarter, with increased variable compensation and other headcount-related charges. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. 
Our G&A costs came in at $11.4 million or 1.7% of revenue, down from last quarter at approximately $13 million, reflecting normal fourth quarter compliance-related activities. 
Our operating income for the quarter was $251.3 million or 37.6% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.6 million. And our effective tax rate was approximately 21.4%. Other income and expense included $2 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amounts. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $198.8 million or 29.8% of revenue. 
Our diluted share number was 79.6 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.50, up approximately 23.8% from the prior year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the year at approximately $3 billion. We repurchased $101 million of our common stock during the first quarter at an average price of $276 per share. As a reminder, we've now repurchased $763 million or 3.6 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years, commencing in Q2 '19. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate. 
Turning to operational cash performance for the first quarter. We generated $254.7 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments in inventory and supply chain. 
DSOs came in at 51 days, down from 55 days in Q4, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.8x, consistent with last quarter. Inventory increased to $483.2 million in the quarter, up from $480 million in the prior period as we continue to buffer certain components of the products. 
Our total deferred revenue balance was $720 million, up from $651 million in Q4, approximately $40 million of this increase related to product deferred revenue with acceptance causes for new products across various customers and sectors. The remainder of the increase in deferred revenue related to service renewal activity and is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. 
Looking forward, we expect 2021 to be a year of significant new product introductions, combined with a healthy new customer acquisition rate and expanded use cases with existing customers. These trends, in conjunction with reduced levels upfront in-person testing, may result in increased customer-specific acceptance clauses and increased volatility and our product deferred revenue amounts. 
Accounts payable days were 52 days, down from 54 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.1 million. 
Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. We saw healthy demand across all of our market segments in the first quarter. These demand trends, combined with favorable year-over-year comparatives, continue to support an improving top line growth rate for the year. That said, we still expect some deceleration in quarterly year-over-year growth rates as we move through the year, given the top line recovery experienced in the second half of 2020. 
On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver. 
Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to growing our investments in R&D to support innovation across the business and sales and marketing to support our go-to-market expansion. 
Finally, our outlook discussed above and our guidance for Q2 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This is, however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate any challenges as the situation unfolds. 
With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the second quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items, is as follows: revenues of approximately $675 million to $695 million, gross margin of 63% to 65% and operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9%, with diluted shares of approximately $79.7 million.

It's not instant gratification like we've often had with our cloud providers or even early enterprise decision-makers. So investments, we made 2 years ago, are the suit to the labor is what we're seeing now. So that's one point. 
The second thing is our product line is more diverse before we were only selling data center. And the expansion from client to cloud, including our software products, our big switch DMF are Awake Security, our routing, our campus most importantly, CloudVision, which is the epicenter of all their manual to automation migration, I think, has been a huge advantage because we've really modernized the network until then, they were measured -- really, the migration was impossible because it was all in silos, different operating systems. 
So another big learning is the product line diversity, combined with the relationship we have formed over the last couple of years, I think, has been key. 
And in an odd sort of way, my third point would be COVID itself. COVID has been an equalizer for Arista with dominant enterprise competitors. So it has given our customers a chance to plan and think about alternatives. And I think we've had some advantage and disadvantage with that. The advantages they're more willing to work with at Arista. The disadvantages, they can't physically come and see us and do physical park, so we've had to move more virtually."

They've got to build the data centers. They've got to acquire the compute, the storage, the power, the cooling, you name it, and we got to also execute.

So where we're not building products today is more for the SMB. I would say that's, first of all, an area we haven't focused on. 
So if you think of our focus, we have DCI, we have multi-cloud. And I would even say WAN  routing, which could be a form of regional SD-WAN, and we'll continue to build on that. But in terms of SD-WAN, for the branch and SAFI and SMB market, we'll continue to partner with best of breed, whether it's VMware or Palo Alto or you name it.

I guess the question really is, when I look at your recent performance, it looks like you're sustaining really good top line growth. But you do with better diversity versus just being cloud titan or switching driven as it was in the past. So I guess my question is only on 2 dynamics: a, inherently, is selling software and security and routing a more complicated operation than selling switching and do you need to alter anything internally on go-to-market or something to keep sustaining this product diversity?  
And then secondly, as you start selling more to enterprises and service providers, what do you think is the biggest challenge you have to overcome to get success in that space?"

So yes, I would say, once you -- switching was hard too when he first got started because we were a new vendor. But now that we have entered switching with good market share, our approach to selling software and routing is to enhance our switching platforms. So it's not inherently harder, but it does take a different systems engineering and technical expertise. So what we find ourselves doing and Ashwin and Anshul's organization is augmenting our switching expertise with more software and routing. And we have specialists for the big Switch monitoring fabric. We have specialists for the Awake, network detection and response. We have specialists for routing.  So naturally, we need to build upon that switching foundation and add these layers of cake or icing, if you will. 
In terms of enterprise and service provider challenges, no doubt there's many. We're the new kid in the block. And we are still best-of-breed there, and we're dealing with the incumbency of vendors who've been there easily 10 to 20 to 30 years longer. So I would say our biggest challenge is breaking old habits. And I don't think we have any challenge showing our technical prowess. But being also the opportunity to get there and overcoming the incumbency continues to be an important challenge."

And what I mean by that is whether this improved visibility is just a reflection of the new projects, the design wins that you've talked about that require a little bit more forward planning or a reflection of the supply chain issues. Meaning once those are resolved, you should expect visibility to shorten back down again?  
And then on the deeper side of it, going back to the question on SD-WAN before. Jayshree, it seems like you talked a lot about automation and AI and monitoring and things like that. But security and networking are slowly blending on the edges as well. And you haven't talked really much, if at all, about your plan and how you're going to attack the security landscape and SD-WAN, which is a clear networking side. You seem to be leaving that to security vendors, which is a little bit of -- I don't understand why you do that? Why would you do that? 
So maybe you can kind of give us a little bit of your thoughts on the security market, how relevant do you think that would be for the future of the company longer term, perhaps not shorter term? And is partnership the best way to play there? Is there no play that you can have in this market?"

But to answer your specific question on cloud titans, definitely, Anshul and the team are very involved with the projects. And yes, those tend to be 1 to 2 quarters. But because of their long-term planning and our supply chain constraints, both go hand-in-hand. They're making some CapEx decisions, and we have some supply constraints. We are getting beyond that 2 quarter visibility to at least a year's visibility.  So I think you're absolutely right in saying it's going beyond the project 1 to 2 quarters to 1 year because of supply constraints and because of their long-term decision. 
On security, we -- I'll give you the short answer and there's a longer discussion. We will continue to partner with best-of-breed security vendors, number one. Our approach to zero trust networking will really be holistic and network centric. And there's really 3 parts to it. One is how do we provide the right network segmentation. We introduced the macro segmentation, how do we provide the right encryption capabilities at the DCI layer. This has been a huge differentiator for us and our data center products. So how do we do the wireless intrusion protection, all of those are network-related security. 
The second area I would largely call visibility of situational analysis. The combination of both the awake products as well as the real-time telemetry and streaming and big switch dance monitoring fabric really allows us to attack security from a visibility perspective. And the third is the proactive acquisition of Awake itself. We didn't acquire Awake just to be a point security product. We really acquired it, and Anshul and Rahul are working on this, to make it a more seamless network and proactive network detection and response capability that's AI driven. 
So stay tuned, you'll hear more from us on that, but all of this basically is our Zero Trust networking strategy, different from our partnerships with firewall vendors or cloud security vendors."

We just introduced that recently, and you'll be seeing variance of that on different platforms, including the 7050 and 7280 towards the end of this year. So the Big Switch integration is very strategic, not only because of the monitoring capabilities, but because of the switch integration. 
On the Awake side, I'm going to have Anshu talk more about it, but the team has done a fantastic job, first of all, of really focusing in, not just on the CSO, but on the CIO. You really have to target both decision-makers. Anshul, do you want to say more about that?"

But I'm not necessarily in a position to start trying to guide that multiple quarters out yet, but I think we do not expect it to come down. It's a mix of customers across various sectors. But I think it's likely that will at least have -- at least that level of deferred going forward. 
On the RPOs, I mean, we did some work in the Q, which you'll see later around the RPO disclosure and kind of consolidated a little bit so that you can see the pieces. A lot of the movement is in deferred revenue between the product and the services. The other items didn't move that much kind of quarter-over-quarter. But again, you'll see that and we kind of consolidated some of those disclosures into a single footnote so that you can see it all together. So hopefully, that's easier to kind of to process. 
But the non-balance sheet, if you like, RPO amounts are around the services. Services kind of unbilled amounts, right, as opposed to kind of build product or anything like that, which is in the deferred revenue."

But they generally sweat their assets for 3 to 5 years, and then they're looking for consolidation, and they're looking for upgrades to 100-gig, 400-gig.

It was more tied to needing a cloud-first strategy and figuring out which of their workloads go to the cloud and which one they invest in their premise. And so I would say it's more tied to that than anything specific to last year. So bringing cloud principles into their data centers is probably the #1 motivator."

No, it's a good question. I was surprised campus hadn't come up so far. So so I think what happened last year in COVID is everybody just CROS, and there was a period of time, nobody even knew how to deal with making decisions, right? Towards the second half of the year, we started seeing them engage in make decision-making and this year, many of them, especially from a campus perspective, are looking at it much more as hybrid workspaces. Arista is doing the same. 
We don't see a full return to work of all our employees until it's safe to do so. But when it is safe to do so, we don't see a 100% return either. Some of them will work here, especially Anshul and John McCool team that's very hardware intensive. But for example, Ken Duda software team is very happy working in the different geographical locations remotely and may or may not come into work every day of the week. 
So we see the campus changing for a variety of reasons. It's moving from very distinct headquarters and regions and branches to a more fluid elastic set of workspaces, where you have to provide wired, Wi-Fi and equal access to multiple geographies. Whether you're at home or whether you're at work or whether you're in transit, you still have to do work. And that is influencing our campus decisions. Our enterprises are clearly very constructive on coming back to headquarters, but they're also very constructive on offering ubiquitous campus connectivity to their remote employees as well. 
As an example, in the retail space, even though we're not an FD brand, we are seeing a lot of activity and distribution centers, which are more regional and connected to these retail spaces. So Arista is doing well in the campus. We're obviously operating off small numbers. And most of our well is in the high end enterprises. So that's where I think we're having success, and we're marching to our targets. 
Where we are not doing well or maybe not have been focused, is, as I said, the SMB, which is more a distributed enterprise, a more channel driven enterprise. We've got a lot of work to do there, and that hasn't been our area of focus, frankly. So doing well in our target campus and not doing much at all in our non-targets is what I'd say."

The white boxes are largely limited to the very large cloud titans in the United States or some in Asia, and it really hasn't changed beyond that. 
You may want to go back to all of the supply chain discussions we had. And just as an FYI, it applies equally to the white boxes as well. And in fact, many of the cloud companies are struggling through that because not every ODM and soon is going to carry so much inventory and have large commitments. So there's actually some shifting there. 
But leaving that aside, on our previous discussion on some of the larger cloud companies looking at going branded, we are doing well in our engineering projects in those opportunities.

Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope you're all being safe and vaccinated in these pandemic times. At Arista, we're especially deeply concerned by the heightened COVID crisi",972,"Thank you, Curtis. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope you're all being safe and vaccinated in these pandemic times. At Arista, we're especially deeply concerned by the heightened COVID crisis in India. We're taking steps to assist our local teams as best we can and know. 
Back to Q1 2021 specifics. We delivered revenues of $667.6 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.50. A-Care services, EOS renewals and subscription software contributed approximately 21.4% of the revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins at 64.7% was influenced by software and services mix as well as higher enterprise and cloud tightened contributions for the quarter. 
We continue to experience good customer traction and growth with new customer logos and increasing million-dollar customers in the enterprises. In the quarter, Cloud Titans was our largest vertical, enterprise was a close second, followed by financials and specialty cloud providers tied at third place and service providers at fourth place. International contribution is 25%, and the Americas were at 75% in the quarter. 
In terms of sector and product trends, we will report the specifics annually. They are consistent with the ranges we have already provided in our Investor Relations deck. To reiterate, our Cloud Titans are in the 35% to 39% range, the enterprises are in the 35% to 39% range also, and the providers in the 25% to 30% range. 
Our product line forecast annually is expected to be 60% to 65% for core data center, 10% to 15% for adjacent campus and routing and 20% to 25% for software and services. In light of the industry-wide chip and supply chain shortages, I'd like to shed more light on this topic, especially as it pertains to Arista. 
First and foremost, we are pleased with the healthy demand we are experiencing, and Arista is resonating well with customers and prospects as they are driving our multiyear growth projections. We share a preferred status with many of our top 100 and more customers and work intimately with them. However, the supply chain has never been so constrained in Arista history. 
To put this in perspective, we now have to plan for many components with 52-week lead times. COVID has resulted in substrate and wafer shortages and reduced assembly capacity. Our contract manufacturers have experienced significant volatility due to country-specific COVID orders. Naturally, we're working more closely with our strategic suppliers to improve planning and delivery. 
Customer demand and visibility, though, has improved in the past few months. We are working with our customers to understand the timing of their deployment needs. We do not believe at this time that our customers are pre-ordering. However, we do think they're exercising prudent planning for second half of 2021 and even into 2022. 
With this as a backdrop, we believe supply chain will remain a pain point for the balance of this year as a result of all these shortages. Therefore, Arista is taking decisive steps to invest in increased inventory and manufacturing capacity. 
I now announce why customers, especially risk-averse enterprises, choose Arista. Arista's recent enterprise momentum spans many vertical markets and includes a suite of data center, campus, routing and software products. Our customers are aligned with our software-driven, data-centric approach to building their cloud architecture, their cloud operations and their cloud experience. 
A key part of our enterprise traction is addressing the CIO's pain points to build a cloud-first and a data-driven network, spanning client to cloud networking. Historically, disparate functions and data sets into routers, security, switches and network management functions can now be integrated by Arista into a seamless network architecture with programmability, state and AI-driven characteristics. 
Let me try to illustrate a few enterprise examples to highlight this. A recent data center customer win was in the hospitality sector. They chose us because of our single EOS software image across multiple leased and spine platforms. Using CloudVision for automation, for 0 touch provisioning, easy upgrades, telemetry and compliance was only feasible because of Arista. Arista's deep buffer spine switches also enhanced their availability. 
A second example is in the international retail customer for data center and routing applications. A million-dollar customer. This was based on EVPN and VXLAN modern deep fine design and once again leveraged CloudVision and EOS for improved automation, programmability and change control. NetOps and DevOps automation with Ansible integration was another key deliverable for their distribution center. 
Our third enterprise win was in campus in Europe. The 720XP is differentiated as a POE platform with multi-gig capability across campus workspaces for both chassis and 1RU form factors. The 7050CX spine and spline brought lower power, low footprint and high-density as an alternative to the chassis. 
The campus customer also implemented unified wired and Wi-Fi cognitive capabilities, and this played a key role. Migrating from manual operations, once again, CloudVision with streaming telemetry was a key factor. 
In all these 3 examples, there were some common themes. The customer was very fatigued with legacy issues and embraced our U.S. software and our CloudVision as key differentiators and advantages. They also have much confidence in Arista's support, quality and continued innovation. They embrace our strategy and built upon our differentiated state-driven and programmable software foundation to deliver our cognitive 5As of agility, availability, analytics automation and AI and API-driven architecture. 
Switching to our popular Cloud Titans, we are pleased to also state that we now see increased visibility across 10-gig -- sorry, 100-gig, 200-gig and 400-gig demand from our Cloud Titan customers. While this business can be volatile, we have enjoyed a preferred partnership status with many of them deploying us in diverse use cases and deployments, consistent with the overall CapEx reported recently. 
I'd like to invite Anshul, our Chief Operating Officer, to elaborate more on this. Anshul?"

This analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full rec",963,"Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in Q1 were $667.6 million, up 27.6% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $630 million to $650 million. Shipments remained somewhat constrained in the period as we continued to carefully navigate industry-wide supply chain constraints and COVID-related disruptions. 
Services and subscription software contributed approximately 21.4% of revenue in the first quarter. International revenues for the quarter came in at $165.7 million or 25% of total revenue, down slightly from 26% in the fourth quarter. This shift in geographical mix was largely due to the location of deployments by our larger Cloud Titan and specialty cloud customers. 
Overall gross margin in Q1 was 64.7%, above the midpoint of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65%, reflecting a balanced customer mix for the quarter. 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $180.9 million or 27.1% of revenue, up from last quarter at $178.1 million. R&D spending came in at $110 million or 16.5% of revenue, consistent with last quarter at $110.2 million. This reflected increased employee-related costs, offset by lower new product introduction spending in the period. 
Sales and marketing expense was $59.5 million or 8.9% of revenue, up from $54.9 million last quarter, with increased variable compensation and other headcount-related charges. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. 
Our G&A costs came in at $11.4 million or 1.7% of revenue, down from last quarter at approximately $13 million, reflecting normal fourth quarter compliance-related activities. 
Our operating income for the quarter was $251.3 million or 37.6% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.6 million. And our effective tax rate was approximately 21.4%. Other income and expense included $2 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amounts. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $198.8 million or 29.8% of revenue. 
Our diluted share number was 79.6 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.50, up approximately 23.8% from the prior year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the year at approximately $3 billion. We repurchased $101 million of our common stock during the first quarter at an average price of $276 per share. As a reminder, we've now repurchased $763 million or 3.6 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years, commencing in Q2 '19. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate. 
Turning to operational cash performance for the first quarter. We generated $254.7 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments in inventory and supply chain. 
DSOs came in at 51 days, down from 55 days in Q4, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.8x, consistent with last quarter. Inventory increased to $483.2 million in the quarter, up from $480 million in the prior period as we continue to buffer certain components and products. 
Our total deferred revenue balance was $720 million, up from $651 million in Q4, approximately $40 million of this increase related to product deferred revenue with acceptance causes for new products across various customers and sectors. The remainder of the increase in deferred revenue related to service renewal activity and is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. 
Looking forward, we expect 2021 to be a year of significant new product introductions, combined with a healthy new customer acquisition rate and expanded use cases with existing customers. These trends, in conjunction with reduced levels upfront in-person testing, may result in increased customer-specific acceptance clauses and increased volatility and our product deferred revenue amounts. 
Accounts payable days were 52 days, down from 54 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.1 million. 
Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. We saw healthy demand across all of our market segments in the first quarter. These demand trends, combined with favorable year-over-year comparatives, continue to support an improving top line growth rate for the year. That said, we still expect some deceleration in quarterly year-over-year growth rates as we move through the year, given the top line recovery experienced in the second half of 2020. 
On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver. 
Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to growing our investments in R&D to support innovation across the business and sales and marketing to support our go-to-market expansion. 
Finally, our outlook discussed above and our guidance for Q2 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business and supply chain. This is, however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate any challenges as the situation unfolds. 
With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the second quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items, is as follows: revenues of approximately $675 million to $695 million, gross margin of 63% to 65% and operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9%, with diluted shares of approximately 79.7 million.

It's not instant gratification like we've often had with our cloud providers or even early enterprise decision-makers. So investments, we made 2 years ago, are the fruit to the labor is what we're seeing now. So that's one point. 
The second thing is our product line is more diverse. Before we were only selling data center. And the expansion from client to cloud, including our software products, our Big Switch DMF, our Awake Security, our routing, our campus most importantly, CloudVision, which is the epicenter of all their manual to automation migration, I think, has been a huge advantage because we've really modernized the network. Until then, they were measured -- really, the migration was impossible because it was all in silos, different operating systems. So another big learning is the product line diversity, combined with the relationship we have formed over the last couple of years, I think, has been key. 
And in an odd sort of way, my third point would be COVID itself. COVID has been an equalizer for Arista with dominant enterprise competitors. So it has given our customers a chance to plan and think about alternatives. And I think we've had some advantage and disadvantage with that. The advantages they're more willing to work with at Arista. The disadvantages, they can't physically come and see us and do physical talks, so we've had to move more virtually."

One of the things you might have heard from Ita's statements is all our 5 verticals performed very, very well in Q1. So they were all up. If I had to highlight which ones were up more, I would go by the ratings. I would say both Cloud Titans and Enterprise definitely made the contribution and made their mark. And especially combined with the new logo acquisitions and increase in million-dollar customers, I think those 2 stood out, but all 5 were very good."

Now having said that, as you know, we're not going to take that to the bank. There's still an awful lot of execution on their part and our part to turn that visibility into actual results. They've got to build the data centers. They've got to acquire the compute, the storage, the power, the cooling, you name it, and we got to also execute.

I guess the question really is, when I look at your recent performance, it looks like you're sustaining really good top line growth.

So yes, I would say, once you -- switching was hard too when we first got started because we were a new vendor. But now that we have entered switching with good market share, our approach to selling software and routing is to enhance our switching platforms. So it's not inherently harder, but it does take a different systems engineering and technical expertise. So what we find ourselves doing and Ashwin and Anshul's organization is augmenting our switching expertise with more software and routing. And we have specialists for the Big Switch DANZ Monitoring Fabric. We've specialists for the Awake, network detection and response. We've specialists for routing.  So naturally, we need to build upon that switching foundation and add these layers of cake or icing, if you will. 
In terms of enterprise and service provider challenges, no doubt there's many. We're the new kid in the block. And we are still best-of-breed there, and we're dealing with the incumbency of vendors who've been there easily 10 to 20 to 30 years longer. So I would say our biggest challenge is breaking old habits. And I don't think we have any challenge showing our technical prowess.

First of all, I wanted to make sure you can clarify the improved visibility on the cloud side?  And what I mean by that is whether this improved visibility is just a reflection of the new projects, the design wins that you've talked about that require a little bit more forward planning? Or a reflection of the supply chain issues? Meaning once those are resolved, you should expect visibility to shorten back down again?  
And then on the deeper side of it, going back to the question on SD-WAN before. Jayshree, it seems like you talked a lot about automation and AI and monitoring and things like that. But security and networking are slowly blending on the edges as well. And you haven't talked really much, if at all, about your plan and how you're going to attack the security landscape and SD-WAN, which is a clear networking side. You seem to be leaving that to security vendors, which is a little bit of -- I don't understand why you do that? Why would you do that? 
So maybe you can kind of give us a little bit of your thoughts on the security market, how relevant do you think that would be for the future of the company longer term, perhaps not shorter term? And is partnership the best way to play there? Is there no play that you can have in this market?"

But to answer your specific question on Cloud Titans, definitely, Anshul and the team are very involved with the projects. And yes, those tend to be 1 to 2 quarters. But because of their long-term planning and our supply chain constraints, both go hand-in-hand. They're making some CapEx decisions, and we have some supply constraints. We are getting beyond that 2-quarter visibility to at least a year's visibility.  So I think you're absolutely right in saying it's going beyond the project 1 to 2 quarters to 1 year because of supply constraints and because of their long-term decision. 
On security, we -- I'll give you the short answer and there's a longer discussion. We will continue to partner with best-of-breed security vendors, number one. Our approach to zero trust networking will really be holistic and network centric. And there's really 3 parts to it. One is how do we provide the right network segmentation. We introduced the macro segmentation, how do we provide the right encryption capabilities at the DCI layer. This has been a huge differentiator for us and our data center products. So how do we do the wireless intrusion protection, all of those are network-related security. 
The second area I would largely call visibility of situational analysis. The combination of both the Awake products as well as the real-time telemetry and streaming and Big Switch DANZ Monitoring Fabric really allows us to attack security from a visibility perspective. And the third is the proactive acquisition of Awake itself. We didn't acquire Awake just to be a point security product, we really acquired it, and Anshul and Rahul are working on this, to make it a more seamless network and proactive network detection and response capability that's AI driven. 
So stay tuned, you'll hear more from us on that, but all of this basically is our Zero Trust networking strategy, different from our partnerships with firewall vendors or cloud security vendors."

We just introduced that recently, and you'll be seeing variance of that on different platforms, including the 7050 and 7280 towards the end of this year. So the Big Switch integration is very strategic, not only because of the monitoring capabilities, but because of the switch integration. 
On the Awake side, I'm going to have Anshul talk more about it, but the team has done a fantastic job, first of all, of really focusing in, not just on the CSO, but on the CIO. You really have to target both decision-makers. Anshul, do you want to say more about that?"

On the RPOs, I mean, we did some work in the Q, which you'll see later around the RPO disclosure and kind of consolidated a little bit so that you can see the pieces.

No, it's a good question. I was surprised campus hadn't come up so far. So so I think what happened last year in COVID is everybody just froze, and there was a period of time, nobody even knew how to deal with making decisions, right? Towards the second half of the year, we started seeing them engage in decision-making and this year, many of them, especially from a campus perspective, are looking at it much more as hybrid workspaces. Arista is doing the same. 
We don't see a full return to work of all our employees until it's safe to do so. But when it is safe to do so, we don't see a 100% return either. Some of them will work here, especially Anshul's and John McCool's team that's very hardware intensive. But for example, Ken Duda's software team is very happy working in the different geographical locations remotely and may or may not come into work every day of the week. 
So we see the campus changing for a variety of reasons. It's moving from very distinct headquarters and regions and branches to a more fluid elastic set of workspaces, where you have to provide wired, Wi-Fi and equal access to multiple geographies. Whether you're at home or whether you're at work or whether you're in transit, you still have to do work. And that is influencing our campus decisions. Our enterprises are clearly very constructive on coming back to headquarters, but they're also very constructive on offering ubiquitous campus connectivity to their remote employees as well. 
As an example, in the retail space, even though we're not an SD-WAN, we are seeing a lot of activity and distribution centers, which are more regional and connected to these retail spaces. So Arista is doing well in the campus. We're obviously operating of small numbers. And most of our well is in the high-end enterprises. So that's where I think we're having success, and we're marching to our targets. 
Where we are not doing well or maybe not have been focused, is, as I said, the SMB, which is more a distributed enterprise, a more channel driven enterprise, we've got a lot of work to do there, and that hasn't been our area of focus, frankly. So doing well in our target campus and not doing much at all in our non-targets is what I'd say."

Liz is a long-time Aristan with deep networking expertise and most recently ran our South Central region as the Systems Engineering Manager. Welcome, Liz. 
Back to Q2 2021 specifics. We delivered revenues of $707.3 million for the quarter with a record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.72. AK services and software renewals contributed approximately 22% of revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 65.2% was influenced by enterprise momentum and software and services contribution. We are pleased with the healthy customer traction, including new customer logos and record million-dollar customers in the mainstream enterprise. 
In Q2 2021, while Titans were our largest vertical, the enterprise was a close second, followed by financials and specialty cloud providers tied at third place and service provider at fourth place. International contribution was strong at 27% and with the Americas at 73% for the quarter. We surpassed the cumulative of 50 million cloud networking port shipments this quarter, and we consider this to be a key golden milestone. In light of the industry-wide supply chain shortages and escalating cost of components, rate and expedite logistics, I would like to invite John McCool, our Senior Vice President and Chief Platform Officer, to shed some more light on our manufacturing execution. Welcome, John."

The continued industry-wide impact was closed on global supply chain output, combined with increase in demand for electronics across all segments, is expected to remain for the foreseeable future. Component lead times are the highest we've seen and have roughly doubled from pre-pandemic norms. Most notable are semiconductor lead times, which have extended in the range of 40 to 60 weeks. Factories are operating near full capacity, limiting flexibility for changes in demand. Therefore, we expect extended lead times and escalating product costs due to expedites and elevated component increases in 2021 and 2022. 
To mitigate these headwinds, we've taken a number of steps in Arista manufacturing. First, we improve manufacturing procedures to maximize capacity and material utilization. We are increasing our purchase commitments for 2022 forecast to adjust for increased component lead times. We placed additional emphasis on inventory for our new products to offset supply constraints. Finally, we are working closely with our strategic suppliers to plan for capacity expansion programs. Clearly, we are redoubling our efforts and execution in this challenging macro environment and look forward to supply chain improvements in the second half of 2022 and beyond. Back to you, Jayshree."

We welcome Susan Hays, your newest Vice President of Manufacturing, as a strong addition. We also thank our customers for their patience and understanding during our lead time constraints and will strive to keep doing better as we recover in second half 2022. 
Our enterprise customer momentum has never been stronger. Continuing on our theme of enterprise wins, I would like to share with you 3 examples of strength and success. The first win was in the retail sector for both data center and campus. We began with the data center win with Arista's hallmark EOS for Dan or data analysis switching and routing. We expanded in 2021 with cognitive campus for both power over Ethernet wired switches and our wireless providing a natural expansion into these use cases. Retail markets cannot tolerate downtime with the magnitude of IoT proliferation they have. Arista was able to perform real-time upgrades without downtime across 100-plus stores and warehouses. In the absence of retail remote staff in hand, we drove automation across all these stores with open APIs and CloudVision. 
Our second win was a major U.S. financial for both data center and routing. Arista continues to expand its enterprise routing use cases, not just supporting with data center with Arista EOS features, but also a more software-led simplified automated deployment of core routing in the spine using standard phase routing protocols with VXLAN, EVPN, and Multicast. Our customer was able to rapidly migrate from legacy to Arista within a few months, enabling billions of transactions. 
An international media and entertainment campus win included a customer who wanted an extension of their data center in the campus with simple operating system, easy to scale, common spine deployment using CloudVision. This customer took a build-as-you-go approach for flexibility and visibility. This also included device access for back-to-work applications with our cognitive WiFi. 
In all of these 3 examples, enterprise customers who refer an alternative, and Arista was chosen as the disruptor with superior product capability and a cohesive client-to-cloud strategy to unify silo data sets consistently. Arista's innovation, combined with high quality and support, is becoming the gold standard for customers to build cognitive cloud networking. 
According to industry experts, Arista continues to gain switching market share across large enterprises and providers. We are proud to be the #1 market leader in 100-gigabit Ethernet ports for the fifth consecutive year. We see 2021 as the first year of inflection for higher speeds ranging from 100 to 200 to 400 gigabit after 18 months of trials. We have now shipped more than 2.5 million ports of high-performance ports in the first half of 2021, according to analysts, placing us also at #1 leadership in the combined 100-gig, 200-gig and 400-gigabit Ethernet high-performance cloud switching. 
In summary, Arista is well positioned for the next phase of our growth in cloud and data-driven networking. We do this with proactive platforms, predictive operations and a prescriptive experience. And we believe we are poised to achieve increasing market share with greater business diversification. And while the path forward is paved with supply chain obstacles, volatile customer demand and your normal typical competitive tactics, I believe Arista, which means to be great in Greek, will live up to its name and with our A game, our A customers and our team. 
With this, I'll pass it over to Ita, our Chief Financial Officer, for financial specifics."

This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 is based on non-GAAP and excludes our noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconcil",1088,"Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 is based on non-GAAP and excludes our noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in Q2 were $707.3 million, up 30.8% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $675 million to $695 million. Shipments remained somewhat constrained in the period as we continue to carefully navigate industry-wide supply chain shortages and COVID-related disruptions. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 22.3% of revenue in the second quarter, up from 21.4% in Q1. 
International revenues for the quarter came in at $193.2 million or 27% of revenue, up from 25% in the first quarter. This shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter basis reflected strong international deployments by our cloud titan and specialty cloud customers, combined with healthy performance from our in-region businesses. 
Overall gross margin in Q2 was 65.2%, above the upper end of our guidance range of approximately 63% to 65%. While we recognize some incremental supply chain costs in the period, these were more than offset by a healthy mix of enterprise and software revenue for the quarter. 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $189.8 million or 26.8% of revenue, up from last quarter at $180.9 million. R&D spending came in at $119.6 million or 16.9% of revenue, up from last quarter at $110 million. This reflected increased employee-related costs and higher new product introduction spending in the period. 
Sales and marketing expense was $67.9 million or 8.2% of revenue, down from $59.5 million last quarter with lower demo related expenses in the period. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. 
Our G&A costs came in at $12.3 million or 1.7% of revenue, consistent with last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $271.7 million or 38.4% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.7 million. And our effective tax rate was approximately 20.7%, reflecting an improved geographical mix. Other income and expenses for the quarter included approximately $2 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amounts. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $216.8 million or 30.6% of revenue. 
Our diluted share number was 79.71 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.72, up approximately 29% from the prior year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $3.3 billion. We did not repurchase shares of our common stock during the second quarter. As a recap, we have now repurchased $763 million or 3.6 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years, commencing in Q2 '19. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate. 
Turning to operational cash performance for the second quarter. We generated $263 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments in inventory and supply chain. DSOs came in at 47 days, down from 51 days in Q1, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.7x, down slightly from last quarter at 1.8. Inventory increased to $543.2 million in the quarter, up from $483.2 million in the prior period as we continue to buffer certain components of products. 
Our total deferred revenue balance was $746 million, up from $720 million in Q1. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Approximately $90 million of the balance, up from $70 million last quarter, represents product deferred revenue, largely related to acceptance clauses for new products across various customers and sectors. 
As a reminder, we expect 2021 to be a year of significant new product introductions, combined with a healthy new customer acquisition rate and expanded use cases with existing customers. These trends, in conjunction with reduced levels of upfront price and testing, may result in increased customer-specific acceptance clauses and increased volatility in our product deferred revenue amount. 
Accounts payable days were 53.7 days, up from 52.3 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of inventory receipt payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.5 million. 
Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter and beyond. We reported strong year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 29% for the first half of 2021, reflecting healthy demand across all our market sectors, combined with favorable comparisons from the first half of 2020. While we expect continued strength in demand as we move through the second half, we will likely see some deceleration in year-over-year revenue growth given the top line recovery experienced in the back half of 2020. 
Turning to gross margin. Industry supply constraints continue to pressure component costs. Some of these incremental costs will initially be recorded as inventory and only be recognized in the income statement when the products are sold in future periods. With this as context, we will continue to reiterate our gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver of volatility on a quarter-by-quarter basis. 
Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to growing our investments in R&D to support innovation across the business and sales and marketing to support our go-to-market expansion. With regard to cash flow, we expect to fund approximately $40 million of CapEx in the third quarter for the purchase of land to build a data center and engineering location in Santa Clara. We'll provide more details on this project over the coming quarters. 
Finally, our outlook discussed above and our guidance for Q3 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact to our business and supply chain. This remains an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. 
With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the third quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items, is as follows. Revenues of approximately $725 million to $745 million; gross margin of 63% to 65%; operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5% with diluted shares of approximately 80 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles?"

We are -- the mix is healthier, the enterprise mix is helping to offset that. But customer mix is still by far the biggest driver.

Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope you're all being safe and vaccinated in these post pandemic times, especially with the resurgence of the Delta variant. I would also like to take this opportunity to warmly welcome Liz Stine, our new Director of Investor Relations Advocacy, working closely with Charles. 
Liz is a long-time Aristan with deep networking expertise and most recently ran our South Central region as the Systems Engineering Manager. Welcome, Liz. 
Back to Q2 2021 specifics. We delivered revenues of $707.3 million for the quarter with a record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.72. A-Care services and software renewals contributed approximately 22% of revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 65.2% was influenced by enterprise momentum and software and services contribution. We are pleased with the healthy customer traction, including new customer logos and record million-dollar customers in the mainstream enterprise. 
In Q2 2021, while cloud titans were our largest vertical, the enterprise was a close second, followed by financials and specialty cloud providers tied at third place and service provider at fourth place. 
International contribution was strong at 27% and with the Americas at 73% for the quarter. We surpassed the cumulative of 50 million cloud networking port shipments this quarter, and we consider this to be a key golden milestone. In light of the industry-wide supply chain shortages and escalating cost of components, rate and expedite logistics, I would like to invite John McCool, our Senior Vice President and Chief Platform Officer, to shed some more light on our manufacturing execution. Welcome, John."

The continued industry-wide impact of COVID on global supply chain output, combined with increase in demand for electronics across all segments, is expected to remain for the foreseeable future. Component lead times are the highest we've seen and have roughly doubled from pre-pandemic norms. Most notable are semiconductor lead times, which have extended in the range of 40 to 60 weeks. Factories are operating near full capacity, limiting flexibility for changes in demand. Therefore, we expect extended lead times and escalating product costs due to expedites and elevated component increases in 2021 and 2022. 
To mitigate these headwinds, we've taken a number of steps in Arista manufacturing. First, we improve manufacturing procedures to maximize capacity and material utilization. We are increasing our purchase commitments for 2022 forecast to adjust for increased component lead times. We placed additional emphasis on inventory for our new products to offset supply constraints. 
Finally, we are working closely with our strategic suppliers to plan for capacity expansion programs. Clearly, we are redoubling our efforts and execution in this challenging macro environment and look forward to supply chain improvements in the second half of 2022 and beyond. 
Back to you, Jayshree."

We really appreciate the diligence and disciplined work that you and the entire manufacturing team have stepped up to. We welcome Susan Hays, your newest Vice President of Manufacturing, as a strong addition. We also thank our customers for their patience and understanding during our lead time constraints and will strive to keep doing better as we recover in second half 2022. 
Our enterprise customer momentum has never been stronger. Continuing on our theme of enterprise wins, I would like to share with you 3 examples of strength and success. The first win was in the retail sector for both data center and campus. We began with the data center win with Arista's hallmark EOS for DANZ or data analysis switching and routing. 
We expanded in 2021 with Cognitive Campus for both power over Ethernet wired switches and our wireless providing a natural expansion into these use cases. Retail markets cannot tolerate downtimes with the magnitude of IoT proliferation they have. Arista was able to perform real-time upgrades without downtimes across 100-plus stores and warehouses. In the absence of retail remote staff in hand, we drove automation across all these stores with open APIs and CloudVision. 
Our second win was a major U.S financials for both data center and routing. Arista continues to expand its enterprise routing use cases, not just supporting with data center with Arista EOS features, but also a more software-led simplified automated deployment of core routing in the spine using standard phase routing protocols with VXLAN, EVPN, and Multicast. 
Our customer was able to rapidly migrate from legacy to Arista within a few months, enabling billions of transactions. An international media and entertainment campus win included a customer who wanted an extension of their data center in the campus with simple operating system, easy to scale, common spine deployment using CloudVision. This customer took a build-as-you-go approach for flexibility and visibility. This also included device access for back-to-work applications with our cognitive WiFi.
In all of these 3 examples, enterprise customers [ were looking ] for an alternative, and Arista was chosen as the disruptor with superior product capability and a cohesive client-to-cloud strategy to unify silo data sets consistently. Arista's innovation, combined with high quality and support, is becoming the gold standard for customers to build cognitive cloud networking. 
According to industry experts, Arista continues to gain switching market share across large enterprises and providers. We are proud to be the #1 market leader in 100-gigabit Ethernet ports for the fifth consecutive year. We see 2021 as the first year of inflection for higher speeds ranging from 100 to 200 to 400 gigabit after 18 months of trials. We have now shipped more than 2.5 million ports of high-performance ports in the first half of 2021, according to analysts, placing us also at #1 leadership in the combined 100-gig, 200-gig and 400-gigabit Ethernet high-performance cloud switching. 
In summary, Arista is well positioned for the next phase of our growth in cloud and data-driven networking. We do this with proactive platforms, predictive operations and a prescriptive experience. And we believe we are poised to achieve increasing market share with greater business diversification. And while the path forward is paved with supply chain obstacles, volatile customer demand and your normal typical competitive tactics, I believe Arista, which means, ""To be Great"" in Greek, will live up to its name and with our A game, our A customers and our teams. 
With this, I'll pass it over to Ita, our Chief Financial Officer, for financial specifics."

This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 is based on non-GAAP and excludes our noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconcil",1091,"Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 is based on non-GAAP and excludes our noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in Q2 were $707.3 million, up 30.8% year-over-year and well above the upper end of our guidance of $675 million to $695 million. Shipments remained somewhat constrained in the period as we continue to carefully navigate industry-wide supply chain shortages and COVID-related disruptions. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 22.3% of revenue in the second quarter, up from 21.4% in Q1. 
International revenues for the quarter came in at $193.2 million or 27% of revenue, up from 25% in the first quarter. This shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter basis reflected strong international deployments by our cloud titan and specialty cloud customers, combined with healthy performance from our in-region businesses. 
Overall gross margin in Q2 was 65.2%, above the upper end of our guidance range of approximately 63% to 65%. While we recognize some incremental supply chain costs in the period, these were more than offset by a healthy mix of enterprise and software revenues for the quarter. 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $189.8 million or 26.8% of revenue, up from last quarter at $180.9 million. R&D spending came in at $119.6 million or 16.9% of revenue, up from last quarter at $110 million. This reflected increased employee-related costs and higher new product introduction spending in the period. 
Sales and marketing expense was $67.9 million or 8.2% of revenue, down from $59.5 million last quarter with lower demo related expenses in the period. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. 
Our G&A costs came in at $12.3 million or 1.7% of revenue, consistent with last quarter. Our operating income for the quarter was $271.7 million or 38.4% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.7 million. And our effective tax rate was approximately 20.7%, reflecting an improved geographical mix. Other income and expenses for the quarter included approximately $2 million of interest income, offset by some unfavorable FX amounts. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $216.8 million or 30.6% of revenue. 
Our diluted share number was 79.71 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.72, up approximately 29% from the prior year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $3.3 billion. We did not repurchase shares of our common stock during the second quarter. As a recap, we have now repurchased [ $763 million ] or 3.6 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years, commencing in Q2 '19. We will continue to execute opportunistically against the remaining mandate. 
Turning to operational cash performance for the second quarter. We generated $263 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting solid net income performance and continued investments of inventory and supply chain. DSOs came in at 47 days, down from 51 days in Q1, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.7x, down slightly from last quarter at 1.8. Inventory increased to $543.2 million in the quarter, up from $483.2 million in the prior period as we continue to buffer certain components of products. 
Our total deferred revenue balance was $746 million, up from $720 million in Q1. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and is directly linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Approximately $90 million of the balance, up from $70 million last quarter, represents product deferred revenue, largely related to acceptance clauses for new products across various customers and sectors. 
As a reminder, we expect 2021 to be a year of significant new product introductions, combined with a healthy new customer acquisition rate and expanded use cases with existing customers. These trends, in conjunction with reduced levels of upfront [ in-process ] testing, may result in increased customer-specific acceptance clauses and increased volatility in our product deferred revenue amount. 
Accounts payable days were 53.7 days, up from 52.3 days in Q1, reflecting the timing of inventory receipt payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.5 million. 
Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter and beyond. We reported strong year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 29% for the first half of 2021, reflecting healthy demand across all our market sectors, combined with favorable comparisons from the first half of 2020. While we expect continued strength in demand as we move through the second half, we will likely see some deceleration in year-over-year revenue growth given the top line recovery experienced in the back half of 2020. 
Turning to gross margin. Industry supply constraints continue to pressure component costs. Some of these incremental costs will initially be recorded as inventory and only be recognized in the income statement when the products are sold in future periods. With this as context, we will continue to reiterate our gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver of volatility on a quarter-by-quarter basis. 
Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to growing our investments in R&D to support innovation across the business and sales and marketing to support our go-to-market expansion. With regard to cash flow, we expect to fund approximately $40 million of CapEx in the third quarter for the purchase of land to build a data center and engineering location in Santa Clara. We'll provide more details on this project over the coming quarters. 
Finally, our outlook discussed above and our guidance for Q3 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact to our business and supply chain. This remains an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. 
With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the third quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items, is as follows. Revenues of approximately $725 million to $745 million; gross margin of 63% to 65%; operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5% with diluted shares of approximately 80 million shares. 
I will now turn the call back to Charles. Charles?"

Anshul, think about the Acacia one while I discuss the delta and pricing. It's difficult for us to parse our competitors pricing. But I can tell you, philosophically, we got backlog, we've got products in flight and we've got customers who are making their budget plan. So we're going to try as much as we can in the short term to absorb the cost. 
That said, we will have some slight price increases probably in the range of 5% on selective models that will affect our customer base in the tail end of this year and next year. And it will still affect our gross margins if the  mix changes dramatically to cloud titans as Ita has alluded to. So all this to say, Alex, we're going to be very thoughtful because it's pain for us, and we're going to try and mitigate the pain for customers and only apply it where there's a real shortage and a real significant cost increase. And Anshul, you want to take the Acacia question."

Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. Today's call will be followed by our Virtual Analyst Day at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. We del",910,"Thank you, Liz, and welcome to your first earnings experience. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. Today's call will be followed by our Virtual Analyst Day at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. We delivered record revenues of $748.7 million for the quarter, with record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.96. Air Care services and software renewals contributed approximately 21.5%. 
Our non-GAAP gross margins at 64.9% was influenced by enterprise and cloud titan momentum. We remain pleased with our healthy customer growth, including record million dollar customers and new customer logos in our mainstream enterprise. In Q3 2021, cloud titans was once again our top vertical, with enterprise being a close second, followed by financials and specialty cloud providers third and service providers at fourth place. 
All verticals contributed to Arista's diversity and growth. International contribution was strong at 25% with the Americas at 75% for the quarter. No earnings call of these days is complete without supply chain commentary. We are clearly in the midst of an acute supply chain crisis with increased prices and long lead times. We are changing our Arista mindset from our historical build to forecast and orders to build to invest doubling our purchase commitments in excess of $2 billion and planning for the next 1 to 2 years. 
Lead times of many components have extended to 50 to 80 weeks with price hikes ranging from 15% to as high as 200% across our entire supply chain of copper, steel, substrate, printed circuit board, memory, silicon ICs, connectors, freight and labor. Arista has been deliberate and thoughtful about price increases so far, as we shared with you but we have recently announced increased list prices effective November 4, 2021, averaging about an approximately 10% to offset the very high escalating costs. 
Customer demand remains strong for Arista products as we're gaining market share in 100- 200- and 400-gig high-performance switching according to market analysts. We truly appreciate our customers and partners for their patience and understanding as we navigate these turbulent times throughout 2022 as well. Recently, we have witnessed the progress of our routing products with key customers and the acceptance of our routing edge use cases. 
Similar to cloud titans, carriers and large enterprise customers are deriving immense benefit from Arista's EOS and rich routing features. We deliver simplification and unified service delivery with the support of segment routing with traffic engineering and EVPN as well as rapid failover techniques. This provides that ideal alternative to today's complex legacy router deployments with much more improved total cost of ownership and CapEx benefits. 
Since its founding, Arista has pioneered the transformation from router to routing with our lease Spine, R series platform. Arista's third-generation R3 series based on EOS-4.26 delivers 3 new edge use cases this year. The first one is a multi-cloud edge that brings provisioning and programmatic traffic steering. The second is a metro edge for single protocol adoption across multiple edge VPN services into the Metro Ethernet fabric. And the final use case is a 5G RAN edge with the 5G edge disaggregating the radio area network with scale-out routing. 
Continuing our theme of big bet wins, I would like to highlight worldwide examples of our strength with specific customer names in routing and campus adjacencies. The first customer was CD LAN and international service provider in Italy that adopted Arista for their routing transformation. Arista solution led them to take a fresh approach to routing for next-generation edge and backbone, reducing the complexity of protocols. This delivered L2 and L3 services with EVPN on a segment routed backbone, along with modern operations and superior services and experience. 
The second customer was Connecticut Education Network, who standardized on Arista's R-Series with Arista EOS being instrumental in their transformation of the MPLS VPN Edge providing 100-gig density in with rough scale, stability and menaability. The advantages in the relationship with CEN across service and engineering affirm their decision to choose us at Arista. 
Peering between ISPs using 100-gig and MPLS PEs to replace their large legacy routers. The third customer is Zenlayer, an international customer in Asia Pacific, who is delighted to partner with Arista and build our next-generation cloud edge and routed backbone for the infrastructure growth. Arista's rich routing stack brought programmatic traffic engineering at the core of the segment routing without sacrificing quality performance and reliability. 
And finally, in the campus, we continue to make progress towards our goal of doubling to $200 million in the cognitive campus in 2021. An example of this is an international customer win in Australia, the Australian Securities Exchange, providing cognitive campus for its corporate sites in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. The new campus network is based on Arista's wired platform to 720 XP Series, and it's built on a multiyear relationship we have built between Arista and ASX utilizing EOS and CloudVision for real-time insights across all devices in trading and nontrading environments. 
In summary, Arista's customers strongly endorse our client-to-cloud strategy to unify silo data sets consistently. We believe we are well positioned for the next phase of growth in data-driven cloud networking with proactive platforms, predictive operations and a prescriptive experience. We look forward to sharing more of this and our vision and our goals with you at our Analyst Day later this afternoon. 
I will pass it over now to Ita Brennan, our Chief Financial Officer, for financial specifics. Ita?"

A full",1129,"Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 of 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q3 were $748.7 million, up 23.7% year-over-year and above the upper end of our guidance of $725 million to $745 million. .
Shipments remained constrained in the period as we continued to carefully navigate industry-wide supply chain shortages and COVID-related disruptions. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 21.5% of revenue in the third quarter, down from 22.3% in Q2. International revenues for the quarter came in at $191 million or 25% of total revenue, down from 27% in the second quarter. 
The shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter basis reflect a continued healthy performance from our cloud titan and in regional businesses in EMEA with some volatility in our APAC business. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 64.9% at the upper end of our guidance range of approximately 63% to 65%. We continue to recognize some incremental supply chain costs in the period, and these were offset by a healthy mix of revenue from our enterprise customers in the quarter. 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $192.4 million or 25.7% of revenue, up from last quarter at $189.8 million. R&D spending commented at $125 million or 16.7% of revenue, up from last quarter at $119.6 million. This reflected increased headcount and employee-related costs and higher new product introduction spending in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $55.8 million or 7.4% of revenue, down from $57.9 million last quarter with lower demo and other variable expenses in the period. 
As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. Our G&A costs came in at $11.6 million or 1.5% of revenue, down slightly from last quarter, but in line with normal quarterly seasonality. Our operating income for the quarter was $293.7 million or 39.2% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.3 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.7%. 
This resulted in net income for the quarter of $236.9 million or 31.6% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.9 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.96, up approximately 22.5% from the prior year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $3.4 billion. We repurchased $134 million of our common stock during the third quarter at an average price of $357 per share. As a recap, at the end of Q3 2021, we had repurchased $897 million or 3.9 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years beginning in April 2019. 
In October 2021, Arista's Board of Directors increased the authorization by adding an additional $1 billion to the repurchase amount. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, business requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. 
Now turning to the operating cash performance for the third quarter. We generated $273 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting strong net income performance and continued investments in inventory and supply chain. DSOs came in at 49 days, up slightly from 47 in Q2, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.7x, consistent with last quarter. Inventory increased to $575.7 million in the quarter, up from $543.2 million in the prior period as we continued to buffer certain components and products. 
Our purchase commitments number for the quarter increased to $2.1 billion, up from $1.1 billion in Q2. This reflects a combination of increased lead times for many components and improved demand visibility. We continue to prioritize newer early life cycle products for inclusion in this strategy to help mitigate the risk of obsolescence. Our total deferred revenue balance was $800 million, up from $746 million in Q2. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Approximately $113 million of the balance, up from $90 million last quarter represents product deferred revenue largely related to acceptance clauses for new products, most recently with our larger cloud titan customers. 
As a reminder, we are currently in a period of significant new product introductions, combined with a healthy new customer acquisition rate and expanded use cases with existing customers. These trends in conjunction with reduced levels of upfront in person testing have resulted in increased customer-specific acceptance clauses and higher product deferred revenue amounts. Accounts payable days were 47 days, down from 54 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $45.9 million, including approximately $40 million of CapEx related to the purchase of land to construct a new data center and hardware engineering building in Santa Clara. We'll provide more details on this project over coming quarters. 
Now turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter and beyond. As outlined in our guidance, we now expect to achieve year-over-year revenue growth for the full year 2021 of approximately 25%. This reflects continued healthy demand across all market sectors, tempered by the impact of the difficult supply environment. On the gross margin front, industry supply constraints and elevated logistics costs continue to pressure gross margins, with customer price increases as a potential offset. 
Based on our current outlook, we continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver of volatility on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to growing our investments in R&D to support innovation across the business and sales and marketing to support our go-to-market expansion. 
Finally, we also announced today that Arista's Board of Directors has approved a 4-for-1 stock split. Each Arista shareholder of record at the close of business on November 11, 2021, will receive 3 additional shares for every share held and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on November 18, 2021. We though this as a backdrop, our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows: revenues of approximately $775 million to $795 million; gross margins of 63% to 65%; operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20.5% with diluted shares on a pre-split basis of approximately 80 million shares.

But just generally, if you can talk to how broad-based is the demand that you're seeing across cloud, and then what is the kind of magnitude of demand that you're seeing from enterprise customers? And how do you think about sustainability of that level of demand, which you're seeing this year? How do we think about sustainability of that into next year?"

It's a proud moment and I really congratulate my entire leadership team and my employees for getting us here. I think demand is very strong, as I mentioned in my earlier script, across all 5 verticals across all 3 product lines and across all 3 sectors as well. So I would not -- I would tell you, we are growing in that what Ita highlighted as our 25% annual growth, every sector is growing. .
And so that's, in some ways, I feel bad that I even have to rank and rate them. But if you ask me to highlight some of the growth vectors, I would say, obviously, cloud titans are back. We had a rough fell. If you remember, 2 years ago, Halloween was not a treat. It was a trick. And it's just come back and it is a volatile sector, and it's positively volatile right now. So we're enjoying the growth of cloud titans. 
We're also enjoying many pieces of our enterprise market growing. And there are really some verticals there that are doing very, very well, not just the financials, but different parts of the enterprise. I think it's fair to say Arista has arrived in the enterprise. We've been growing double digits for a couple of years, and we expect to continue to see double-digit growth in the enterprise sector. And this is by far our largest momentum of all the verticals, I would say. 
But not -- as I mentioned, a lot of routing use cases, these in use cases are not only in the cloud titans, but are obviously also in service providers and enterprises as well. So we're just enjoying a very diversified momentum of our business at the moment."

And we're no more like we said, building to forecast orders but really building to a future demand. So visibility becomes very important in that case because it's no more 1 or 2 quarters. The cloud tightness visibility has improved a lot this year. .
Typically, it used to be 1 to 2 quarters. Right now, it's more like a year or more. So this is the best visibility we've ever had with the cloud titan that's allowing us to build the inventory and to build a plan and to get ahead, if you will. In the enterprise as well, nobody's lead times are very good right now, and we're no different. Although we thought and we believe we have a head start by starting on this problem as early as last year. We have hundreds of suppliers, and we've had to increase our strategic interface with these suppliers to -- and make, again, bets on them long term. 
So visibility in the enterprise is also 6 months to a year, visibility in the cloud and specialty cloud providers is now exceeding a year. So in general, we're now able to make a plan to buy components well ahead of the purchase orders and forecast. Ita, do you want to add something more?"

I think we are -- as Jayshree mentioned, we are in the process of instituting some price increases, et cetera, to help offset some of those costs. So that will help. 
I think we're comfortable thinking about that 63% to 65% range is still being reasonable. But you will see some more volatility quarter-by-quarter just as the mix of the business. The customer mix is still going to be the biggest driver. The other costs we're managing with some of the price increases, et cetera.

If you -- let me just step back, Jim, and thank you for the kind wishes. The traditional model for everybody has been built to forecast, Lead times are based on supplier commits. There's some buffers, but most of it is just in time, right? And very rarely does anybody pay for expedite. 
If you look at supply chain in 2022, first of all, expedites our way of life. It doesn't matter which vendor it is. You have to plan not just weeks ahead, but months ahead. Often, you can get decommits from suppliers. There's shortages across the board. There's lots of orders with no buffers. Everybody is coming at them sometimes and we used to think the high-tech industry is special. But some of the components we're talking about, we compete with the automotive industry and the consumer industry, which makes it tougher. 
And it isn't surprising at all to see expedites involve not just CEOs, but heads of countries literally. That's how tough it is. So it's a very oversubscribed process. We thought we got a head start by starting when was it either late last year when Anshul and the team put together a plan. So we've definitely had a head start. And if things have gotten better, we would be well ahead of everyone. But these things keep getting worse. 
So now the head start is good, but we have to add to that head start and hence, the doubling of the inventory. And without naming any vendor, I'll just say we've increased the strategic nature of our relationship with not just 1 or 2 vendors, but 25% of our vendors. So this is a much larger relationship pool, and we're committing to them long term. They're committing to us, but both of us have to be patient and understanding of the short-term troubles we have.

So the completeness and the innovative nature of our portfolio itself. The second thing that's helped is our Power of One, if you will, on OS, one image, one cloud vision. Customers just love the -- not just the innovation, but the quality and support. I'm not having to buy silo boxes, but having an innovative and much better operator experience with a much lower TCO. And finally, at the enterprise customers is that we have now much as we talk about products, we have invested in customers. Our investment in sales led by Chris Schmidt and Ashwin Kohli and the entire team worldwide really began in 2017.

It's offsetting some of the cost impacts as well. And we've been deferring some of the -- as Paul was talking about, some of the larger customer revenue as well. 
So I think as you look forward kind of outside of these quarters, when the mix of the business comes back to something more balanced, I think you will see back towards the bottom end of that range from time to time. I think we believe we'll stay in the range over a long period of time, but there will be quarters where we could be pressuring the bottom end of that range and maybe even break the bottom end of that range. 
While for, say, for 4 quarters, I think we can still be okay. So there is definitely customer element to this. There's a cost increase element to this, and we will benefit from some customer price increases here that will help offset some of that. But I think the days of living at upper end of that range. I wouldn't assume that we can do that on an ongoing basis as you look forward."

But you noted that you have a little bit more than a year visibility. I mean how should we think about 2023? I know we don't even have '22 guidance yet, but given the strength and the expansion and the availability and the data center trajectory, how do we think about that? And then just as a follow-up on pricing, when you think about the 10% price hike that you're going to implement in a couple of weeks, in your mind, is that sort of more than offset the supply chain?

I would say this year with all the supply chain issues, much more of our share gains is coming from enterprise and cloud titans. Just getting our fair share from our peers in the industry, not necessarily white box. If you fast forward to later years, I do think Arista will have an advantage, not just in product capability, but also in the ability to rapidly supply product probably better than some of the white boxes. And Anshul has often alluded to this. So the make versus buy decision for many of our cloud titans may shift in the direction of Arista rather than strictly white boxes. 
We look forward to that. I'm not going to make any guesses on that, but I don't preclude that Anita has Anshul when he's spoken in the past. So it certainly wasn't part of the market share gains and the growth this year, but it could be next year."

So both within the data center and outside Arista is getting its fair share of opportunity to respond. And we're doing a lot of proof of concepts and testing work with them. Regarding the cloud titan CapEx spend, we're always surprised when the numbers actually come out because they're in billions. And of course, they're nowhere close to the percentage they spend with us necessarily. But our relationship with Facebook dates back now at least 4, 5 years.

On the cloud titan, you're going to see a much more rapid inflection to 200-gig and 400-gig, especially in the spine layers and the uplinks at the top of rack. And they've always been an early and fast adopter of speeds and technology, especially within the data center or even data center to data center. So we are expecting an inflection of 200- and 400-gig. 
That basically has started this year was very challenged with the ecosystem and availability of optics and even switches the last year. The year of inspection, in my view, is really late this year and goes well into 2022. On the enterprise tool, we expect to have by the end of this year, 300 customers of 200 and 400-gig, anal 400-gig, I would say. And as you know, our customer base is more than 7,000. So obviously, 100-gig and 400-gig will continue to coexist and live happily ever after together. But we will start to see the uptick and adoption of 400-gig in the high end and early adopters of enterprise as well, like we're starting to see this year. 
So I think the next few years can be best characterized as inflection of new higher speeds like 200 and 400 and the continuation and adoption of 100-gig in the mainstream enterprise."

It's not because of the life cycle of the products and stuff, it's not -- It's not really an obsolescence risk, right? But it could take some time to burn through that inventory if things change.

Today's call will be followed by our Virtual Analyst Day at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. We delivered record revenues of $748.7 million for the quarter, with record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.96. A-Care services and software renewals contributed approximately 21.5%.  
Our non-GAAP gross margins at 64.9% was influenced by enterprise and cloud titan momentum. We remain pleased with our healthy customer growth, including record million-dollar customers and new customer logos in our mainstream enterprise. 
In Q3 2021, cloud titans was once again our top vertical, with enterprise being a close second, followed by financials and specialty cloud providers tied at third and service providers at fourth place. All verticals contributed to Arista's diversity and growth. International contribution was strong at 25% with the Americas at 75% for the quarter. 
No earnings call these days is complete without supply chain commentary. We are clearly in the midst of an acute supply chain crisis with increased prices and long lead times. We are changing our Arista mindset from our historical build to forecast and orders to build to invest, doubling our purchase commitments in excess of $2 billion and planning for the next 1 to 2 years.  
Lead times of many components have extended to 50 to 80 weeks with price hikes ranging from 15% to as high as 200% across our entire supply chain of copper, steel, substrate, printed circuit board, memory, silicon, ICs, connectors, freight and labor. Arista has been deliberate and thoughtful about price increases so far, as we shared with you but we have recently announced increased list prices effective November 4, 2021, averaging about an approximately 10% to offset the very high escalating costs.  
Customer demand remains strong for Arista products as we're gaining market share in 100- 200- and 400-gig high-performance switching according to market analysts. We truly appreciate our customers and partners for their patience and understanding as we navigate these turbulent times throughout 2022 as well. 
Recently, we have witnessed the progress of our routing products with key customers and the acceptance of our routing edge use cases. Similar to cloud titan, carriers and large enterprise customers are deriving immense benefit from Arista's EOS and rich routing features. We deliver simplification and unified service delivery with the support of segment routing with traffic engineering and EVPN as well as rapid failover techniques. This provides that ideal alternative to today's complex legacy router deployments with much more improved total cost of ownership and CapEx benefits.  
Since its founding, Arista has pioneered the transformation from router to routing with our leaf/spine, R-Series platforms. Arista's third-generation R3 series based on EOS 4.26 delivers 3 new edge use cases this year. The first one is a multi-cloud edge that brings provisioning and programmatic traffic steering. The second is a metro edge for single protocol adoption across multiple edge VPN services into the metro ethernet fabric. And the final use case is a 5G RAN edge with the 5G edge disaggregating the radio area network with scale-out routing.  
Continuing our theme of big bet wins, I would like to highlight worldwide examples of our strength with specific customer names in routing and campus adjacencies. The first customer was CDLAN, an international service provider in Italy that adopted Arista for their routing transformation. Arista solution led them to take a fresh approach to routing for next-generation edge and backbone, reducing the complexity of protocols. This delivered L2 and L3 services with EVPN on a segment routed backbone, along with modern operations and superior services and experience.  
The second customer was Connecticut Education Network, who standardized on Arista's R-Series with Arista EOS being instrumental in their transformation of the MPLS VPN edge providing 100-gig density in with rough scale, stability and manageability. The advantages and the relationship with CEN across service and engineering affirm their decision to choose us at Arista.  
Peering between ISPs using 100-gig and MPLS PEs to replace their large legacy routers. The third customer was Zenlayer, an international customer in Asia Pacific, who is delighted to partner with Arista and build their next-generation cloud edge and routed backbone for the infrastructure growth. Arista's rich routing stack brought programmatic traffic engineering at the core of the segment routing without sacrificing quality, performance and reliability.  
And finally, in the campus, we continue to make progress towards our goal of doubling to $200 million in the cognitive campus in 2021. An example of this is an international customer win in Australia, the Australian Securities Exchange, providing cognitive campus for its corporate sites in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. The new campus network is based on Arista's wired platform the 720XP Series, and it's built on a multiyear relationship we have built between Arista and ASX utilizing EOS and CloudVision for real-time insights across all devices in trading and nontrading environments.  
In summary, Arista's customers strongly endorse our client-to-cloud strategy to unify silo data sets consistently. We believe we are well positioned for the next phase of growth in data-driven cloud networking with proactive platforms, predictive operations and a prescriptive experience. We look forward to sharing more of this and our vision and our goals with you at our Analyst Day later this afternoon.  
I will pass it over now to Ita Brennan, our Chief Financial Officer, for financial specifics. Ita?"

A full",1129,"Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 of 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release.
Total revenues in Q3 were $748.7 million, up 23.7% year-over-year and above the upper end of our guidance of $725 million to $745 million.
Shipments remained constrained in the period as we continued to carefully navigate industry-wide supply chain shortages and COVID-related disruptions. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 21.5% of revenue in the third quarter, down from 22.3% in Q2. International revenues for the quarter came in at $191 million or 25% of total revenue, down from 27% in the second quarter. 
The shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter basis reflect a continued healthy performance from our cloud titan and in-region businesses in EMEA with some volatility in our APAC business. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 64.9% at the upper end of our guidance range of approximately 63% to 65%. We continue to recognize some incremental supply chain costs in the period, and these were offset by a healthy mix of revenue from our enterprise customers in the quarter. 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $192.4 million or 25.7% of revenue, up from last quarter at $189.8 million. R&D spending came in at $125 million or 16.7% of revenue, up from last quarter at $119.6 million. This reflected increased headcount and employee-related costs and higher new product introduction spending in the period. Sales and marketing expense was $55.8 million or 7.4% of revenue, down from $57.9 million last quarter with lower demo and other variable expenses in the period. As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. 
Our G&A costs came in at $11.6 million or 1.5% of revenue, down slightly from last quarter, but in line with normal quarterly seasonality. Our operating income for the quarter was $293.7 million or 39.2% of revenue. Other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.3 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.7%. 
This resulted in net income for the quarter of $236.9 million or 31.6% of revenue. Our diluted share number was 79.9 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.96, up approximately 22.5% from the prior year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $3.4 billion. We repurchased $134 million of our common stock during the third quarter at an average price of $357 per share. As a recap, at the end of Q3 2021, we had repurchased $897 million or 3.9 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3 years beginning in April 2019. 
In October 2021, Arista's Board of Directors increased the authorization by adding an additional $1 billion to the repurchase amount. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, business requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. 
Now turning to the operating cash performance for the third quarter. We generated $273 million of cash from operations in the period, reflecting strong net income performance and continued investments in inventory and supply chain. DSOs came in at 49 days, up slightly from 47 in Q2, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 1.7x, consistent with last quarter. Inventory increased to $575.7 million in the quarter, up from $543.2 million in the prior period as we continued to buffer certain components and products. 
Our purchase commitments number for the quarter increased to $2.1 billion, up from $1.1 billion in Q2. This reflects a combination of increased lead times for many components and improved demand visibility. We continue to prioritize newer early life cycle products for inclusion in this strategy to help mitigate the risk of obsolescence. 
Our total deferred revenue balance was $800 million, up from $746 million in Q2. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Approximately $113 million of the balance, up from $90 million last quarter represents product deferred revenue largely related to acceptance clauses for new products, most recently with our larger cloud titan customers. 
As a reminder, we are currently in a period of significant new product introductions, combined with a healthy new customer acquisition rate and expanded use cases with existing customers. These trends in conjunction with reduced levels of upfront in-person testing have resulted in increased customer-specific acceptance clauses and higher product deferred revenue amounts. Accounts payable days were 47 days, down from 54 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $45.9 million, including approximately $40 million of CapEx related to the purchase of land to construct a new data center and hardware engineering building in Santa Clara. We'll provide more details on this project over coming quarters. 
Now turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter and beyond. As outlined in our guidance, we now expect to achieve year-over-year revenue growth for the full year 2021 of approximately 25%. This reflects continued healthy demand across all market sectors, tempered by the impact of the difficult supply environment. On the gross margin front, industry supply constraints and elevated logistics costs continue to pressure gross margins, with customer price increases as a potential offset. Based on our current outlook, we continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix remaining the key driver of volatility on a quarter-by-quarter basis. 
Turning to spending and investments. We remain committed to growing our investments in R&D to support innovation across the business and sales and marketing to support our go-to-market expansion. Finally, we also announced today that Arista's Board of Directors has approved a 4 for 1 stock split. Each Arista shareholder of record at the close of business on November 11, 2021, will receive 3 additional shares for every share held and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on November 18, 2021. 
With all this as a backdrop, our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows: revenues of approximately $775 million to $795 million, gross margins of 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20.5% with diluted shares on a pre-split basis of approximately 80 million shares.

It's a proud moment and I really congratulate my entire leadership team and my employees for getting us here. I think demand is very strong, as I mentioned in my earlier script, across all 5 verticals across all 3 product lines and across all 3 sectors as well. So I would not -- I would tell you, we are growing in that what Ita highlighted as our 25% annual growth, every sector was growing.
And so that's, in some ways, I feel bad that I even have to rank and rate them. But if you ask me to highlight some of the growth vectors, I would say, obviously, cloud titans are back. We had a rough fell. If you remember, 2 years ago, Halloween was not a treat. It was a trick. And it's just come back and it is a volatile sector, and it's positively volatile right now. So we're enjoying the growth of cloud titans. 
We're also enjoying many pieces of our enterprise market growing. And there are really some verticals there that are doing very, very well, not just the financials, but different parts of the enterprise. I think it's fair to say Arista has arrived in the enterprise. We've been growing double digits for a couple of years, and we expect to continue to see double-digit growth in the enterprise sector. And this is by far our largest momentum of all the verticals, I would say. 
But not -- as I mentioned, a lot of routing use cases, these routing use cases are not only in the cloud titans, but are obviously also in service providers and enterprises as well. So we're just enjoying a very diversified momentum of our business at the moment."

The cloud tightness visibility has improved a lot this year.
Typically, it used to be 1 to 2 quarters. Right now, it's more like a year or more. So this is the best visibility we've ever had with the cloud titan that's allowing us to build the inventory and to build a plan and to get ahead, if you will. In the enterprise as well, nobody's lead times are very good right now, and we're no different. Although we thought and we believe we have a head start by starting on this problem as early as last year. We have hundreds of suppliers, and we've had to increase our strategic interface with these suppliers to -- and make, again, bets on them long term. 
So visibility in the enterprise is also 6 months to a year, visibility in the cloud and specialty cloud providers is now exceeding a year. So in general, we're now able to make a plan to buy components well ahead of the purchase orders and forecast. Ita, do you want to add something more?"

I think we are -- as Jayshree mentioned, we are in the process of instituting some price increases, et cetera, to help offset some of those costs. So that will help. 
I think we're comfortable thinking about that 63% to 65% range is still being reasonable. But you will see some more volatility quarter-by-quarter just as the mix of the business. The customer mix is still going to be the biggest driver. The other costs we're managing with some of the price increases, et cetera.

If you -- let me just step back, Jim, and thank you for the kind wishes. The traditional model for everybody has been built to forecast, Lead times are based on supplier commits. There's some buffers, but most of it is just in time, right? And very rarely does anybody pay for expedites. 
If you look at supply chain in 2022, first of all, expedites are a way of life. It doesn't matter which vendor it is. You have to plan not just weeks ahead, but months ahead. Often, you can get decommits from suppliers. There's shortages across the board. There's lots of orders with no buffers. Everybody is coming at them sometimes and we used to think the high-tech industry is special. But some of the components we're talking about, we compete with the automotive industry and the consumer industry, which makes it tougher. 
And it isn't surprising at all to see expedites involve not just CEOs, but heads of countries literally. That's how rough it is. So it's a very oversubscribed process. We thought we got a head start by starting when was it Ita, late last year when Anshul and the team put together a plan. So we've definitely had a head start. And if things have gotten better, we would be well ahead of everyone. But just things keep getting worse. 
So now the head start is good, but we have to add to that head start and hence, the doubling of the inventory. And without naming any vendor, I'll just say we've increased the strategic nature of our relationship with not just 1 or 2 vendors, but 25% of our vendors. So this is a much larger relationship pool, and we're committing to them long term. They're committing to us, but both of us have to be patient and understanding of the short-term troubles we have."

And finally, at the enterprise customers is that we have now much as we talk about products, we have invested in customers. Our investment in sales led by Chris Schmidt and Ashwin Kohli and the entire team worldwide really began in 2017. 
So this is our third or fourth year of enterprise investment. And I think we're now seeing the results of that. The first and second year, we were kind of getting in, and we're just coming into the campus. And now I think we're coming on to our own in a complete holistic fashion."

I just think it's really hard from a timing perspective. When you have these lead times, of course, you're going to have accelerated bookings and larger bookings. And certainly, we have our fair share of that, right? There's no -- it's always difficult to talk about the business, I think, in that context. So we're more focused on what can we deploy and that's how we're running it internally as well, right? 
What are the periods where these bookings will get deployed and building out deployment plans. And that's really what's going to matter. And I think when you think about the business that way, the pull-ins and push-outs of the actual bookings numbers and how much visibility you're getting, et cetera, becomes less important, right? So not kind of duck -- not ducking your question, we have obviously lots of demand. We've talked about the demand that we have, but these are extended lead times. So we're just focused on making sure we understand how it's going to get deployed."

So I think as you look forward kind of outside of these quarters, when the mix of the business comes back to something more balanced, I think you will see back towards the bottom end of that range from time to time. I think we believe we'll stay in the range over a long period of time, but there will be quarters where we could be pressuring the bottom end of that range and maybe even break the bottom end of that range. 
While for, say, for 4 quarters, I think we can still be okay. So there is definitely a customer element to this. There's a cost increase element to this, and we will benefit from some customer price increases here that will help offset some of that. But I think the days of living at the upper end of that range, I wouldn't assume that we can do that on an ongoing basis as you look forward."

And then just as a follow-up on pricing, when you think about the 10% price hike that you're going to implement in a couple of weeks, in your mind, is that sort of more than offsets the supply chain?

If you fast forward to later years, I do think Arista will have an advantage, not just in product capability, but also in the ability to rapidly supply product probably better than some of the white boxes. And Anshul has often alluded to this. So the make versus buy decision for many of our cloud titans may shift in the direction of Arista rather than strictly white boxes. 
We look forward to that. I'm not going to make any guesses on that, but I don't preclude that and Ita has Anshul when he's spoken in the past. So it certainly wasn't part of the market share gains and the growth this year, but it could be next year."

Regarding the cloud titan CapEx spend, we're always surprised when the numbers actually come out because they're in billions. And of course, they're nowhere close to the percentage they spend with us necessarily. But our relationship with Facebook dates back now at least 4, 5 years.

And then what happens with your cost of goods sold since it's on FIFO. I'm assuming it's on FIFO like everyone else. Does it mean that right now, you're still recording cheaper components, so the margins are higher.

There are other costs like higher price -- higher pricing increases, et cetera, that will end up being inventoried and will flow with the inventory. And some of that obviously will burn through the inventory that we have in the supply chain, and then we'll start to see those costs. 
Those will line up better, hopefully, with some of the price increases that we are passing on to customers as well. I mean this is -- it's going to be complex. It won't necessarily be perfect, right? But as we look at the various different scenarios, there's a better chance of those lining up with the price increases. So that will help kind of offset some of that."

I think the cloud titan behavior will be different than the enterprise behavior. On the cloud titan, you're going to see a much more rapid inflection to 200-gig and 400-gig, especially in the spine layers and the uplinks at the top of rack. And they've always been an early and fast adopter of speeds and technology, especially within a data center or even data center to data center. So we are expecting an inflection of 200- and 400-gig. 
That basically has started this year was very challenged with the ecosystem and availability of optics and even switches the last year. The year of inflection, in my view, is really late this year and goes well into 2022. On the enterprise too, we expect to have by the end of this year, 300 customers of 200 and 400-gig, primarily 400-gig, I would say. And as you know, our customer base is more than 7,000. So obviously, 100-gig and 400-gig will continue to coexist and live happily ever after together. But we will start to see the uptick and adoption of 400-gig in the high end and early adopters of enterprise as well, like we're starting to see this year. 
So I think the next few years can be best characterized as inflection of new higher speeds like 200 and 400 and the continuation and adoption of 100-gig in the mainstream enterprise."

So it's build to purchase orders to our supply chain rather than build to customer purchase orders. If that makes sense. Since they're still constrained on long lead times.

And I think that's important. And again, we're doing it on new products, newer products that have significant lives ahead of them. So really, the risk we're taking somewhat is tying up some cash, et cetera. 
It's not because of the life cycle of the products and stuff, it's not really an obsolescence risk, right? But it could take some time to burn through that inventory if things change. But I think it's well -- it's a bet that's worth making. We're making it obviously in consultation and discussion with customers, et cetera. But it is kind of a longer lead time and then a broader set of suppliers than we'd normally carry.
