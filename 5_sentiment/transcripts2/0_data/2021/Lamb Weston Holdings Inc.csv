Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our entire Lamb Weston team continues to execute well through this challenging environment. That's only possible becau",819,"Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our entire Lamb Weston team continues to execute well through this challenging environment. That's only possible because of their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, suppliers and communities, and I can't thank them enough for their dedication and support. Our second quarter results also reflect operating conditions that were generally similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. Overall restaurant traffic in the U.S. was resilient by holding steady at around 90% of pre-pandemic levels for much of the quarter. However, traffic and frozen potato demand rates continue to vary widely by channel. 
Traffic at large chain restaurants were essentially at prior year levels as quick-service restaurants continued to leverage drive-through, takeout and delivery formats. Traffic at full-service restaurants was 70% to 80% at prior year levels for much of the quarter. However, traffic began to soften in November as governments reimposed social and on-premise dining restrictions in an effort to contain the resurgence of COVID and as the onset of colder weather tempered outdoor dining opportunities across many markets. Traffic and demand in noncommercial customers, which includes lodging, hospitality, health care, schools and universities, sports and entertainment, and workplace environment was fairly steady at around 50% prior year levels for the entire quarter. 
In retail, consumer demand continued to be strong with weekly category volume growth between 15% and 20% versus the prior year. Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic and fried demand were uneven across markets and varied within the quarter. In Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston Meijer joint venture, fry demand during most of the quarter was similar to last year, but softened to 75% to 85% at prior year levels during the latter part of the quarter as governments reimposed social restriction and as the weather turned colder. 
As you may recall, unlike in the U.S., QSRs in Europe generally have only limited drive-through capabilities. Demand in our other key international markets was mixed. In China and Australia, demand was near prior year levels. In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, overall demand improved sequentially from our first quarter, but remained well below prior year levels. Going forward, we expect many of the softer traffic and demand trends that we began to see in November to carry over into our fiscal third quarter. The sharp resurgence of COVID in the U.S. and Europe has led governments to impose even more rigid social restrictions. In addition, we expect outdoor restaurant dining traffic in our largest markets to fall further as we enter the coldest month of the year in the northern hemisphere. Not surprisingly, we expect traffic at full-service restaurants will continue to be disproportionately affected. Major QSR chains in the U.S. should be able to continue to hold up well due to their ability to serve customers via drive-through and delivery. Retail should also benefit as consumers eat more meals at home. And as Rob will discuss later, while still early, our shipments to those channels in December support that view. So on the one hand, in the near term, we anticipate facing even more challenging and volatile operating conditions than what we experienced in the first half of our fiscal year. On the other hand, we believe this COVID-induced shock to demand is temporary. We're confident in the strength of the frozen potato category and do not see any structural impediments to recovery in demand and growth over the long term. As COVID vaccines become more widely available in the coming months and as the virus is more broadly contained, we expect governments will gradually lift social restrictions. 
This should lead to steady growth in restaurant traffic as the year progresses. We believe this growth will lead to overall frozen potato demand approaching pre pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. 
In the meantime, we're confident in our business fundamentals, the pricing, capacity utilization and potato supply and our ability to manage through the pandemic impacts on our manufacturing operations. Our recently announced increase in our quarterly dividend and the planned resumption of our share repurchase program, reinforce our conviction in the strength of our business in the category, as well as our commitment to support customers and create value for our stakeholders. 
In summary, we delivered solid Q2 results and are executing well in a challenging environment. We expect frozen potato demand to soften in the near term due to reduced traffic following government reimposed social restrictions as well as the onset of colder weather, and we're optimistic that the increasing availability of COVID vaccines will enable restaurant traffic to gradually improve as the year progresses, and that demand will approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar 2021. Now let me turn the call over to Rob."
374372246,697320416,2166297,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 07, 2021",2021-01-07,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter.

As Tom noted, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter. As our teams continue to manage through an ever-changing demand environment as well as COVID-related disruptions to our manufacturing and distribution networks. For the quarter, net sales declined 12% to $896 million. Sales volume was down 14%, largely due to FRI demand at restaurants and food service being negatively impacted following government-imposed restrictions to contain the spread of COVID as well as colder weather beginning to limit outdoor dining across many of our markets. In addition, volume was down as we lapped the benefit of additional shipping days related to the timing of Thanksgiving last year. 
Overall, as Tom described earlier, restaurant traffic and our sales volumes in the U.S. stabilized at approximately 90% of pre pandemic levels, although performance varied widely by sales channel. International sales were mixed but improved sequentially versus our first quarter. Price/mix increased 2%, driven by improved price in our foodservice and retail segments as well as favorable mix in retail. Gross profit declined $62 million as lower sales and higher manufacturing costs more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix and productivity savings. 
As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we expected our manufacturing costs to increase in the quarter. This was partly due to processing potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual. We did this in order to manage finished goods inventories in light of the pandemic's impact on fry demand. Processing older crop results in increased cost due to significant -- due to higher raw material storage fees and lower recovery rates. Since we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory, we realized the impact of these costs in our second quarter income statement as we sold that inventory. We also realized higher manufacturing costs due to input cost inflation, primarily related to edible oils, raw potatoes and other raw ingredients. Overall, our input cost inflation was in the low single digits. Finally, we continue to realize incremental costs and inefficiencies resulting from the pandemic's disruptive effect on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. 
As a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other costs to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID. Costs associated with modifying production schedules, reducing run times and manufacturing retail products online primarily designed for foodservice products, and cost for enhancing employee safety and sanitation protocols as well as for incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs.  Specifically in the quarter, we had notable disruptions in our facilities in Idaho as well as lesser ones and some other facilities. We expect to continue to incur COVID-related costs through at least the remainder of fiscal 2021. As a result, we consider these costs and disruptions as part of our ongoing operations and are no longer disclosing these costs separately. SG&A declined by nearly $8 million in the quarter, largely due to lower incentive compensation expense accruals and a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and promotional expense. The decline was partially offset by investments to improve our operations and IT infrastructure, which included about $5 million of nonrecurring consulting and training expenses associated with implementing Phase 1 of our new ERP system. Equity method earnings were $19 million, which is up $4 million versus last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased about $2 million due to better performance by our European joint venture. 
However, like in the U.S., our shipments softened during the latter part of the quarter, reflecting the effect on restaurant traffic of governments reimposing social restrictions as well as colder weather on outdoor Dining. EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $213 million, which is down $48 million. The decline was driven by lower income from operations, and was partially offset by higher equity method earnings. Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.66, down $0.29, largely due to lower income from operations. EPS was also down due to higher interest expense, reflecting our higher average total debt and the write-off of some debt issuance costs as we paid off a term loan a year early. The decline was partially offset by higher equity earnings. 
Moving to our segments. Sales for our global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100 North American-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were down 12% in the quarter. Volume was down 11% due to softer demand for fries outside the home, especially in our international markets. Shipments to large chain restaurant customers in the U.S. of which approximately 85% are to QSRs approached prior year levels as QSRs leverage drive-through and delivery formats. However, some of that strength also reflected pulling forward sales of customized and limited time offering products from the third quarter. International sales, which historically comprised about 40% of segment sales, we're at about 80% of prior year levels in the aggregate, but varied by market. Shipments in China and Australia approached prior year levels. Our shipments to other parts of Asia and Latin America improved sequentially as customers and distributors in many of these markets were able to rightsize inventory. However, they remain well below prior year levels. 
Price/mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix. Price alone was flat. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, declined 28% to $93 million. Lower sales volume, higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline. 
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 21% in the quarter. Volume declined 25%. Segments to smaller chain and independent full-service and quick-service restaurants tracked around 70% to 80% of prior year levels through much of October but slowed to 60% to 70% in November following governments reimposing social restrictions and is colder weather tempered restaurant traffic in some of our markets. 
Shipments to noncommercial customers improved modestly since summer, but remain at around 50% of prior year levels. With strength in health care, more than offset by continued weakness in the other channels. Price/mix increased 4% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of fiscal 2020. Mix continued to be unfavorable with some hard-hit independent restaurants looking to reduce costs by purchasing more value-added products rather than the premium  Lamb Weston branded ones. While we've regained much of this business since the pandemic first struck last spring, on a year-over-year basis, it remains a mixed headwind. 
Foodservice's product contribution margin declined 21% to $88 million. Lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline and was partially offset by favorable price. Sales for our retail segment increased 7% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 7%, primarily reflecting favorable mix benefit of selling more of our higher-margin branded portfolio of Alexa -- Alexia, grown in Idaho and licensed restaurant trademarks. Volume increased nominally. Sales of our branded products were up about 30%, which is well above category growth rates, which range between 15% and 20%. The increase in our branded volume was offset by the loss of certain low-margin private label volume that began late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as well as an additional amount that began a couple of months ago. As a result, we expect private label losses to continue to be a headwind. Retail's product contribution margin increased 6% to $30 million. The increase was driven by favorable mix and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. 
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. We're comfortable with our liquidity position and confident in our ability to continue to generate cash. In the first half, we generated nearly $320 million of cash from operations, which is down about $25 million versus last year due to lower sales and earnings. We spent $54 million in CapEx, including expenditures for our new ERP system. We paid $67 million in dividends. And a few weeks ago, announced a 2% increase in our quarterly dividend. In addition, we plan to resume our share repurchase program this quarter. As you may recall, we temporarily suspended our buyback program in late fiscal 2020 in order to help preserve our liquidity during the early days of the pandemic. 
As we discussed in our previous earnings call, in September, we amended our credit agreement to put in place a new 3-year $750 million revolver. At the same time, using a portion of the more than $1 billion of cash on hand, we prepaid the approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was due in November of 2021. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $760 million of cash on hand and our new revolver was undrawn. Our total debt was $2.75 billion, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.1x. 
Now turning to our shipments so far in the third quarter. Broadly speaking, in the U.S., demand at QSRs and at retail are holding up well while traffic at full-service restaurants continues to soften. Specifically, U.S. shipments in the 4 weeks ending December 27, were approximately 85% of prior year levels. In our global segments, shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain customers in the U.S. were more than 95% of prior year levels. We expect that rate will largely continue for the remainder of the third quarter. 
In our Foodservice segment, shipments to our full service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and noncommercial customers in aggregate, were 60% to 65% of prior year levels. That is largely in line with what we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We anticipate that shipments to full-service restaurants and small and regional QSR will continue to soften as social restrictions broaden and as winter weather takes a bigger bite out of outdoor dining. 
Shipments to noncommercial customers, which have historically comprised about 25% of the segment's volume were roughly half of prior year levels and will likely remain soft for the remainder of the quarter. In our retail segments, shipments were above prior year levels with strong volume of our branded products, partially offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. We believe that this rate will largely continue for the remainder of the quarter. Outside the U.S., overall demand has slowed but is varied by market. In Europe, shipments by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture were approximately 85% of prior year levels, continuing the softer demand that we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We believe that shipments will continue to soften due to severe social restrictions and colder weather. Shipments to our other international markets, which primarily include Asia, Oceana, Latin America were mixed. In aggregate, international shipments so far in the quarter have been softer than what we realized during the latter half of the second quarter. As a reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our global results. 
In short, other than U.S. QSRs, which can leverage drive-through access, global demand for fries at restaurants and foodservice will be soft in the third quarter following government's reimposing restrictions to combat the resurgence of COVID as well as colder weather in our northern hemisphere markets limits outdoor dining opportunities. 
With respect to contract pricing, after completing discussions for contracts that were up for renewal, we expect pricing across our domestic large chain restaurant portfolio in aggregate to be flat versus prior year. Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts on balance, domestic pricing is holding up well. However, we continue to see increased competitive activity in more value-added oriented products in some international markets and to a lesser extent, in some value tiered domestic market segments. With respect to costs, the potato crop in our growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the upper Midwest is consistent with historical averages in aggregate. We don't see any notable impact on cost outside of inflation. 
Crop in our growing areas in Europe is also broadly consistent with historical averages, which should help ease cost pressures there versus last year. However, we do expect to continue to incur additional costs as a result of COVID's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. And we expect that we'll continue to do so until the virus is broadly contained. Now here's Tom to offer some closing comments."

We have a big initiative within supply chain to unlock capacity and drive efficiencies. 
And if you think about, Andrew, the timing of new capacity versus what we have in our current footprint, I'm 100% confident that with our supply chain initiative, unlock hidden capacity in our current footprint that we're absolutely in a great position as demand returns to support not only our current customers as their business returns, but also future demand and category growth.

So as we look over this next quarter, while our -- we're seeing softness in some of the channels, specifically foodservice. I don't believe it's going to be anywhere near it was when all this thing started. 
Now that said, we gave guidance on what's happening through December. And I think that's going to be where it plays out over the next 30, 60 days. We get through winter, things are going to open them back up. The most important thing for us is to be prepared for the opening back up. And we learned a lot of lessons last spring as a management team and myself personally that we have to be ready and what does that mean? It means if you think about April, May, we're taking some measures right now to ensure we've got the right inventory, the right products. So when demand snaps back, which we believe it will in the spring, and start increasing, we can service our customers. All the while, recognize that we're still dealing with manufacturing operating issues because of COVID in terms of efficiencies. 
So on the one hand, while things are slowing down in some areas. On the other hand, it's a great opportunity for us to get ourselves positioned to meet demand when this thing snaps back. So the near-term is going to be volatile. But as we come out, get to spring and summer and you got vaccines and this thing, hopefully, starts getting behind us. There's -- I believe there's going to be some pent-up demand for people to go out and eat at the end, so we're going to be prepared for that."

Is there -- like if you step back and you say, okay, this is where we are now, it's how many potatoes we have, how many potatoes the industry has. I feel like we kind of forecasted it somewhat appropriately relative to demand when you go back to, right, March-April of last year. And now as you sit here and you think about Q3 into the spring and summer, do you kind of say, yes, we still feel pretty good. The industry feels pretty good about those inventory levels as long as that demand does snap back. So we're not once again kind of, so to speak, over inventory. Is that fair?"

The thing that we're working on right now is to make sure we got the right inventory levels of product that was really pulled when the economy opened back up in May, June. And so we've got data, and we can look and see what the customers -- the products, we were shipping to them. So we're positioning those products to have a different level of safety stock, if you will, to anticipate that. And so I think we're in good shape in finished good inventory and raw inventory. The thing to remember is the timing of whether it's April, May or June, the timing of consumer demand, out -- going out to eat more or maybe it's further down the road, we'll manage it, and we can manage our production schedules. We can manage inventory levels. So there's things we can do and have done and always do just to manage the supply and demand side of it. And so I feel good about where we're at now. 
Like I said, we're getting ourselves prepared for demand return as we get through Q3. And I think the company will be in good shape, and we'll react as needed just based on the ordering signals we're getting from our customers."

We delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our entire Lamb Weston team continues to execute well through this challenging environment.

We delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our entire Lamb Weston team continues to execute well through this challenging environment. That's only possible because of their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, suppliers and communities, and I can't thank them enough for their dedication and support. Our second quarter results also reflect operating conditions that were generally similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. Overall, restaurant traffic in the U.S. was resilient by holding steady at around 90% of pre-pandemic levels for much of the quarter. However, traffic and frozen potato demand rates continue to vary widely by channel.  
Traffic at large chain restaurants were essentially at prior year levels as quick-service restaurants continued to leverage drive-through, takeout and delivery formats. Traffic at full-service restaurants was 70% to 80% at prior year levels for much of the quarter. However, traffic began to soften in November as governments reimposed social and on-premise dining restrictions in an effort to contain the resurgence of COVID and as the onset of colder weather tempered outdoor dining opportunities across many markets. Traffic and demand at noncommercial customers, which includes lodging, hospitality, health care, schools and universities, sports and entertainment and workplace environment, was fairly steady at around 50% prior year levels for the entire quarter. In retail, consumer demand continued to be strong with weekly category volume growth between 15% and 20% versus the prior year. 
Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic and fry demand were uneven across markets and varied within the quarter. In Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, fry demand during most of the quarter was similar to last year but softened to 75% to 85% at prior year levels during the latter part of the quarter as governments reimposed social restriction and as the weather turned colder. As you may recall, unlike in the U.S., QSRs in Europe generally have only limited drive-through capabilities. 
Demand in our other key international markets was mixed. In China and Australia, demand was near prior year levels. In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, overall demand improved sequentially from our first quarter but remained well below prior year levels. 
Going forward, we expect many of the softer traffic and demand trends that we began to see in November to carry over into our fiscal third quarter. The sharp resurgence of COVID in the U.S. and Europe has led governments to impose even more rigid social restrictions. In addition, we expect outdoor restaurant dining traffic in our largest markets to fall further as we enter the coldest months of the year in the northern hemisphere. Not surprisingly, we expect traffic at full-service restaurants will continue to be disproportionately affected. Major QSR chains in the U.S. should be able to continue to hold up well due to their ability to serve customers via drive-through and delivery. Retail should also benefit as consumers eat more meals at home. And as Rob will discuss later, while still early, our shipments to those channels in December support that view. 
So on the one hand, in the near term, we anticipate facing even more challenging and volatile operating conditions than what we experienced in the first half of our fiscal year. On the other hand, we believe this COVID-induced shock to demand is temporary. We're confident in the strength of the frozen potato category and do not see any structural impediments to recovery in demand and growth over the long term. 
As COVID vaccines become more widely available in the coming months and as the virus is more broadly contained, we expect governments will gradually lift social restrictions. This should lead to steady growth in restaurant traffic as the year progresses. We believe this growth will lead to overall frozen potato demand approaching pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021.  
In the meantime, we're confident in our business fundamentals, the pricing, capacity utilization and potato supply and our ability to manage through the pandemic's impacts on our manufacturing operations. 
Our recently announced increase in our quarterly dividend and the planned resumption of our share repurchase program reinforce our conviction in the strength of our business and the category as well as our commitment to support customers and create value for our stakeholders.  
In summary, we delivered solid Q2 results and are executing well in a challenging environment. We expect frozen potato demand to soften in the near term due to reduced traffic following government reimposed social restrictions as well as the onset of colder weather. And we're optimistic that the increasing availability of COVID vaccines will enable restaurant traffic to gradually improve as the year progresses, and that demand will approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar 2021. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."
374372246,697320416,2166338,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 07, 2021",2021-01-07,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our teams continue to manage through an ever-changing demand environment as well as COVID-related disruptions to our manufacturing and distrib",2076,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our teams continue to manage through an ever-changing demand environment as well as COVID-related disruptions to our manufacturing and distribution networks. For the quarter, net sales declined 12% to $896 million. Sales volume was down 14%, largely due to fry demand at restaurants and food service being negatively impacted following government-imposed restrictions to contain the spread of COVID as well as colder weather beginning to limit outdoor dining across many of our markets. In addition, volume was down as we lapped the benefit of additional shipping days related to the timing of Thanksgiving last year.  
Overall, as Tom described earlier, restaurant traffic and our sales volumes in the U.S. stabilized at approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels, although performance varied widely by sales channel. International sales were mixed but improved sequentially versus our first quarter. Price/mix increased 2% driven by improved price in our foodservice and retail segments as well as favorable mix in retail. Gross profit declined $62 million as lower sales and higher manufacturing costs more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix and productivity savings.  
As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we expected our manufacturing costs to increase in the quarter. This was partly due to processing potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual. We did this in order to manage finished goods inventories in light of the pandemic's impact on fry demand. Processing older crop results in increased cost due to significant -- due to higher raw material storage fees and lower recovery rates. Since we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory, we realized the impact of these costs in our second quarter income statement as we sold that inventory. 
We also realized higher manufacturing costs due to input cost inflation, primarily related to edible oils, raw potatoes and other raw ingredients. Overall, our input cost inflation was in the low single digits. 
Finally, we continue to realize incremental costs and inefficiencies resulting from the pandemic's disruptive effect on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. As a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other costs to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID; costs associated with modifying production schedules, reducing run times and manufacturing retail products online primarily designed for foodservice products; and costs for enhancing employee safety and sanitation protocols; as well as for incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs.  
Specifically in the quarter, we had notable disruptions in our facilities in Idaho as well as lesser ones in some other facilities. We expect to continue to incur COVID-related costs through at least the remainder of fiscal 2021. As a result, we consider these costs and disruptions as part of our ongoing operations and are no longer disclosing these costs separately. SG&A declined by nearly $8 million in the quarter, largely due to lower incentive compensation expense accruals and a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and promotional expense. The decline was partially offset by investments to improve our operations and IT infrastructure, which included about $5 million of nonrecurring consulting and training expenses associated with implementing Phase 1 of our new ERP system. 
Equity-method earnings were $19 million, which is up $4 million versus last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased about $2 million due to better performance by our European joint venture.  However, like in the U.S., our shipments softened during the latter part of the quarter, reflecting the effect on restaurant traffic of governments reimposing social restrictions as well as colder weather on outdoor dining. 
EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $213 million, which is down $48 million. The decline was driven by lower income from operations and was partially offset by higher equity-method earnings. 
Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.66, down $0.29 largely due to lower income from operations. EPS was also down due to higher interest expense, reflecting our higher average total debt and the write-off of some debt issuance costs as we paid off a term loan a year early. The decline was partially offset by higher equity earnings.  
Moving to our segments. Sales for our global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100 North American-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were down 12% in the quarter. Volume was down 11% due to softer demand for fries outside the home, especially in our international markets. Shipments to large chain restaurant customers in the U.S., of which approximately 85% are to QSRs, approached prior year levels as QSRs leverage drive-through and delivery formats. However, some of that strength also reflected pulling forward sales of customized and limited time offering products from the third quarter. 
International sales, which historically comprised about 40% of segment sales, were at about 80% of prior year levels in the aggregate but varied by market. Shipments in China and Australia approached prior year levels. Our shipments to other parts of Asia and Latin America improved sequentially as customers and distributors in many of these markets were able to rightsize inventories. However, they remain well below prior year levels.  
Price/mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix. Price alone was flat. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, declined 28% to $93 million. Lower sales volume, higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline.  
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 21% in the quarter. Volume declined 25%. Segments to smaller chain and independent full-service and quick-service restaurants tracked around 70% to 80% of prior year levels through much of October but slowed to 60% to 70% in November following governments reimposing social restrictions and as colder weather tempered restaurant traffic in some of our markets.  
Shipments to noncommercial customers improved modestly since summer but remain at around 50% of prior year levels, with strength in health care more than offset by continued weakness in the other channels. 
Price/mix increased 4% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of fiscal 2020. Mix continued to be unfavorable with some hard-hit independent restaurants looking to reduce costs by purchasing more value-added products rather than the premium  Lamb Weston branded ones. While we've regained much of this business since the pandemic first struck last spring, on a year-over-year basis, it remains a mix headwind.  
Foodservice's product contribution margin declined 21% to $88 million. Lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline and was partially offset by favorable price. Sales for our retail segment increased 7% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 7%, primarily reflecting favorable mix benefit of selling more of our higher-margin branded portfolio of Alexa -- Alexia grown in Idaho and licensed restaurant trademarks. Volume increased nominally. Sales of our branded products were up about 30%, which is well above category growth rates, which ranged between 15% and 20%. The increase in our branded volume was offset by the loss of certain low-margin private label volume that began late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as an additional amount that began a couple of months ago. As a result, we expect private label losses to continue to be a headwind.  
Retail's product contribution margin increased 6% to $30 million. The increase was driven by favorable mix and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.  
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. We're comfortable with our liquidity position and confident in our ability to continue to generate cash. In the first half, we generated nearly $320 million of cash from operations, which is down about $25 million versus last year due to lower sales and earnings. We spent $54 million in CapEx, including expenditures for our new ERP system. We paid $67 million in dividends and a few weeks ago announced a 2% increase in our quarterly dividend. In addition, we plan to resume our share repurchase program this quarter. As you may recall, we temporarily suspended our buyback program in late fiscal 2020 in order to help preserve our liquidity during the early days of the pandemic.  
As we discussed in our previous earnings call, in September, we amended our credit agreement to put in place a new 3-year $750 million revolver. At the same time, using a portion of the more than $1 billion of cash on hand, we prepaid the approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was due in November of 2021.  
At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $760 million of cash on hand and our new revolver was undrawn. Our total debt was $2.75 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.1x.  
Now turning to our shipments so far in the third quarter. Broadly speaking, in the U.S., demand at QSRs and at retail are holding up well while traffic at full-service restaurants continues to soften. Specifically, U.S. shipments in the 4 weeks ending December 27 were approximately 85% of prior year levels. In our global segments, shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain customers in the U.S. were more than 95% of prior year levels. We expect that rate will largely continue for the remainder of the third quarter.  
In our Foodservice segment, shipments to our full service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and noncommercial customers in aggregate were 60% to 65% of prior year levels. That is largely in line with what we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We anticipate that shipments to full-service restaurants and small and regional QSRs will continue to soften as social restrictions broaden and as winter weather takes a bigger bite out of outdoor dining.  
Shipments to noncommercial customers, which have historically comprised about 25% of the segment's volume were roughly half of prior year levels and will likely remain soft for the remainder of the quarter. 
In our retail segments, shipments were above prior year levels with strong volume of our branded products partially offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. We believe that this rate will largely continue for the remainder of the quarter. 
Outside the U.S., overall demand has slowed but is varied by market. In Europe, shipments by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture were approximately 85% of prior year levels, continuing the softer demand that we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We believe that shipments will continue to soften due to severe social restrictions and colder weather. Shipments to our other international markets, which primarily include Asia, Oceana, Latin America, were mixed. In aggregate, international shipments so far in the quarter have been softer than what we realized during the latter half of the second quarter. As a reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our global results.  
In short, other than U.S. QSRs, which can leverage drive-through access, global demand for fries at restaurants and foodservice will be soft in the third quarter following government's reimposing restrictions to combat the resurgence of COVID as well as colder weather in our northern hemisphere markets limits outdoor dining opportunities.  
With respect to contract pricing, after completing discussions for contracts that were up for renewal, we expect pricing across our domestic large chain restaurant portfolio in aggregate to be flat versus prior year. Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts on balance, domestic pricing is holding up well. However, we continue to see increased competitive activity in more value-oriented products in some international markets and, to a lesser extent, in some value-tiered domestic market segments. 
With respect to costs, the potato crop in our growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Upper Midwest is consistent with historical averages in aggregate. We don't see any notable impact on cost outside of inflation.  
Crop in our growing areas in Europe is also broadly consistent with historical averages, which should help ease cost pressures there versus last year. However, we do expect to continue to incur additional cost as a result of COVID's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and supply chain operations and we expect that we'll continue to do so until the virus is broadly contained. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

And if you think about, Andrew, the timing of new capacity versus what we have in our current footprint, I'm 100% confident that with our supply chain initiative unlock hidden capacity in our current footprint that we're absolutely in a great position as demand returns to support not only our current customers as their business returns, but also future demand and category growth. So I feel we're in a really good position. But again, at the right time, we got to make those decisions in terms of getting ourselves ready for demand resurgence 18, 24 months out."

Now that said, we gave guidance on what's happening through December. And I think that's going to be where it plays out over the next 30, 60 days. We'd get through winter, things are going to open them back up. The most important thing for us is to be prepared for the opening back up. And we learned a lot of lessons last spring as a management team and myself personally that we have to be ready. 
And what does that mean? It means if you think about April, May, we're taking some measures right now to ensure we've got the right inventory, the right products. So when demand snaps back, which we believe it will in the spring, and start increasing, we can service our customers, all the while recognize that we're still dealing with manufacturing operating issues because of COVID in terms of efficiencies. 
So on the one hand, while things are slowing down in some areas; on the other hand, it's a great opportunity for us to get ourselves positioned to meet demand when this thing snaps back. So the near term is going to be volatile. But as we come out, get to spring and summer and you got vaccines and this thing hopefully starts getting behind us, there's -- I believe there's going to be some pent-up demand for people to get out -- to go out and eat again.

The thing that we're working on right now is to make sure we got the right inventory levels of product that was really pulled when the economy opened back up in May, June. And so we've got data, and we can look and see what the customers, the products, they were -- we were shipping to them. So we're positioning those products to have a different level of safety stock, if you will, to anticipate that. And so I think we're in good shape from a finished good inventory, raw inventory. 
The thing to remember is the timing of -- whether it's April, May or June, the timing of consumer demand out -- going out to eat more or maybe it's further down the road, we'll manage it, and we can manage our production schedules. We can manage inventory levels. So there's things we can do and have done and always do just to manage the supply and demand side of it. And so I feel good about where we're at now.

Chris, like I said earlier, we're very well balanced with raw needs based on our latest forecast for the remainder of the year. So I feel very comfortable where we're at. And just in terms of the raw cost impact with the demand change, last spring/summer, we made a decision to store and run potatoes longer than we ever had. And the implications of that is you just don't get the yield that we're used to based on it stores longer and it just doesn't perform in the factories as well as the longer you store it. So we're through all that. 
Going forward with the current crop and storage, we will process that on a normal time line as we have in previous years. So it was just a one-off thing. It was a decision based on the change in demand to utilize the old crop longer. So it's -- but that's all behind us now."

But again, you look for positives in this, and that's one thing that is really intriguing to us because that could be -- if it holds to the level it's holding on the importance -- menu importance, that's going to elevate demand even further than what we believe it's going to come back by the end of the calendar year, which is close to pre-pandemic levels."

We delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our entire Lamb Weston team continues to execute well through this challenging environment. That's only possible because of their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, suppliers and communities, and I can't thank them enough for their dedication and support. Our second quarter results also reflect operating conditions that were generally similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. Overall, restaurant traffic in the U.S. was resilient by holding steady at around 90% of pre-pandemic levels for much of the quarter. However, traffic and frozen potato demand rates continue to vary widely by channel. 
Traffic at large chain restaurants were essentially at prior year levels as quick-service restaurants continued to leverage drive-through, takeout and delivery formats. Traffic at full-service restaurants was 70% to 80% of prior year levels for much of the quarter. 
However, traffic began to soften in November as governments reimposed social and on-premise dining restrictions in an effort to contain the resurgence of COVID and as the onset of colder weather tempered outdoor dining opportunities across many markets. 
Traffic and demand at noncommercial customers, which includes lodging, hospitality, health care, schools and universities, sports and entertainment and workplace environment, was fairly steady at around 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter. In retail, consumer demand continued to be strong with weekly category volume growth between 15% and 20% versus the prior year. 
Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic and fry demand were uneven across markets and varied within the quarter. In Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, fry demand during much of the quarter was similar to last year but softened to 75% to 85% of prior year levels during the latter part of the quarter as governments reimposed social restriction and as the weather turned colder. As you may recall, unlike in the U.S., QSRs in Europe generally have only limited drive-through capabilities.
Demand in our other key international markets was mixed. In China and Australia, demand was near prior year levels. In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, overall demand improved sequentially from our first quarter but remained well below prior year levels. 
Going forward, we expect many of the softer traffic and demand trends that we began to see in November to carry over into our fiscal third quarter. The sharp resurgence of COVID in the U.S. and Europe has led governments to impose even more rigid social restrictions. In addition, we expect outdoor restaurant dining traffic in our largest markets to fall further as we enter the coldest months of the year in the northern hemisphere. Not surprisingly, we expect traffic at full-service restaurants will continue to be disproportionately affected. Major QSR chains in the U.S. should be able to continue to hold up well due to their ability to serve customers via drive-through and delivery. Retail should also benefit as consumers eat more meals at home. And as Rob will discuss later, while still early, our shipments to those channels in December support that view. 
So on the one hand, in the near term, we anticipate facing even more challenging and volatile operating conditions than what we experienced in the first half of our fiscal year. On the other hand, we believe this COVID-induced shock to demand is temporary. We're confident in the strength of the frozen potato category and do not see any structural impediments to recovery in demand and growth over the long term. 
As COVID vaccines become more widely available in the coming months and as the virus is more broadly contained, we expect governments will gradually lift social restrictions. This should lead to steady growth in restaurant traffic as the year progresses. We believe this growth will lead to overall frozen potato demand approaching pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. 
In the meantime, we're confident in our business fundamentals, the pricing, capacity utilization and potato supply and our ability to manage through the pandemic's impacts on our manufacturing operations. 
Our recently announced increase in our quarterly dividend and the planned resumption of our share repurchase program reinforce our conviction in the strength of our business and the category as well as our commitment to support customers and create value for our stakeholders. 
In summary, we delivered solid Q2 results and are executing well in a challenging environment. We expect frozen potato demand to soften in the near term due to reduced traffic following government reimposed social restrictions as well as the onset of colder weather. And we're optimistic that the increasing availability of COVID vaccines will enable restaurant traffic to gradually improve as the year progresses, and that demand will approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar 2021. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."
374372246,697320416,2227181,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 07, 2021",2021-01-07,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our teams continued to manage through an ever-changing demand environment as well as COVID-related disruptions to our manufacturing and distri",2077,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our teams continued to manage through an ever-changing demand environment as well as COVID-related disruptions to our manufacturing and distribution networks. For the quarter, net sales declined 12% to $896 million. Sales volume was down 14%, largely due to fry demand at restaurants and food service being negatively impacted following government-imposed restrictions to contain the spread of COVID as well as colder weather beginning to limit outdoor dining across many of our markets. In addition, volume was down as we lapped the benefit of additional shipping days related to the timing of Thanksgiving last year. 
Overall, as Tom described earlier, restaurant traffic and our sales volumes in the U.S. stabilized at approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels, although performance varied widely by sales channel. International sales were mixed but improved sequentially versus our first quarter. Price/mix increased 2% driven by improved price in our foodservice and retail segments as well as favorable mix in retail. Gross profit declined $62 million as lower sales and higher manufacturing costs more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix and productivity savings. 
As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we expected our manufacturing costs to increase in the quarter. This was partly due to processing potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual. We did this in order to manage finished goods inventories in light of the pandemic's impact on fry demand. Processing older crop results in increased cost due to significant -- due to higher raw material storage fees and lower recovery rates. Since we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory, we realized the impact of these costs in our second quarter income statement as we sold that inventory. 
We also realized higher manufacturing costs due to input cost inflation, primarily related to edible oils, raw potatoes and other raw ingredients. Overall, our input cost inflation was in the low single digits. 
Finally, we continue to realize incremental costs and inefficiencies resulting from the pandemic's disruptive effect on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. As a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other costs to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID; costs associated with modifying production schedules, reducing run times and manufacturing retail products online primarily designed for foodservice products; and costs for enhancing employee safety and sanitation protocols; as well as for incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs. 
Specifically in the quarter, we had notable disruptions in our facilities in Idaho as well as lesser ones in some other facilities. We expect to continue to incur COVID-related costs through at least the remainder of fiscal 2021. As a result, we consider these costs and disruptions as part of our ongoing operations and are no longer disclosing these costs separately. SG&A declined by nearly $8 million in the quarter, largely due to lower incentive compensation expense accruals and a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and promotional expense. The decline was partially offset by investments to improve our operations and IT infrastructure, which included about $5 million of nonrecurring consulting and training expenses associated with implementing Phase 1 of our new ERP system. 
Equity-method earnings were $19 million, which is up $4 million versus last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased about $2 million due to better performance by our European joint venture. However, like in the U.S., our shipments softened during the latter part of the quarter, reflecting the effect on restaurant traffic of governments reimposing social restrictions as well as colder weather on outdoor dining. 
EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $213 million, which is down $48 million. The decline was driven by lower income from operations and was partially offset by higher equity-method earnings. 
Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.66, down $0.29 largely due to lower income from operations. EPS was also down due to higher interest expense, reflecting our higher average total debt and the write-off of some debt issuance costs as we paid off a term loan a year early. The decline was partially offset by higher equity earnings. 
Moving to our segments. Sales for our global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100 North American-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were down 12% in the quarter. Volume was down 11% due to softer demand for fries outside the home, especially in our international markets. Shipments to large chain restaurant customers in the U.S., of which approximately 85% are to QSRs, approached prior year levels as QSRs leverage drive-through and delivery formats. However, some of that strength also reflected pulling forward sales of customized and limited time offering products from the third quarter. 
International sales, which historically comprised about 40% of segment sales, were at about 80% of prior year levels in the aggregate but varied by market. Shipments in China and Australia approached prior year levels. Our shipments to other parts of Asia and Latin America improved sequentially as customers and distributors in many of these markets were able to rightsize inventories. However, they remain well below prior year levels. 
Price/mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix. Price alone was flat. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, declined 28% to $93 million. Lower sales volume, higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline. 
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 21% in the quarter. Volume declined 25%. Segments to smaller chain and independent full-service and quick-service restaurants tracked around 70% to 80% of prior year levels through much of October but slowed to 60% to 70% in November following governments reimposing social restrictions and as colder weather tempered restaurant traffic in some of our markets. 
Shipments to noncommercial customers improved modestly since summer but remain at around 50% of prior year levels, with strength in health care more than offset by continued weakness in the other channels. 
Price/mix increased 4% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of fiscal 2020. Mix continued to be unfavorable with some hard-hit independent restaurants looking to reduce costs by purchasing more value-added products rather than the premium Lamb Weston branded ones. While we've regained much of this business since the pandemic first struck last spring, on a year-over-year basis, it remains a mix headwind. 
Foodservice's product contribution margin declined 21% to $88 million. Lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline and was partially offset by favorable price. Sales for our retail segment increased 7% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 7%, primarily reflecting favorable mix benefit of selling more of our higher-margin branded portfolio of Alexa -- Alexia grown in Idaho and licensed restaurant trademarks. Volume increased nominally. Sales of our branded products were up about 30%, which is well above category growth rates, which ranged between 15% and 20%. The increase in our branded volume was offset by the loss of certain low-margin private label volume that began late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as an additional amount that began a couple of months ago. As a result, we expect private label losses to continue to be a headwind. 
Retail's product contribution margin increased 6% to $30 million. The increase was driven by favorable mix and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. 
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. We're comfortable with our liquidity position and confident in our ability to continue to generate cash. In the first half, we generated nearly $320 million of cash from operations, which is down about $25 million versus last year due to lower sales and earnings. We spent $54 million in CapEx, including expenditures for our new ERP system. We paid $67 million in dividends and a few weeks ago announced a 2% increase in our quarterly dividend. In addition, we plan to resume our share repurchase program this quarter. As you may recall, we temporarily suspended our buyback program in late fiscal 2020 in order to help preserve our liquidity during the early days of the pandemic. 
As we discussed in our previous earnings call, in September, we amended our credit agreement to put in place a new 3-year $750 million revolver. At the same time, using a portion of the more than $1 billion of cash on hand, we prepaid the approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was due in November of 2021. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $760 million of cash on hand and our new revolver was undrawn. Our total debt was $2.75 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.1x. 
Now turning to our shipments so far in the third quarter. Broadly speaking, in the U.S., demand at QSRs and at retail are holding up well while traffic at full-service restaurants continues to soften. Specifically, U.S. shipments in the 4 weeks ending December 27 were approximately 85% of prior year levels. In our global segments, shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain customers in the U.S. were more than 95% of prior year levels. We expect that rate will largely continue for the remainder of the third quarter. 
In our Foodservice segment, shipments to our full service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and noncommercial customers in aggregate were 60% to 65% of prior year levels. That is largely in line with what we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We anticipate that shipments to full-service restaurants and small and regional QSRs will continue to soften as social restrictions broaden and as winter weather takes a bigger bite out of outdoor dining. 
Shipments to noncommercial customers, which have historically comprised about 25% of the segment's volume were roughly half of prior year levels and will likely remain soft for the remainder of the quarter. 
In our retail segments, shipments were above prior year levels with strong volume of our branded products partially offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. We believe that this rate will largely continue for the remainder of the quarter. 
Outside the U.S., overall demand has slowed but is varied by market. In Europe, shipments by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture were approximately 85% of prior year levels, continuing the softer demand that we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We believe that shipments will continue to soften due to severe social restrictions and colder weather. Shipments to our other international markets, which primarily include Asia, Oceana, Latin America, were mixed. In aggregate, international shipments so far in the quarter have been softer than what we realized during the latter half of the second quarter. As a reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our global results. 
In short, other than U.S. at QSRs, which can leverage drive-through access, global demand for fries at restaurants and foodservice will be soft in the third quarter following government's reimposing restrictions to combat the resurgence of COVID as well as colder weather in our northern hemisphere markets limits outdoor dining opportunities. 
With respect to contract pricing, after completing discussions for contracts that were up for renewal, we expect pricing across our domestic large chain restaurant portfolio in aggregate to be flat versus prior year. Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts on balance, domestic pricing is holding up well. However, we continue to see increased competitive activity in more value-oriented products in some international markets and, to a lesser extent, in some value-tiered domestic market segments. 
With respect to costs, the potato crop in our growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Upper Midwest is consistent with historical averages in aggregate. We don't see any notable impact on cost outside of inflation. 
Crop in our growing areas in Europe is also broadly consistent with historical averages, which should help ease cost pressures there versus last year. However, we do expect to continue to incur additional cost as a result of COVID's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and supply chain operations and we expect that we'll continue to do so until the virus is broadly contained. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

And it's giving us visibility to opportunities, we believe, within the current manufacturing footprint to unlock capacity. So that's something that the supply chain team in Lamb Weston is focused on. We have a big initiative within supply chain to unlock capacity and drive efficiencies. 
And if you think about, Andrew, the timing of new capacity versus what we have in our current footprint, I'm 100% confident that with our supply chain initiative unlock hidden capacity in our current footprint that we're absolutely in a great position as demand returns to support not only our current customers as their business returns, but also future demand and category growth.

Now that said, we gave guidance on what's happening through December. And I think that's going to be where it plays out over the next 30, 60 days. We'd get through winter, things are going to open back up. The most important thing for us is to be prepared for the opening back up. And we learned a lot of lessons last spring as a management team and myself personally that we have to be ready. 
And what does that mean? It means if you think about April, May, we're taking some measures right now to ensure we've got the right inventory, the right products. So when demand snaps back, which we believe it will in the spring, and start increasing, we can service our customers, all the while recognize that we're still dealing with manufacturing operating issues because of COVID in terms of efficiencies. 
So on the one hand, while things are slowing down in some areas; on the other hand, it's a great opportunity for us to get ourselves positioned to meet demand when this thing snaps back. So the near term is going to be volatile. But as we come out, get to spring and summer and you got vaccines and this thing hopefully starts getting behind us, there's -- I believe there's going to be some pent-up demand for people to get out -- to go out and eat again.

The thing that we're working on right now is to make sure we got the right inventory levels of product that was really pulled when the economy opened back up in May, June. And so we've got data, and we can look and see what the customers, the products, they were -- we were shipping to them. So we're positioning those products to have a different level of safety stock, if you will, to anticipate that. And so I think we're in good shape from a finished good inventory, raw inventory. 
The thing to remember is the timing of -- whether it's April, May or June, the timing of consumer demand out -- going out to eat more or maybe it's further down the road, we'll manage it, and we can manage our production schedules. We can manage inventory levels. So there's things we can do and have done and always do just to manage the supply and demand side of it. And so I feel good about where we're at now.

And the implications of that is you just don't get the yield that we're used to based on it stores longer and it just doesn't perform in the factories as well as -- the longer you store it. 
So we're through all that. Going forward with the current crop in storage, we will process that on a normal time line as we have in previous years. So it was just a one-off thing.

We delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our entire Lamb Weston team continues to execute well through this challenging environment. That's only possible because of their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, suppliers and communities, and I can't thank them enough for their dedication and support. Our second quarter results also reflect operating conditions that were generally similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. Overall, restaurant traffic in the U.S. was resilient by holding steady at around 90% of pre-pandemic levels for much of the quarter. However, traffic and frozen potato demand rates continue to vary widely by channel. 
Traffic at large chain restaurants were essentially at prior year levels as quick-service restaurants continued to leverage drive-through, takeout and delivery formats. Traffic at full-service restaurants was 70% to 80% of prior year levels for much of the quarter. 
However, traffic began to soften in November as governments reimposed social and on-premise dining restrictions in an effort to contain the resurgence of COVID and as the onset of colder weather tempered outdoor dining opportunities across many markets. 
Traffic and demand at noncommercial customers, which includes lodging, hospitality, health care, schools and universities, sports and entertainment and workplace environment, was fairly steady at around 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter. In retail, consumer demand continued to be strong with weekly category volume growth between 15% and 20% versus the prior year. 
Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic and fry demand were uneven across markets and varied within the quarter. In Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, fry demand during much of the quarter was similar to last year but softened to 75% to 85% of prior year levels during the latter part of the quarter as governments reimposed social restriction and as the weather turned colder. As you may recall, unlike in the U.S., QSRs in Europe generally have only limited drive-through capabilities.
Demand in our other key international markets was mixed. In China and Australia, demand was near prior year levels. In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, overall demand improved sequentially from our first quarter but remained well below prior year levels. 
Going forward, we expect many of the softer traffic and demand trends that we began to see in November to carry over into our fiscal third quarter. The sharp resurgence of COVID in the U.S. and Europe has led governments to impose even more rigid social restrictions. In addition, we expect outdoor restaurant dining traffic in our largest markets to fall further as we enter the coldest months of the year in the northern hemisphere. Not surprisingly, we expect traffic at full-service restaurants will continue to be disproportionately affected. Major QSR chains in the U.S. should be able to continue to hold up well due to their ability to serve customers via drive-through and delivery. Retail should also benefit as consumers eat more meals at home. And as Rob will discuss later, while still early, our shipments to those channels in December support that view. 
So on the one hand, in the near term, we anticipate facing even more challenging and volatile operating conditions than what we experienced in the first half of our fiscal year. On the other hand, we believe this COVID-induced shock to demand is temporary. We're confident in the strength of the frozen potato category and do not see any structural impediments to recovery in demand and growth over the long term. 
As COVID vaccines become more widely available in the coming months and as the virus is more broadly contained, we expect governments will gradually lift social restrictions. This should lead to steady growth in restaurant traffic as the year progresses. We believe this growth will lead to overall frozen potato demand approaching pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. 
In the meantime, we're confident in our business fundamentals, the pricing, capacity utilization and potato supply and our ability to manage through the pandemic's impacts on our manufacturing operations. 
Our recently announced increase in our quarterly dividend and the planned resumption of our share repurchase program reinforce our conviction in the strength of our business and the category as well as our commitment to support customers and create value for our stakeholders. 
In summary, we delivered solid Q2 results and are executing well in a challenging environment. We expect frozen potato demand to soften in the near term due to reduced traffic following government reimposed social restrictions as well as the onset of colder weather. And we're optimistic that the increasing availability of COVID vaccines will enable restaurant traffic to gradually improve as the year progresses, and that demand will approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar 2021. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."

Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter as our teams continued to manage through an ever-changing demand environment as well as COVID-related disruptions to our manufacturing and distribution networks. For the quarter, net sales declined 12% to $896 million. Sales volume was down 14%, largely due to fry demand at restaurants and food service being negatively impacted following government-imposed restrictions to contain the spread of COVID as well as colder weather beginning to limit outdoor dining across many of our markets. In addition, volume was down as we lapped the benefit of additional shipping days related to the timing of Thanksgiving last year. 
Overall, as Tom described earlier, restaurant traffic and our sales volumes in the U.S. stabilized at approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels, although performance varied widely by sales channel. International sales were mixed but improved sequentially versus our first quarter. Price/mix increased 2% driven by improved price in our foodservice and retail segments as well as favorable mix in retail. Gross profit declined $62 million as lower sales and higher manufacturing costs more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix and productivity savings. 
As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we expected our manufacturing costs to increase in the quarter. This was partly due to processing potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual. We did this in order to manage finished goods inventories in light of the pandemic's impact on fry demand. Processing older crop results in increased cost due to significant -- due to higher raw material storage fees and lower recovery rates. Since we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory, we realized the impact of these costs in our second quarter income statement as we sold that inventory. 
We also realized higher manufacturing costs due to input cost inflation, primarily related to edible oils, raw potatoes and other raw ingredients. Overall, our input cost inflation was in the low single digits. 
Finally, we continue to realize incremental costs and inefficiencies resulting from the pandemic's disruptive effect on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. As a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other costs to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID; costs associated with modifying production schedules, reducing run times and manufacturing retail products online primarily designed for foodservice products; and costs for enhancing employee safety and sanitation protocols; as well as for incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs. 
Specifically in the quarter, we had notable disruptions in our facilities in Idaho as well as lesser ones in some other facilities. We expect to continue to incur COVID-related costs through at least the remainder of fiscal 2021. As a result, we consider these costs and disruptions as part of our ongoing operations and are no longer disclosing these costs separately. SG&A declined by nearly $8 million in the quarter, largely due to lower incentive compensation expense accruals and a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and promotional expense. The decline was partially offset by investments to improve our operations and IT infrastructure, which included about $5 million of nonrecurring consulting and training expenses associated with implementing Phase 1 of our new ERP system. 
Equity-method earnings were $19 million, which is up $4 million versus last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased about $2 million due to better performance by our European joint venture. However, like in the U.S., our shipments softened during the latter part of the quarter, reflecting the effect on restaurant traffic of governments reimposing social restrictions as well as colder weather on outdoor dining. 
EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $213 million, which is down $48 million. The decline was driven by lower income from operations and was partially offset by higher equity-method earnings. 
Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.66, down $0.29 largely due to lower income from operations. EPS was also down due to higher interest expense, reflecting our higher average total debt and the write-off of some debt issuance costs as we paid off a term loan a year early. The decline was partially offset by higher equity earnings. 
Moving to our segments. Sales for our global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100 North American-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were down 12% in the quarter. Volume was down 11% due to softer demand for fries outside the home, especially in our international markets. Shipments to large chain restaurant customers in the U.S., of which approximately 85% are to QSRs, approached prior year levels as QSRs leverage drive-through and delivery formats. However, some of that strength also reflected pulling forward sales of customized and limited time offering products from the third quarter. 
International sales, which historically comprised about 40% of segment sales, were at about 80% of prior year levels in the aggregate but varied by market. Shipments in China and Australia approached prior year levels. Our shipments to other parts of Asia and Latin America improved sequentially as customers and distributors in many of these markets were able to rightsize inventories. However, they remain well below prior year levels. 
Price/mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix. Price alone was flat. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, declined 28% to $93 million. Lower sales volume, higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline. 
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 21% in the quarter. Volume declined 25%. Segments to smaller chain and independent full-service and quick-service restaurants tracked around 70% to 80% of prior year levels through much of October but slowed to 60% to 70% in November following governments reimposing social restrictions and as colder weather tempered restaurant traffic in some of our markets. 
Shipments to noncommercial customers improved modestly since summer but remain at around 50% of prior year levels, with strength in health care more than offset by continued weakness in the other channels. 
Price/mix increased 4% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of fiscal 2020. Mix continued to be unfavorable with some hard-hit independent restaurants looking to reduce costs by purchasing more value-added products rather than the premium Lamb Weston branded ones. While we've regained much of this business since the pandemic first struck last spring, on a year-over-year basis, it remains a mix headwind. 
Foodservice's product contribution margin declined 21% to $88 million. Lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline and was partially offset by favorable price. Sales for our retail segment increased 7% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 7%, primarily reflecting favorable mix benefit of selling more of our higher-margin branded portfolio of Alexa -- Alexia grown in Idaho and licensed restaurant trademarks. Volume increased nominally. Sales of our branded products were up about 30%, which is well above category growth rates, which ranged between 15% and 20%. The increase in our branded volume was offset by the loss of certain low-margin private label volume that began late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as an additional amount that began a couple of months ago. As a result, we expect private label losses to continue to be a headwind. 
Retail's product contribution margin increased 6% to $30 million. The increase was driven by favorable mix and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. 
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. We're comfortable with our liquidity position and confident in our ability to continue to generate cash. In the first half, we generated nearly $320 million of cash from operations, which is down about $25 million versus last year due to lower sales and earnings. We spent $54 million in CapEx, including expenditures for our new ERP system. We paid $67 million in dividends and a few weeks ago announced a 2% increase in our quarterly dividend. In addition, we plan to resume our share repurchase program this quarter. As you may recall, we temporarily suspended our buyback program in late fiscal 2020 in order to help preserve our liquidity during the early days of the pandemic. 
As we discussed in our previous earnings call, in September, we amended our credit agreement to put in place a new 3-year $750 million revolver. At the same time, using a portion of the more than $1 billion of cash on hand, we prepaid the approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was due in November of 2021. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $760 million of cash on hand and our new revolver was undrawn. Our total debt was $2.75 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.1x. 
Now turning to our shipments so far in the third quarter. Broadly speaking, in the U.S., demand at QSRs and at retail are holding up well while traffic at full-service restaurants continues to soften. Specifically, U.S. shipments in the 4 weeks ending December 27 were approximately 85% of prior year levels. In our global segments, shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain customers in the U.S. were more than 95% of prior year levels. We expect that rate will largely continue for the remainder of the third quarter. 
In our Foodservice segment, shipments to our full service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and noncommercial customers in aggregate were 60% to 65% of prior year levels. That is largely in line with what we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We anticipate that shipments to full-service restaurants and small and regional QSRs will continue to soften as social restrictions broaden and as winter weather takes a bigger bite out of outdoor dining. 
Shipments to noncommercial customers, which have historically comprised about 25% of the segment's volume were roughly half of prior year levels and will likely remain soft for the remainder of the quarter. 
In our retail segments, shipments were above prior year levels with strong volume of our branded products partially offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. We believe that this rate will largely continue for the remainder of the quarter. 
Outside the U.S., overall demand has slowed but is varied by market. In Europe, shipments by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture were approximately 85% of prior year levels, continuing the softer demand that we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We believe that shipments will continue to soften due to severe social restrictions and colder weather. Shipments to our other international markets, which primarily include Asia, Oceana, Latin America, were mixed. In aggregate, international shipments so far in the quarter have been softer than what we realized during the latter half of the second quarter. As a reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our global results. 
In short, other than U.S. at QSRs, which can leverage drive-through access, global demand for fries at restaurants and foodservice will be soft in the third quarter following government's reimposing restrictions to combat the resurgence of COVID as well as colder weather in our northern hemisphere markets limits outdoor dining opportunities. 
With respect to contract pricing, after completing discussions for contracts that were up for renewal, we expect pricing across our domestic large chain restaurant portfolio in aggregate to be flat versus prior year. Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts on balance, domestic pricing is holding up well. However, we continue to see increased competitive activity in more value-oriented products in some international markets and, to a lesser extent, in some value-tiered domestic market segments. 
With respect to costs, the potato crop in our growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Upper Midwest is consistent with historical averages in aggregate. We don't see any notable impact on cost outside of inflation. 
Crop in our growing areas in Europe is also broadly consistent with historical averages, which should help ease cost pressures there versus last year. However, we do expect to continue to incur additional cost as a result of COVID's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and supply chain operations and we expect that we'll continue to do so until the virus is broadly contained. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

And it's giving us visibility to opportunities, we believe, within the current manufacturing footprint to unlock capacity. So that's something that the supply chain team in Lamb Weston is focused on. We have a big initiative within supply chain to unlock capacity and drive efficiencies. 
And if you think about, Andrew, the timing of new capacity versus what we have in our current footprint, I'm 100% confident that with our supply chain initiative unlock hidden capacity in our current footprint that we're absolutely in a great position as demand returns to support not only our current customers as their business returns, but also future demand and category growth.

I don't believe it's going to be anywhere near it was when all this thing started. 
Now that said, we gave guidance on what's happening through December. And I think that's going to be where it plays out over the next 30, 60 days. We'd get through winter, things are going to open back up. The most important thing for us is to be prepared for the opening back up. And we learned a lot of lessons last spring as a management team and myself personally that we have to be ready. 
And what does that mean? It means if you think about April, May, we're taking some measures right now to ensure we've got the right inventory, the right products. So when demand snaps back, which we believe it will in the spring, and start increasing, we can service our customers, all the while recognize that we're still dealing with manufacturing operating issues because of COVID in terms of efficiencies. 
So on the one hand, while things are slowing down in some areas; on the other hand, it's a great opportunity for us to get ourselves positioned to meet demand when this thing snaps back. So the near term is going to be volatile. But as we come out, get to spring and summer and you got vaccines and this thing hopefully starts getting behind us, there's -- I believe there's going to be some pent-up demand for people to get out -- to go out and eat again.

The thing that we're working on right now is to make sure we got the right inventory levels of product that was really pulled when the economy opened back up in May, June. And so we've got data, and we can look and see what the customers, the products, they were -- we were shipping to them. So we're positioning those products to have a different level of safety stock, if you will, to anticipate that. And so I think we're in good shape from a finished good inventory, raw inventory. 
The thing to remember is the timing of -- whether it's April, May or June, the timing of consumer demand out -- going out to eat more or maybe it's further down the road, we'll manage it, and we can manage our production schedules. We can manage inventory levels. So there's things we can do and have done and always do just to manage the supply and demand side of it. And so I feel good about where we're at now.

And again, as Tom talked about, in terms of the capacity unlocked, the supply chain team is working on. While we haven't spent the capital for a new line per se, the guys just figuring out some ways to get some capital out. So if you think about that, the ability to service that capacity, I think our international sales team is well set up and well positioned. And we've talked about our Foodservice sales team with that direct sales model that went to being in a favored position relative to maybe some of our competitors who are more broker-oriented that adjusted their service model a little bit, their cost to that.

And the implications of that is you just don't get the yield that we're used to based on it stores longer and it just doesn't perform in the factories as well as -- the longer you store it. 
So we're through all that. Going forward with the current crop in storage, we will process that on a normal time line as we have in previous years. So it was just a one-off thing.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid sales volumes in the third quarter as restaurant traffic and consumer demand improved as governments gradually ease social and on-premise dining restriction in some markets. While still down year-over-year, the rate of volume decline improved sequentially in both the U.S. and in our key international markets from what we realized during the first half of our fiscal year. Again, this was largely in response to government's easing restrictions as the quarter progressed and demonstrates that consumers are ready to go out as restaurants expand dining capacity. Specifically, overall restaurant traffic in the U.S. was between 85% and 90% of pre-pandemic levels. Traffic at large quick service chain restaurants continued at roughly prior year levels as they leverage drive-through takeout and delivery formats. After a slow start to the quarter, traffic at full-service restaurants recovered to 70% to 80% of prior year levels. 
Traffic began to pick up later in the quarter as some governments gradually lifted social and dining restrictions that were put in place due to the resurgence of COVID and as a relatively mild winter weather provided more outdoor dining opportunities. While we expect this momentum will continue, we're mindful that some of this performance may be due to customers and distributors restocking inventory prior to unexpected boom and restaurant traffic in coming months. In contrast, demand at noncommercial customers, which includes lodging and hospitality, health care, schools and university, sports and entertainment and workplace environments, remained around 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter. We're confident that demand from these customers will return, but realize a recovery to pre-pandemic levels may take some time as government slowly lift restrictions for larger gatherings. In retail, demand in the quarter was strong with weekly category volume at 115% to 125% of prior year levels as consumers continue to eat more meals at home. 
Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic and fry demand has been mixed. In Europe, which is served by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, fry demand in the quarter was 80% to 85% of prior year levels. However, we believe that demand rate is likely to soften as governments reimpose severe social restrictions in response to the resurgence of COVID infections. Demand in most of our international markets in Asia, Oceana and Latin America improved in the quarter. Our shipments in China were strong. Demand in our other key markets in the aggregate remained below prior year levels but continued to improve sequentially versus the first half of the year as well as in each month of the quarter. So while demand in Europe remains soft, we feel good about the demand trends in the U.S. in most of our key international markets. And we expect governments will continue to gradually roll back social restrictions in the months ahead as more other citizens get access to vaccines. This should serve to unlock pent-up consumer demand to visit restaurants and other foodservice outlets and ultimately demand for fries. As a result, we remain optimistic that overall frozen potato demand will steadily approach pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. 
The progress remained on sales volume in the quarter was offset by the pandemics continued effect on our supply chain operations. As Rob will discuss later, COVID-related disruptions significantly affected our production, transportation and warehousing networks, leading to significantly higher costs as we focused on customer service while dealing with the pandemic's impact in some of our communities of workforce. 
In addition, decisions that we made in the first half of the year to defer certain capital repair and maintenance projects further reduce our flexibility to manage disruptions and drove incremental manufacturing and distribution costs. 
So in summary, in the third quarter, we delivered solid top line results. Operating in the pandemic environment has been and will continue to be challenged, and we expect it will continue to incur higher costs across our supply chain in the near term. 
Before I turn the call over to Rob, let me review a couple of items. First, we'll provide our normal update for this year's potato crop when we report earnings in July and October. Second, as you may have seen a couple of weeks ago, we announced that we're building a new french fry processing facility in China at a total investment of around $250 million. This greenfield facility will complement our planned change and is expected to add about 250 million pounds of frozen potato product capacity. We anticipate starting up the plant sometime during the back half of calendar 2023. 
We chose to build this plant in China because it's a fast-growing 1 billion pound plus market and a key driver to our international growth. This new plant enables us to support customers in China using in-country supply which is something that our larger customers there increasingly want as they continue to expand. In addition, our new facility will allow us to further diversify our manufacturing base and mitigate risks of potential trade disruptions as we look to drive international growth. 
So in summary, in the third quarter, we delivered solid top line results as demand continued to gradually recover, but incremental costs related to pandemic-related disruptions pressured earnings. We expect that the increasing availability of Cove vaccines and the easing of government-imposed social restrictions will allow restaurant traffic to gradually improve as the year progresses. And we remain optimistic that overall frozen potato demand will approach pre pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."
374372246,706485433,2247981,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 07, 2021",2021-04-07,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, in the third quarter, we delivered solid sales results as overall demand continued to improve with the pandemic's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations significantly increased",2679,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, in the third quarter, we delivered solid sales results as overall demand continued to improve with the pandemic's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations significantly increased our costs. 
Specifically in the quarter, net sales declined 4% to $896 million. Sales volume was down 6%, largely due to the pandemic impact on fry demand, but improved through the quarter after a slow start. Importantly, that rate of volume decline improved sequentially from the 14% decline that we realized during the first half of fiscal 2021. Most of the sequential improvement was within our global segment and largely reflects a steady recovery in shipments in our key international markets. Stronger sales of limited time offering products in the U.S. also contributed to the Global segment's recovery. 
In addition, we saw a sequential improvement in our Foodservice segment, led by casual dining as well as continued strength by our branded offerings in our Retail segment. 
Price/mix increased 2%, improved price in our Retail and Foodservice segments as well as favorable mix in Retail, drove the increase. Price was up in our Global segment, although this was offset by negative mix. Gross profit declined $54 million as lower sales and higher manufacturing and distribution costs more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix and productivity savings. 
Let's focus on cost of goods sold. As Tom noted, the higher costs were largely a result of the pandemic's disruptive impact across our supply chain. The resurgence of COVID in many of the communities where our plants are located, greatly affected our manufacturing workforce. At times, the combination of infected and quarantine employees significantly affected our ability to staff production lines and other key roles at a number of our facilities. 
The consequences were: first, we lost days of production, which resulted in a number of our plants operating well below normal utilization rates and reduced our ability to cover fixed overhead costs. In addition, recall that a year ago, we decided to continue paying employees despite production lines being down due to covet. While we believe that was the right thing to do to support our production teams, it has had an impact on our cost structure. 
Second, focusing on maintaining customer service levels required us to quickly adjust production schedules to accommodate workforce and manufacturing line availability. This drove incremental costs and efficiencies. In many cases, we shifted production from one facility to another even though the alternate facility may not be the most effective in terms of cost or throughput for that specific product. That negatively impacted line speeds throughput and raw potato recovery rates. 
And third, the number of effective employees and facilities meant that we incurred even more costs related to temporary shutdown and restart of manufacturing facilities. Compounding these disruptions in the quarter were our decisions to defer certain capital repair and maintenance projects on our production lines that were originally scheduled for the first half of fiscal 2021. We planned on undertaking these capital and maintenance projects once the demand environment and our operations were more stable during the second half of the year. While deferring these projects was prudent in light of the uncertainty surrounding COVID, executing them at same time as another COVID wave impacted our plants led to additional disruption in our manufacturing capabilities and further limited our flexibility to adjust production schedules across our network. This drove additional costs and inefficiencies on top of the staffing-related issues I described. 
The pandemic induced volatility of our production facilities also had a downstream impact on our transportation and warehousing operations. We generally prefer to rely on rail more than trucking to move product from our production facilities and warehouses to our distribution centers and customers across the country. However, late changes to production schedules required us to switch significant volume from rail to trucking, which is more flexible, but also higher cost in an effort to maintain customer service levels. 
In addition, we typically employ trucks using contracted carrier rates as opposed to securing spot trucking, which tends to be higher cost. Spot trucking has also had significant rate increases over the past 6 months, but because of the disruption to our production schedules and again to prioritize customer service, we lean more on expensive spot trucking. So our transportation costs significantly increased because of an unfavorable mix of rail and trucking as well as an unfavorable mix of contracted and spot trucking. As you would expect, our warehousing costs also increased with the additional handling required across our distribution network. 
Finally, while the pandemic-related effects on our supply chain were the primary drivers of our cost increases, we also realized higher costs due to input cost inflation in the low single digits. We expect that rate will begin to tick up in the coming quarters as edible oil and transportation costs continue to increase. While our costs were higher in the quarter, we are starting to see the benefits of our supply chain team's work around a series of initiatives we call Win As One. These initiatives build upon the Lamb Weston operating culture productivity programs that we have in place. 
Broadly speaking, Win As One seeks ways to reduce our variable and fixed cost, increase production throughput on existing assets and improved working capital, especially inventories. In the couple of the plants where the team has implemented these new ways of working, asset utilization is at or above pre-pandemic utilization rates, and we're seeing the benefit in the cost structures in those facilities. As the team continues to roll out these programs to the rest of the network and as infection and quarantine rates decline through vaccination programs we're supporting for our production employees, we expect our cost structure and utilization rates will begin to normalize. Longer term, we expect these initiatives to enhance margins, drive cash flow and strengthen our culture of continuous improvement. Since we only began to roll out Win As One at a couple of our plants a few months ago, we're not providing any specifics on activities or targets today. We anticipate giving investors more insight into this program as we gain more traction. 
Moving to the segments -- moving on from cost of sales, excuse me. Our SG&A increased $8 million in the quarter. The increase was largely due to investments we're making behind the Win As One initiatives I just described. Equity method earnings were $11 million. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments and a comparability item in the prior year quarter, equity earnings declined about $11 million. 2 factors drove the decline: first, dry demand in Europe fell as much of the region remained in lockdown and as colder weather affected outdoor dining; second, our joint ventures also realized higher production costs related to COVID, disrupting their manufacturing and distribution operations. 
Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $167 million, which is down $61 million. Lower income from operations drove the decline. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.45, which is down $0.32, mostly due to lower income from operations. EPS was also down due to higher interest expense, reflecting our higher average total debt resulting from actions we took to in late fiscal 2020 and early fiscal 2021 to enhance our liquidity position. 
Now moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100 North American-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were down 2% in the quarter. Volume was down only 2%, which is much better than the minus 12% we realized during the first half of fiscal 2021. Shipments to large chain restaurant customers in the U.S., of which approximately 85% are to QSRs, increased nominally versus prior year. QSRs continued to perform well, as they continue to leverage drive-thru and delivery formats. As I mentioned earlier, U.S. QSRs were also aided by the return of some noteworthy limited time off product offerings. 
International shipments, which historically comprise about 40% of the segment's volume or about 95% of prior year levels in the aggregate, that's up from around 75% of prior year levels that we realized during the first half of fiscal 2021. In the third quarter, shipments in China were strong versus the prior year when demand was negatively impacted by COVID. Shipments to our other key markets strengthened as the quarter progressed and were generally stronger in developed markets than emerging ones. 
Price/mix was flat with positive price offset by unfavorable mix. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, declined 27% to $79 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution costs as well as unfavorable mix drove the decline. 
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 22%. Volume declined 24%. After a slow start, shipments to smaller chain and independent full-service and quick service restaurants recovered to about 90% of prior year levels for the entire quarter as governments gradually ease social and indoor dining restrictions. We believe that some of the sales volumes strengthening during the last few weeks of the quarter may reflect distributors restocking inventory in anticipation of more governments lifting social restrictions in the spring. However, it's difficult to gauge the extent of that benefit. In contrast, shipments to noncommercial customers remained at around 50% of prior year levels, with continued strength in health care, more than offset by weakness in the other channels such as travel, hospitality and education. 
Price/mix increased 2% behind the carryover pricing benefit of pricing actions we took in the second half of fiscal 2020. This was partially offset by unfavorable mix versus the prior year due to lower sales of premium products. As we've discussed in previous earnings calls, we've regained much of this business since pandemic first struk by spring, but on a year-over-year basis, it remained a mix headwind for the quarter. 
Foodservice's product contribution margin declined 30% to $70 million. Lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing and distribution costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline, and was partially offset by favorable price. 
Sales for our Retail segment increased 23%, with volume up 13%. Sales of our branded portfolio, which include Alexia, Grown In Idaho and licensed restaurant trademarks, were up about 45%, continuing the strong growth trend we've seen since the start of the pandemic and well above category volume growth rates that have been between 15% and 25% in the quarter. The increase in our branded volume was partially offset by the loss of certain low-margin private label volume, which will continue to be a headwind on volume through the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Price/mix increased 10%, primarily reflecting the favorable mix benefit of selling more of our higher-margin branded products. Retail's product contribution margin increased 15% to $33 million. The increase was driven by favorable mix and was partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs as well as a $1 million increase in advertising and promotional expense. 
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. We continue to be comfortable with our liquidity position and confident in our ability to continue to generate cash. At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly $715 million of cash on hand, and our revolver was undrawn. Our total debt was more than $2.7 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 3.5x. 
In the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2021, we generated nearly $375 million of cash from operations, which is down about $60 million versus last year due to lower sales and earnings. We spent $107 million in CapEx and paid $101 million in dividends. In addition, in the third quarter, we resumed our share buyback program and bought back nearly $13 million worth of stock at an average price of just over $77 per share. 
Now turning to our current shipment trends. Please note that instead of providing a comparison to last fiscal year's fourth quarter, we're providing comparisons to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. We're doing this since fourth quarter fiscal 2020, which includes March, April and May of 2020, includes a severe impact of government-imposed social restrictions at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. It was also the height of personal and economic uncertainty for many businesses and individuals. As such, we believe the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 provides a more meaningful comparison for investors to understand the current condition of our business. Broadly speaking, we're optimistic about the recent restaurant traffic and significant shipment trends in the U.S. and many of our key international markets, other than Europe. 
U.S. shipments in the 4 weeks ending March 28 were approximately 90% of levels during a similar period for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. In our Global segment, shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain restaurant customers in the U.S. were more than the 85% of fiscal 2019 levels, and we expect that rate will largely continue for the remainder of the fourth quarter. 
In our Foodservice segment, shipments to our full service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and noncommercial customers in aggregate were approximately 90% of fiscal 2019 levels. We anticipate that shipments for these customers will largely continue at a similar rate for the remainder of the fourth quarter. Shipments to noncommercial customers, which have historically comprised about 25% of the segment's volume, remained at around half of fiscal 2019 levels. We expect these shipment rates will likely remain soft for the rest of the quarter and will likely take time to fully recover from -- to pre-pandemic levels. 
In our Retail segment, shipments were approximately 110% of fiscal 2019 levels, with strong volume growth of our branded products, partially offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. We believe this rate may gradually decline during the remainder of the fourth quarter as consumers begin to shift purchases of fries to dining at restaurants as governments lift social restrictions. 
Outside the U.S., overall demand varies by market. In Europe, shipments by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture were about 85% of fiscal 2019 levels. Demand has softened over the past few months as governments in some of our larger markets such as Italy and France, reimposed stricter social restrictions to combat resurgence in COVID infections. In addition, other than in the U.K., vaccination efforts across Europe have lagged well behind rates in the U.S. As a result, we anticipate shipments may slow during the remainder of the fourth quarter. 
Shipments to our other international markets, which primarily include Asia, Oceania and Latin America, were approximately 75% of fiscal 2019 levels in aggregate. As I discussed earlier, international shipment rates have steadily improved over the past few months, and we expect that will continue during the remainder of the fourth quarter as governments slowly ease social restrictions and as the current congestion at shipping ports begins to clear up. For those markets that are currently already operating under more lenient social restrictions, we anticipate that current shipment rates for those countries will largely remain at current levels. 
In short, although Europe is challenging, we believe overall shipment and restaurant trends in the U.S. and most of our international markets will remain favorable as governments continue to roll back social restrictions and vaccine becomes more widely available. These trends will keep us on a path of steady progress in restaurant traffic, which we believe will lead to overall frozen potato demand approaching pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. 
With respect to costs, in the fourth quarter, we expect to incur a similar level of incremental pandemic-related manufacturing and distribution costs as we did in the third quarter. We experienced significant disruption in our production facilities transportation warehousing networks in January and February, and this continued into March. We will realize some of the costs related to these disruptions in the fourth quarter as we ship finished goods inventory produced during these months. 
Now here's Tom for closing comments."

In terms of quantifying it, again, we did stop breaking that out as a specific as we viewed it as more normal, I think we started that in Q2, I believe. But the way I would think about it is that you know what pricing has done. We've got modest input cost inflation. And so if you go back historically and look at margins, that would give you a sense of what margin should be in a normalized ex the COVID cost. And I would argue that the bulk of any margin difference there is going to be related to the COVID cost. And so I think you can back into it that way and come pretty close. 
In terms of bleeding into Q1, again, it's going to depend on how quickly we can get people in plants vaccinated and back to normal production and operating schedules. Again, we see demand recovering, as we've said, by the end of calendar 2021 to pre-COVID levels. And so as you think about that, that tells you the operating -- the pull on the demand side ought to be there. And so it's back to, as long as we can get people in plants to operate the plants, we should, over time, get cost back to where they are. But again, that will take some time to get people vaccinated, get them back into plants and stabilize all of that. So I anticipate that certainly into Q4, and we'll probably have some bleed over into Q1 as well."

On the transportation side, again, the shifting around from rail to truck and more spot trucking and so forth, that's temporary as well, driven off of that same issue. But I would point that there is generally transportation cost inflation going on. And so as we go, we contract freight for the coming periods, I think we, like everybody else, are going to see freight costs to increase."

Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid sales volumes in the third quarter as restaurant traffic and consumer demand improved as governments gradually ease social and on-premise dining restriction in some markets. While still down year-over-year, the rate of volume decline improved sequentially in both the U.S. and in our key international markets from what we realized during the first half of our fiscal year. Again, this was largely in response to governments easing restrictions as the quarter progressed and demonstrates that consumers are ready to go out as restaurants expand dining capacity. 
Specifically, overall restaurant traffic in the U.S. was between 85% and 90% of pre-pandemic levels. Traffic at large quick service chain restaurants continued at roughly prior year levels as they leverage drive-thru, takeout and delivery formats. After a slow start to the quarter, traffic at full-service restaurants recovered to 70% to 80% of prior year levels. 
Traffic began to pick up later in the quarter as some governments gradually lifted social and dining restrictions that were put in place due to the resurgence of COVID and as a relatively mild winter weather provided more outdoor dining opportunities. While we expect this momentum will continue, we're mindful that some of this performance may be due to customers and distributors restocking inventories prior to an expected boom in restaurant traffic in coming months. 
In contrast, demand at noncommercial customers, which includes lodging and hospitality, health care, schools and university, sports and entertainment and workplace environments, remained around 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter. We're confident that demand from these customers will return, but realize that recovery to pre-pandemic levels may take some time as government slowly lift restrictions for larger gatherings. 
In retail, demand in the quarter was strong with weekly category volume at 115% to 125% of prior year levels as consumers continue to eat more meals at home. 
Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic and fry demand has been mixed. In Europe, which is served by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, fry demand in the quarter was 80% to 85% of prior year levels. However, we believe that demand rate is likely to soften as governments reimpose severe social restrictions in response to the resurgence of COVID infections. 
Demand in most of our international markets in Asia, Oceania and Latin America improved in the quarter. Our shipments in China were strong. Demand in our other key markets in the aggregate remained below prior year levels but continued to improve sequentially versus the first half of the year as well as in each month of the quarter. 
So while demand in Europe remains soft, we feel good about the demand trends in the U.S. and most of our key international markets. And we expect governments will continue to gradually roll back social restrictions in the months ahead as more of their citizens get access to vaccines. This should serve to unlock pent-up consumer demand to visit restaurants and other foodservice outlets and ultimately demand for fries. 
As a result, we remain optimistic that overall frozen potato demand will steadily approach pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. 
The progress we made on sales volume in the quarter was offset by the pandemic's continued effect on our supply chain operations. As Rob will discuss later, COVID-related disruptions significantly affected our production, transportation and warehousing networks, leading to significantly higher costs as we focused on customer service while dealing with the pandemic's impact in some of our communities and workforce. In addition, decisions that we made in the first half of the year to defer certain capital repair and maintenance projects further reduce our flexibility to manage disruptions and drove incremental manufacturing and distribution costs. 
So in summary, in the third quarter, we delivered solid top line results. Operating in the pandemic environment has been and will continue to be challenged, and we expect it will continue to incur higher costs across our supply chain in the near term. 
Before I turn the call over to Rob, let me review a couple of items. First, we'll provide our normal update for this year's potato crop when we report earnings in July and October. Second, as you may have seen a couple of weeks ago, we announced that we're building a new french fry processing facility in China at a total investment of around $250 million. This greenfield facility will complement our plant in Shangdu and is expected to add about 250 million pounds of frozen potato product capacity. We anticipate starting up the plant sometime during the back half of calendar 2023. 
We chose to build this plant in China because it's a fast-growing 1 billion-pound-plus market and a key driver to our international growth. This new plant enables us to support customers in China using in-country supply which is something that our larger customers there increasingly want as they continue to expand. In addition, our new facility will allow us to further diversify our manufacturing base and mitigate risks of potential trade disruptions as we look to drive international growth. 
So in summary, in the third quarter, we delivered solid top line results as demand continued to gradually recover, but incremental costs related to pandemic-related disruptions pressured earnings. We expect that the increasing availability of COVID vaccines and the easing of government-imposed social restrictions will allow restaurant traffic to gradually improve as the year progresses. And we remain optimistic that overall frozen potato demand will approach pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."

Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, in the third quarter, we delivered solid sales results as overall demand continued to improve with the pandemic's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations significantly increased",2677,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, in the third quarter, we delivered solid sales results as overall demand continued to improve with the pandemic's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations significantly increased our costs. 
Specifically in the quarter, net sales declined 4% to $896 million. Sales volume was down 6%, largely due to the pandemic's impact on fry demand, but improved through the quarter after a slow start. Importantly, that rate of volume decline improved sequentially from the 14% decline that we realized during the first half of fiscal 2021. Most of the sequential improvement was within our Global segment and largely reflects a steady recovery in shipments in our key international markets. Stronger sales of limited-time offering products in the U.S. also contributed to the Global segment's recovery. 
In addition, we saw a sequential improvement in our Foodservice segment, led by casual dining as well as continued strength by our branded offerings in our Retail segment. 
Price/mix increased 2%. Improved price in our Retail and Foodservice segments as well as favorable mix in Retail drove the increase. Price was up in our Global segment, although this was offset by negative mix. Gross profit declined $54 million as lower sales and higher manufacturing and distribution costs more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix and productivity savings. 
Let's focus on cost of goods sold. As Tom noted, the higher costs were largely a result of the pandemic's disruptive impact across our supply chain. The resurgence of COVID in many of the communities where our plants are located greatly affected our manufacturing workforce. At times, the combination of infected and quarantined employees significantly affected our ability to staff production lines and other key roles at a number of our facilities. 
The consequences were: first, we lost days of production, which resulted in a number of our plants operating well below normal utilization rates and reduced our ability to cover fixed overhead costs. In addition, recall that a year ago, we decided to continue paying employees despite production lines being down due to COVID. While we believe that was the right thing to do to support our production teams, it has had an impact on our cost structure. 
Second, focusing on maintaining customer service levels required us to quickly adjust production schedules to accommodate workforce and manufacturing line availability. This drove incremental costs and inefficiencies. In many cases, we shifted production from one facility to another even though the alternate facility may not be the most effective in terms of cost or throughput for that specific product. That negatively impacted line speeds throughput and raw potato recovery rates. 
And third, the number of effective (sic) [ affected ] employees and facilities meant that we incurred even more costs related to temporary shutdown and restart of manufacturing facilities. Compounding these disruptions in the quarters were our decisions to defer certain capital repair and maintenance projects on our production lines that were originally scheduled for the first half of fiscal 2021. We planned on undertaking these capital and maintenance projects once the demand environment and our operations were more stable during the second half of the year. While deferring these projects was prudent in light of the uncertainty surrounding COVID, executing them that same time as another COVID wave impacted our plants led to additional disruption in our manufacturing capabilities and further limited our flexibility to adjust production schedules across our network. This drove additional costs and inefficiencies on top of the staffing-related issues I described. 
The pandemic-induced volatility on our production facilities also had a downstream impact on our transportation and warehousing operations. We generally prefer to rely on rail more than trucking to move product from our production facilities and warehouses to our distribution centers and customers across the country. However, late changes to production schedules required us to switch significant volume from rail to trucking, which is more flexible but also higher cost, in an effort to maintain customer service levels. 
In addition, we typically employ trucks using contracted carrier rates as opposed to securing spot trucking, which tends to be higher cost. Spot trucking has also had significant rate increases over the past 6 months, but because of the disruption to our production schedules, and again, to prioritize customer service, we lean more on expensive spot trucking. So our transportation costs significantly increased because of an unfavorable mix of rail and trucking as well as an unfavorable mix of contracted and spot trucking. As you would expect, our warehousing costs also increased with the additional handling required across our distribution network. 
Finally, while the pandemic-related effects on our supply chain were the primary drivers of our cost increases, we also realized higher costs due to input cost inflation in the low single digits. We expect that rate will begin to tick up in the coming quarters as edible oil and transportation costs continue to increase. While our costs were higher in the quarter, we are starting to see the benefits of our supply chain team's work around a series of initiatives we call [ Win As One ]. These initiatives build upon the Lamb Weston operating culture productivity programs that we have in place. Broadly speaking, Win As One seeks ways to reduce our variable and fixed cost, increase production throughput on existing assets and improve working capital, especially inventories. In the couple of the plants where the team has implemented these new ways of working, asset utilization is at or above pre-pandemic utilization rates, and we're seeing the benefit in the cost structures in those facilities. 
As the team continues to roll out these programs to the rest of the network and as infection and quarantine rates decline through vaccination programs we're supporting for our production employees, we expect our cost structure and utilization rates will begin to normalize. Longer term, we expect these initiatives to enhance margins, drive cash flow and strengthen our culture of continuous improvement. Since we only began to roll out Win As One at a couple of our plants a few months ago, we're not providing any specifics on activities or targets today. We anticipate giving investors more insight into this program as we gain more traction. 
Moving to the segments -- moving onto cost of sales, excuse me. Our SG&A increased $8 million in the quarter. The increase was largely due to investments we're making behind the Win As One initiatives I just described. Equity method earnings were $11 million. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments and a comparability item in the prior year quarter, equity earnings declined about $11 million. Two factors drove the decline: first, dry demand in Europe fell as much of the region remained in lockdown and as colder weather affected outdoor dining; second, our joint ventures also realized higher production costs related to COVID, disrupting their manufacturing and distribution operations. 
Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $167 million, which is down $61 million. Lower income from operations drove the decline. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.45, which is down $0.32, mostly due to lower income from operations. EPS was also down due to higher interest expense, reflecting our higher average total debt resulting from actions we took to in late fiscal 2020 and early fiscal 2021 to enhance our liquidity position. 
Now moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100 North American-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were down 2% in the quarter. Volume was down only 2%, which is much better than the minus 12% we realized during the first half of fiscal 2021. Shipments to large chain restaurant customers in the U.S., of which approximately 85% are to QSRs, increased nominally versus prior year. QSRs continued to perform well,as they continue to leverage drive-thru and delivery formats. As I mentioned earlier, U.S. QSRs were also aided by the return of some noteworthy limited-time product offerings. 
International shipments, which historically comprise about 40% of the segment's volume were about 95% of prior year levels in the aggregate, that's up from around 75% of prior year levels that we realized during the first half of fiscal 2021. In the third quarter, shipments in China were strong versus the prior year when demand was negatively impacted by COVID. Shipments to our other key markets strengthened as the quarter progressed and were generally stronger in developed markets than emerging ones. 
Price/mix was flat with positive price offset by unfavorable mix. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, declined 27% to $79 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution costs as well as unfavorable mix drove the decline. 
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 22%. Volume declined 24%. After a slow start, shipments to smaller chain and independent full-service and quick service restaurants recovered to about 90% of prior year levels for the entire quarter as governments gradually ease social and indoor dining restrictions. We believe that some of the sales volumes strengthening during the last few weeks of the quarter may reflect distributors restocking inventory in anticipation of more governments lifting social restrictions in the spring. However, it's difficult to gauge the extent of that benefit. In contrast, shipments to noncommercial customers remained at around 50% of prior year levels, with continued strength in health care more than offset by weakness in the other channels such as travel, hospitality and education. 
Price/mix increased 2% behind the carryover pricing benefit of pricing actions we took in the second half of fiscal 2020. This was partially offset by unfavorable mix versus the prior year due to lower sales of premium products. As we've discussed in previous earnings calls, we've regained much of this business since pandemic first struck last spring, but on a year-over-year basis, it remained a mix headwind for the quarter. 
Foodservice's product contribution margin declined 30% to $70 million. Lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing and distribution costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline, and was partially offset by favorable price. 
Sales for our Retail segment increased 23%, with volume up 13%. Sales of our branded portfolio, which include Alexia, Grown In Idaho and licensed restaurant trademarks, were up about 45%, continuing the strong growth trend we've seen since the start of the pandemic and well above category volume growth rates that have been between 15% and 25% in the quarter. The increase in our branded volume was partially offset by the loss of certain low-margin private label volume, which will continue to be a headwind on volume through the remainder of the fiscal year. Price/mix increased 10%, primarily reflecting the favorable mix benefit of selling more of our higher-margin branded products. 
Retail's product contribution margin increased 15% to $33 million. The increase was driven by favorable mix and was partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs as well as a $1 million increase in advertising and promotional expense. 
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. We continue to be comfortable with our liquidity position and confident in our ability to continue to generate cash. At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly $715 million of cash on hand, and our revolver was undrawn. Our total debt was more than $2.7 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 3.5x. 
In the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2021, we generated nearly $375 million of cash from operations, which is down about $60 million versus last year due to lower sales and earnings. We spent $107 million in CapEx and paid $101 million in dividends. In addition, in the third quarter, we resumed our share buyback program and bought back nearly $13 million worth of stock at an average price of just over $77 per share. 
Now turning to our current shipment trends. Please note that instead of providing a comparison to last fiscal year's fourth quarter, we're providing comparisons to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. We're doing this since fourth quarter fiscal 2020, which includes March, April and May of 2020, includes the severe impact of government-imposed social restrictions at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. It was also the height of personal and economic uncertainty for many businesses and individuals. As such, we believe the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 provides a more meaningful comparison for investors to understand the current condition of our business. 
Broadly speaking, we're optimistic about the recent restaurant traffic and shipment trends in the U.S. and many of our key international markets, other than Europe. U.S. shipments in the 4 weeks ending March 28 were approximately 90% of levels during a similar period for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. 
In our Global segment, shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain restaurant customers in the U.S. were more than the 85% of fiscal 2019 levels, and we expect that rate will largely continue for the remainder of the fourth quarter. 
In our Foodservice segment, shipments to our full-service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and noncommercial customers in aggregate were approximately 90% of fiscal 2019 levels. We anticipate that shipments for these customers will largely continue at a similar rate for the remainder of the fourth quarter. Shipments to noncommercial customers, which have historically comprised about 25% of the segment's volume, remained at around half of fiscal 2019 levels. We expect these shipment rates will likely remain soft for the rest of the quarter and will likely take time to fully recover from -- to pre-pandemic levels. 
In our Retail segment, shipments were approximately 110% of fiscal 2019 levels, with strong volume growth of our branded products, partially offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. We believe this rate may gradually decline during the remainder of the fourth quarter as consumers begin to shift purchases of fries to dining at restaurants as governments lift social restrictions. 
Outside the U.S., overall demand varies by market. In Europe, shipments by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture were about 85% of fiscal 2019 levels. Demand has softened over the past few months as governments in some of our larger markets such as Italy and France reimposed stricter social restrictions to combat resurgence in COVID infections. In addition, other than in the U.K., vaccination efforts across Europe have lagged well behind rates in the U.S. As a result, we anticipate shipments may slow during the remainder of the fourth quarter. 
Shipments to our other international markets, which primarily include Asia, Oceania and Latin America, were approximately 75% of fiscal 2019 levels in aggregate. As I discussed earlier, international shipment rates have steadily improved over the past few months, and we expect that will continue during the remainder of the fourth quarter as governments slowly ease social restrictions and as the current congestion at shipping ports begins to clear up. For those markets that are currently already operating under more lenient social restrictions, we anticipate that current shipment rates for those countries will largely remain at current levels. 
In short, although Europe is challenging, we believe overall shipment and restaurant trends in the U.S. and most of our international markets will remain favorable as governments continue to roll back social restrictions and vaccine becomes more widely available. These trends will keep us on a path of steady progress in restaurant traffic, which we believe will lead to overall frozen potato demand approaching pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. 
With respect to costs, in the fourth quarter, we expect to incur a similar level of incremental pandemic-related manufacturing and distribution costs as we did in the third quarter. We experienced significant disruption in our production facility's transportation warehousing networks in January and February, and this continued into March. We will realize some of the costs related to these disruptions in the fourth quarter as we ship finished goods inventory produced during these months. 
Now here's Tom for closing comments."

But the way I would think about it is that you know what pricing has done. You know we've got modest input cost inflation. And so if you go back historically and look at margins, that would give you a sense of what margin should be in a normalized -- ex the COVID cost. And I would argue that the bulk of any margin difference there is going to be related to the COVID cost. And so I think you can back into it that way and come pretty close. 
In terms of bleeding into Q1, again, it's going to depend on how quickly we can get people in plants vaccinated and back to normal production and operating schedules. Again, we see demand recovering, as we've said, by the end of calendar 2021 to pre-COVID levels. And so as you think about that, that tells you the operating -- the pull on the demand side ought to be there. And so it's back to as long as we can get people in plants to operate the plants, we should, over time, get cost back to where they are. But again, that will take some time to get people vaccinated, get them back into plants and stabilize all of that.

Just like we have been in the past, we make decisions now anticipating what 2 and 3 years is going to look like."

In terms of efficiencies, clearly, we're going to gain technical efficiencies in areas like recovery, but there are so many variables that go into that. Clearly, labor costs are lower in China than they would be in the U.S., but you get some offsets in some other things. But clearly, we'll gain some efficiencies there. 
I will tell you that the folks who have been running our existing plant in Shangdu, and we've done some debottlenecking there to service growth there, have done a great job of managing those assets and extracting the real value out of those.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me start by saying that I'm proud of how the entire Lamb Weston team stepped up this year to navigate through the most challenging operating environment in our company's history. We took necessary steps across our organization to focus on the health and well-being of our employees while continuing to focus on supporting our customers. At the same time, we continue to make timely investments to execute on our long-term strategic objectives. 
For our larger customers in our Global and Foodservice segments, we work through production and distribution challenges to maintain customer service levels and support them as they manage through near-term volatility in demand and inventories. We also partnered with several large chain QSRs to run their menus with new products and limited time offerings and to position them for a more aggressive set of offerings in a post-pandemic environment. 
In our Foodservice segment, despite lower volumes in the near term, we maintained our direct sales force that services independent restaurants. We believe it was important to continue to invest in these sales capabilities to provide these customers with uninterrupted support as they adapted to capacity restrictions in new operating models. That investment is now paying off as sales of Lamb Weston branded products have rebounded. 
In Retail, the surge in food at home consumption during the pandemic provided a strong tailwind to our branded portfolio. Each of our Alexia, Grown in Idaho and licensed restaurant brands gained share as compared to pre-pandemic levels. Our branded portfolio market share in aggregate has nearly doubled in the past 5 years, and we've significantly closed the gap with a leading branded competitor. Including what we produce for private label retail customers, we are now the clear leader in the category. 
In our supply chain, we're making some significant investments to support long-term growth and profitability. First, we began construction of a new and form line in our facility in American Falls, Idaho, that will be available in spring 2022. Second, we announced major capacity expansion projects in China and the U.S. We expect both lines to be operational in the next couple of years, which will have us well positioned to support market growth. In addition, through our joint venture in Europe, Lamb Watson Meyer, we announced a capacity expansion project in Russia. And just this morning, a 400 million pound expansion in the Netherlands. These 2 expansions will be focused on supporting continued growth in their respective primary markets. 
Finally, we began to implement our Win as One series of safety, quality and productivity initiatives in our manufacturing facilities and across our procurement, transportation and distribution networks. This is an ambitious program that adopts and tailors lean manufacturing and other productivity tools that have been successfully used by other world-class manufacturing organizations. We're excited about how these initiatives will further strengthen our Lamb Weston operating culture of continuous improvement and drive financial benefits that should enhance margins and cash flow over the long term. 
We're targeting up to $300 million of gross productivity savings by reducing variable costs and waste while also increasing potato and asset utilization. We're also targeting up to 300 million pound of incremental capacity from debottlenecking and other tools to increase throughput on existing assets. To put that into context, 300 million  pound is equivalent to a new production line. 
Finally, we're targeting up to a 10% reduction in finished goods inventory while continuing to target high service levels and case fill rates. As I mentioned, these are long-term targets. We expect benefits from the win as one initiatives to gradually build as they become fully incorporated across the entire supply chain organization. 
We completed the initial phase of a new enterprise resource planning system early in the year. However, we deferred the second phase, which would have had a more direct effect on our manufacturing facilities at a time when those operations were managing through pandemic-related disruptions. We continue to map out Phase II and expect to begin implementation later this fiscal year. This project will tie into our win as one initiatives to provide vendor data and systems to drive more efficient execution. 
So although our results in fiscal 2021 were somewhat choppy due to the pandemic, we focus on the right near-term priorities while making sure we continue the pursuit of our long-term strategic objectives. The pandemic showed the resilience of the category and our business model, with demand in most of our Foodservice segment channels largely offset by the performance in QSR and at Retail. Our operating cash flow and financial liquidity were solid, enabling us to invest in the infrastructure to support growth opportunities. As a result, I'm confident that we are well positioned to drive sustainable profitable growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long term. 
Now turning to the current operating environment. While the pandemic continues to impact people and economies in the U.S. and around the world, we believe the worst of its direct effect on our business, restaurant traffic and French fry demand is behind us. We're encouraged by the pace of recovery in restaurant traffic in the U.S. While overall restaurant traffic remains below pre-pandemic levels, it's recovered much of the lost ground and continues trending in the right direction. 
In May, QSR traffic was down low single digits versus prepandemic levels, which is a modest improvement versus what we saw earlier in the year. The larger QSR chains have been generally outperforming small and regional ones with chicken-based chains outperforming more burier-oriented chains. Overall traffic at full-service restaurants in May was still down mid-teens as compared to prepandemic levels. But that's a significant improvement versus down mid-20s that we saw just a few months ago. This reflects fewer social restrictions and consumers increased willingness to eat on-premises. 
What's helped to offset the effect of lower restaurant traffic during the year has been an increase in fry attachment rate. Simply put, this is a rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant. The increase in fried attachment rate has been largely consistent through most of fiscal 2021, and we believe that rate may have some staying power. We believe that if fry orders continue at the higher rate as restaurant traffic normalizes, it would lead to a meaningful amount of additional volume demand in the U.S. annually. 
The increase in fry in part helps to explain how our shipments in most of our key restaurant and food service channels have already reached or are close to pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis despite restaurant traffic not yet fully recovered. Our shipments to large QSR chains essentially reached that level last fall as customers leverage drive-through and delivery formats. Shipments to commercial customers in our Foodservice segment have essentially returned in aggregate to pre-pandemic levels in the last few months behind strength in small and regional QSRs as well as independent restaurants. 
The recovery shipments to our noncommercial foodservice customers, which include lodging and hospitality, health care, schools and universities, sports and entertainment and workplace environments, continues to lag that in restaurants. However, we expect the rate of improvement will steadily increase through the fall, especially in our education, lodging and entertainment channels. 
While restaurant Foodservice demand continues to recover, demand in the Retail channel continues to be strong. May volumes for the category were 15% to 20% above pre-pandemic levels and our shipment of branded products were in line with those trends. However, we expect category growth will likely slow as it laps strong prior year results and as consumers step up food away from home purchases. We have seen these factors already begin to play out in the fourth quarter and in the first couple of months of fiscal 2022. 
In short, we feel good about the frozen potato category in the U.S. because of increasing strength in restaurant and Foodservice channels as well as continued solid performance in Retail. As a result, we remain confident that overall U.S. fry demand will return to pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. 
Outside the U.S., it's a more complicated story. While demand has improved in Europe and our key international markets, the pace of recovery has been much more uneven and generally behind that in the U.S. as a result of slower vaccine availability and rates. In addition, the spread of COVID variants in many markets has also led governments to delay lifting and, in some cases, reimposing social restrictions which has further increased volatility in demand and stretched out the timing of recovery. 
Overall, we expect the pace of recovery outside the U.S. will continue to vary, with Europe and the developed markets in Asia continuing to generate gradual improvement in demand. We expect the pace of recovery in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East to be more volatile and take a bit longer. 
With respect to supply chain and our cost environment, as with the pandemics impact on fry demand, we believe the worst of its effect on our supply chain is also behind us. We're making progress in stabilizing our manufacturing operations with a number of production days and throughput at most of our plants during the fourth quarter, improving on a year-over-year basis as well as sequentially versus the third quarter. However, we're not yet consistently operating at targeted levels across our network, and it will take some time as we gradually return to operating at normalized levels. 
In the near term, we'll realize incremental costs and inefficiencies incurred during and since the fourth quarter as we sell finished goods inventory in the first half of the year. Going forward, the lingering effects of the pandemic and the sharp recovery of the broader economy in the U.S. has disrupted supply chain operations across all industries, including ours, which has resulted in increased costs. As a result, we expect input cost inflation, especially for edible oils, packaging and transportation, to be a significant headwind for fiscal 2022. 
Our goal is to offset inflation is a combination of levers, including pricing. To that end, we just began implementing broad-based price increases in our Foodservice and Retail segments and don't expect to see the most of their benefit until our fiscal third quarter. 
Before I turn the call over to Rob, let me review a couple of items. First, a few words about the current potato crop. We have recently begun processing early potato varieties in the Pacific Northwest. And early indications are that the recent high temperatures in the Pacific Northwest did not have a negative impact on yield or quality. 
With respect to the main crop that we harvest in the fall, we expect the recent heat waves may have some negative effect on yield and quality, but it's too early to tell. We'll provide our usual updates on the crop when we report our first and second quarter earnings. 
Second, as you may have seen last week, we announced an expansion of our facility in American Falls, Idaho, which will add about 350 million pounds of french fry capacity. The total investment of around $450 million over the next couple of years is for a new production line as well as to modernize the infrastructure facility. We anticipate starting up the new line by mid-2023, just as we expect capacity will be needed to support demand growth. 
So in summary, while this has been a challenging year, I'm proud of how the team has navigated through the pandemic's impact and remained focused on supporting our covers in the near term while continuing to execute on our long-term strategic priorities. We're pleased by the strong recovery in demand in the U.S. and continue to believe that it will be back to pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. And finally, while our supply chain is not yet operating where we wanted to be, I'm encouraged by the improvement that we're making towards getting back to normalized levels as well as the actions we're taking to offset input cost inflation. 
Finally, as we announced a couple of months ago, Rob will be retiring after more than 4 years with Lamb Weston. As part of the leadership team, he's been instrumental in setting up Lamb Weston as an independent company and creating a world-class finance and IT organization. With his passing of manufacturing companies and capital markets, along with his insights into the business, Rob has been a valuable voice as we drove growth, broaden our global footprint and navigated through the challenges of the pandemic. 
As you know, Bernadette will be succeeding Rob as CFO on August 6 after serving as our controller since just before the spin. Bernadette has been a key member of the leadership team from the beginning and has had a hand in all our major decisions and initiatives. This succession has been long planned, so we expect a smooth transition. So I just want to say thanks, Rob, for being part of the Lamb Weston family. I'm grateful to have Bernadette stepping into her new role. 
And with that, here's Rob to review our fourth quarter results."
374372246,1671866715,2351606,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we delivered solid top line results in the fourth quarter as demand trends improved, while our earnings continue to reflect pandemic's disruptive impact on our supply chain as well as higher inflation. Specifi",1567,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we delivered solid top line results in the fourth quarter as demand trends improved, while our earnings continue to reflect pandemic's disruptive impact on our supply chain as well as higher inflation. Specifically in the quarter, sales increased 19% to more than $1 billion, which is a company record for the fourth quarter and within about $10 million of our best quarter ever. 
Volume was up 13%, and price/mix up 6%. Excluding the benefit of the extra week last year, net sales increased 28% and volume was up 21%. The sales volume increase largely reflected the strong recovery in demand in the U.S., especially at full-service restaurants as well as improvement in some of our key international markets. It also reflected the comparison to soft shipments last year due to the pandemic, which included the impact of customers significantly destocking inventories as they adjusted to the abrupt change in the operating environment. The increase in price/mix was driven by favorable price and mix in each of our core business segments. 
For the year, net sales, exclude benefit of the 53rd week last year, was down 2%, with volume down 6% and price mix up 4%. Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased $87 million, driven by higher sales and lower supply chain costs on a per pound basis. The overall reduction in cost per pound as compared to the prior year was largely driven by lower incremental cost and inefficiencies related to the pandemic's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations. It also includes a $27 million year-over-year benefit from unrealized mark-to-market adjustments as well as the absence of a $14 million write-off of rock potatoes that we incurred last year. 
The reduction in per pound cost was partially offset by inflation for key inputs, especially for edible oils and packaging. Canola oil prices, in particular, have nearly doubled in the last 12 months. Our transportation costs were also up sharply. While we've reduced Pamtemix's downstream disruptive effect on our distribution network, we continue to use an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail as we took extraordinary steps to maintain customer service levels as demand turned up sharply. However, the significant increase in our transportation cost was also driven by inflation as rail, trucking, and ocean freight suppliers all struggled to keep up with demand as economic activity surged. 
Moving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A increased $19 million in the quarter. The increase was largely driven by 3 factors. First, it reflects higher incentive compensation expense, which was significantly down in the first quarter -- fourth quarter last year after the pandemic hit. Second, it reflects investments we're making behind our supply chain productivity, commercial and information technology initiatives that should improve our operations over the long term. And third, it includes an additional $3 million of advertising and promotional support behind the launch of new branded items in our Retail segment. 
Equity method earnings were $10 million. Excluding the impact of the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased $14 million versus the prior year. Higher sales volumes compared to soft shipments in Europe and the U.S. last year as well as lower manufacturing costs per pound drove the increase. 
Diluted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.44 compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year. The increase reflects higher sales income from operations and equity method earnings. For the year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.16, down $0.34. 
Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $166 million, which is up $88 million. The increase was driven by higher sales, income from operations and equity method earnings. For the year, adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $748 million down, $51 million. 
Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100 North American-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were up 19% in the quarter, with volume up 16% and price mix up 3%. Excluding the extra selling week last year, sales increased 28% and volume was up 24%. The volume increase largely reflected the year-over-year recovery in demand, especially at large chain QSRs and full-service restaurants in the U.S. Shipments to these customers in the aggregate have essentially returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
Shipments to customers in our key international markets also increased in the aggregate, but remain below pre-pandemic levels as demand recovery continues to lag the U.S. in some of these markets. In addition, traffic and logistics issues affecting ports along the West Coast hindered our export shipments in the quarter. 
The 3% increase in price/mix reflected the benefit of inflation-driven price escalators in our multiyear customer contracts as well as favorable customer mix. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, increased 68% to $56 million. Higher sales volume will be role price/mix and lower manufacturing and distribution cost per pound drove the increase. 
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, increased 82% with volume up 64% and price/mix up 18%. Sales increased 94% and volume rose 74%, excluding the benefit of the extra selling week last year. 
The strong increase in sales volumes largely reflected the year-over-year recovery in shipments to small and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants as governments further ease social restrictions. The increase also reflected a comparison to soft shipments in the prior year quarter as customers significantly destocked inventories. 
Our shipments to noncommercial customers increased at a more modest rate and currently remain at about 2/3 of pre-pandemic levels. As Tom noted, we expect the rate of improvement to steadily increase through the fall as travel and lodging continues to ramp up and as schools and universities return to full capacity. Overall, shipments by our Foodservice segment exited the quarter at around 95% of pre-pandemic volume. The increase in the segment's price mix largely reflected the benefit of favorable mix from higher sales of Lamb Weston branded and premium products. As you may recall, sales of these products declined sharply in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as customers, which primarily included independent restaurants, destocked inventories or traded down to more value-oriented products during the early days of the pandemic. Since then, our direct sales force has steadily rebuilt shipments of Lamb Weston branded products close to pre-pandemic levels. 
Foodservice's product contribution margin rose 127% to $96 million. Higher sales volumes, favorable price mix, lower manufacturing and distribution cost per pound drove the increase. Sales for our Retail segment declined 28%, with volume down 30% and price mix up 2%. Excluding the extra sales week last year, sales declined 22% and volume declined 24%. We expected this decline as it was against a very strong fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which included weekly retail sales for the category that were up around 50% on average as consumers switched consumption patterns due to government-imposed stay-at-home orders. 
The decline in sales also includes the loss of certain low-margin private label volume, which will continue to be a headwind through fiscal 2022. With social and on-premise dining restrictions largely lifted in the U.S., consumer consumption patterns have begun to swing back towards restaurants and away-from-home athletes. Despite this trend, the frozen potato category at retail remains strong. Overall category sales are currently up about 25% from pre-pandemic levels, and each of our branded equities continued to outperform the category. 
The Retail segment's price/mix increased 2%, reflecting favorable mix benefit of our branded business. Retail's product contribution margin declined 32% to $21 million. Lower sales volumes and a $3 million increase in A&P expense to support the launch of new products drove the decline. 
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. We continued to generate solid cash flow even while the pandemic severely impacted demand. In fiscal 2021, we generated more than $550 million of cash from operations, down about $20 million versus last year due to lower sales and earnings, partially offset by lower working capital. We spent $161 million in CapEx, paid $135 million in dividends and bought back nearly $26 million worth of stock at an average price of just over $78 per share. 
We continue to be comfortable with our liquidity position. And at the end of our fiscal year, we had nearly $785 million of cash on hand, and our revolver was undrawn. Our total debt was more than $2.7 billion, and our net debt to EBITDA, including joint ventures ratio, was 2.6x. 
Before turning the call over to Bernadette, I want to thank Tom and the entire Lamb Weston family for letting me be part of the team. It's been an incredibly rewarding experience, and I know that this team will continue to drive the company's success. In terms of my successor, I've known and worked with Bernadette for around 20 years on and on. And I expect that you'll find that she and I approached things in many respects with a similar mindset. As Tom said, she's been deeply involved in all of the key decisions at Lamb Weston, and that's certainly true in developing the broader finance team and strategy. I'm excited for Bernadette to step into the role and see the impact that I know she'll deliver. 
Now here's Bernadette to review our fiscal 2022 outlook."

As you've heard this morning, we feel good about our top line momentum in the past couple of quarters and expect that to continue in fiscal 2022. For the year, we ex",1067,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and I look forward to meeting everyone in the coming months. As you've heard this morning, we feel good about our top line momentum in the past couple of quarters and expect that to continue in fiscal 2022. 
For the year, we expect sales growth will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits, with the drivers of that growth being somewhat different in the first half versus the second. For the first half, we expect growth to be largely driven by higher volume, although we also anticipate that overall price/mix will be positive. The expected volume increase reflects the continuing recovery in demand in the U.S. and our key international markets as well as the comparison to our relatively soft shipments during the first half of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic. 
For the second half of the year, we expect our sales growth will reflect more of a balance of our volume and improved price/mix. While the volume drivers should be similar to those in the first half, the benefit of the shipment comparisons will be less pronounced, especially late in the year. 
Pricing in the second half will benefit from the broad-based actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments that became effective in mid-July, but won't be mostly realized until our fiscal third quarter. Price in the Global segment in the second half should also benefit from price escalators built into multiyear customer agreements. In addition, mix should benefit as our shipments continue to steadily recover in some of our noncommercial channels in our Foodservice segment. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to expect overall U.S. french fry demand will return to pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis around the end of calendar 2021, which is essentially the beginning of our fiscal third quarter. 
With respect to earnings, we expect adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures and net income, to gradually normalize as the year progresses, but it will be pressured during the first half by a step-up in input and transportation cost inflation as well as some residual effects of the pandemic's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations. 
As we noted earlier, we believe the worst of the pandemic impact on our operations is behind us. So we expect these near-term cost pressures will steadily ease as we progress to the second half of the year. As you may recall, we generally hold about 60 days of finished goods inventory. So production costs that we incurred within the last couple of months are held on our balance sheet until the inventory is sold. Accordingly, we already have a good idea about the expected impact on our fiscal first and second quarter results from the disruption in our manufacturing assets in the past few months. 
We expect inflation to be a headwind throughout fiscal 2022, especially in the first half of the year. As Tom noted, we expect volatility in the broader supply chain as the overall economy continues to recover from the pandemic's impact. We believe this will contribute to significant inflation for key inputs, especially edible oils, transportation and packaging, continuing the trend that we began to see during the latter months of fiscal 2021. That said, we're pulling a combination of levers, which may collectively offset most of these inflationary pressures. 
First, there's pricing. As we've discussed, we began implementing a round of broad-based price increases in our Foodservice and Retail segments a couple of weeks ago. These increases generally take 3 to 6 months to be mostly realized in the market and will, therefore, lag the impact of inflation by a couple of quarters. We're also not ruling out the possibility of subsequent rounds of price increases based on the pace and scope of inflation. In our Global segments, we're in the middle of negotiating contracts for our larger customers, and the results of those discussions, including price, won't be known until later this year. However, we will continue to benefit from inflation-driven price escalators built into multiyear customer contracts. 
Second, there's mix. As I also mentioned earlier, we expect a continued recovery in shipments to customers and higher-margin foodservice channels. And third, we expect to steadily drive increased productivity with our win as one lean manufacturing initiatives. So while the ongoing impact of the pandemic is uncertain, we expect these levers together may largely offset inflation and allow us a more stable manufacturing and distribution operations will enable us to improve gross profit during the second half of fiscal 2022. 
We expect that some of this improvement will be offset by continued investments in our supply chain, commercial and IT operations, especially in the first half of the year. These investments will increase our operating expenses in the near term but should improve our ability to support growth and margin improvement over the long term. 
In addition to our operating targets, we anticipate total interest expense of around $115 million. We estimate a full year effective tax rate of between 23% and 24% and expect total depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately $190 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures of $650 million to $700 million depending on the timing of spending behind our large capital projects. This CapEx amount is high relative to our past annual levels and is largely a function of growth capital to complete the construction of our top 10 form line in Idaho as well as to begin construction of new french fry lines in Idaho and China. It also includes capital associated with the second phase of our ERP implementation. 
So in sum, we expect net sales growth for the year will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits, with growth largely driven by volume in the front half and more of a balance of volume and price/mix in the back half. We expect adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, will grow for the year with earnings pressure in the first half and gradual improvements towards more normalized results in the second half as operations stabilize and price/mix improves. 
At this time, we're taking a prudent approach by not providing a specific earnings growth target, given the increased volatility of key input and transportation costs as well as the potential impact of the recent heat waves in the Pacific Northwest on potato yield and quality. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

This is Rob. I'll take that. The -- in terms of COGS inflation, first, remind you that our COGS does have some seasonality just as the crop, the storage and the crops of incurring the storage costs as well as the physical deterioration of the crop impact yields. So that's seasonal, so pull that aside. The key elements of the inflation have been in -- outside of that just normal seasonality of been in edible oils, where we've seen sharp inflation in that really over the last 12 months. That started moving up about -- not quite a year ago, about almost a year ago and has been moving up. Now recently, there's been a little bit more up and down rather than steadily up. So we'll see how that continues to develop and evolve. 
The other place where we've seen in packaging. I think that's just driven by general demand for packaging and again, the packaging producers, producers having the same challenges production-wise at everybody else. So those are 2 key elements that are driving our cost of goods manufactured. 
Another piece that's driving our cost of goods manufactured up or has had an impact on it has been the volatility in our manufacturing operations that have -- is really a carryover from some of the pandemic-related things and as we recover. What we're seeing is as demand comes up sharply, and we're trying to maintain customer service levels that we're doing some more break-in to meet customer service levels on manufacturing. The -- and so those are the elements driving manufacturing. 
On the operations side, as I think as Tom mentioned, we're stabilizing those operations and seeing significant improvement there. The other piece that gets into cost of goods sold is transportation. Two elements to that. One is just the overall inflation, and that's really happening in trucking, in rail and in ocean freight across the board. And I think it's pretty common across industries to see that. The other piece, again, is we're maintaining customer service levels at a high level. We've been incurring more spot truck than we have our normal mix of primarily rail to move product to the East Coast. So those are the elements in it. 
In terms of the outlook for inflation, again, the oils, we continue to hedge those. And so a lot of that oil is hedged through the year. The transportation, as we continue to stabilize operations and as demand stabilizes, we expect that we'll get to a more normalized mix of rail, truck freight. But we think that there's still some choppiness going to occur in cost in terms of spot trucking and certainly, ocean freight off the West Coast for us as we ship to our export markets. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. We think that that a lot of the oil inflation feels like it's more behind us, not to say there won't be more, but the rate of increase over the last 12 months, as I mentioned, has really doubled in canola. So that's kind of a long-winded answer, but I think it covers the covers the basis there."

So the team is doing a great job managing the volatility in the demand forecast plus, throw on top of that, container challenges that every manufacturing company is having, especially on the West Coast, just getting product to the markets. 
And -- so while all that is being -- is pretty volatile right now, we're just managing through it real time, just like everybody else. So -- that said, the second part of your question is the competitive landscape right now from the Europeans is pretty, I'll call it, normalized to what it's been. There hasn't been any -- there's always spot pressures in certain markets, but it's been pretty, I'll call it, normalized. And that's -- one of the things I attribute that to is everybody's experiencing the same thing we're experiencing. So it's manufacturing challenges, it's shipping challenges, a number of different things just to get product to the market and serve your customers. And that's the #1 goal right now, I think, for everybody. 
So I think it's going to be choppy, especially in the international markets with all the freight pressure going forward until things kind of normalize. And the question is, when is that going to happen? And right now, we're going to see freight challenges in the near term for a while, and it's just going to be the way we have to operate."

And so there was more volatility and so more break into lines, more hot shotting maintain customer service levels, those kinds of elements. And so as we think about it, we think that the long term of maintaining the customer service levels is a lot more important than incurring a little bit of extra cost in this kind of an environment in the short term.

And as I talked about, the independent smaller QSR chains in our Foodservice segment have steadily recovered and they're down somewhat, but they continue to improve. And it -- with the new variant, it's hard to say. And the barometer for me is some of the international markets that have reimposed restrictions, and we've seen volume step back. But this whole thing is going to depend upon the restrictions that are imposed or not imposed. And if we kind of navigate through it here in North America, we expect, with fry incident rates that I alluded to in my remarks, if that continues and holds, which we believe it will, then the volume is going to be there.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me start by saying that I'm proud of how the entire Lamb Weston team stepped up this year to navigate through the most challenging operating environment in our company's history. We took necessary steps across our organization to focus on the health and well-being of our employees while continuing to focus on supporting our customers. At the same time, we continue to make timely investments to execute on our long-term strategic objectives.  
For our larger customers in our Global and Foodservice segments, we work through production and distribution challenges to maintain customer service levels and support them as they manage through near-term volatility in demand and inventories. We also partnered with several large chain QSRs to broaden our menus with new products and limited time offerings and to position them for a more aggressive set of offerings in a post-pandemic environment.  
In our Foodservice segment, despite lower volumes in the near term, we maintained our direct sales force that services independent restaurants. We believe it was important to continue to invest in these sales capabilities to provide these customers with uninterrupted support as they adapted to capacity restrictions in new operating models. That investment is now paying off as sales of Lamb Weston branded products have rebounded.  
In Retail, the surge in food-at-home consumption during the pandemic provided a strong tailwind to our branded portfolio. Each of our Alexia, Grown in Idaho and licensed restaurant brands gained share as compared to pre-pandemic levels. Our branded portfolio market share in aggregate has nearly doubled in the past 5 years, and we've significantly closed the gap with a leading branded competitor. Including what we produced for private label retail customers, we are now the clear leader in the category.  
In our supply chain, we're making some significant investments to support long-term growth and profitability. First, we began construction of a new chopped and formed line in our facility in American Falls, Idaho, that will be available in spring 2022. 
Second, we announced major capacity expansion projects in China and the U.S. We expect both lines to be operational in the next couple of years, which will have us well positioned to support market growth. 
In addition, through our joint venture in Europe, Lamb-Weston/Meijer, we announced a capacity expansion project in Russia. And just this morning, a GBP 400 million expansion in the Netherlands. These 2 expansions will be focused on supporting continued growth in their respective primary markets.  
Finally, we began to implement our Win As One series of safety, quality and productivity initiatives in our manufacturing facilities and across our procurement, transportation and distribution networks. This is an ambitious program that adopts and tailors lean manufacturing and other productivity tools that have been successfully used by other world-class manufacturing organizations. We're excited about how these initiatives will further strengthen our Lamb Weston operating culture of continuous improvement and drive financial benefits that should enhance margins and cash flow over the long term.  
We're targeting up to $300 million of gross productivity savings by reducing variable costs and waste, while also increasing potato and asset utilization. We're also targeting up to GBP 300 million of incremental capacity from debottlenecking and other tools to increase throughput on existing assets. To put that into context, GBP 300 million  is equivalent to a new production line.  
Finally, we're targeting up to a 10% reduction in finished goods inventory, while continuing to target high service levels and case fill rates. As I mentioned, these are long-term targets. We expect benefits from the Win As One initiatives to gradually build as they become fully incorporated across the entire supply chain organization.  
We completed the initial phase of a new enterprise resource planning system early in the year. However, we deferred the second phase, which would have had a more direct effect on our manufacturing facilities at a time when those operations were managing through pandemic-related disruptions. We continue to map out Phase II and expect to begin implementation later this fiscal year. This project will tie into our Win As One initiatives to provide better data and systems to drive more efficient execution.  
So although our results in fiscal 2021 were somewhat choppy due to the pandemic, we focus on the right near-term priorities, while making sure we continue the pursuit of our long-term strategic objectives. The pandemic showed the resilience of the category and our business model, with demand in most of our Foodservice segment channels largely offset by the performance in QSR and at Retail. Our operating cash flow and financial liquidity were solid, enabling us to invest in the infrastructure to support growth opportunities. As a result, I'm confident that we are well positioned to drive sustainable profitable growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long term.  
Now turning to the current operating environment. While the pandemic continues to impact people and economies in the U.S. and around the world, we believe the worst of its direct effect on our business, restaurant traffic in french fry demand is behind us. We're encouraged by the pace of recovery in restaurant traffic in the U.S. While overall restaurant traffic remains below pre-pandemic levels, it's recovered much of the lost ground and continues trending in the right direction.  
In May, QSR traffic was down low single digits versus pre-pandemic levels, which is a modest improvement versus what we saw earlier in the year. The larger QSR chains have been generally outperforming small and regional ones with chicken-based chains outperforming more burger-oriented chains. 
Overall traffic at full-service restaurants in May was still down mid-teens as compared to pre-pandemic levels. But that's a significant improvement versus down mid-20s that we saw just a few months ago. This reflects fewer social restrictions and consumer's increased willingness to eat on-premises.  
What's helped to offset the effect of lower restaurant traffic during the year has been an increase in fry attachment rate. Simply put, this is a rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant. The increase in fry attachment rate has been largely consistent through most of fiscal 2021, and we believe that rate may have some staying power. We believe that if fry orders continue at the higher rate as restaurant traffic normalizes, it would lead to a meaningful amount of additional volume demand in the U.S. annually.  
The increase in fry attachment rate in part helps to explain how our shipments in most of our key restaurant and food service channels have already reached core or close to pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis despite restaurant traffic not yet fully recovered it. 
Our shipments to large QSR chains essentially reached at level last fall as customers leverage drive-thru and delivery formats. Shipments to commercial customers in our Foodservice segment have essentially returned in aggregate to pre-pandemic levels in the last few months behind strength in small and regional QSRs as well as independent restaurants.  
The recovery shipments to our noncommercial foodservice customers, which include lodging and hospitality, health care, schools and universities, sports and entertainment and workplace environment, continues to lag that in restaurants. However, we expect the rate of improvement will steadily increase through the fall, especially in our education, lodging and entertainment channels.  
While restaurant Foodservice demand continues to recover, demand in the Retail channel continues to be strong. May volumes for the category were 15% to 20% above pre-pandemic levels and our shipment of branded products were in line with those trends. However, we expect category growth will likely slow as it laps strong prior year results and as consumers step up food away from home purchases. We have seen these factors already begin to play out in the fourth quarter and in the first couple of months of fiscal 2022.  
In short, we feel good about the frozen potato category in the U.S. because of increasing strength in restaurant and Foodservice channels as well as continued solid performance in Retail. As a result, we remain confident that overall U.S. fry demand will return to pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021.  
Outside the U.S., it's a more complicated story. While demand has improved in Europe and our key international markets, the pace of recovery has been much more uneven and generally behind that in the U.S. as a result of slower vaccine availability and rates. In addition, the spread of COVID variants in many markets has also led governments to delay lifting and, in some cases, reimposing social restrictions which has further increased volatility in demand and stretched out the timing of recovery.  
Overall, we expect the pace of recovery outside the U.S. will continue to vary, with Europe and the developed markets in Asia continuing to generate gradual improvement in demand. We expect the pace of recovery in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East to be more volatile and take a bit longer.  
With respect to supply chain in our cost environment, as with the pandemics impact on fry demand, we believe the worst of its effect on our supply chain is also behind us. We're making progress in stabilizing our manufacturing operations with a number of production days and throughput at most of our plants during the fourth quarter, improving on a year-over-year basis as well as sequentially versus the third quarter. However, we're not yet consistently operating at targeted levels across our network, and it will take some time as we gradually return to operating and normalized levels.  
In the near term, we'll realize incremental costs and inefficiencies incurred during and since the fourth quarter as we sell finished goods inventory in the first half of the year. Going forward, the lingering effects of the pandemic and the sharp recovery of the broader economy in the U.S. has disrupted supply chain operations across all industries, including ours, which has resulted in increased costs. As a result, we expect input cost inflation, especially for edible oils, packaging and transportation, to be a significant headwind for fiscal 2022.  
Our goal is to offset inflation using a combination of levers, including pricing. To that end, we just began implementing broad-based price increases in our Foodservice and Retail segments and don't expect to see the most of their benefit until our fiscal third quarter.  
Before I turn the call over to Rob, let me review a couple of items. First, a few words about the current potato crop. We have recently begun processing early potato varieties in the Pacific Northwest. And early indications are that the recent high temperatures in the Pacific Northwest did not have a negative impact on yield or quality.  
With respect to the main crop that we harvest in the fall, we expect the recent heat waves may have some negative effect on yield and quality, but it's too early to tell. We'll provide our usual updates on the crop when we report our first and second quarter earnings.  
Second, as you may have seen last week, we announced an expansion of our facility in American Falls, Idaho, which will add about 350 million pounds of french fry capacity. The total investment of around $450 million over the next couple of years is for a new production line as well as to modernize the infrastructure at the facility. We anticipate starting up the new line by mid-2023, just as we expect capacity will be needed to support demand growth.  
So in summary, while this has been a challenging year, I'm proud of how the team has navigated through the pandemic's impact and remained focused on supporting our customers in the near term, while continuing to execute on our long-term strategic priorities. We're pleased by the strong recovery in demand in the U.S. and continue to believe that it will be back to pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021. 
And finally, while our supply chain is not yet operating where we wanted to be, I'm encouraged by the improvement that we're making towards getting back to normalized levels as well as the actions we're taking to offset input cost inflation.  
Finally, as we announced a couple of months ago, Rob will be retiring after more than 4 years with Lamb Weston. As part of the leadership team, he's been instrumental in setting up Lamb Weston as an independent company and creating a world-class finance and IT organization. With his past experience in manufacturing companies and capital markets, along with his insights into the business, Rob has been a valuable voice as we drove growth, broaden our global footprint and navigated through the challenges of the pandemic.  
As you know, Bernadette will be succeeding Rob as CFO on August 6 after serving as our controller since just before the spin. Bernadette has been a key member of the leadership team from the beginning and has had a hand in all our major decisions and initiatives. This succession has been long planned, so we expect a smooth transition. So I just want to say thanks, Rob, for being part of the Lamb Weston family. I'm grateful to have Bernadette stepping into her new role.  
And with that, here's Rob to review our fourth quarter results."

Good morning, everyone. Overall, we delivered solid top line results in the fourth quarter as demand trends improved, while our earnings continue to reflect pandemic's disruptive impact on our supply chain as well as higher inflation. Specifi",1564,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we delivered solid top line results in the fourth quarter as demand trends improved, while our earnings continue to reflect pandemic's disruptive impact on our supply chain as well as higher inflation. Specifically in the quarter, sales increased 19% to more than $1 billion, which is a company record for the fourth quarter and within about $10 million of our best quarter ever.  
Volume was up 13%, and price/mix up 6%. Excluding the benefit of the extra selling week last year, net sales increased 28% and volume was up 21%. The sales volume increase largely reflected the strong recovery in demand in the U.S., especially at full-service restaurants as well as improvement in some of our key international markets. It also reflected the comparison to soft shipments last year due to the pandemic, which included the impact of customers significantly destocking inventories as they adjusted to the abrupt change in the operating environment. The increase in price/mix was driven by favorable price and mix in each of our core business segments.  
For the year, net sales, exclude benefit of the 53rd week last year, was down 2%, with volume down 6% and price/mix up 4%. Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased $87 million, driven by higher sales and lower supply chain costs on a per pound basis. The overall reduction in cost per pound as compared to the prior year was largely driven by lower incremental cost and inefficiencies related to the pandemic's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations. It also includes a $27 million year-over-year benefit from unrealized mark-to-market adjustments as well as the absence of a $14 million write-off of raw potatoes that we incurred last year.  
The reduction in per pound cost was partially offset by inflation for key inputs, especially for edible oils and packaging. Canola oil prices, in particular, have nearly doubled in the last 12 months. Our transportation costs were also up sharply. While we've reduced pandemics downstream disruptive effect on our distribution network, we continue to use an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail as we took extraordinary steps to maintain customer service levels as demand turned up sharply. However, the significant increase in our transportation cost was also driven by inflation as rail, trucking, and ocean freight suppliers all struggled to keep up with demand as economic activity surged.  
Moving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A increased $19 million in the quarter. The increase was largely driven by 3 factors. First, it reflects higher incentive compensation expense, which was significantly down in the first quarter -- fourth quarter last year after the pandemic hit. 
Second, it reflects investments we're making behind our supply chain productivity, commercial and information technology initiatives that should improve our operations over the long term. And third, it includes an additional $3 million of advertising and promotional support behind the launch of new branded items in our Retail segment.  
Equity method earnings were $10 million. Excluding the impact of the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased $14 million versus the prior year. Higher sales volumes compared to soft shipments in Europe and the U.S. last year as well as lower manufacturing costs per pound drove the increase.  
Diluted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.44 compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year. The increase reflects higher sales, income from operations and equity method earnings. For the year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.16, down $0.34.  
Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $166 million, which is up $88 million. The increase was driven by higher sales, income from operations and equity method earnings. For the year, adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $748 million down, $51 million.  
Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100 North American-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were up 19% in the quarter, with volume up 16% and price/mix up 3%. Excluding the extra selling week last year, sales increased 28% and volume was up 24%. The volume increase largely reflected the year-over-year recovery in demand, especially at large chain QSRs and full-service restaurants in the U.S. Shipments to these customers in the aggregate have essentially returned to pre-pandemic levels.  
Shipments to customers in our key international markets also increased in the aggregate but remain below pre-pandemic levels as demand recovery continues to lag the U.S. in some of these markets. In addition, traffic and logistics issues affecting ports along the West Coast hindered our export shipments in the quarter.  
The 3% increase in price/mix reflected the benefit of inflation-driven price escalators in our multiyear customer contracts as well as favorable customer mix. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, increased 68% to $56 million. Higher sales volumes, favorable price/mix and lower manufacturing and distribution cost per pound drove the increase.  
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, increased 82% with volume up 64% and price/mix up 18%. Sales increased 94% and volume rose 74%, excluding the benefit of the extra selling week last year.  
The strong increase in sales volumes largely reflected the year-over-year recovery in shipments to small and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants as governments further ease social restrictions. The increase also reflected a comparison to soft shipments in the prior year quarter as customers significantly destocked inventories.  
Our shipments to noncommercial customers increased at a more modest rate and currently remain at about 2/3 of pre-pandemic levels. As Tom noted, we expect the rate of improvement to steadily increase through the fall as travel and lodging continues to ramp up and as schools and universities return to full capacity. 
Overall, shipments by our Foodservice segment exited the quarter at around 95% of pre-pandemic volume. The increase in the segment's price/mix largely reflected the benefit of favorable mix from higher sales of Lamb Weston branded and premium products. As you may recall, sales of these products declined sharply in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as customers, which primarily included independent restaurants, destocked inventories or traded down to more value-oriented products during the early days of the pandemic. Since then, our direct sales force has steadily rebuilt shipments of Lamb Weston branded products close to pre-pandemic levels.  
Foodservice's product contribution margin rose 127% to $96 million. Higher sales volumes, favorable price/mix, lower manufacturing and distribution cost per pound drove the increase. Sales for our Retail segment declined 28%, with volume down 30% and price/mix up 2%. Excluding the extra sales week last year, sales declined 22% and volume declined 24%. We expected this decline as it was against a very strong fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which included weekly retail sales for the category that were up around 50% on average as consumers switched consumption patterns due to government-imposed stay-at-home orders.  
The decline in sales also includes the loss of certain low-margin private label volume, which will continue to be a headwind through fiscal 2022. With social and on-premise dining restrictions largely lifted in the U.S., consumer consumption patterns have begun to swing back towards restaurants and away-from-home out flex. Despite this trend, the frozen potato category at retail remains strong. Overall category sales are currently up about 25% from pre-pandemic levels, and each of our branded equities continued to outperform the category.  
The Retail segment's price/mix increased 2%, reflecting favorable mix benefit of our branded business. Retail's product contribution margin declined 32% to $21 million. Lower sales volumes and a $3 million increase in A&P expense to support the launch of new products drove the decline.  
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. We continued to generate solid cash flow even while the pandemic severely impacted demand. In fiscal 2021, we generated more than $550 million of cash from operations, which is down about $20 million versus last year due to lower sales and earnings, partially offset by lower working capital. 
We spent $161 million in CapEx, paid $135 million in dividends and bought back nearly $26 million worth of stock at an average price of just over $78 per share.  
We continue to be comfortable with our liquidity position. And at the end of our fiscal year, we had nearly $785 million of cash on hand, and our revolver was undrawn. Our total debt was more than $2.7 billion, and our net debt to EBITDA, including joint ventures ratio, was 2.6x.  
Before turning the call over to Bernadette, I want to thank Tom and the entire Lamb Weston family for letting me be part of the team. It's been an incredibly rewarding experience, and I know that this team will continue to drive the company's success. 
In terms of my successor, I've known and worked with Bernadette for around 20 years on and off. And I expect that you'll find that she and I approach things in many respects with a similar mindset. As Tom said, she's been deeply involved in all of the key decisions at Lamb Weston, and that's certainly true in developing the broader finance team and strategy. I'm excited for Bernadette to step into the role and see the impact that I know she'll deliver.  
Now here's Bernadette to review our fiscal 2022 outlook."

As you've heard this morning, we feel good about our top line momentum in the past couple of quarters and expect that to continue in fiscal 2022. For the year, we exp",1067,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and I look forward to meeting everyone in the coming month. As you've heard this morning, we feel good about our top line momentum in the past couple of quarters and expect that to continue in fiscal 2022. 
For the year, we expect sales growth will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits, with the drivers of that growth being somewhat different in the first half versus the second. For the first half, we expect growth to be largely driven by higher volume, although we also anticipate that overall price/mix will be positive. The expected volume increase reflects the continuing recovery in demand in the U.S. and our key international markets as well as the comparison to our relatively soft shipments during the first half of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic. 
For the second half of the year, we expect our sales growth will reflect more of a balance of higher volume and improved price/mix. While the volume drivers should be similar to those in the first half, the benefit of the shipment comparisons will be less pronounced, especially late in the year. 
Pricing in the second half will benefit from the broad-based actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments that became effective in mid-July but won't be mostly realized until our fiscal third quarter. 
Price in the Global segment in the second half should also benefit from price escalators built into multiyear customer agreements. In addition, mix should benefit as our shipments continue to steadily recover in some of our noncommercial channels in our Foodservice segment. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to expect overall U.S. french fry demand will return to pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis around the end of calendar 2021, which is essentially the beginning of our fiscal third quarter. 
With respect to earnings, we expect adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures and net income to gradually normalize as the year progresses, but it will be pressured during the first half by a step-up in input and transportation cost inflation as well as some residual effects of the pandemic's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations. 
As we noted earlier, we believe the worst of the pandemic's impact on our operations is behind us. So we expect these near-term cost pressures will steadily ease as we progress to the second half of the year. As you may recall, we generally hold about 60 days of finished goods inventory. So production costs that we incurred within the last couple of months are held on our balance sheet until the inventory is sold. 
Accordingly, we already have a good idea about the expected impact on our fiscal first and second quarter results from the disruption in our manufacturing assets in the past few months. 
We expect inflation to be a headwind throughout fiscal 2022, especially in the first half of the year. As Tom noted, we expect volatility in the broader supply chain as the overall economy continues to recover from the pandemic's impact. We believe this will contribute to significant inflation for key inputs, especially edible oils, transportation and packaging, continuing the trend that we began to see during the latter months of fiscal 2021. 
That said, we're pulling a combination of levers, which may collectively offset most of these inflationary pressures. 
First, there's pricing. As we've discussed, we began implementing a round of broad-based price increases in our Foodservice and Retail segments a couple of weeks ago. These increases generally take 3 to 6 months to be mostly realized in the market and will, therefore, lag the impact of inflation by a couple of quarters. We're also not ruling out the possibility of subsequent rounds of price increases based on the pace and scope of inflation. 
In our Global segment, we're in the middle of negotiating contracts for our larger customers, and the results of those discussions, including price, won't be known until later this year. However, we will continue to benefit from inflation-driven price escalators built into multiyear customer contracts. 
Second, there's mix. As I also mentioned earlier, we expect a continued recovery in shipments to customers and higher-margin foodservice channels. 
And third, we expect to steadily drive increased productivity with our Win As One, lean manufacturing initiative. So while the ongoing impact of the pandemic is uncertain, we expect these levers together may largely offset inflation and allow us a more stable manufacturing and distribution operations will enable us to improve gross profit during the second half of fiscal 2022. 
We expect that some of this improvement will be offset by continued investments in our supply chain, commercial and IT operations, especially in the first half of the year. These investments will increase our operating expenses in the near term but should improve our ability to support growth and margin improvement over the long term. 
In addition to our operating targets, we anticipate total interest expense of around $115 million. We estimate a full year effective tax rate of between 23% and 24% and expect total depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately $190 million. 
And finally, we expect capital expenditures of $650 million to $700 million depending on the timing of spending behind our large capital projects. This CapEx amount is high relative to our past annual levels and is largely a function of growth capital to complete the construction of our chopped and formed line in Idaho as well as to begin construction of new french fry lines in Idaho and China. It also includes capital associated with the second phase of our ERP implementation. 
So in sum, we expect net sales growth for the year will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits, with growth largely driven by volume in the front half and more of a balance of volume and price/mix in the back half. We expect adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, will grow for the year with earnings pressure in the first half and gradual improvements towards more normalized results in the second half as operations stabilize and price/mix improves. 
At this time, we're taking a prudent approach by not providing a specific earnings growth target, given the increased volatility of key input and transportation costs as well as the potential impact of the recent heat waves in the Pacific Northwest on potato yield and quality. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

We feel good about how well the category has been recovering from the pandemic and believe these positive trends provide a good tailwind for above algorithm sales growth in fiscal 2022. We're making progress in stabilizing our manufacturing network, and we're pulling the right levers to gradually normalize operations and offset significant inflationary pressures to improve profitability as the year progresses. 
With our Win As One productivity initiatives, we're putting in place the lean manufacturing and productivity tools to improve our operations and cost structure so that we can return to or even exceed pre-pandemic margin levels in the coming years. 
And finally, I'm confident that we're making the right investments to strategically expand our production capacity so that we can deliver sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long term.

I wanted to ask about how costs have ramped over the past few months. Do you expect COGS inflation in the first half of the fiscal year to come in above the COGS inflation you faced in the fourth quarter? Is there a range you can provide? What are the items that have gotten worse over the last couple of months? And then just to what extent did your COGS inflation ramp subsequent to you announcing these recent price actions?"
374372246,1671866715,2351803,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Yes. This is Rob. I'll take that.

This is Rob. I'll take that. The -- in terms of COGS inflation, first, remind you that our COGS does have some seasonality just as the crop, the storage and the crops so encouraging, incurring the storage costs as well as the physical deterioration of the crop impact yields. So that's seasonal, so pull that aside. 
The key elements of the inflation have been in -- outside of that just normal seasonality have been in edible oils, where we've seen sharp inflation in that really over the last 12 months. That started moving up about -- not quite a year ago, about almost a year ago and has been moving up. Now recently, there's been a little bit more up and down rather than steadily up. So we'll see how that continues to develop and evolve. 
The other place where we've seen inflation is in packaging. I think that's just driven by general demand for packaging and again, the packaging producers, canola oil producers having the same challenges production-wise as everybody else. So those are two key elements that are driving our cost of goods manufactured. 
Another piece that's driving our cost of goods manufactured up or has had an impact on it has been the volatility in our manufacturing operations that have -- is really a carryover from some of the pandemic-related things and as we recover. What we're seeing is, as demand comes up sharply, and we're trying to maintain customer service levels that we're doing some more break-in to meet customer service levels on manufacturing. The -- and so those are the elements driving manufacturing. 
On the operations side, as I think as Tom mentioned, we're stabilizing those operations and seeing significant improvement there. The other piece that gets into cost of goods sold is transportation. Two elements to that. One is just the overall inflation, and that's really happening in trucking, in rail and in ocean freight across the board. And I think it's pretty common across industries to see that. 
The other piece, again, is we're maintaining customer service levels at a high level. We've been incurring more spot truck than we have our normal mix of primarily rail to move product to the East Coast. So those are the elements in it. 
In terms of the outlook for inflation, again, the oils, we continue to hedge those. And so a lot of that oil is hedged through the year. The transportation, as we continue to stabilize operations and as demand stabilizes, we expect that we'll get to a more normalized mix of rail, truck freight. But we think that there's still some choppiness going to occur in cost in terms of spot trucking and certainly, ocean freights off the West Coast for us as we ship to our export markets. 
So it's a bit of a mixed bag. We think that, that a lot of the oil inflation feels like it's more behind us, not to say there won't be more, but the rate of increase over the last 12 months, as I mentioned, has really doubled in canola. So that's kind of a long-winded answer, but I think it covers the -- covers the basis there."

So it's really kind of week by week on what's going on, especially with the delta variant that's going on. 
So the team is doing a great job managing the volatility in the demand forecast plus, through on top of that, container challenges that every manufacturing company is having, especially on the West Coast, just getting product to the markets. 
And -- so while all that is being -- is pretty volatile right now, we're just managing through it real time, just like everybody else. So -- that said, the second part of your question is the competitive landscape right now from the Europeans is pretty, I'll call it, normalized to what it's been. It had -- there hasn't been any -- there's always spot pressures in certain markets, but it's been pretty, I'll call it, normalized. And that's -- one of the things I attribute that to is everybody's experiencing the same thing we're experiencing. So it's manufacturing challenges, it's shipping challenges, a number of different things just to get product to the market and serve your customers. And that's the #1 goal right now, I think, for everybody. 
So I think it's going to be choppy, especially in the international markets with all the freight pressure going forward until things kind of normalize. And the question is, when is that going to happen? And right now, we're going to see freight challenges in the near term for a while, and it's just going to be the way we have to operate."

Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with our strong sales growth in the quarter, which reflects the ongoing broad recovery in demand across our out-of-home sales channels as well as continued improvement in our key international markets. However, our margin improvement lags our volume recovery as a result of the timing of pricing actions to offset cost inflation as well as challenging macro factors that increase our cost and affected our production run rates and throughput. 
These ongoing challenges, combined with the extreme summer's heat, negative impact on potato crops in the Pacific Northwest will result in a higher cost as the year progresses. As a result, we now expect our gross profit margins will remain below pre-pandemic levels through fiscal 2022. 
We believe many of these costs and supply chain challenges are transitory, and we're taking aggressive actions to mitigate their effects on our operations and financial performance. We're confident that our actions, along with our investments to improve productivity and operations over the long term, will get us back on track to deliver higher margins and sustainable growth. 
Before Bernadette gets into some of the specifics of our first quarter results and outlook, let's briefly review the current operating environment, starting with demand. In the U.S., we continue to be encouraged by the pace of recovery in restaurant traffic and demand for fries. Overall, restaurant traffic has largely stabilized at about 5% below pre-pandemic levels, led by the continued solid performance at quick service restaurants. Traffic at full-service restaurants continued to rebound in June and July, but it did soften a bit in August as the Delta variant surged across most of the country. 
Demand improved at noncommercial foodservice outlets, especially in the education market, which helped to offset the near-term slowdown in full-service restaurants. The fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is a rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, also continued to help support the recovery in demand by remaining above pre-pandemic levels. Demand in U.S. retail channels also remained solid, with overall category volumes in the quarter, still up 15% to 20% from pre-pandemic levels. 
Outside the U.S., overall fry demand continued to improve in the quarter, although the rate of improvement varied widely among our key international markets. Demand in Europe, which is served by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, gradually recovered as vaccination rates climbed. Demand in Asia and Oceania was solid, but also softened in August due to the spread of the Delta variant. And South America remained challenged, especially in Brazil. So overall, we're happy with the recovery in global demand and believe it provides a solid foundation for continued volume growth in fiscal 2022. 
With respect to the pricing environment, I'm pleased with the progress of our recently implemented pricing actions to manage sharp input cost inflation. In our foodservice and retail segments as well as in some of our international business, we'll begin to realize some of the pricing benefits in the second quarter and more fully in the third quarter. In our Global segment, the contract renewables for large chain restaurant customers have largely progressed as we expected and we'll generally begin to see the impact of any pricing actions associated with these contracts in our third quarter. In addition, we'll continue to benefit from price escalators for most of the global contracts that are not up for renewal this year. These price adjustments reset based on the underlying timing of the contract renewals, but largely during our fiscal third quarter. 
Overall, we expect our price increases across our business segments will, in aggregate, mitigate most of the cost inflation. However, depending on the pace and scope of inflation and the increase of total costs resulting from this year's poor crop, we may take further price action as the year progresses. 
In contrast to demand and pricing, the manufacturing and distribution environment continues to be difficult. Our supply chain costs on a per pound basis have increased significantly due to input and transportation cost inflation as well as labor availability and other macro supply chain disruptions that are continuing to cause production inefficiencies across our global manufacturing network. Although we're making gradual progress to mitigate these challenges, they have slowed our efforts to stabilize our manufacturing operations during the first half of fiscal 2022. As a result, we expect the turnaround in our supply chain will take longer than we initially anticipated. 
Now turning to the crop. The early read on this year's crop in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, and Alberta indicates that it will be well below average levels in both yield and quality due to the extreme heat over the summer. As we're still in the middle of the main crop harvest, the extent of the financial impact of the crop condition will be determined over the coming quarter as the harvest is completed. While we expect this impact will be significant, we're examining a variety of levers to mitigate the effect on our earnings as well as on customer service and supply. As usual, we'll provide a more complete assessment of the crop and its impact on earnings when we release our second quarter results in early January. 
So in summary, I feel good about the overall pace of recovery in french fry demand, especially in the U.S. I believe it provides a solid foundation for future growth. I also feel good about the current pricing environment and how we're executing pricing actions in the marketplace. We do expect higher potato costs, input and transportation inflation, labor challenges and other industry-wide operational headwinds to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year. While we're taking specific actions to mitigate these challenges, they will keep our gross margins below pre-pandemic levels through fiscal 2022. 
And finally, I'm confident that we're taking the right steps to get our company back on track to delivering more normalized profit margins. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our first quarter results and our fiscal 2022 outlook."

As many of you know, this is my first earnings call as CFO of Lamb Weston. I've now been in the role for about 9 weeks. For those on the line that I haven't met, it's a pleasure to meet you over the phone. I'm looking forward to meeting many of you in person over the coming months as we get back into the cadence of in-person investor meetings and industry events. 
As Tom discussed, we feel good about the health of the category and our top line performance in the first quarter, and expect our gross margins going forward will improve as we benefit from our recent pricing actions as well as from other actions that we're taking to mitigate some of the macro challenges affecting our supply chain. 
Specifically, in the quarter, sales increased 13% to $984 million, with volume up 11% and price mix up 2%. As expected, volume was the primary driver of sales growth, reflecting the ongoing recovery in fry demand outside the home in the U.S. and in some of our key international markets as well as the comparison to relatively soft shipments in the prior year quarter. Lower retail segment sales volume partially offset this growth, largely as a result of incremental losses of low-margin private label business. Overall, our sales volume in the first quarter was about 95% of what it was during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, before the pandemic impacted demand. 
Moving to pricing, pricing actions and favorable mix drove an increase in price/mix in each of our core business segments. As I'll discuss in more detail later, our pricing actions include the benefit of higher prices charged to customers for product delivery in an effort to pass through rising freight costs. The offset to this is higher transportation costs and cost of goods sold. 
Gross profit in the quarter declined $63 million as the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher manufacturing and transportation costs on a per pound basis. The decline in gross profit also includes a $6 million decrease in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, which includes a $1 million gain in the current quarter compared with a $7 million gain in the prior year quarter. 
The increase in cost per pound primarily related to 3 factors: first, we incurred double-digit cost inflation for key commodity inputs, most notably, edible oils, which has more than doubled versus the prior year quarter. Other inputs that saw significant inflation include ingredients such as wheat and starches used to make batter and other coatings and containerboard and plastic film for packaging. Higher labor costs were also a factor as we incurred more expense from increased unplanned overtime. 
Second, our transportation costs increased due to rising freight rates as global logistics networks continue to struggle. Our costs also rose due to an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail as we took extraordinary steps to deliver product to our customers. Together, inflation for commodity inputs and transportation accounted for approximately 3/4 of the increase in our cost per pound. 
The third factor driving the increase in cost per pound was lower production run rates and throughput at our plants from lost production days and unplanned downtime. This resulted in incremental costs and inefficiencies. Some of this is attributable to ongoing upstream supply chain disruption including the timely delivery of key inputs and other vendor-supplied materials and services. However, most of the impact on run rate was attributable to volatile labor availability and shortages across our manufacturing network. 
So what are we doing to mitigate these higher costs and stabilize our supply chain? First, price. We are executing our recently announced price increases across each of our business segments and implementation of these pricing actions are on track. Our price/cost relationship will progressively improve as our pass-through pricing catches up with the inflationary cost increases. We'll begin to see some benefit from these actions in the second quarter and it will continue to build through the year. If needed, we will implement additional rounds of price increases to mitigate the impact of further cost inflation. 
We've also increased the freight rates that we charge customers to recover the cost of product delivery, and we are adjusting them more frequently to better reflect changes to the market rates. These adjustments have also lagged the cost increases. While we saw some benefit in the first quarter, we expect to see more of a benefit beginning in the second quarter. In addition, we're significantly restricting the use of higher cost spot rate trucking. 
Second, we're optimizing our portfolio. We're eliminating underperforming SKUs to drive savings through simplification in terms of procurement, production, inventory management and distribution. We are also partnering with our customers to modify product specifications without compromising food safety and quality. These modifications will help mitigate the impact of lower potato crop yields from this year's crop as well as some of the impact of reduced potato utilization that results from poor raw potato quality. 
Third, we're increasing productivity savings with our Win As One program. While realized savings to date have been small, given that the initiative is still fairly new, we began to execute specific cost reduction programs around procurement, commodity utilization, manufacturing waste, inventory management and logistics as well as programs to improve demand planning and throughput. We expect savings from these and other productivity programs will steadily build as our supply chain stabilizes. 
And finally, we're managing labor availability and volatility. This includes changing how we schedule our labor crews, which provides our employees more control and predictability over their personal schedules and reduces unplanned overtime. We're also reviewing compensation levels to make sure we remain an employer of choice in each of our local communities. This is in addition to the other recruiting tools and incentives such as signing and retention bonuses. 
Moving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A increased $13 million in the quarter. This increase was largely driven by 3 factors: first, it reflects the investments we're making behind information technology, commercial and supply chain productivity initiatives that should improve our operations over the long term. About $4 million this quarter represents nonrecurring ERP-related expenses; second, it reflects higher compensation and benefits expense; and third, it includes an additional $3 million of advertising and promotional support behind the launch of new branded items in our Retail segment. This increase compares to a low base in the prior year when we significantly reduced A&P activities at the onset of the pandemic. Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.20, down from $0.61 in the prior year, while adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $123 million, down from $202 million. 
Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment were up 12% in the quarter, with volume up 10% and price mix up 2%. Overall, the segment's total shipments are trending above pre-pandemic levels due to strength in our North American chain restaurant business, especially at QSRs. Our international shipments in the quarter also approached pre-pandemic levels despite congestion at West Coast ports and the worldwide shipping container shortage continuing to disrupt our exports as well as softening demand in Asia due to the spread of the Delta variant. The 2% increase in price/mix reflected the benefit of higher prices charged for freight, inflation-driven price escalators and favorable customer mix. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expenses, declined 45% to $43 million. Input and transportation cost inflation as well as higher manufacturing cost per pound more than offset the benefit of higher sales volume and favorable price mix. 
Moving to our Foodservice segment. Sales increased 36%, with volume up 35% and price/mix up 1%. The strong increase in sales volumes largely reflected the year-over-year recovery in shipments to small and regional restaurant chains and independently-owned restaurants. However, shipments to these end customers, along with restaurant traffic, slowed in August, due to the surge of the Delta variant across the U.S. Volume growth in August was also tempered by the inability to service full customer demand due to lower production run rates and throughput at our plant largely due to labor availability. 
Our shipments to noncommercial customers improved through the quarter as the education, lodging and entertainment channels continue to strengthen. Overall, noncommercial shipments were up sequentially to 75% to 80% of pre-pandemic levels from about 65% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in price/mix largely reflected pricing actions, including the benefit of higher prices charged for freight. Foodservice's product contribution margin rose 12% to $96 million. Higher sales volumes and favorable price/mix more than offset input and transportation cost inflation as well as higher manufacturing cost per pound. 
Moving to our Retail segment. Sales declined 14%, with volume down 15% and price/mix up 1%. The sales volume decline largely reflects lower shipments of private label products, resulting from incremental losses of certain low-margin business. Sales of branded products were down slightly from a strong prior year quarter that benefited from very high in-home consumption demand due to the pandemic, but remain well above pre-pandemic levels. The increase in price/mix was largely driven by favorable price, including higher prices charged for freight. Retail's product contribution margin declined 59% to $15 million. Input and transportation cost inflation, higher manufacturing cost per pound, lower sales volumes and a $2 million increase in A&P expenses to support the launch of new products drove the decline. 
Let's move to our cash flow and liquidity position. In the first quarter, we generated more than $160 million of cash from operations. That's down about $90 million versus the prior year quarter due primarily to lower earnings. We spent nearly $80 million in capital expenditures and paid $34 million in dividends. We also bought back nearly $26 million worth of stock or about double what we have typically repurchased in prior quarters. During the quarter, we amended our revolver to increase its capacity from $750 million to $1 billion and extended its maturity date to August 2026. At the end of the first quarter, our revolver was undrawn, and we had nearly $790 million of cash on hand. Our total debt was about $2.75 billion and our net debt to EBITDA, including joint ventures ratio was 2.7x. 
Now let's turn to our updated outlook. We continue to expect our sales growth in fiscal 2022 to be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits. In the second quarter, we continue to anticipate sales growth will be largely driven by higher volumes as we lap a comparison to relatively soft shipments during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic. We expect price/mix will be up sequentially versus the 2% that we delivered in Q1 as the execution of pricing actions in all of our segments remain on track. 
For the second half of the year, we continue to expect our sales growth will reflect more of a balance of higher volume and improved price/mix as we begin to lap some of the softer volume comparisons from the prior year, and as the benefit from our earlier pricing actions continue to build. Our volume growth, however, may be tempered by global logistics disruptions and container shortages that affects both domestic and export shipments. It may also be tempered by lower factory production due to macro industry and labor challenges as well as a poor quality crop. 
With respect to earnings, we expect net income and adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, will continue to be pressured through fiscal 2022. That's a change from our previous expectation of earnings gradually approaching pre-pandemic levels in the second half of the year. Driving most of this change is our expectation of significantly higher potato costs resulting from poor yield and quality of the crops in our growing regions. We previously assumed the potato crop that approached historical averages. Outside of raw potatoes, we expect double-digit inflation for key production inputs such as edible oils, transportation and packaging to continue through fiscal 2022. We have previously assumed these costs would begin to gradually ease during the second half of the year. 
We also expect the macro challenges that have slowed the turnaround in our supply chain to continue through fiscal 2022. That said, we expect the labor and transportation actions that I described earlier, along with our Win As One productivity initiatives, will help us continue to gradually stabilize operations, improve production run rates and throughput, and manage costs as the year progresses. 
For the full year, we expect our gross margin may be at least 5 to 8 points below our normalized annual margin rate of 25% to 26%. While we recognize this is a wide range, it reflects the volatility and high degree of uncertainty regarding the cost pressures that I've discussed. Consistent with prior years, we'll have a better understanding of the crop's financial impact in the next couple of months, and we will provide an update when we release our second quarter results in early January. Below gross margin, we expect our quarterly SG&A expense will be in the high 90s as we continue our investments to improve our operations over the long term, while equity earnings will likely remain pressured, due to input cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs, both in Europe and the U.S. 
We've also updated a couple of our other targets for the year. First, we've reduced our capital expenditure estimate to $450 million from our previous estimate of $650 million to $700 million. This significant reduction is due to the timing of spend behind our large capital projects and effectively shift the spend into early 2023 -- fiscal 2023. Despite the shift in expenditures, our expansion projects in Idaho and China remain on track to open in the spring and fall of 2023, respectively. And second, we're reducing our estimated full year effective tax rate to approximately 22%, down from our previous estimate of between 23% and 24%. Our estimates for total interest expense of around $115 million and total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $190 million remain unchanged. 
So in summary, the strong recovery in demand helped fuel our top line growth in the first quarter, but higher manufacturing and distribution costs led to lower earnings. For fiscal 2022, we expect net sales growth will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits, but that our earnings will continue to be pressured for the remainder of the year due to higher potato costs from a poor crop and persistent inflationary and macro challenges. Nonetheless, we expect to begin to see earnings improve in the second quarter, behind our pricing actions and the steps we're taking to improve our costs. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

So I'm trying to think out if we just take ahead for a minute to fiscal '23, and just maybe if you play out the sort of the potential sort of puts and takes, what are the things that in theory could be more positive? Where are some of the things that maybe you still don't really have a lot of clarity on? So that was you're clearly putting a lot of pricing through potentially could put more through. There's always a little bit of a timing lag, but one would think that's going to certainly better help you get a lot closer to where your costs are. I'm trying -- I'm struggling with like the labor piece. And are you making progress on that? Is it just slow? 
And I'm trying to get a sense if some of these negatives can kind of bleed into '23. Or is there a reason that there could be a pretty dramatic bounce back in operating margin and gross margins in '23? Like do the next 3 quarters give you enough time essentially, to figure out some of these issues? Or frankly, are some of these thorny enough that they could go beyond that?

Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with our strong sales growth in the quarter, which reflects the ongoing broad recovery in demand across our out-of-home sales channels as well as continued improvemen",1023,"Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with our strong sales growth in the quarter, which reflects the ongoing broad recovery in demand across our out-of-home sales channels as well as continued improvement in our key international markets. However, our margin improvement lags our volume recovery as a result of the timing of pricing actions to offset cost inflation as well as challenging macro factors that increase our cost and affected our production run rates and throughput.  
These ongoing challenges, combined with the extreme summer's heat, negative impact on potato crops in the Pacific Northwest will result in a higher cost as the year progresses. As a result, we now expect our gross profit margins will remain below pre-pandemic levels through fiscal 2022.  
We believe many of these costs and supply chain challenges are transitory, and we're taking aggressive actions to mitigate their effects on our operations and financial performance. We're confident that our actions, along with our investments to improve productivity and operations over the long term, will get us back on track to deliver higher margins and sustainable growth.  
Before Bernadette gets into some of the specifics of our first quarter results and outlook, let's briefly review the current operating environment, starting with demand. In the U.S., we continue to be encouraged by the pace of recovery in restaurant traffic and demand for fries. Overall, restaurant traffic has largely stabilized at about 5% below pre-pandemic levels, led by the continued solid performance at quick service restaurants. Traffic at full service restaurants continued to rebound in June and July, but it did soften a bit in August as the Delta variant surged across most of the country.  
Demand improved at noncommercial foodservice outlets, especially in the education market, which helped to offset the near-term slowdown in full service restaurants. The fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is a rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, also continued to help support the recovery in demand by remaining above pre-pandemic levels. Demand in U.S. retail channels also remained solid, with overall category volumes in the quarter still up 15% to 20% from pre-pandemic levels.  
Outside the U.S., overall fry demand continued to improve in the quarter, although the rate of improvement varied widely among our key international markets. Demand in Europe, which is served by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, gradually recovered as vaccination rates climbed. Demand in Asia and Oceania was solid, but also softened in August due to the spread of the Delta variant. And South America remained challenged, especially in Brazil. So overall, we're happy with the recovery in global demand and believe it provides a solid foundation for continued volume growth in fiscal 2022.  
With respect to the pricing environment, I'm pleased with the progress of our recently implemented pricing actions to manage sharp input cost inflation. In our Foodservice and Retail segments as well as in some of our international business, we'll begin to realize some of the pricing benefits in the second quarter and more fully in the third quarter. In our Global segment, the contract renewables for large chain restaurant customers have largely progressed as we expected and we'll generally begin to see the impact of any pricing actions associated with these contracts in our third quarter. In addition, we'll continue to benefit from price escalators for most of the global contracts that are not up for renewal this year. These price adjustments reset based on the underlying timing of the contract renewals, but largely during our fiscal third quarter.  
Overall, we expect our price increases across our business segments will, in aggregate, mitigate most of the cost inflation. However, depending on the pace and scope of inflation and the increase of potato costs resulting from this year's poor crop, we may take further price action as the year progresses. In contrast to demand and pricing, the manufacturing and distribution environment continues to be difficult. Our supply chain costs on a per pound basis have increased significantly due to input and transportation cost inflation as well as labor availability and other macro supply chain disruptions that are continuing to cause production inefficiencies across our global manufacturing network. Although we're making gradual progress to mitigate these challenges, they have slowed our efforts to stabilize our manufacturing operations during the first half of fiscal 2022. As a result, we expect the turnaround in our supply chain will take longer than we initially anticipated.  
Now turning to the crop. The early read on this year's crop in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, and Alberta indicates that it will be well below average levels in both yield and quality due to the extreme heat over the summer. As we're still in the middle of the main crop harvest, the extent of the financial impact of the crop condition will be determined over the coming quarter as the harvest is completed. While we expect this impact will be significant, we're examining a variety of levers to mitigate the effect on our earnings as well as on customer service and supply. As usual, we'll provide a more complete assessment of the crop and its impact on earnings when we release our second quarter results in early January.  
So in summary, I feel good about the overall pace of recovery in french fry demand, especially in the U.S. I believe it provides a solid foundation for future growth. I also feel good about the current pricing environment and how we're executing pricing actions in the marketplace. We do expect higher potato costs, input and transportation inflation, labor challenges and other industry-wide operational headwinds to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year. While we're taking specific actions to mitigate these challenges, they will keep our gross margins below pre-pandemic levels through fiscal 2022.  
And finally, I'm confident that we're taking the right steps to get our company back on track to delivering more normalized profit margins. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our first quarter results and our fiscal 2022 outlook."

For those on the line that I haven't met, it's a pleasure to meet you over the phone. I'm look",2466,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As many of you know, this is my first earnings call as CFO of Lamb Weston. I've now been in the role for about 9 weeks. For those on the line that I haven't met, it's a pleasure to meet you over the phone. I'm looking forward to meeting many of you in person over the coming months as we get back into the cadence of in-person investor meetings and industry events.  
As Tom discussed, we feel good about the health of the category and our top line performance in the first quarter, and expect our gross margins going forward will improve as we benefit from our recent pricing actions as well as from other actions that we're taking to mitigate some of the macro challenges affecting our supply chain.  
Specifically, in the quarter, sales increased 13% to $984 million, with volume up 11% and price/mix up 2%. As expected, volume was the primary driver of sales growth, reflecting the ongoing recovery in fry demand outside the home in the U.S. and in some of our key international markets as well as the comparison to relatively soft shipments in the prior year quarter. Lower retail segment sales volume partially offset this growth, largely as a result of incremental losses of low-margin private-label business. Overall, our sales volume in the first quarter was about 95% of what it was during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, before the pandemic impacted demand.  
Moving to pricing, pricing actions and favorable mix drove an increase in price/mix in each of our core business segments. As I'll discuss in more detail later, our pricing actions include the benefit of higher prices charged to customers for product delivery in an effort to pass through rising freight costs. The offset to this is higher transportation costs and cost of goods sold.  
Gross profit in the quarter declined $63 million as the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher manufacturing and transportation costs on a per pound basis. The decline in gross profit also includes a $6 million decrease in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, which includes a $1 million gain in the current quarter compared with a $7 million gain in the prior year quarter.  
The increase in cost per pound primarily related to 3 factors: first, we incurred double-digit cost inflation for key commodity inputs, most notably, edible oils, which has more than doubled versus the prior year quarter. Other inputs that saw significant inflation include ingredients such as wheat and starches used to make batter and other coatings and containerboard and plastic film for packaging. Higher labor costs were also a factor as we incurred more expense from increased unplanned overtime. 
Second, our transportation costs increased due to rising freight rates as global logistics networks continue to struggle. Our costs also rose due to an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail as we took extraordinary steps to deliver product to our customers. Together, inflation for commodity inputs and transportation accounted for approximately 3/4 of the increase in our cost per pound. 
The third factor driving the increase in cost per pound was lower production run rates and throughput at our plants from lost production days and unplanned downtime. This resulted in incremental costs and inefficiencies. Some of this is attributable to ongoing upstream supply chain disruption including the timely delivery of key inputs and other vendor-supplied materials and services. However, most of the impact on run rate was attributable to volatile labor availability and shortages across our manufacturing network.  
So what are we doing to mitigate these higher costs and stabilize our supply chain? First, price. We are executing our recently announced price increases across each of our business segments and implementation of these pricing actions are on track. Our price/cost relationship will progressively improve as our pass-through pricing catches up with the inflationary cost increases. We'll begin to see some benefit from these actions in the second quarter and it will continue to build through the year. If needed, we will implement additional rounds of price increases to mitigate the impact of further cost inflation.  
We've also increased the freight rates that we charge customers to recover the cost of product delivery, and we are adjusting them more frequently to better reflect changes to the market rates. These adjustments have also lagged the cost increases. While we saw some benefit in the first quarter, we expect to see more of a benefit beginning in the second quarter. In addition, we're significantly restricting the use of higher cost spot rate trucking.  
Second, we're optimizing our portfolio. We're eliminating underperforming SKUs to drive savings through simplification in terms of procurement, production, inventory management and distribution. We are also partnering with our customers to modify product specifications without compromising food safety and quality. These modifications will help mitigate the impact of lower potato crop yields from this year's crop as well as some of the impact of reduced potato utilization that results from poor raw potato quality. 
Third, we're increasing productivity savings with our Win As One program. While realized savings to date have been small, given that the initiative is still fairly new, we began to execute specific cost reduction programs around procurement, commodity utilization, manufacturing waste, inventory management and logistics as well as programs to improve demand planning and throughput. We expect savings from these and other productivity programs will steadily build as our supply chain stabilizes. 
And finally, we're managing labor availability and volatility. This includes changing how we schedule our labor crews, which provides our employees more control and predictability over their personal schedules and reduces unplanned overtime. We're also reviewing compensation levels to make sure we remain an employer of choice in each of our local communities. This is in addition to the other recruiting tools and incentives such as signing and retention bonuses. 
Moving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A increased $13 million in the quarter. This increase was largely driven by 3 factors: first, it reflects the investments we're making behind information technology, commercial and supply chain productivity initiatives that should improve our operations over the long term. About $4 million this quarter represents nonrecurring ERP-related expenses; second, it reflects higher compensation and benefits expense; and third, it includes an additional $3 million of advertising and promotional support behind the launch of new branded items in our Retail segment. This increase compares to a low base in the prior year when we significantly reduced A&P activities at the onset of the pandemic. Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.20, down from $0.61 in the prior year, while adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $123 million, down from $202 million. 
Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment were up 12% in the quarter, with volume up 10% and price/mix up 2%. Overall, the segment's total shipments are trending above pre-pandemic levels due to strength in our North American chain restaurant business, especially at QSRs. Our international shipments in the quarter also approached pre-pandemic levels despite congestion at West Coast ports and the worldwide shipping container shortage continuing to disrupt our exports as well as softening demand in Asia due to the spread of the Delta variant. The 2% increase in price/mix reflected the benefit of higher prices charged for freight, inflation-driven price escalators and favorable customer mix. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expenses, declined 45% to $43 million. Input and transportation cost inflation as well as higher manufacturing cost per pound more than offset the benefit of higher sales volume and favorable price/mix. 
Moving to our Foodservice segment. Sales increased 36%, with volume up 35% and price/mix up 1%. The strong increase in sales volumes largely reflected the year-over-year recovery in shipments to small and regional restaurant chains and independently-owned restaurants. However, shipments to these end customers, along with restaurant traffic, slowed in August, due to the surge of the Delta variant across the U.S. Volume growth in August was also tempered by the inability to service full customer demand due to lower production run rates and throughput at our plants largely due to labor availability. 
Our shipments to noncommercial customers improved through the quarter as the education, lodging and entertainment channels continue to strengthen. Overall, noncommercial shipments were up sequentially to 75% to 80% of pre-pandemic levels from about 65% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in price/mix largely reflected pricing actions, including the benefit of higher prices charged for freight. Foodservice's product contribution margin rose 12% to $96 million. Higher sales volumes and favorable price/mix more than offset input and transportation cost inflation as well as higher manufacturing cost per pound. 
Moving to our Retail segment. Sales declined 14%, with volume down 15% and price/mix up 1%. The sales volume decline largely reflects lower shipments of private-label products, resulting from incremental losses of certain low-margin business. Sales of branded products were down slightly from a strong prior year quarter that benefited from very high in-home consumption demand due to the pandemic, but remain well above pre-pandemic levels. The increase in price/mix was largely driven by favorable price, including higher prices charged for freight. Retail's product contribution margin declined 59% to $15 million. Input and transportation cost inflation, higher manufacturing cost per pound, lower sales volumes and a $2 million increase in A&P expenses to support the launch of new products drove the decline. 
Let's move to our cash flow and liquidity position. In the first quarter, we generated more than $160 million of cash from operations. That's down about $90 million versus the prior year quarter due primarily to lower earnings. We spent nearly $80 million in capital expenditures and paid $34 million in dividends. We also bought back nearly $26 million worth of stock or about double what we have typically repurchased in prior quarters. During the quarter, we amended our revolver to increase its capacity from $750 million to $1 billion and extended its maturity date to August 2026. At the end of the first quarter, our revolver was undrawn, and we had nearly $790 million of cash on hand. Our total debt was about $2.75 billion and our net debt to EBITDA, including joint ventures ratio was 2.7x. 
Now let's turn to our updated outlook. We continue to expect our sales growth in fiscal 2022 to be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits. In the second quarter, we continue to anticipate sales growth will be largely driven by higher volumes as we lap a comparison to relatively soft shipments during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic. We expect price/mix will be up sequentially versus the 2% that we delivered in Q1 as the execution of pricing actions in all of our segments remain on track. 
For the second half of the year, we continue to expect our sales growth will reflect more of a balance of higher volume and improved price/mix as we begin to lap some of the softer volume comparisons from the prior year, and as the benefit from our earlier pricing actions continue to build. Our volume growth, however, may be tempered by global logistics disruptions and container shortages that affects both domestic and export shipments. It may also be tempered by lower factory production due to macro industry and labor challenges as well as a poor quality crop. 
With respect to earnings, we expect net income and adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, will continue to be pressured through fiscal 2022. That's a change from our previous expectation of earnings gradually approaching pre-pandemic levels in the second half of the year. Driving most of this change is our expectation of significantly higher potato costs resulting from poor yield and quality of the crops in our growing regions. We previously assumed a potato crop that approached historical averages. Outside of raw potatoes, we expect double-digit inflation for key production inputs such as edible oils, transportation and packaging to continue through fiscal 2022. We have previously assumed these costs would begin to gradually ease during the second half of the year. 
We also expect the macro challenges that have slowed the turnaround in our supply chain to continue through fiscal 2022. That said, we expect the labor and transportation actions that I described earlier, along with our Win As One productivity initiatives, will help us continue to gradually stabilize operations, improve production run rates and throughput, and manage costs as the year progresses. 
For the full year, we expect our gross margin may be at least 5 to 8 points below our normalized annual margin rate of 25% to 26%. While we recognize this is a wide range, it reflects the volatility and high degree of uncertainty regarding the cost pressures that I've discussed. Consistent with prior years, we'll have a better understanding of the crop's financial impact in the next couple of months, and we will provide an update when we release our second quarter results in early January. Below gross margin, we expect our quarterly SG&A expense will be in the high 90s as we continue our investments to improve our operations over the long term, while equity earnings will likely remain pressured, due to input cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs, both in Europe and the U.S. 
We've also updated a couple of our other targets for the year. First, we've reduced our capital expenditure estimate to $450 million from our previous estimate of $650 million to $700 million. This significant reduction is due to the timing of spend behind our large capital projects and effectively shift the spend into early 2023 -- fiscal 2023. Despite the shift in expenditures, our expansion projects in Idaho and China remain on track to open in the spring and fall of 2023, respectively. And second, we're reducing our estimated full year effective tax rate to approximately 22%, down from our previous estimate of between 23% and 24%. Our estimates for total interest expense of around $115 million and total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $190 million remain unchanged. 
So in summary, the strong recovery in demand helped fuel our top line growth in the first quarter, but higher manufacturing and distribution costs led to lower earnings. For fiscal 2022, we expect net sales growth will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits, but that our earnings will continue to be pressured for the remainder of the year due to higher potato costs from a poor crop and persistent inflationary and macro challenges. Nonetheless, we expect to begin to see earnings improve in the second quarter, behind our pricing actions and the steps we're taking to improve our costs. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

The international business has been -- with the container shortages challenges on the ports and the exports and even the containers coming in, we're essentially allocated a certain number of containers. So we're managing to that level based on our freight partners. And every day is a little bit different. So the team is doing a good job, making sure we're allocating the product to our key customers internationally, but it's a challenge. 
And on the flip side of that, that does -- as we look at our forecast weekly, we're managing the pile on production and other customers domestically to ensure they're getting their products. So it's a really dynamic situation with the containers and even the trucking and the rail and all those things. But essentially, we're managing to what we can ship based on our allocation of containers, and that's what we're dealing with. And as that frees up, and we get more containers available, that will help the exports to our international markets."

So I'm trying to think out if we just think ahead for a minute to fiscal '23, and just maybe if you play out the sort of the potential sort of puts and takes, what are the things that in theory could be more positive? Where are some of the things that maybe you still don't really have a lot of clarity on? So in other words, you're clearly putting a lot of pricing through, potentially could put more through. There's always a little bit of a timing lag, but one would think that's going to certainly better help you get a lot closer to where your costs are. I'm trying -- I'm struggling with like the labor piece. And are you making progress on that? Is it just slow? 
And I'm trying to get a sense if some of these negatives can kind of bleed into '23. Or is there a reason that there could be a pretty dramatic bounce back in operating margin and gross margins in '23? Like do the next 3 quarters give you enough time essentially, to figure out some of these issues? Or frankly, are some of these thorny enough that they could go beyond that?

It's just slow going. The thing that will take time is even within our supply chain and our suppliers' supply chain, it's disrupting our production and driving inefficiencies in our plants that we're doing a number of things to address that as well. And from last summer to now, it's just going to take more time. 
We are seeing progress. It's not as fast as we -- any of us want. But as I think through the next 3 quarters, where we will be a year from now, with the things we're doing in the company in terms of addressing inflation, adjusting how our supply chain -- we're focused on our supply chain differently, some of the actions we're taking. And a year from now, we're in a new potato crop, and that's going to be hopefully back in average normalized levels. We will have a certain amount of probably inflation over that time that we'll address. But everything we're doing, it's going to take time, Andrew. And the category is very healthy. 
And so we're preparing for it to -- with a number of capacity investments that we're doing right now. Our long-term strategy is sound.
