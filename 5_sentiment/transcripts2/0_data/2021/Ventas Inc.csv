On behalf of all my colleagues, we want to welcome you to the Ventas fourth quarter and year-end 2020 earnings call. 
Let me begin by expressing my deep gratitude and optimism, born of the strength, resilience and innovation so many have demonstrated over the past year, and the positive developments we are seeing on the ground in our portfolio virtually every day. Our results in the fourth quarter demonstrated Ventas' resilience, with normalized FFO reported at $0.83 a share and $0.74 at much appreciated funding from HHS to our senior living communities that have been affected by COVID-19. [indiscernible] reflected on the growing year we've all had. I couldn't be prouder of our productive and skilled team, our enterprise and our capable, dedicated partners. After a fast and positive start to 2020, the last year has been dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and punctuated by extreme weather disruptions, both of which have continued into the first quarter of 2021. Throughout, we've put the full force of our firm's resources and energy behind keeping people safe, demonstrating remarkable resilience and becoming part of the solution, whether in employee testing, advocacy or assistance to tenants and operators who needed it. 
Financially, through our 4 sites, our long-standing diversification strategy and our decisive actions, we've kept our enterprise strong and stable, generating almost the same EBITDA in 2020 as we did in 2019, and benefiting from our investments in people, systems and preparedness. 
Our balance sheet flexibility, and our embedded relationships with best-in-class partners. And we found ways to grow and advance our strategic objectives, including building value through acquisition and development in life sciences, investing in Le Groupe Maurice's attractive senior housing development pipeline, creating new partnerships, and establishing a third-party investment management platform that will provide more options for future growth. We remain committed to our core values of respect and integrity and accelerated our actions to promote sustainability, diversity and social justice in our company, our communities and our country. 
Finally, we were very fortunate to recently add 2 top notch directors to the company: one, a leader in health care; and the other in real estate and REITs. My gratitude and optimism also flow from the life-saving COVID-19 vaccine discovery by doctors and scientists in record time, and the recent acceleration of vaccine delivery by the big on administration. 
Nationally, ending COVID-19 is foundational to spur sustained economic recovery and restore vitality to so many businesses, households and workers. At Ventas, we're proud that 100% of our U.S. SHOP, AL and Memory Care Communities, have already received the vaccine, and nearly 90% of them will complete their second dose by the end of this month. Notably, senior housing vaccine delivery represents one of the shining successes in our fight against COVID-19. In our SHOP communities, it is wonderful to know that about 30,000 vulnerable residents have already been vaccinated and are one step closer to feeling safe, seeing loved one and enjoying a richer life. 
From our real-time data, we also know that confirmed COVID-19 cases in our communities have recently begun to improve significantly, creating an enhanced sense of well-being and enabling more operators to open communities to new move-ins. And leads at our communities built to their highest level since the pandemic began in January, once again demonstrated the strength of the value proposition of senior housing and the resilient demand for the services our care providers deliver. While we expect shop first quarter NOI and occupancy, which are lagging indicators, to decline sequentially as a result of November to January's extreme COVID-19 conditions. We are encouraged by the breadth and consistency of all positive leading indicators. Conditions remain dynamic, and it is too early to declare a definitive trend. But we like the picture we are starting to see. Post pandemic senior housing growth represents an incredibly significant value creation opportunity for our shareholders. 
Turning to our investment outlook. Our diversified asset base with 5 verticals has given us the ability to continue successfully allocated capital over time and through cycles. For example, we've created tremendous value since our early cycle investments in our Research & Innovation business in 2016. We continue to find meaningful opportunities to drive that business forward, in both ground-up development and asset acquisitions with universities and in cluster markets alike. Our decision to add life sciences to our enterprise has provided an uplift to our results, our investment activity and our value. 
Here are a couple of current examples. Our $280 million life sciences project, known as one new city in the thriving research submarket of Philadelphia, which is book ended by Penn and Drexel, is attracting significant leasing interest. In addition to the nearly $1 billion ground-up development projects already underway, our university based development pipeline continues to hold about another $1 billion in active potential projects with both new and existing university relationships. In particular, with Wexford, we are in the design development phase of a nearly $0.5 billion project with a major research University on the West Coast that is substantially pre-leased. We look forward to sharing more information with you later this year. Outside of Research & Innovation, we continue to allocate capital to develop large Class A independent living communities with our partner, LGM in Qu√©bec. We've had 5 projects underway with investment also totaling nearly $0.5 billion, and 2 of the projects were delivered in the fourth quarter. We are pleased to report that the 2 open communities have leased up quickly, and occupancy is already nearly 80%. In addition, our pipeline of potential acquisitions in all 5 of our verticals is active and growing. We continue to invest with an eye towards growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk-adjusted return. We will also continue to evaluate and execute opportunities to recycle capital as well. Both Justin and Pete have been working with our deal team to target about $1 billion of dispositions during the year to optimize our portfolio. 
Finally, our institutional investment Capital management platform continues to grow and succeed with well over $3 billion in assets under management. Bringing together our pre-existing and new third-party capital vehicles under 1 umbrella, the Ventas Investment Management business includes our life sciences and health care funds. The Ventas fund stands out as one of the most successful launches of a first-time real estate fund in any asset class. Our investment management platform provides a significant competitive advantage to Ventas. It broadens our capital sources, augments our investment capacity, expands our footprint, leverages our team and industry expertise, improves our financial flexibility and liquidity and adds an incremental source of earnings. There is tremendous market opportunity within life science, medical office and senior housing real estate, and we are well positioned to capitalize, capitalize on it in multiple ways. 
In closing, let me reiterate that demographically driven demand is right in front of us. The leading indicators in senior housing are improving rapidly. Vaccine delivery is accelerating, and the long-term basis for all of our asset classes and for Ventas remains firmly positive. All of us at Ventas have an abiding commitment to staying strong and steady and winning the recovery on behalf of all of our stakeholders. 
Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Justin Hutchens."
398549,702559887,2215448,"Ventas, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Debbie. I'd like to begin by highlighting the fourth quarter performance and first quarter performance expectations. First, I would like to mention that we are humbled and grateful that HHS continues to recognize the crucial role senior livin",1149,"Thank you, Debbie. I'd like to begin by highlighting the fourth quarter performance and first quarter performance expectations. 
First, I would like to mention that we are humbled and grateful that HHS continues to recognize the crucial role senior living plays in protecting vulnerable older Americans. Through the Cares Act, HHS has provided several rounds of funding to assisted living communities to partially mitigate losses directly suffered because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Through this program applicable to sequential same-store shop assets, our communities have received $34 million in the fourth quarter and $13 million to date in the first quarter, which has been applied as a contract expense to offset COVID-19-related expenses incurred. 
After a challenging fourth quarter and January, in which the national spread of COVID-19 at all-time highs, our communities experienced an increase in resident cases, and we had more communities close to move-ins. Leading indicators have followed a similar pattern. Leads and move-ins drifted down throughout November and December, while at the same time, move-outs were elevated. Although the fourth quarter was a challenging quarter, we are pleased our occupancy hung in there with a 90 basis point decline. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the first quarter. For the forecast Q1 sequential same-store SHOP portfolio, we expect cash NOI to decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, excluding HHS grants of $34 million and $13 million to date in each respective period. This NOI deterioration is driven by a 250 to 325 basis point expected occupancy declined, partially offset by a modest rate increase. We expect to see continued elevated operating expenses into the first quarter. And while we are seeing continued high levels of COVID-related costs, these are partially mitigated by $13 million of Phase III HHS grant money received to date in the first quarter. I'll add that recent severe winter weather across the country could cause additional expenses as well as delays in move-ins. We haven't included any impacts, if any, in our guidance. 
While we are experiencing choppy waters at this stage of pandemic, I would like to highlight green shoots that support a more optimistic outlook ahead. I'll start by highlighting our improving clinical trends. Consistent with the U.S. COVID case trends, our SHOP communities are experiencing a significant decline in new COVID cases. In the most recent week, we are averaging 9 cases per day, which is the lowest since October and down from 92 cases per day at the peak in January. We couldn't be more relieved about this improvement, knowing this means less illness and less people potentially dying from COVID. 
This positive clinical trend is also important to local health departments support of our community's ability to accept new move-ins and to offer a more robust living experience for our residents. I'd like to comment on the early success our operators have had deploying the vaccine to residents and employees within our Shop portfolio. 
As Debbie mentioned, 100% of our assisted living and memory care communities have hosted their first vaccine clinic. In other good news related to the vaccine, 2 studies from Spain and Israel have come out showing favorable data that people who are vaccinated and still contract COVID-19 are far less likely to spread the illness to others than if they were not vaccinated. 
The execution of the vaccine is a massively important step towards the stabilization and growth in our senior housing platform.  I'll note that 95% of our communities are already open to move-ins, which is near a pandemic high. 
I'll remind you of the importance of the segments mentioned in our business update. Currently, 80% of our communities are operating in segment 3. This is up from 64% a month ago. Segment 3 is the least restrictive operating environment. The communities in this segment offer a more robust living experience includes a more open dining experience and small group activities. Most importantly, it allows for a less restrictive visitation between residents and their loved ones. As more communities expand their service offering, demand for our services should improve. Leads and move-ins started to pick up again in January with the highest number of leads we have witnessed since the beginning of the pandemic. We have seen broad-based strength in lead volume across regions, and the initial indication is that this momentum has continued into February. The increase in leads have been bolstered by very strong growth in our group arise portfolio in Canada, and consistent strong lead performance by Atria in the U.S. To summarize our optimism, new COVID cases down, vaccine distribution on track, leading to a more robust living experience in all combining to support higher leads. We continue to monitor these positive trends on a real-time basis and remain focused on supporting our operating partners as they get positioned to win the recovery. 
Moving on to triple-net senior housing. In the fourth quarter and through January, Ventas received all of its expected triple net senior housing cash rent. Our underlying triple-net senior housing portfolio performance continues to be impacted by COVID-19. However, due to a mix of lease resolutions executed in 2020, government subsidies, including PPP loans and HHS funds and other tenant resources, our tenants have continued to pay as expected. 
Our trailing 12-month cash flow of coverage for senior housing is 1.3x, respectively. 
I'll comment on the senior housing industry outlook. Our competitive outlook has continued to evolve amid the pandemic. In 2020, construction starts nationally were down 50% year-over-year, and deliveries were at their lowest level since 2013. Our SHOP markets witnessed particularly favorable supply trends, with starts down 66 versus the prior -- 66% versus the prior year, and delivery is down over 40%. We are optimistic about the long-term impact from lower construction starts. Fewer starts today, combined with the compelling aging demographic trends where the 80-plus population is expected to grow nearly 15% between now and 2024, which is 5x faster than the broader population will provide a potent tailwind over the next few years. Moving on to final comments. 
I'd like to comment on the tremendous job well done, our operator partners and frontline staff have done prioritizing the health and safety of our residents and employees throughout a very challenging period. We couldn't be more proud of their focus, determination, courage and perseverance throughout the pandemic. I'd also like to note our excitement and support for JAck [indiscernible], the new CEO of Sunrise Senior Living. 
We know Jack to be an accomplished and charismatic leader who is extremely qualified to lead Sunrise. I'll finish by reiterating our optimistic outlook as we consider the improving clinical trends, vaccine rollout, communities, opening for move-ins with a more robust living experience. And post pandemic supply demand tailwinds that give us continued confidence and a very strong positive growth trajectory in senior housing. 
With that, I'll hand the call to Pete."

I'll cover the office and health care triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent 47% of Ventas' NOI. They continue to produce strong results, showcasing their value proposition and financial strength amongst the pandemic. In fact, for the full year 2020, these segments combined to generate same-store cash NOI growth of 3%. First, I'll cover office, MOBs in Research & Innovation centers. The 2 lines of business within our office portfolio, they play a key role in the delivery of crucial health care services and research for life-saving vaccines and therapeutics. The office portfolio continued to provide steady growth, delivering $128 million, a same-store cash NOI in the fourth quarter. This represents a 1.5% sequential growth, led by our R&I portfolio, which generated 3.6% same-store cash NOI growth. 
Moreover, full year office same-store cash NOI grew 3.3% versus 2019, near the midpoint of original 2020 office guidance of 3% to 4% despite the impacts of COVID-19. Normalizing for a paid parking shortfall increased cleaning costs due to COVID, same-store cash NOI grew 4.5%, surpassing our pre-COVID guidance range. 
In terms of rent receipts, office tenants paid an industry-leading 99.2% of contractual rent in the fourth quarter. For the entire period, from April through December, tenants paid 99.4% of contractual rent. This is without D docs or deferrals, which were de minimis. Substantially, all granted deferrals have been repaid and new deferrals were negligible during the fourth quarter. Continuing the trend, we have collected 98% of January contractual rents, on track to meet or exceed the fourth quarter collection rate. February today collection results are also strong, and are at a consistent pace when compared to the fourth quarter. This strong performance is enabled by the mission-critical nature of our portfolio and by our high-quality creditworthy tenancy. In our medical office portfolio, nearly 85% of our NOI comes from investment-grade rated tenants and HCA. 
In our R&I portfolio, a 76% of our revenues come directly from investment-grade rated organizations and publicly traded companies. Medical office had a record level retention of 88% for the fourth quarter and 87% for the trailing 12 months. Driven by this retention, total office leasing was 700,000 square feet for the quarter and 3.4 million square feet for the full year 2020. This includes 540,000 square feet of new leasing. Total leasing far exceeded our pre-COVID 2020 plan. All of our MOB properties are an elective surgery restriction free locations. As a result, we are seeing positive utilization trends that mirror increased admissions and surgery volumes being reported by the health systems. As an example, paid parking receipts during the second quarter of 2020 were only 46% of normal. During the fourth quarter, however, paid parking recovered to 71% of normal. As Debbie mentioned, we continue to be excited about the office business and particularly investment opportunities in the R&I space. In the fourth quarter, we closed our acquisition of the 3 asset, 800,000 square foot Trophy life sciences portfolio in San Francisco. Since last quarter's announcement, we have renewed a large tenant, and signed 2 new leases, bringing the building to 100% leased, a clear demonstration of the attractiveness of these buildings to the marketplace. 
We also opened our $80 million RNI development on the campus of Arizona state located within the Phoenix Biomedical campus, a 30-acre innovation district established by the city of Phoenix in the heart of downtown. The building is over 50% pre-leased and is ahead of pro forma. 
Now let's turn to health care triple-net. During the fourth quarter, our health care triple-net assets showed continued strength. We have received 100% of fourth quarter rents as well as 100% of January and 100% of February rents. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage improved sequentially for all our health care triple net asset classes, except skilled nursing, despite COVID-19. Acute and post-acute providers had early access to significant government funding to create liquidity and mitigate pandemic related losses. Acute care hospitals trailing 12-month coverage, was a strong 3.3 in the third quarter, a 20 basis point sequential improvement, driven by a rebound in elective surgical procedures, prudent expense management as well as government funding. Ardent continues to perform extremely well in this dynamic market condition and all of ardent's hospitals reside in jurisdictions that are open for elective procedures. We are excited to continue growing with ardent. 
During the fourth quarter, Ardent opened a new outpatient cancer center on the campus, their hospital in Amarillo, Texas. The cancer center features best-in-class equipment and facilities for radiation therapy, chemotherapy and cancer care. We invested approximately $30 million and a near 8% stabilized yield. [ Earth ] and LTAC coverage improved 10 basis points to 1.6x in the third quarter, buoyed by strong business results and government funding. In particular, Kindred has demonstrated its core competency in treating complex patient cases. Census levels continued to be very high. 
And finally, within our loan portfolio, our Colony, Holiday and Brookdale loans are all fully current. I'd like to close with a thank you, a sincere thank you to our frontline staff who have kept these critical facilities open during this difficult time. You are all heroes. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

In my remarks today, I'll cover our 2020 enterprise fourth quarter results, our expectations for the first quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities. Let's start with our fourth quarter financial perfor",659,"Thanks, Pete. In my remarks today, I'll cover our 2020 enterprise fourth quarter results, our expectations for the first quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities. 
Let's start with our fourth quarter financial performance. Ventas reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.29 per share, and normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per share or $0.74, excluding the $0.09 and HHS grants received in SHOP in Q4. Other sequential fourth quarter drivers to highlight, include $0.04 of income recorded in our unconsolidated entities, offset by a $0.05 Q4 sequential decline in NOI, principally in SHOP. Meanwhile, office and triple-net healthcare was stable on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. That's a good segue way to our Q1 guidance as Q4 is an appropriate start point for our first quarter 2021 expectations. The key components of our Q1 guidance are as follows: net income attributable to common stockholders is estimated to range between minus $0.07 and minus $0.01 per fully diluted share; normalized FFO is forecast to range from $0.66 to $0.71 per share; the midpoint of our FFO guidance, $0.68 per share, represents a $0.15 sequential decline from the fourth quarter. This change can be largely explained by a $0.09 reduction in HHS grant income and income from unconsolidated entities. The balance is driven by a $0.05 reduction in organic SHOP NOI performance. A few of the key SHOP Q1 assumptions, include Q1 2021 average occupancy ranging from 250 to 325 basis points lower versus the fourth quarter average, sequential growth in REVPOR as a result of the annual in-place rent increases implemented at the start of 2021 and continued elevated levels of operating expenses driven by COVID labor and testing. Outside of SHOP, we expect our property NOI to be stable on a sequential basis in the first quarter. A normalized FFO per share bridge from our fourth quarter to our first quarter 2021 guidance midpoint, together with key assumptions can be found in our press release and our business update presentation posted to our website today. 
I'll close with our balance sheet and capital activity. I'm proud of the actions the Ventas team has taken to manage our balance sheet, leverage and liquidity. We have navigated the disruption created by COVID, and kept Ventas strong and stable while protecting shareholder capital. I'd highlight a few of our most recent actions and results. First, some key stats from 2020. We finished 2020 with full year net debt-to-EBITDA of 6.1x, maintained a strong maturity profile with duration exceeding 6 years, had held total debt to gross asset value at 37%, reduced our net debt at year-end by over $500 million year-over-year, and retained robust liquidity exceeding $3 billion. 
In 2020, we also took advantage of the strong bid for health care real estate, and realized over $1 billion in asset sales at a blended 5.3% cash yield. 
In 2021, we're targeting an additional $1 billion in asset sales across our verticals in the second half of the year. Proceeds from dispositions are expected to be used to reduce debt and to fund future growth through development and redevelopment capital spend. In January 2021, we closed on a new 4-year $2.75 billion unsecured credit facility. We had great demand from 24 new and incumbent financial institutions, and we're able to realize better pricing. 
I'd like to personally thank our banking partners for their support of Ventas. They are critical to our success. 
And finally, in March 2021, Ventas will use cash on hand from recent dispositions to reduce our near-term maturities by full year repaying $400 million of our 3.1% senior notes due January 2023. As a result of these and other actions, we're positioned to capitalize on the powerful upside across our business once the pandemic is finally in the rearview mirror.

With what we're focused on going forward is there continues to be significant billions remaining in the HHS fund, well, first of all, Phase III could result in additional funding, that's an unknown. There's also multiple tens of billions remaining in the HHS Fund, which hopefully can be utilized beyond Phase III to support the health care providers at large, including senior housing. And then in terms of additional coved release packages, we would endeavor to make the case that some of those funds should be either earmarked for or certainly available to be used to mitigate the continuing impact of COVID-19 on the 1 to 2 million seniors, who are cared for in senior living.

So I mentioned I'll try like to step back for a second and just reiterate the underlying demand that the operators are facing and how they're trying to play into that. I had mentioned before that leads are very strong, and we're missing parts of the typical lead bank that could help bolster things. But if you look back a little bit, and you look back into September, October, if you look at our leads and our move-ins, you can see that we're running 80% and 90%, respectively, no vaccine in sight at the time. So the underlying demand remains really strong, our operators are well aware of that. We even had, at that time in October, almost 60% of our communities that are achieving 100% or more of their prior to Co bid typical move in run rate. So all of that bodes well. And as operators have tried to play into that. And with the backdrop of, of course, the clinical trends they were facing throughout the end of last year, beginning of this year, they're taking different approaches. One I'll highlight is Atria. I mentioned that they've bolstered our overall lead growth and volume, and they've done that with the help of discounting, and it's worked. Because they've had higher occupancy, higher leads as a result. We've had others that have been a little more local market focus, holding back a little bit to preserve rate. And that worked as well. And moving ahead, I think what every operator is focused on is a wide variety of different referral sources that they've relied in the past, how to rejuvenate those moving forward and to play into that, that the optimistic kind of supply demand outlook I gave as well as the trends that are positioning our communities 6 set move-ins again."

So you do have -- your EBITDA is probably closer to the low 1s, if I'm not wrong. And you have at a minimum 4 years left on maturity for a lot of these leases that are kind of in that range or below. So I'm just wondering if there is a need or thought or are you just to adjust rents or convert some of these to RIDEA? And could you just clarify in that the cash flow coverage. I may be thinking wrong about this. But in the quarter or historically, are there -- just the last 2 quarters, is there any -- the provider funds or the relief funds?

And that's been really helpful, and we received significant cash upfront as well as participation in the upside through either warrants or conversions to management contracts. So those have been really well received and rightly. So our operators, as you mentioned, really have been the beneficiaries in some cases of government funding that would principally be in the fourth quarter. Of course, that would benefit coverage. But our statistics are really through the end of the third quarter, which is always on a 1 quarter lag, as you know. So So they will be factored in. They'll be called out separately as we have with some of the health care providers in the supplemental materials. And so you'll be able to do your own analysis. But again, remember that the funding is really intended to be a bridge, if you will, to replace NOI that would otherwise be there, and hopefully will otherwise be there in the future.

On behalf of all my colleagues, we want to welcome you to the Ventas Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2020 Earnings Call. Let me begin by expressing my deep gratitude and optimism, borne of the strength, resilience and innovation so many have demonstrated over the past year and the positive developments we are seeing on the ground in our portfolio virtually every day. 
Our results in the fourth quarter demonstrated Ventas' resilience with normalized FFO reported at $0.83 a share and $0.74 at much appreciated funding from HHS to our senior living communities that have been affected by COVID-19. I've reflected on the grueling year we've all had. I couldn't be prouder of our productive and skilled teams, our enterprise and our capable, dedicated partners. 
After a fast and positive start to 2020, the last year has been dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and punctuated by extreme weather disruptions, both of which have continued into the first quarter of 2021. Throughout, we've put the full force of our firm's resources and energy behind keeping people safe, demonstrating remarkable resilience and becoming part of the solution, whether in employee testing, advocacy or assistance to tenants and operators who needed it. 
Financially, through our foresight, our longstanding diversification strategy and our decisive actions, we've kept our enterprise strong and stable, generating almost the same EBITDA in 2020 as we did in 2019 and benefiting from our investments in people, systems and preparedness, our balance sheet flexibility and our embedded relationships with best-in-class partners. 
And we found ways to grow and advance our strategic objectives, including building value through acquisition and development in life sciences, investing in Le Groupe Maurice's attractive senior housing development pipeline, creating new partnerships and establishing a third-party investment management platform that will provide more options for future growth. 
We remain committed to our core values of respect and integrity and accelerated our actions to promote sustainability, diversity and social justice in our company, our communities and our country. Finally, we were very fortunate to recently add 2 topnotch directors to the company: one, a leader in health care; and the other in real estate and REITs. 
My gratitude and optimism also flow from the life-saving COVID-19 vaccine discovery by doctors and scientists in record time and the recent acceleration of vaccine delivery by the Biden administration. Nationally, ending COVID-19 is foundational to spur sustained economic recovery and restore vitality to so many businesses, households and workers. 
At Ventas, we're proud that 100% of our U.S. SHOP, AL and memory care communities have already received the vaccine. And nearly 90% of them will complete their second dose by the end of this month. Notably, senior housing vaccine delivery represents one of the shining successes in our fight against COVID-19. In our SHOP communities, it is wonderful to know that about 30,000 vulnerable residents have already been vaccinated and are one step closer to feeling safe, seeing loved ones and enjoying a richer life. 
From our real-time data, we also know that confirmed COVID-19 cases in our communities have recently begun to improve significantly, creating an enhanced sense of well-being and enabling more operators to open communities to new move-ins. And leads at our communities built to their highest level since the pandemic began in January, once again demonstrating the strength of the value proposition of senior housing and the resilient demand for the services our care providers deliver. 
While we expect SHOP's first quarter NOI and occupancy, which are lagging indicators, to decline sequentially as a result of November to January's extreme COVID-19 conditions, we are encouraged by the breadth and consistency of all positive leading indicators. Conditions remain dynamic, and it is too early to declare a definitive trend. But we like the picture we are starting to see. Post-pandemic senior housing growth represents an incredibly significant value creation opportunity for our shareholders. 
Turning to our investment outlook. Our diversified asset base with 5 verticals has given us the ability to continue successfully allocating capital over time and through cycles. For example, we've created tremendous value since our early cycle investments in our Research & Innovation business in 2016. We continue to find meaningful opportunities to drive that business forward in both ground-up development and asset acquisitions with universities and in cluster markets alike. 
Our decision to add life sciences to our enterprise has provided an uplift to our results, our investment activity and our value. Here are a couple of current examples. Our $280 million life sciences project, known as One uCity, in the thriving research submarket of Philadelphia, which is bookended by Penn and Drexel, is attracting significant leasing interest. 
In addition to the nearly $1 billion ground-up development projects already underway, our university-based development pipeline continues to hold about another $1 billion in active potential projects with both new and existing university relationships. In particular, with Wexford, we are in the design development phase of a nearly $0.5 billion project with a major research university on the West Coast that is substantially pre-leased. We look forward to sharing more information with you later this year. 
Outside of Research & Innovation, we continue to allocate capital to develop large Class A independent living communities with our partner, LGM, in Qu√©bec. We've had 5 projects underway with investment also totaling nearly $0.5 billion. And 2 of the projects were delivered in the fourth quarter. We are pleased to report that the 2 open communities have leased up quickly and occupancy is already nearly 80%. 
In addition, our pipeline of potential acquisitions in all 5 of our verticals is active and growing. We continue to invest with an eye towards growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk-adjusted returns. We will also continue to evaluate and execute opportunities to recycle capital as well. Both Justin and Pete have been working with our deal team to target about $1 billion of dispositions during the year to optimize our portfolio. 
Finally, our institutional investment capital management platform continues to grow and succeed with well over $3 billion in assets under management. Bringing together our pre-existing and new third-party capital vehicles under one umbrella, the Ventas Investment Management business includes our life sciences and health care funds. The Ventas Fund stands out as one of the most successful launches of a first-time real estate fund in any asset class. 
Our investment management platform provides a significant competitive advantage to Ventas. It broadens our capital sources, augments our investment capacity, expands our footprint, leverages our team and industry expertise, improves our financial flexibility and liquidity and adds an incremental source of earnings. There is tremendous market opportunity within life science, medical office and senior housing real estate. And we are well positioned to capitalize on it in multiple ways. 
In closing, let me reiterate that demographically driven demand is right in front of us. The leading indicators in senior housing are improving rapidly. Vaccine delivery is accelerating. And the long-term thesis for all of our asset classes and for Ventas remains firmly positive. All of us at Ventas have an abiding commitment to staying strong and steady and winning the recovery on behalf of all of our stakeholders. 
Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Justin Hutchens."

I'd like to begin by highlighting the fourth quarter performance and first quarter performance expectations. First, I would like to mention that we are humbled and grateful that HHS continues to recognize the crucial role senior livin",1141,"Thank you, Debbie. I'd like to begin by highlighting the fourth quarter performance and first quarter performance expectations. 
First, I would like to mention that we are humbled and grateful that HHS continues to recognize the crucial role senior living plays in protecting vulnerable older Americans. Through the CARES Act, HHS has provided several rounds of funding to assisted living communities to partially mitigate losses directly suffered because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this program, applicable to sequential same-store SHOP assets, our communities have received $34 million in the fourth quarter and $13 million to date in the first quarter, which has been applied as a contract expense to offset COVID-19-related expenses incurred. 
After a challenging fourth quarter and January in which the national spread of COVID-19 hit all-time highs, our communities experienced an increase in resident cases and we had more communities closed to move-ins. Leading indicators have followed a similar pattern. Leads and move-ins drifted down throughout November and December while at the same time, move-outs were elevated. Although the fourth quarter was a challenging quarter, we are pleased that our occupancy hung in there with a 90 basis point decline. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the first quarter. For the forecast Q1 sequential same-store SHOP portfolio, we expect cash NOI to decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, excluding HHS grants of $34 million and $13 million to date in each respective period. This NOI deterioration is driven by a 250 to 325 basis point expected occupancy decline, partially offset by a modest rate increase. We expect to see continued elevated operating expenses into the first quarter. 
And while we are seeing continued high levels of COVID-related costs, these are partially mitigated by $13 million of Phase 3 HHS grant money received to date in the first quarter. I'll add that recent severe winter weather across the country could cause additional expenses as well as delays in move-ins. We haven't included any impacts, if any, in our guidance. 
While we are experiencing choppy waters at this stage of the pandemic, I would like to highlight green shoots that support a more optimistic outlook ahead. I'll start by highlighting our improving clinical trends. Consistent with the U.S. COVID case trends, our SHOP communities are experiencing a significant decline in new COVID cases. In the most recent week, we are averaging 9 cases per day, which is the lowest since October and down from 92 cases per day at the peak in January. We couldn't be more relieved about this improvement, knowing this means less illness and less people potentially dying from COVID. 
This positive clinical trend is also important to local health departments' support of our communities' ability to accept new move-ins and to offer a more robust living experience for our residents. I'd like to comment on the early success our operators have had deploying the vaccine to residents and employees within our SHOP portfolio. As Debbie mentioned, 100% of our assisted living and memory care communities have hosted their first vaccine clinic. 
In other good news related to the vaccine, 2 studies from Spain and Israel have come out showing favorable data that people who are vaccinated and still contract COVID-19 are far less likely to spread the illness to others than if they were not vaccinated. The execution of the vaccine is a massively important step towards the stabilization and growth in our senior housing platform. I'll note that 95% of our communities are already open to move-ins, which is near our pandemic high. 
I'll remind you of the importance of the segments mentioned in our business update. Currently, 80% of our communities are operating in segment 3. This is up from 64% a month ago. Segment 3 is the least restrictive operating environment. The communities in this segment offer a more robust living experience, includes a more open dining experience and small group activities. Most importantly, it allows for less restrictive visitation between residents and their loved ones. As more communities expand their service offering, demand for our services should improve. 
Leads and move-ins started to pick up again in January with the highest number of leads we have witnessed since the beginning of the pandemic. We have seen broad-based strength in lead volume across regions. And the initial indication is that this momentum has continued into February. The increase in leads have been bolstered by very strong growth in our Le Groupe Maurice portfolio in Canada and consistent strong lead performance by Atria in the U.S. 
To summarize our optimism, new COVID cases down, vaccine distribution on track, leading to a more robust living experience and all combining to support higher leads. We continue to monitor these positive trends on a real-time basis and remain focused on supporting our operating partners as they get positioned to win the recovery. 
Moving on to triple-net senior housing. In the fourth quarter and through January, Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rents. Our underlying triple-net senior housing portfolio performance continues to be impacted by COVID-19. However, due to a mix of lease resolutions executed in 2020, government subsidies, including PPP loans and HHS funds and other tenant resources, our tenants have continued to pay as expected. Our trailing 12-month cash flow coverage for senior housing is 1.3x, respectively. 
I'll comment on the senior housing industry outlook. Our competitive outlook has continued to evolve amid the pandemic. In 2020, construction starts nationally were down 50% year-over-year and deliveries were at their lowest levels since 2013. Our SHOP markets witnessed particularly favorable supply trends with starts down 66% versus the prior year and deliveries down over 40%. We are optimistic about the long-term impact from lower construction starts. Fewer starts today, combined with the compelling aging demographic trends, where the 80-plus population is expected to grow nearly 15% between now and 2024, which is 5x faster than the broader population, will provide a potent tailwind over the next few years. 
Moving on to final comments. I'd like to comment on the tremendous job well done our operator partners and frontline staff have done prioritizing the health and safety of our residents and employees throughout a very challenging period. We couldn't be more proud of their focus, determination, courage and perseverance throughout the pandemic. I'd also like to note our excitement in support for Jack Callison, the new CEO of Sunrise Senior Living. We know Jack to be an accomplished and charismatic leader who is extremely qualified to lead Sunrise. 
I'll finish by reiterating our optimistic outlook as we consider the improving clinical trends, vaccine rollout, communities opening for move-ins with a more robust living experience and post-pandemic supply-demand tailwinds that give us continued confidence and a very strong positive growth trajectory in senior housing. 
With that, I'll hand the call to Pete."
398549,702559887,2215757,"Ventas, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Justin. I'll cover the Office and health care triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent 47% of Ventas' NOI. They continue to produce strong results, showcasing their value proposition and financial strength amongst the pandemic. In f",865,"Thanks, Justin. I'll cover the Office and health care triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent 47% of Ventas' NOI. They continue to produce strong results, showcasing their value proposition and financial strength amongst the pandemic. In fact, for the full year 2020, these segments combined to generate same-store cash NOI growth of 3%. 
First, I'll cover Office. MOBs and Research & Innovation centers, the 2 lines of business within our Office portfolio, they play a key role in the delivery of crucial health care services and research for life-saving vaccines and therapeutics. The office portfolio continued to provide steady growth, delivering $128 million of same-store cash NOI in the fourth quarter. This represents a 1.5% sequential growth, led by our R&I portfolio, which generated 3.6% same-store cash NOI growth. 
Moreover, full year Office same-store cash NOI grew 3.3% versus 2019, near the midpoint of original 2020 Office guidance of 3% to 4% despite the impacts of COVID-19. Normalizing for a pay parking shortfall and increased cleaning cost due to COVID, same-store cash NOI grew 4.5%, surpassing our pre-COVID guidance range. 
In terms of rent receipts, Office tenants paid an industry-leading 99.2% of contractual rent in the fourth quarter. For the entire period, from April through December, tenants paid 99.4% of contractual rent. This is without deducts or deferrals, which were de minimis. Substantially, all granted deferrals have been repaid and new deferrals were negligible during the fourth quarter. Continuing the trend, we have collected 98% of January contractual rents, on track to meet or exceed the fourth quarter collection rate. February to  date collection results are also strong and are at a consistent pace when compared to the fourth quarter. 
This strong performance is enabled by the mission-critical nature of our portfolio and by our high-quality, creditworthy tenancy. In our medical office portfolio, nearly 85% of our NOI comes from investment-grade-rated tenants and HCA. In our R&I portfolio, a 76% of our revenues come directly from investment-grade-rated organizations and publicly traded companies. Medical office had a record level retention of 88% for the fourth quarter and 87% for the trailing 12 months. 
Driven by this retention, total Office leasing was 700,000 square feet for the quarter and 3.4 million square feet for the full year of 2020. This includes 540,000 square feet of new leasing. Total leasing far exceeded our pre-COVID 2020 plan. All of our MOB properties are in elective surgery restriction-free locations. As a result, we are seeing positive utilization trends that mirror increased admissions and surgery volumes being reported by the health systems. As an example, pay parking receipts during the second quarter of 2020 were only 46% of normal. During the fourth quarter, however, pay parking recovered to 71% of normal. 
As Debbie mentioned, we continue to be excited about the Office business and particularly investment opportunities in the R&I space. In the fourth quarter, we closed our acquisition of the 3-asset, 800,000-square foot trophy life sciences portfolio in San Francisco. Since last quarter's announcement, we have renewed a large tenant and signed 2 new leases, bringing the building to 100% leased, a clear demonstration of the attractiveness of these buildings to the marketplace. We also opened our $80 million R&I development on the campus of Arizona State, located within the Phoenix Biomedical Campus, a 30-acre innovation district established by the city of Phoenix in the heart of downtown. The building is over 50% pre-leased and is ahead of pro forma. 
Now let's turn to health care triple-net. During the fourth quarter, our health care triple-net assets showed continued strength. We have received 100% of fourth quarter rents as well as 100% of January and 100% of February rents. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage improved sequentially for all our health care triple-net asset classes, except skilled nursing despite COVID-19. Acute and post-acute providers had early access to significant government funding to create liquidity and mitigate pandemic-related losses. 
Acute care hospitals' trailing 12-month coverage was a strong 3.3 in the third quarter, a 20 basis point sequential improvement, driven by a rebound in elective surgical procedures, prudent expense management as well as government funding. Ardent continues to perform extremely well in this dynamic market condition. And all of Ardent's hospitals reside in jurisdictions that are open for elective procedures. We are excited to continue growing with Ardent. During the fourth quarter, Ardent opened a new outpatient cancer center on the campus in their hospital in Amarillo, Texas. The cancer center features best-in-class equipment and facilities for radiation therapy, chemotherapy and cancer care. 
We invested approximately $30 million at a near 8% stabilized yield. IRF and LTAC coverage improved 10 basis points to 1.6x in the third quarter, buoyed by strong business results and government funding.

In my remarks today, I'll cover our 2020 enterprise fourth quarter results, our expectations for the first quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities. Let's start with our fourth quarter financial perfor",659,"Thanks, Pete. In my remarks today, I'll cover our 2020 enterprise fourth quarter results, our expectations for the first quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities. 
Let's start with our fourth quarter financial performance. Ventas reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.29 per share and normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per share or $0.74, excluding the $0.09 in HHS grants received in SHOP in Q4. Other sequential fourth quarter drivers to highlight include $0.04 of income recorded in our unconsolidated entities, offset by a $0.05 Q4 sequential decline in NOI, principally in SHOP. Meanwhile, Office and triple-net healthcare was stable on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. 
That's a good segue way to our Q1 guidance as Q4 is an appropriate start point for our first quarter 2021 expectations. The key components of our Q1 guidance are as follows. Net income attributable to common stockholders is estimated to range between minus $0.07 and minus $0.01 per fully diluted share. Normalized FFO is forecast to range from $0.66 to $0.71 per share. The midpoint of our FFO guidance, $0.68 per share, represents a $0.15 sequential decline from the fourth quarter. This change can be largely explained by a $0.09 reduction in HHS grant income and income from unconsolidated entities. The balance is driven by a $0.05 reduction in organic SHOP NOI performance. 
A few of the key SHOP Q1 assumptions include Q1 2021 average occupancy ranging from 250 to 325 basis points lower versus the fourth quarter average; sequential growth in REVPOR as a result of the annual in-place rent increases implemented at the start of 2021; and continued elevated levels of operating expenses, driven by COVID labor and testing. Outside of SHOP, we expect our property NOI to be stable on a sequential basis in the first quarter. A normalized FFO per share bridge from our fourth quarter to our first quarter 2021 guidance midpoint, together with key assumptions, can be found in our press release and our business update presentation posted to our website today. 
I'll close with our balance sheet and capital activity. I am proud of the actions the Ventas team has taken to manage our balance sheet, leverage and liquidity. We have navigated the disruption created by COVID and kept Ventas strong and stable while protecting shareholder capital. I'd highlight a few of our most recent actions and results. 
First, some key stats from 2020. We finished 2020 with full year net debt-to-EBITDA of 6.1x, maintained a strong maturity profile with duration exceeding 6 years, had held total debt to gross asset value at 37%, reduced our net debt at year-end by over $500 million year-over-year and retained robust liquidity exceeding $3 billion. 
In 2020, we also took advantage of the strong bid for health care real estate and realized over $1 billion in asset sales at a blended 5.3% cash yield. In 2021, we're targeting an additional $1 billion in asset sales across our verticals in the second half of the year. Proceeds from dispositions are expected to be used to reduce debt and to fund future growth through development and redevelopment capital spend. 
In January 2021, we closed on a new 4-year $2.75 billion unsecured credit facility. We had great demand from 24 new and incumbent financial institutions and we're able to realize better pricing. I'd like to personally thank our banking partners for their support of Ventas. They are critical to our success. 
And finally, in March 2021, Ventas will use cash on hand from recent dispositions to reduce our near-term maturities by fully repaying $400 million of our 3.1% senior notes due January 2023. As a result of these and other actions, we're positioned to capitalize on the powerful upside across our business once the pandemic is finally in the rearview mirror. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call back to the operator."

And we're very grateful for that, as Justin mentioned. 
What we're focused on going forward is there continues to be significant billions remaining in the HHS fund -- well, first of all, Phase 3 could result in additional funding. That's an unknown. There's also multiple tens of billions remaining in the HHS fund, which hopefully can be utilized beyond Phase 3 to support the health care providers writ large, including senior housing. 
And then in terms of additional COVID relief packages, we would endeavor to make the case that some of those funds should be either earmarked for or certainly available to be used to mitigate the continuing impact of COVID-19 on the 1 to 2 million seniors, who are cared for in senior living. So that's the framework, and we'll continue to try to make -- be effective advocates with policymakers to produce a favorable and, I think, very justifiable outcome on a public health priority basis."

So when you think about us, think about a higher conversion rate in Canada, there's less dependency on external agencies to get move-ins. But if you focus in on the U.S., one thing that we found interesting is that the lead volume is very high, as Debbie mentioned, in spite of the clinical backdrop. But we're also still missing out on some typical sources for leads. And that includes respites, that includes personal and professional referral sources, which are all our highest converted leads. So as the lead bank starts to materialize and get back to normal, not only the leads go up, but our conversion should go with it. So our operators are fairly bullish on the outlook. But that remains to be seen, obviously."

So I mentioned -- but I'll try, I'd like to step back for a second and just reiterate the underlying demand that the operators are facing and how they're trying to play into that. I had mentioned before that leads are very strong, and we're missing parts of the typical lead bank that could help bolster things. But if you look back a little bit, and you look back into September, October, if you look at our leads and our move-ins, you can see that we're running 80% and 90%, respectively, no vaccine in sight at the time. So the underlying demand remains really strong. Our operators are well aware of that. We even had, at that time in October, almost 60% of our communities that were achieving 100% or more of their prior-to-COVID typical move-in run rate. So all of that bodes well. And as operators have tried to play into that and with the backdrop of, of course, the clinical trends they were facing throughout the end of last year, beginning of this year, they're taking different approaches. 
One I'll highlight is Atria. I mentioned that they have bolstered our overall lead growth and volume. And they've done that with the help of discounting and it's worked. Because they've had higher occupancy, higher leads as a result. We've had others that have been a little more local market-focused, holding back a little bit to preserve rate. And that worked as well. And moving ahead, I think what every operator is focused on is the wide variety of different referral sources that they've relied in, in the past, how to rejuvenate those moving forward and to play into that, the optimistic kind of supply-demand outlook I gave as well as the trends that are positioning our communities to accept move-ins again."

And you have at a minimum 4 years left on maturity for a lot of these leases that are kind of in that range or below. So I'm just wondering if there is a need or thought or are you just able to adjust rents or convert some of these to RIDEA. And could you just clarify in that the cash flow coverage -- I may be thinking wrong about this. But in the quarter or historically, are there -- just the last 2 quarters, is there any -- the provider funds or the relief funds, they're not factored into that coverage, are they?"

So look, I mean, we have been really successful during 2020, since Justin been here, at really having some outstanding resolutions of the bigger relationships we have with partners like Brookdale and Holiday and others. And that's been really helpful. And we've received significant cash upfront as well as participation in the upside through either warrants or conversions to management contracts. So those have been really well received and rightly so. Our operators, as you mentioned, really have been the beneficiaries in some cases of government funding that would principally be in the fourth quarter. Of course, that would benefit coverage. 
But our statistics are really through the end of the third quarter, which is always on a 1 quarter lag, as you know. So they will be factored in. They'll be called out separately as we have with some of the health care providers in the supplemental materials. And so you'll be able to do your own analysis. But again, remember that the funding is really intended to be a bridge, if you will, to replace NOI that would otherwise be there and hopefully will otherwise be there in the future. So that's how we've been thinking about it."

And so those conversations are happening constantly. And it's very much driven by recent COVID activity, sometimes in the broader community, sometimes within our own communities. So that's fluid.

Let me start by saying that we believe the macro environment and the Ventas has outlook have turned an important corner and that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. You have no idea how good it feels to say those words, even though we recognize that significant uncertainty remains. The whole Ventas team is actively engaged in taking steps to win the recovery for our stakeholders. These steps include making smart portfolio and capital allocation decisions, capturing the embedded upside in our high-quality senior housing portfolio, focusing on operational excellence and initiatives, Investing in value-creating development and acquisition opportunities across our demographically driven asset classes, attracting diverse, attractive capital and maintaining financial strength and flexibility. 
I also think it's important to reiterate our gratitude and optimism. The widespread administration and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines have dramatically benefited the health and well-being of our senior residents and their caregivers. and also laid the foundation for sustained economic recovery. Let me first address senior housing trends and results. With respect to health and safety, I'm thrilled to report that our confirmed new resident cases in SHOP have fallen to literally a single person per day out of a resident population of 40,000. And all our communities are now open to new move-ins and most have reintroduced expanded visitation and communal activities. 
As a result, the natural, resilient and demographically based demand for senior living has revised and we reached the cyclical pandemic occupancy bottom in our SHOP portfolio in mid-March. Since then, led by our U.S. SHOP community, which posted 280 basis points of growth, we grew SHOP spot occupancy 190 basis points through April 30 to nearly 78%.
Our Canadian SHOP portfolio, which has maintained occupancy of over 91%, tempered the full SHOP occupancy growth because Canadian clinical conditions and regulatory measures are currently lagging those in the U.S. We do expect those to catch up over time. Notably, for the whole portfolio, March and April were the first 2 consecutive months when SHOP move-ins exceeded both pre-pandemic move-in levels and move-outs since the start of the pandemic. In fact, move-ins during April at 1,880 totaled more move-ins in a single month than we've experienced at any time since June 2019. 
While many of these positive trends began in the first quarter and therefore did not fully benefit first quarter results, we are also pleased with those results. Our first quarter normalized FFO per share and SHOP performance came in ahead of our expectations. And our SHOP occupancy gains were at or above those reported by other market participants to date. The resilient and robust demand we are seeing for senior housing once again validates the need-based nature of our communities and the crucial role care providers play in facilitating longer, healthier lives for this portion of the nation's population, which is set to grow by over 2 million individuals over just the next few years. 
Supply trends in senior housing are also highly favorable. This combination of growing demographic demand and constrained supply creates a favorable backdrop for senior housing recovery, which represents an incredibly significant value creation opportunity for our shareholders. The high quality of our senior housing portfolio, as Justin will describe, makes us well positioned to recapture NOI and realize this upside. 
Turning to our capital allocation approach, we are confident of our ability to recycle about $1 billion through property dispositions in the second half of this year, and those are expected to enhance our enterprise. On the investment side, our attractive Life Science Research and Innovation business continues to provide us with value-creating opportunities to invest capital. The Ventas portfolio, which now exceeds 9 million square feet, is located in 3 of the top 5 cluster markets and is affiliated with over 15 of the nation's top research university. 
We are also investing in our active and just delivered ground-up developments in Life Science Research and Innovation, which totaled nearly $1 billion in project costs. And I'm pleased to report that we also have another $1 billion in potential projects affiliated with major universities right behind the 4 developments currently underway. We look forward to sharing more information on our exciting development pipeline with you later this year. 
We recently expanded our Life Sciences business through our investment in a Class A portfolio of life science assets anchored by Johns Hopkins Medical, which we purchased at an attractive valuation of $600 per square foot. Located in the fourth largest life science cluster in the U.S., Hopkins is a global leader in research and medicine and the #1 recipient of government research funding. This acquisition leverages our unique expertise at the intersection of universities, life sciences and academic medicine. 
In addition, we continue to invest capital in senior housing with our partner, Le Groupe Maurice in Quebec. LGM maintains a first-class brand, product and financial model for success. Our 2 most recently completed high-end communities with LGM opened in the fourth quarter and have already achieved 87% occupancy. We have 3 additional developments underway with LGM, representing nearly $300 million in aggregate project costs. 
Looking at the broader investment market, deal volume is again trending toward normalized levels. In a typical year, our deal team reviews over $30 billion in investment opportunities. Our pipeline of potential investments across our asset classes is active and growing, and we are on our front foot from an external growth standpoint. We have access to significant liquidity and a wide array of capital sources to fund deals. 
Our investment philosophy continues to be focused on growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk-adjusted return, taking into account factors such as market position and trajectory of the asset and business, cost per square footer unit, downside protection and ultimate potential for cash flow growth and asset appreciation. 
In closing, we believe we've turned an important corner. and key metrics in our business are showing meaningful improvement. The positive investment thesis for all of our demographically driven asset classes and for Ventas is pointing firmly positive. As a team at Ventas, we're really happy about the strength and stability we've shown and the recent upswing in economic, clinical and operating environment. We have an abiding commitment to win the recovery for all our stakeholders, and we are confident we're taking the right steps to do so. Thank you. Now to Justin."
398549,711460821,2275717,"Ventas, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 07, 2021",2021-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Debbie. I am very excited that senior housing recovery is underway. As we've mentioned before, the lifestyle offering in our communities will be a leading indicator of performance. Now that vaccines have been executed, activities are picking up",674,"Thank you, Debbie. I am very excited that senior housing recovery is underway. As we've mentioned before, the lifestyle offering in our communities will be a leading indicator of performance. Now that vaccines have been executed, activities are picking up again, communal dining is coming back and all of our communities are open to visitation from relatives, the underlying demand for our services should continue to strengthen. 
As we have visited communities recently, the enthusiasm expressed by residents, their relatives and employees is compelling as communities are literally coming back to life again. As Debbie noted, we are pleased with the improvement in leading indicators in occupancy as our move-in and move-out performance in March and April resulted in 266 and 363 net move-ins, respectively. We expect occupancy improvements benefiting from a return to 2019 move-in levels while at the same time, move out to be lower than 2019 levels due to lower current occupancy levels. 
If we use the move-out rate as a percentage of the resident population from 2019, and apply that percentage to the current lower resident occupancy, the outcome is lower move-outs than prepandemic levels. That, in combination with a 2019 move-in run rate, results in projected net positive occupancy gains. I refer to this as the ""turn the lights on"" scenario, where we simply get the structural benefit from this netting effect. 
Having said that, March and April both performed well above this baseline, as we started to see a resurgence of high-converting lead sources, which include respites and personal referrals. As these lead sources and professional referrals continue to recover, we could see move-in rates grow. 
Moving on to macro drivers. We remain optimistic on our long-term supply and demand outlook. Construction starts continue to decelerate in the first quarter to the lowest level since the first quarter of 2011. And were down 77% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fewer starts should translate into materially lower deliveries in 2022 and 2023. In addition, we expect strong demographic tailwinds to provide support for occupancy growth. The 80-plus population is expected to grow 17% over the next 5 years, more than double the rate witnessed during the 5-year recovery following the financial crisis. 
I'll comment on our SHOP portfolio. When I joined Ventas just over a year ago, one of my first priorities was to assess the overall quality of our portfolio. Now that we are traveling again and visiting communities, I'm pleased to verify, we benefit from a well-invested, highly diversified portfolio of market-leading senior housing communities with service offerings that range from an active adult, independent living, social assisted living and assisted living and memory care. We are well located in high [ barrier ] markets that have substantial income and wealth demographics to support our offering. 
Our 3 primary operators, Le Groupe Maurice, Sunrise and Atria, are each uniquely positioned to be competitive within their respective markets. Collectively, They account for 90% of our SHOP NOI on a stabilized basis. With these attributes of a high-quality portfolio in mind, moving forward, we are actively reviewing opportunities to optimize our portfolio through pruning, strategic CapEx investment, transitioning communities, new developments and pursuing new acquisitions to maintain our strong market position in senior housing. 
Moving on to triple-net senior housing. Given the proactive measures taken last year where we addressed a substantial portion of our portfolio and additionally paired with government subsidies and other tenant resources, our tenants continue to pay as expected in the first quarter and through April. Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rent. Our trailing 12 cash flow coverage for senior housing, which is reported 1 quarter in arrears, is 1.3x and stable versus the prior quarter. 
I'll summarize by expressing our enthusiasm around our strong leading indicators, high-quality portfolio of communities and operators. I have a high confidence in our ability to compete in what should be a very exciting period of recovery for the senior housing sector. 
With that, I'll hand the call to Pete."

I'll cover the office and health care triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent over 50% of Ventas' NOI. They continue to produce solid and reliable results. First, I'll cover office. The core office portfolio, ex parking,",915,"Thanks, Justin. I'll cover the office and health care triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent over 50% of Ventas' NOI. They continue to produce solid and reliable results. 
First, I'll cover office. The core office portfolio, ex parking, performed well. Core office grew 1.7% year-on-year and 1.1% sequentially. Those results were tempered by lower parking activity, which I'm pleased to say is materially increasing. All in, the office portfolio delivered $123 million of same-store cash NOI in the first quarter. This represents an 80 basis point reported sequential growth. 
In terms of rent collections, our strong record continued during the quarter and into April. This outstanding record is enabled by the mission-critical nature of our portfolio and our high-quality creditworthy tenancy. In our Medical Office portfolio, 88% of our NOI comes from investment-grade rated tenants and HCA. In our Life Sciences portfolio, 76% of our revenues come directly from investment-grade rated organizations and publicly traded companies. 
All of our MOB properties are in elective surgery restriction free locations and clinical activity and building utilization is rebounding. A clinical rebound provides confidence to health care executives in making business decisions. We're certainly seeing that on the real estate side. As an example, we are finishing negotiations on a 10-year 160,000 square foot renewal with a 16,000 square foot expansion with a leading health system in the Southeast. And another example. We relocated and extended several hospital offices on a Midwestern campus to accommodate the addition of a 50,000 square foot health care-focused technical college. The leases will commence in July, a win for the health system, the college and Ventas. 
Medical Office had record-level retention of 91% for the first quarter and 86% for the trailing 12 months. Driven by this retention, total office leasing was nearly 1 million square feet for the quarter. This includes 160,000 square feet of new leasing. The result is that MOB occupancy stayed essentially flat, down only 10 basis points for the quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year. Previous actions to bolster leasing are clearly showing results. 
In 2019, we hired a head of leasing. In 2020, we hired a digital marketing lead. In 2020, we redeployed 30% of our third-party brokers. And in 2020, we increased the number of third-party brokers by 70% to impact the local coverage. Our digital marketing program focused on local market awareness and virtual touring of vacant suites is fully in place and making a difference. Average length of term for new leases was 7.3 years, 5 months higher than the 2019 average. Renewal term length also exceeded 2019 averages. Average escalators for new leasing was 2.7%, higher than our average in-place escalator of 2.4%. All of this represents growing health care community confidence in the recovery. 
I'd also like to highlight our pre-leasing construction initiative. This is where we take a vacant suite where it is difficult to visualize this future potential and either demolish the in-place improvements to [ Core & Shell ] or complete a hospital standard physician suite in advance of leasing. We've invested over $2 million in a pilot across 20 suites. The results have been fantastic. These projects have driven 20 basis points of occupancy and created a nearly 20% return on investment. Because of these results, we intend to expand this program later this year. 
We remain enthusiastic about the office business and particularly investment opportunities in the R&I space. We continue to make progress on our recently announced $2 billion pipeline of development opportunities with Wexford. We've publicly announced 4 projects in that pipeline, Arizona State University in Phoenix, which opened in the fourth quarter and is soon to be over 70% leased. Drexel University College of Nursing in Philadelphia is 100% leased. The project, in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh for immunotherapy, is 70% preleased. And our new development in the thriving uCity submarket of Philadelphia between Penn and Drexel is showing strong pre-leasing activity. 
Since the acquisition of our South San Francisco Life Science trophy asset, we have renewed several tenants and have driven occupancy to 100%. In some cases, the mark-to-market has exceeded 30%. At our newest Life Sciences acquisition on the Johns Hopkins Campus in Baltimore, we are in lease negotiations to take the buildings from 96% to 100% occupancy. Demand far exceeds our current capacity. 
Now let's turn to health care triple net. During the first quarter, our health care triple-net assets showed continued strength and reliability with 100% rent collections in April and May. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage through 12/31 improved sequentially for all of our health care triple-net asset classes. Acute care hospitals' trailing 12-month coverage was a strong 3.5x in the fourth quarter, a 20 basis point sequential improvement. Ardent has performed extremely well in this dynamic market. IRF and LTAC coverage improved 10 basis points to 1.7x in the first quarter, buoyed by strong business results and government funding. 
Census levels were high at year-end and continued into the first quarter. During this period, Kindred has been able to demonstrate their expertise in treating complex respiratory disorders to their health system partners. Regarding our loan portfolio, it is fully current. 
Finally, a word of thanks to our frontline workers who have kept our facilities open and safe during this last year. They are our heroes. We are relieved that now, protected by the vaccine, they can do their jobs with peace of mind and in safety. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."
398549,711460821,2275717,"Ventas, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 07, 2021",2021-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Pete. In my remarks today, I'll cover our first quarter results, our expectations for the second quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities. Let's start with our results in the first quarter. Ventas reported f",591,"Thanks, Pete. In my remarks today, I'll cover our first quarter results, our expectations for the second quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities. 
Let's start with our results in the first quarter. Ventas reported first quarter net income of minus $0.15 per share, driven by noncash charges in the quarter as we transferred assets to held for sale. Normalized funds from operations in the first quarter was $0.72 per share, a $0.01 beat versus the high end of our prior guidance range of $0.66 to $0.71. As previously communicated and included in our Q1 guidance range, we received $0.04 in HHS brands in SHOP in Q1. Adjusted for these grants, Q1 FFO per share was $0.68. As expected, Office and triple net contributed stable sequential NOI performance in the first quarter. Q1 outperformance was driven by better occupancy and lower-than-expected operating expenses in SHOP. As a result, same-store shop NOI declined sequentially by 8% in the second quarter versus the first. 
Turning to our Q2 guidance. Second quarter net income is estimated to range from flat to $0.07 per fully diluted share. Our guidance range for normalized FFO for Q2 is $0.67 to $0.71 per share. The Q2 FFO midpoint of $0.69 is $0.01 higher sequentially than the first quarter results due to an improving shop trajectory after adjusting for HHS grants in both periods. 
Key second quarter assumptions underlying our guidance are as follows: starting with SHOP. Q2 spot occupancy from March 31 to June 30 is forecast to increase between 150 to 250 basis points, with the midpoint assuming the occupancy improvement in March and April, continues through May and June. Sequential SHOP revenue is expected to grow modestly as a result of occupancy gains. While operating expenses, excluding HHS grants, are forecast to be flat with lower COVID costs, offsetting higher costs due to increased occupancy, higher community activity levels and an additional day in the second quarter. 
Finally, we've not included the receipt of HHS grants in SHOP in our Q2 guidance. In our Office and Triple-net segments, we expect stable NOI in Q2 relative to Q1. And finally, we continue to assume $1 billion in proceeds from property dispositions in the back half of 2021. I'd like to underscore that we're still in a highly uncertain environment. [indiscernible] trends in SHOP are positive, the pandemic's impact on our business remain very difficult to predict. 
I'll close our prepared remarks with our liquidity, balance sheet and capital activity. We continue to enjoy robust liquidity with $2.7 billion as of May 5. Notably, in the first quarter, we renewed our revolver at better pricing and improved our near-term maturity profile by fully repaying $400 million of senior notes due 2023. In terms of capital structure, we maintained total debt to gross fed value at 37% in the first quarter. Q1 net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.1x, as EBITDA continued to feel the impacts of COVID in the quarter. We expect net debt-to-EBITDA will reach its peak in the first half of '21 and then begin to improve in the second half as senior housing rebounds and we reduce debt with asset sales. 
On behalf of all my colleagues, Ventas is committed to continuing to take the actions to win the post-pandemic recovery, which finally is appearing in our sights. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we're limiting each caller to 2 questions to be respectful to everyone on the line. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator."

And what I'd like to highlight is that the typical primary driver of lead conversion comes from professional and personal referrals. That's historically been a very strong driver. Throughout the pandemic, the business has been resilient. It's benefited from leads driven through company Internet. It's been benefited from leads driven through referral agencies. Those referral sources should persist. 
But what we're looking to see come back and what has started to come back are those other referral sources. It's personal and professional referrals, which convert at 20% to 25% each versus the overall 10% conversion rate that we experienced plus respites. But to put all this together, respites have, during the pandemic, ran at about a 25% of prepandemic level run rate. They're back to 50% now. Personal referrals ran at 50% to 60%. They're back to 94% now. Those will grow because that's simply residents and relatives referring their friends, which is phenomenal. And that will grow as our occupancy grows. 
And then professional referrals, if you want a leading indicator for that category, look toward health care activity. As health care and still nursing picks up, that's a driver of professional referrals. And those are still running at only 50%. So given that and given where our performance is and the strong net activity we have, we do feel comfortable that there's opportunity for more move-ins over time. And that's why we've highlighted that. We could see a pickup in 10%, 20% of our move-in volume over time as those leases come back. And we started to see it come back. You'll notice on the slide that we highlighted in Q1, and we know that in March and April that there's -- particularly respites and the personal referrals are playing a bigger role in the leads and therefore driving more move-ins."

Again, starts are dramatically better in the sense that, as Justin said, the first quarter was down gigantically from the peak and then the lowest level since 2011. So that's really, really good. We know that really when you look forward in the near term, that the most important thing is even if over the next couple of years things start to get on the drawing board, you're going to have this window of opportunity where you're going to have 3% to 4% CAGR on the over 80 population, which ultimately spikes in 26, 27, over 6%, as you know. 
And you're going to have this window of time where the kind of embedded communities are going to have some really great supply-demand tailwinds in this sort of intermediate term. So hard to say when they would pick up again. We know there are increased construction costs. We know there are supply chain issues. Those will probably delay some of the things that would start. And we also know that rents right now may not be supportive of those higher construction costs. So when you put all those things together, we like the forward runway as we come out of -- we really emerge post-pandemic into the recovery."

398549,711460821,2275919,"Ventas, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 07, 2021",2021-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sarah, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.Let me start by saying that we believe the macro environment and the Ventas outlook have turned an important",1083,"Thank you, Sarah, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.
Let me start by saying that we believe the macro environment and the Ventas outlook have turned an important corner and that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. You have no idea how good it feels to say those words, even though we recognize that significant uncertainty remains. The whole Ventas team is actively engaged in taking steps to win the recovery for our stakeholders. These steps include making smart portfolio and capital allocation decisions, capturing the embedded upside in our high-quality senior housing portfolio, focusing on operational excellence and initiatives, investing in value-creating development and acquisition opportunities across our demographically driven asset classes, attracting diverse, attractive capital and maintaining financial strength and flexibility.
I also think it's important to reiterate our gratitude and optimism. The widespread administration and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines have dramatically benefited the health and well-being of our senior residents and their caregivers, and also laid the foundation for sustained economic recovery.
Let me first address senior housing trends and results. With respect to health and safety, I'm thrilled to report that our confirmed new resident cases in SHOP have fallen to literally a single person per day out of a resident population of 40,000. And all our communities are now open to new move-ins and most have reintroduced expanded visitation and communal activities. As a result, the natural, resilient and demographically based demand for senior living has revised, and we reached the cyclical pandemic occupancy bottom in our SHOP portfolio in mid-March. Since then, led by our U.S. SHOP community, which posted 280 basis points of growth, we grew SHOP spot occupancy 190 basis points through April 30 to nearly 78%.
Our Canadian SHOP portfolio, which has maintained occupancy of over 91%, tempered the full SHOP occupancy growth because Canadian clinical conditions and regulatory measures are currently lagging those in the U.S. We do expect those to catch up over time. Notably, for the whole portfolio, March and April were the first 2 consecutive months when SHOP move-ins exceeded both prepandemic move-in levels and move-outs since the start of the pandemic. In fact, move-ins during April at 1,880 totaled more move-ins in a single month than we've experienced at any time since June 2019.
While many of these positive trends began in the first quarter and therefore did not fully benefit first quarter results, we are also pleased with those results. Our first quarter normalized FFO per share and SHOP performance came in ahead of our expectations. And our SHOP occupancy gains were at or above those reported by other market participants to date.
The resilient and robust demand we are seeing for senior housing once again validates the need-based nature of our communities and the crucial role care providers play in facilitating longer, healthier lives for this portion of the nation's population, which is set to grow by over 2 million individuals over just the next few years.
Supply trends in senior housing are also highly favorable. This combination of growing demographic demand and constrained supply creates a favorable backdrop for senior housing recovery, which represents an incredibly significant value creation opportunity for our shareholders. The high quality of our senior housing portfolio, as Justin will describe, makes us well positioned to recapture NOI and realize this upside.
Turning to our capital allocation approach, we are confident of our ability to recycle about $1 billion through property dispositions in the second half of this year, and those are expected to enhance our enterprise. On the investment side, our attractive life science, research and innovation business continues to provide us with value-creating opportunities to invest capital. The Ventas portfolio, which now exceeds 9 million square feet, is located in 3 of the top 5 cluster markets and is affiliated with over 15 of the nation's top research universities.
We are also investing in our active and just delivered ground-up developments in life science, research and innovation, which totaled nearly $1 billion in project costs. And I'm pleased to report that we also have another $1 billion in potential projects affiliated with major universities right behind the 4 developments currently underway. We look forward to sharing more information on our exciting development pipeline with you later this year.
We recently expanded our life sciences business through our investment in a Class A portfolio of life science assets anchored by Johns Hopkins Medical, which we purchased at an attractive valuation of $600 per square foot. Located in the fourth largest life science cluster in the U.S., Hopkins is a global leader in research and medicine and the #1 recipient of government research funding. This acquisition leverages our unique expertise at the intersection of universities, life sciences and academic medicine.
In addition, we continue to invest capital in senior housing with our partner, Le Groupe Maurice in Quebec. LGM maintains a first-class brand, product and financial model for success. Our 2 most recently completed high-end communities with LGM opened in the fourth quarter and have already achieved 87% occupancy. We have 3 additional developments underway with LGM, representing nearly $300 million in aggregate project costs.
Looking at the broader investment market, deal volume is again trending toward normalized levels. In a typical year, our deal team reviews over $30 billion in investment opportunities. Our pipeline of potential investments across our asset classes is active and growing, and we are on our front foot from an external growth standpoint. We have access to significant liquidity and a wide array of capital sources to fund deals.
Our investment philosophy continues to be focused on growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk-adjusted return, taking into account factors such as market position and trajectory of the asset and business, cost per square footer unit, downside protection and ultimate potential for cash flow growth and asset appreciation.
In closing, we believe we've turned an important corner, and key metrics in our business are showing meaningful improvement. The positive investment thesis for all of our demographically driven asset classes and for Ventas is pointing firmly positive. As a team at Ventas, we're really happy about the strength and stability we've shown and the recent upswing in economic, clinical and operating environment. We have an abiding commitment to win the recovery for all our stakeholders, and we are confident we're taking the right steps to do so.
Thank you. Now to Justin."

As we've mentioned before, the lifestyle offering in our communities will be a leading indicator of performance. Now that vaccines have been executed, activities are picking up again, communal dining is coming back and all of our communities are open to visitation from relatives, the underlying demand for our services should continue to strengthen.
As we have visited communities recently, the enthusiasm expressed by residents, their relatives and employees is compelling as communities are literally coming back to life again. As Debbie noted, we are pleased with the improvement in leading indicators in occupancy as our move-in and move-out performance in March and April resulted in 266 and 363 net move-ins, respectively. We expect occupancy improvements benefiting from a return to 2019 move-in levels while at the same time, move-outs to be lower than 2019 levels due to lower current occupancy levels.
If we use the move-out rate as a percentage of the resident population from 2019 and apply that percentage to the current lower resident occupancy, the outcome is lower move-outs than prepandemic levels. That, in combination with a 2019 move-in run rate, results in projected net positive occupancy gains. I refer to this as the ""turn the lights on"" scenario, where we simply get the structural benefit from this netting effect.
Having said that, March and April both performed well above this baseline, as we started to see a resurgence of high-converting lead sources, which include respites and personal referrals. As these lead sources and professional referrals continue to recover, we could see move-in rates grow.
Moving on to macro drivers. We remain optimistic on our long-term supply and demand outlook. Construction starts continue to decelerate in the first quarter to the lowest level since the first quarter of 2011, and were down 77% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fewer starts should translate into materially lower deliveries in 2022 and 2023. In addition, we expect strong demographic tailwinds to provide support for occupancy growth. The 80-plus population is expected to grow 17% over the next 5 years, more than double the rate witnessed during the 5-year recovery following the financial crisis.
I'll comment on our SHOP portfolio. When I joined Ventas just over a year ago, one of my first priorities was to assess the overall quality of our portfolio. Now that we are traveling again and visiting communities, I'm pleased to verify, we benefit from a well-invested, highly diversified portfolio of market-leading senior housing communities with service offerings that range from an active adult, independent living, social assisted living and assisted living and memory care. We are well located in high barrier markets that have substantial income and wealth demographics to support our offering.
Our 3 primary operators, Le Groupe Maurice, Sunrise and Atria, are each uniquely positioned to be competitive within their respective markets. Collectively, they account for 90% of our SHOP NOI on a stabilized basis. With these attributes of a high-quality portfolio in mind, moving forward, we are actively reviewing opportunities to optimize our portfolio through pruning, strategic CapEx investment, transitioning communities, new developments and pursuing new acquisitions to maintain our strong market position in senior housing.
Moving on to triple-net senior housing. Given the proactive measures taken last year where we addressed a substantial portion of our portfolio and additionally paired with government subsidies and other tenant resources, our tenants continue to pay as expected in the first quarter and through April. Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rent. Our trailing 12 cash flow coverage for senior housing, which is reported 1 quarter in arrears, is 1.3x and stable versus the prior quarter.
I'll summarize by expressing our enthusiasm around our strong leading indicators, high-quality portfolio of communities and operators. I have a high confidence in our ability to compete in what should be a very exciting period of recovery for the senior housing sector.
With that, I'll hand the call to Pete."

The core Office portfolio, ex parking, p",912,"Thanks, Justin. I'll cover the Office and health care triple-net segments. Together, these segments represent over 50% of Ventas' NOI. They continue to produce solid and reliable results.
First, I'll cover Office. The core Office portfolio, ex parking, performed well. Core Office grew 1.7% year-on-year and 1.1% sequentially. Those results were tempered by lower parking activity, which I'm pleased to say is materially increasing. All in, the Office portfolio delivered $123 million of same-store cash NOI in the first quarter. This represents an 80 basis point reported sequential growth.
In terms of rent collections, our strong record continued during the quarter and into April. This outstanding record is enabled by the mission-critical nature of our portfolio and our high-quality creditworthy tenancy. In our medical office portfolio, 88% of our NOI comes from investment-grade rated tenants and HCA. In our life sciences portfolio, 76% of our revenues come directly from investment-grade rated organizations and publicly traded companies.
All of our MOB properties are in elective surgery restriction-free locations and clinical activity and building utilization is rebounding. A clinical rebound provides confidence to health care executives in making business decisions. We're certainly seeing that on the real estate side.
As an example, we are finishing negotiations on a 10-year 160,000 square foot renewal with a 16,000 square foot expansion with a leading health system in the Southeast. And another example. We relocated and extended several hospital offices on a Midwestern campus to accommodate the addition of a 50,000 square foot health care-focused technical college. The leases will commence in July, a win for the health system, the college and Ventas.
Medical office had record-level retention of 91% for the first quarter and 86% for the trailing 12 months. Driven by this retention, total office leasing was nearly 1 million square feet for the quarter. This includes 160,000 square feet of new leasing. The result is that MOB occupancy stayed essentially flat, down only 10 basis points for the quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year. Previous actions to bolster leasing are clearly showing results.
In 2019, we hired a head of leasing. In 2020, we hired a digital marketing lead. In 2020, we redeployed 30% of our third-party brokers. And in 2020, we increased the number of third-party brokers by 70% to impact the local coverage. Our digital marketing program focused on local market awareness and virtual touring of vacant suites is fully in place and making a difference. Average length of term for new leases was 7.3 years, 5 months higher than the 2019 average. Renewal term length also exceeded 2019 averages. Average escalators for new leasing was 2.7%, higher than our average in-place escalator of 2.4%. All of this represents growing health care community confidence in the recovery.
I'd also like to highlight our pre-leasing construction initiative. This is where we take a vacant suite where it is difficult to visualize this future potential and either demolish the in-place improvements to core and shell or complete a hospital standard physician suite in advance of leasing. We've invested over $2 million in a pilot across 20 suites. The results have been fantastic. These projects have driven 20 basis points of occupancy and created a nearly 20% return on investment. Because of these results, we intend to expand this program later this year.
We remain enthusiastic about the Office business and particularly investment opportunities in the R&I space. We continue to make progress on our recently announced $2 billion pipeline of development opportunities with Wexford. We've publicly announced 4 projects in that pipeline, Arizona State University in Phoenix, which opened in the fourth quarter and is soon to be over 70% leased. Drexel University College of Nursing in Philadelphia is 100% leased. The project, in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh for immunotherapy, is 70% preleased. And our new development in the thriving uCity submarket of Philadelphia between Penn and Drexel is showing strong pre-leasing activity.
Since the acquisition of our South San Francisco life science trophy asset, we have renewed several tenants and have driven occupancy to 100%. In some cases, the mark-to-market has exceeded 30%. At our newest life sciences acquisition on the Johns Hopkins Campus in Baltimore, we are in lease negotiations to take the buildings from 96% to 100% occupancy. Demand far exceeds our current capacity.
Now let's turn to health care triple net. During the first quarter, our health care triple-net assets showed continued strength and reliability with 100% rent collections in April and May. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage through 12/31 improved sequentially for all of our health care triple-net asset classes. Acute care hospitals' trailing 12-month coverage was a strong 3.5x in the fourth quarter, a 20 basis point sequential improvement. Ardent has performed extremely well in this dynamic market. IRF and LTAC coverage improved 10 basis points to 1.7x in the first quarter, buoyed by strong business results and government funding.
Census levels were high at year-end and continued into the first quarter. During this period, Kindred has been able to demonstrate their expertise in treating complex respiratory disorders to their health system partners. Regarding our loan portfolio, it is fully current.
Finally, a word of thanks to our frontline workers who have kept our facilities open and safe during this last year. They are our heroes. We are relieved that now, protected by the vaccine, they can do their jobs with peace of mind and in safety.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

In my remarks today, I'll cover our first quarter results, our expectations for the second quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities.Let's start with our results in the first quarter. Ventas reported fi",572,"Thanks, Pete. In my remarks today, I'll cover our first quarter results, our expectations for the second quarter of 2021 and our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities.
Let's start with our results in the first quarter. Ventas reported first quarter net income of minus $0.15 per share, driven by noncash charges in the quarter as we transferred assets to held for sale. Normalized funds from operations in the first quarter was $0.72 per share, a $0.01 beat versus the high end of our prior guidance range of $0.66 to $0.71. As previously communicated and included in our Q1 guidance range, we received $0.04 in HHS brands in SHOP in Q1. Adjusted for these grants, Q1 FFO per share was $0.68. As expected, office and triple-net contributed stable sequential NOI performance in the first quarter.
Q1 outperformance was driven by better occupancy and lower-than-expected operating expenses in SHOP. As a result, same-store shop NOI declined sequentially by 8% in the second quarter versus the first.
Turning to our Q2 guidance. Second quarter net income is estimated to range from flat to $0.07 per fully diluted share. Our guidance range for normalized FFO for Q2 is $0.67 to $0.71 per share. The Q2 FFO midpoint of $0.69 is $0.01 higher sequentially than the first quarter results due to an improving shop trajectory after adjusting for HHS grants in both periods.
Key second quarter assumptions underlying our guidance are as follows, starting with SHOP. Q2 spot occupancy from March 31 to June 30 is forecast to increase between 150 to 250 basis points, with the midpoint assuming the occupancy improvement in March and April, continues through May and June. Sequential SHOP revenue is expected to grow modestly as a result of occupancy gains. While operating expenses, excluding HHS grants, are forecast to be flat with lower COVID costs, offsetting higher costs due to increased occupancy, higher community activity levels and an additional day in the second quarter.
Finally, we've not included the receipt of HHS grants in SHOP in our Q2 guidance. In our Office and triple-net segments, we expect stable NOI in Q2 relative to Q1. And finally, we continue to assume $1 billion in proceeds from property dispositions in the back half of 2021. I'd like to underscore that we're still in a highly uncertain environment. Though trends in SHOP are positive, the pandemic's impact on our business remain very difficult to predict.
I'll close our prepared remarks with our liquidity, balance sheet and capital activity. We continue to enjoy robust liquidity with $2.7 billion as of May 5. Notably, in the first quarter, we renewed our revolver at better pricing and improved our near-term maturity profile by fully repaying $400 million of senior notes due 2023. In terms of capital structure, we maintained total debt to gross asset value at 37% in the first quarter. Q1 net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.1x, as EBITDA continued to feel the impacts of COVID in the quarter. We expect net debt-to-EBITDA will reach its peak in the first half of '21 and then begin to improve in the second half as senior housing rebounds and we reduce debt with asset sales.
On behalf of all my colleagues, Ventas is committed to continuing to take the actions to win the post-pandemic recovery, which finally is appearing in our sights.
That concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator."

And what I'd like to highlight is that the typical primary driver of lead conversion comes from professional and personal referrals. That's historically been a very strong driver. Throughout the pandemic, the business has been resilient. It's benefited from leads driven through company Internet. It's been benefited from leads driven through referral agencies. Those referral sources should persist.
But what we're looking to see come back and what has started to come back are those other referral sources. It's personal and professional referrals, which convert at 20% to 25% each versus the overall 10% conversion rate that we experienced plus respites. But to put all this together, respites have, during the pandemic, ran at about a 25% of prepandemic level run rate. They're back to 50% now. Personal referrals ran at 50% to 60%. They're back to 94% now. Those will grow because that's simply residents and relatives referring their friends, which is phenomenal. And that will grow as our occupancy grows.
And then professional referrals, if you want a leading indicator for that category, look toward health care activity. As health care and skilled nursing picks up, that's a driver of professional referrals. And those are still running at only 50%. So given that and given where our performance is and the strong net activity we have, we do feel comfortable that there's opportunity for more move-ins over time. And that's why we've highlighted that. We could see a pickup in 10%, 20% of our move-in volume over time as those leases come back. And we started to see it come back. You'll notice on the slide that we highlighted in Q1, and we know that in March and April that there's -- particularly respites and the personal referrals are playing a bigger role in the leads and therefore driving more move-ins."

Here's what's interesting. Again, starts are dramatically better in the sense that, as Justin said, the first quarter was down gigantically from the peak and then the lowest level since 2011. So that's really, really good. We know that really when you look forward in the near term, that the most important thing is even if over the next couple of years, things start to get on the drawing board, you're going to have this window of opportunity where you're going to have 3% to 4% CAGR on over 80 population, which ultimately spikes in '26, '27, over 6%, as you know. And you're going to have this window of time where the kind of embedded communities are going to have some really great supply-demand tailwinds in this sort of intermediate term.
So hard to say when they would pick up again. We know there are increased construction costs. We know there are supply chain issues. Those will probably delay some of the things that would start. And we also know that rents right now may not be supportive of those higher construction costs. So when you put all those things together, we like the forward runway as we come out of -- we really emerge post-pandemic into the recovery."

398549,1674658513,2367492,"Ventas, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2021",2021-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Sarah, well done, your first public company merger. Congratulations. Well, good morning, everyone. I want to welcome our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Ventas delivered an outstanding second quarter,",1386,"Sarah, well done, your first public company merger. Congratulations. 
Well, good morning, everyone. I want to welcome our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Ventas delivered an outstanding second quarter, and we have strong momentum across the board in health and safety, capital deployment and access, realization of the benefits of prior successful investments, financial strength and most importantly, in portfolio growth, led by our high-quality SHOP business with significant contributions from Office and stability in our Triple Net lease business. 
We see a clear path to growth in our demographically-driven enterprise through capturing the embedded upside, internal investments, reliable cash flow from our Office and Triple Net businesses and delivery and stabilization of ongoing developments, primarily in the Life Science, Research & Innovation and Canadian senior housing areas. Our experienced team is committed to winning the recovery for all of our stakeholders. 
Let me first turn to our second quarter results. We posted $0.73 of normalized FFO per share, which is above the high end of our previously provided guidance. I'm delighted that our same-store property portfolio grew 3.6% sequentially. Our outperformance was driven by SHOP, which produced $111 million in quarterly NOI, a recovery of $50 million of NOI, representing industry-leading growth in same-store cash NOI and occupancy. 
July continued these positive SHOP trends for the fifth consecutive month of occupancy growth. Importantly, by the end of July, lease reached their highest level since the pandemic began. Justin will unpack these trends more fully in his remarks. 
As a result, we've never been more confident that the senior living business is supported by powerful demand that is growing and resilient, while supply remains constrained. If the last 18 months have taught us anything, it is that as soon as our communities and care providers are ready to welcome residents and their families we experienced a surge of leads and move-ins almost immediately, which then builds sustainably and rapidly. 
That said, given the macro uncertainty in the COVID-19 environment, particularly the national and regional rise in cases and the measures that have been taken or may be taken to contain COVID spread, the path to full recovery may not be a straight line, but we believe that we'll point inexorably upwards. In our third quarter outlook, we have assumed the increase in COVID cases throughout the U.S. may have some impact on the velocity of leasing and expenses. 
Rounding out our portfolio performance, Office grew nicely in the quarter and our Triple Net portfolio continued its stability. Pete's efforts to increase leasing, keep high retention rates, improve customer relationships and grow NOI are showing results. Our on-campus and affiliated MOB strategy with leading health systems continues to shine. 
Turning to health systems. Our investment in Ardent also continues to deliver benefits. In addition to strong cash flow coverage on our $1.3 billion leasehold position, our 10% equity stake in the Ardent Enterprise is benefiting from excellent Ardent results and our prior purchase of $200 million of Ardent senior notes recently paid off with a $15 million prepayment fee, providing us with a 13% unlevered return on our investment in the Ardent notes. When all is said and done, I believe and hope that our Ardent investment in real estate, equity and debt will prove to be one of our best risk-adjusted return. 
In total, in 2021, we have over $3.5 billion in investments completed, pending or underway, with another $1 billion Life Science, Research & Innovation pipeline with our exclusive development partner, Wexford, right behind that. 
Our team is also so busy evaluating attractive deals across our asset classes. This year-to-date, we have already reviewed about as many investment opportunities as we saw in all of 2019. We will pursue those that meet our multifactor investment philosophy, which is focused on growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk-adjusted returns, taking into account factors such as cost per square foot or unit, downside protection and ultimate potential for cash flow growth and asset appreciation. 
Our $2.3 billion pending investment in new senior announced in the second quarter is a great example. In this deal, we are acquiring over 100 high-quality independent living communities that are well invested and located in advantaged market at compelling pricing. The per unit cost is estimated to be 20% to 30% below replacement cost. The 5% cash going in cap rate is expected to grow to a 6% cap rate on expected 2022 NOI with upside as the senior housing recovery continues. And the FFO multiple of less than 12x post synergized 2022 estimated FFO are all attractive valuation metrics. 
I commend Susan Gibbons and her team for doing a tremendous job creating and realizing value for their stakeholders. We are also confident that Ventas shareholders will receive immediate and long-term accretion and upside from the deal as senior housing recovers and the large, middle market demographic expand significantly in the near term. As Justin will describe [indiscernible] New Senior portfolio, also energy and framework. 
New Senior also performed well in Q2 and into July, with occupancy increasing in its same-store portfolio for 5 straight months. A unique strategic advantage to the new senior transaction is the long-standing relationship we have with the principal managers of the portfolio, Atria and Holiday, 2 leading operators who recently combined to form the second largest senior housing manager. 
As a 1/3 owner of Atria, we are excited about the opportunities the combination creates. We will directly benefit from growth in Atria's management platform, and we welcome the combination of Atria and Holiday's talent in Atria's advanced enterprise. 
Switching to our attractive Life Science, Research & Innovation business, it continues to provide us with value-creating opportunities to invest capital. The Ventas life science portfolio now exceeds 9 million square feet. It's located in 3 of the top 5 cluster markets, includes 3 ongoing development projects and is affiliated with over 16 of the nation's top research universities. 
We also have an incremental $1 billion in potential projects we are working on with Wexford. The first and largest new life science project in the pipeline totaling about $500 million in cost is gaining steam. Expected to be 60% pre-leased to a major public research University that ranks in the top 5% of NIH funding, this project will be located on the West Coast and should break ground in the first half of 2022. 
Wexford, with its exceptional reputation among universities, is also exploring significant additional life science potential projects beyond those in our existing pipeline. 
North of the border, we continued to invest capital in high end, large-scale independent living communities with our partner, Le Groupe Maurice, in Qu√©bec. We have always tried to create value through both internal and external growth, and we're pleased that we've returned to being a net acquirer in 2021. Our team is active and engaged beyond our announced deals and our pipeline of potential investments across asset classes. To fund new investments, we have access to significant liquidity and a wide array of capital sources, including the asset dispositions and receipt of loan repayments, as Bob will describe in greater detail. 
The demand for senior housing has been robust and sustainable, proving out the value proposition our communities and care providers offer to seniors and their families. The SHOP recovery has begun, and we've started capturing the significant upside embedded in our existing senior housing portfolio from both pandemic recovery and a 17.5% growth in the senior population projected over the next few years. 
Our diversified business model continues to provide uplift and stability to our enterprise. We are investing nearly $4 billion in announced deals and development projects and our access to and pricing up capital are positive. 
In closing, the U.S. is in the midst of an impressive economic recovery. That, together with demographic demand for all our asset classes, will benefit our business. We embrace the opportunity to take on any near-term challenges that are temporarily caused by the strength and speed of this recovery. Especially because now, unlike last year and the beginning of 2021, our employees, residents, tenants and caregivers are largely safe and healthy. 
As a team at Ventas, we're incredibly pleased about the results we've delivered and the strength and momentum we've demonstrated. Justin, over to you."

We remain excited about delivering industry-leading occupancy and NOI growth, and we are encouraged about recent trends in the senior housing portfolio. Although we are still in the early stages of the recovery, we are off to a very strong start. Ventas is well positioned to benefit from significant senior housing tailwinds, including the sector recovery upside supportive demand fundamentals and continued improvement in leading indicators. 
I'll review 3 topics today: first, our second quarter performance; second, our perspective on the senior housing operating environment; and third, our continued execution of our senior housing strategy. I'll start by covering our second quarter performance. 
In SHOP, leading indicators continued to trend favorably and accelerated during the quarter. As leads and move-ins each surpassed 100% of 2019 levels while move-outs remain steady. June marked the best month for lease and move-ins since the start of the pandemic, and July has sustained strong momentum. Strong sales activity has now driven 5 consecutive months of occupancy growth, inclusive of July. 
In the second quarter, approximate spot occupancy from March 31 to June 30 increased 229 basis points, led by the U.S. with growth of 313 basis points in accelerating lease and move-ins. In Canada, the trends were more muted due to a slower vaccine rollout, but approximate spot occupancy still increased during the second quarter, driven by 33 basis points of growth in June. Leading indicators remain strong in our portfolio as the digital footprint of our operators has significantly expanded over the past year, testing a wider net and traditional high converting lead sources such as personal referrals, and professional referrals continue recovering. 
Turning to the SHOP operating results. Same-store revenue in the second quarter increased sequentially by $3.5 million as strong occupancy growth was partially offset by the impact of a new resident move-in incentives and pricing, specifically at Atria. I'll touch on that more in a minute. 
Operating expenses declined sequentially by $9.2 million or 2.3%, excluding the impact of HHS grants received in the first quarter, driven by a better-than-expected reduction of COVID-19 operating costs, partially offset by a modest increase in routine operating expenses. 
For the sequential same-store pool, SHOP generated approximately $111 million of NOI received in the first quarter, which represents a sequential increase of $12.4 million or 12.6% when excluding the impact of HHS grants. This marks the first quarter of sequential underlying NOI growth since the onset of COVID-19 and approximates a nearly $50 million NOI improvement on an annualized basis. 
During the quarter, we saw solid contribution to sequential NOI growth from both revenue and operating expenses as average occupancy increased 110 basis points and COVID-19 costs declined substantially and ahead of expectations. 
Turning to Triple Net. Sequential same-store cash NOI was largely stable in the second quarter and 98% of all contractual Triple Net rent was received from the company's tenants. Our trailing 12-month cash flow coverage for senior housing, which is reported 1 quarter in arrears, is 1.2x and down versus the prior quarter, reflecting the timing associated with coverage reporting which now includes effectively 4 full quarters of operations impacted by COVID. 
Moving on to the current operating environment, which is full of green shoots. Our market-leading operators continue to demonstrate their strong market position through broad occupancy gains. Sunrise, by the way, with 627 basis points of spot occupancy growth from the low point in March to the end of July, benefiting from a rejuvenated management team, significantly well-invested communities in a balanced approach demonstrating very strong occupancy gains and pricing power. We would like to congratulate Sunrise's CEO, Jack Callison, for adding experience and depth to his management team with his recently announced hires. 
Atria, which benefits from a higher absolute occupancy of 81.8% at July end, continues to deliver solid volume growth. Spot occupancy in July increased 529 basis points since the low point in mid-March, resulting from the combination of their industry-leading vaccine mandate and strategic price incentives to capture movements. Atria anticipates tightening incentives moving forward as pricing power recovers and occupancy stabilizes. Supporting all of this is Atria's industry-leading vaccination rates, which are impressively high at nearly 100% of both residents and employees. 
Looking ahead, as Debbie mentioned, the third quarter is off to a strong start, with July spot occupancy increasing 74 basis points versus June and lease continuing to stand strong at 105% of pre pandemic levels. Our operators have been prioritizing resident safety and weathering several near-term headwinds, including the delta variant and transitory wage pressures from staffing shortages in select markets. 
Underpinning our leading operating partner relationships and recent sales momentum is our attractive market footprint, which positions us to benefit from the compelling supply and demand outlook in the senior housing sector. Our communities in the U.S. are poised for improving performance over time due to our strong presence in submarkets that outpaced the U.S. national average and aging population growth and wealth demographics, but with significantly lower exposure to new construction starts and construction as a percentage of inventory. 
Approximately 30% of our SHOP portfolio on a stabilized basis is located in Canada. The senior housing sector in Canada has performed exceptionally well, with occupancy exceeding 90% every year from 2010 to 2020 and demand outpacing new supply and 8 of that, the last 11 years. As a foundation to these attractive fundamentals, the 75-plus population in Canada is projected to grow more than 20% over the next 5 years, about twice the pace of the U.S. 
The Ventas team has been busy executing our senior housing strategy driven by experiential, operating expertise, and underpinned by our analytical capabilities to further strengthen our senior housing business. The underlying goal of our strategy is simply to execute portfolio actions that ensure we are located in the right markets, with the right operator, with assets, with strong local market positioning. 
A notable example of our strategy execution is the new senior transaction. New senior has a track record of strong operating performance, benefits from a geographically diverse footprint with favorable exposure to compelling market fundamentals and demographics and represents a well-invested high-quality portfolio catering to an attractive market segment. The acquisition also represents an excellent opportunity to further expand our relationships with 2 long-standing operators, Holiday Retirement and Atria Senior Living, and with new relationships, such is Hawthorne Senior Living. 
New Senior will strengthen our existing senior housing business from several strategic perspectives. Operationally, New Senior will enhance Ventas' cash flow generation profile. Its margin has remained resilient in the 35%-plus range during the COVID-19 and occupancy has weathered the pandemic headwinds approximately 80 basis points better than the NIC industry average. Most recently, New Senior has seen strong sales trends as we progressed through the early stages of the senior housing recovery with powerful upside as the portfolio occupancy grew 100 basis points in June. 
Geographically, New Senior has a diverse presence across 36 states, which includes exposure to markets with high home values and high household income levels, ideal proximity to premium retail and high visibility locations and favorable supply outlooks versus industry averages. This transaction is a reflection of our focus on adding high-quality assets to our senior housing platform and maintaining balance across independent living and assisted living product types. We see New Seniors independent living assets is complementary to our existing high end major market portfolio as it provides a lower average resident age and longer length of stay at an accessible price point, with REVPOR of approximately 2,700. 
The purpose-built nature of these communities, which include consistent layouts with 120 units per building, also will strengthen our ability to effectively and efficiently redevelopment, redevelop and invest in these assets over time. 
Moving on to new developments. We continue to drive value from our development pipeline through our relationship with Le Groupe Maurice, where we have opened 3 communities with more than 1,000 units over the past year. 2 of the 3 developments were delivered in the fourth quarter of 2020. Both projects had substantial pre-leasing activity and have already stabilized at approximately 95% occupancy. 
The third project, a 287-unit expansion of an existing Le Groupe Maurice community in Montreal was delivered in June of this year. Initial leasing activity has been strong, with more than half of the new units occupied as of the end of July. 
Our plans across our broader SHOP portfolio includes significant deployment of refresh and redevelopment capital, strengthening our market-leading position where we expect to realize occupancy growth and pricing upside over the next few years. We continue to actively manage our portfolio with the disposition of nonstrategic assets and the transition of operators in select markets to position our senior housing business for long-term success. 
In summary, our recovery is off to a strong start. We are well positioned in markets that benefit from outsized aging and wealth demographics with less exposed we are executing our senior housing strategy to help ensure success in the near and long term. 
I will now hand over to Pete."

Together, these segments represent over 50% of Ventas' NOI. They continue to produce positive and reliable results. Within these segments, we're seeing a changing business climate. Health system and university business confidence is rising, leading to longer-term commitments and strategic growth investments. 
During the pandemic, we kept our business confidence. We remain focused on growth, and we continue to invest in incremental leasing resources and in creating a leasing center of excellence led by an industry veteran. She is now 2 years in. We've built a technical engineering team to assist our local property teams and running our buildings more efficiently, also led by an industry veteran. He is now 18 months in. 
We doubled our capital invested in our MOBs to ensure their competitiveness, including major redevelopments in Phoenix, Atlanta and Austin, Texas. We expanded our tenant satisfaction programs under the leadership of our new property management leader. He is also 18 months in. Because of this focus, I'm proud to say that our MOBs now rank in the top quartile of tenant overall satisfaction as surveyed by Kingsley, the national real estate survey leader, happy tenants equals higher occupancy. 
Our focus on the fundamentals and growth is showing results. Let me describe them now. Office, which includes our medical office and research and innovation segments, performed well delivering 10.5% sequential same-store growth. Office quarterly same-store growth was 12.6% year-on-year. The R&I portfolio benefited from a $12 million termination fee from a large tenant in the Winston Salem innovation center anchored by Wake Forest. Adjusted for the termination fee, Office sequential same-store growth was 90 basis points and 2.8% for year on year same-store quarterly growth, a strong quarter. 
Medical Office same-store sequential growth was 80 basis points, and year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 2.4%. For the quarter, we executed 230,000 square feet in office new leasing and 460,000 square feet year-to-date, a 78% improvement from prior year. Medical Office had strong same-store retention of 94% for the quarter and 85% for the trailing 12 months. The result is the total MOB occupancy increased 20 basis points sequentially. Total office leasing was 750,000 square feet for the quarter and 1.8 million square feet year-to-date. We are also pleased there are annual escalators for the new MOB leases averaged 2.9% for the quarter, which caused MOB same-store portfolio annual rent escalators to increase from 2.4% to 2.6%. 
Our R&I business continues to excel as it strives to provide effective facilities to support the record level of investment into life sciences research. Same-store sequential growth was 38.9%. Adjusted for the termination fee, same-store sequential growth was 1.1%. Year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 42.6%. Adjusted for the termination fee, year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was a strong 3.9%. Quarterly same-store occupancy was outstanding 94%, with sequential occupancy increasing by 10 basis points. 
Looking forward, we have 3 R&I buildings comprising of 1.2 million square feet of space under construction. Collectively, they are 78% leased or committed. Of the 2 buildings in our U City Complex in Philadelphia, the Drexel building is 100% leased, while One U City Square is over 55% leased or committed. We are oversubscribed for the remaining space with 11 above pro forma proposals currently outstanding. 
In Pittsburgh, our new building is 70% pre-leased, University of Pittsburgh, and UPMC with significant activity on the remaining space. At our recently opened project with Arizona State University in Phoenix, we are 86% leased or committed and expect to be 100% leased shortly. These performance numbers reflect the quality of our well-located R&I assets. 
Now let's turn to Health Care Triple Net. During the second quarter, our Health Care Triple Net assets showed continued strength and reliability with 100% rent collections. Second quarter same-store cash NOI growth was 2.5% year-on-year. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage through June 30 was strong across the portfolio. Health systems trailing 12-month coverage was an excellent 3.6x in the first quarter, a 10 basis point sequential improvement. As Debbie mentioned, Ardent continues to perform extremely well in this dynamic market. 
Our urban LTAC coverage improved 20 basis points to 1.9x in the first quarter, buoyed by strong business results. Although skilled nursing declined 10 basis points to 1.8x as the pandemic continued to impact census, total post-acute coverage increased sequentially by 20 basis points to 1.9x in the first quarter of '21. 
Finally, several of our partners have been approached for M&A opportunities. Kindred is expected to merge with LifePoint, Inspire recently entertained multiple offers by Ramsey. It is a testament to the underlying value of our health care operators and the associated real estate. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."
398549,1674658513,2367492,"Ventas, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2021",2021-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. In my remarks today, I'll cover our second quarter results, our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities. And finally, our expectations for the third quarter of '21. Starting with our results in the second quarter.  Ventas r",923,"Thanks, Steve. In my remarks today, I'll cover our second quarter results, our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities. And finally, our expectations for the third quarter of '21. 
Starting with our results in the second quarter.  Ventas reported strong second quarter net income of $0.23 per share and normalized funds from operations of $0.73 per share. Normalized FFO per share was $0.02 above the high end of our initial guidance range or $0.67 to $0.71 for the quarter, and is consistent with our June update to be at the high end or better than that original range. 
The Q2 is driven by growth in Office, continued stable performance from Triple Net, strong results from margins and better-than-expected NOI in our SHOP portfolio. 
Turning to capital. We've been busy in proactively managing our capital structure, duration of debt and liquidity since our last earnings call. First, following the announcement of the New Senior agreement, we raised $300 million of equity at an average gross price of approximately $58.60 per share under our ATM program. This $300 million equity raise, together with $800 million of new equity to be issued to new senior shareholders for the fixed exchange ratio and $1.2 billion of New Senior debt to be assumed or refinanced, constitutes the overall $2.3 billion funding of the new senior transaction. 
Second through August 5, we received $450 million of disposition proceeds and receipt of loan receivable. Included in the $450 million received to date is repayment of 2 well-structured loans in July, partner redemption of $200 million of 9.75% senior notes due 2026 and Holiday's repayment of $66 million of 9.4% notes due 2025. Medical office buildings sold during the second quarter also resulted in proceeds of approximately $107 million. 
Using proceeds from these dispositions, in the third quarter, Ventas will improve its near-term debt maturity profile further by fully repaying a total of $664 million and outstanding 3.25% senior notes due August '22 and 3.13% notes due June of 2023. 
As a result of the recovery of senior housing NOI and our capital structure actions, we're seeing strengthening credit metrics. Reported Q2 net EBITDA was better than expectations, improving 10 basis points sequentially to 7x. Within that 10 basis point improvement, underlying SHOP annualized EBITDA improved nearly $50 million or a 25 basis point beneficial impact to the ratio in just 1 quarter. This organic improvement was offset by the elimination of SHOP which experienced HHS grants in Q2. This provides a proof point of the anticipated material improvement in leverage, resulting from the underlying recovery in senior housing over time. 
Pro forma for announced ATM issuance and capital activities, Ventas' Q2 net debt-to-EBITDA moved lower from 7x to 6.8x. I would highlight that the New Senior transaction is expected to be 30 basis points levering on projected New Senior 2022 NOI and is supported by the forecasted growth in cash flows from the New Senior portfolio. 
Ventas has ample liquidity totaling $3.3 billion. As of August 5, the company had $2.7 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, $600 million in cash and no commercial paper outstanding. 
Let's finish with our Q3 guidance. Third quarter net income is estimated to range from flat to $0.05 per fully diluted share. Our guidance range for normalized FFO for Q3 is $0.70 to $0.74 per share. The Q3 FFO midpoint of $0.72 can be bridged from Q2 of $0.73 by a $0.02 benefit from the Ardent loan prepayment fee in Q3, net of the Ardent fee tranche in Q2, offset by $0.02 from lost interest income on the loan prepayments and the July equity rates. NOI reduction from assets intended for disposition described the last [indiscernible]. 
Key third quarter assumptions underlying our guidance are as follows: SHOP Q3 spot occupancy from June 30 to September 30 is forecast to increase between 150 to 250 basis points, with the midpoint roughly assuming a continuation of occupancy growth trends observed in July. REVPOR is expected to be roughly flat sequentially, and move-in incentives are expected to narrow in the quarter. Sequential SHOP revenue growth is expected to be offset by increasing operating costs due to an additional day in the quarter, higher occupancy, labor, and routine seasonal items, including repair and maintenance and utility costs. 
No HHS brands are soon to be received in the third quarter, stable performance is expected in the Office and Triple Net segments. We continue to expect $1 billion in asset sales and loan repayments for the full year 2021, with line of sight for the remaining balance in the second half of this year. Fully diluted share count is now 383 million shares, reflecting the equity rate in anticipation of New Senior. 
Guidance does not include any unannounced capital markets activity. Our Q3 guidance excludes any impact from the pending acquisition of New Senior. The New Senior transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021. And once closed, is forecast to be between $0.09 and to $0.11 accretive to normalized FFO per share in 2022. 
I'd like to underscore that we're still in a highly uncertain environment, though trends in SHOP are positive, the pandemic impact on our business remains very difficult to predict. 
Ventas is excited about our business and our future, and we believe we have a well diversified portfolio, best-in-class operators, and experienced team to win the recovery that is now underway. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator."

So if you were to look at our year-over-year REVPOR and you exclude Atria, which as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, had some discounting. I'll come back to that. And exclude LGM, which performed really well this past year, but they operate at a lower price point in an active living product in Canada. So there's a mix shift impact from LGM. So if you were to take those 2 out, our REVPOR would have increased 1.8%. 
So set LGM aside, let's get back to Atria. You might remember that Atria, starting back in the pandemic, has positioned themselves to go for volume in a few different ways. Very early on, they were the first to execute testing broadly. As they move throughout the pandemic, they saw an opportunity for volume ahead of the worst part of the pandemic, which was emerging in the fall and then into the winter. So they offered price incentives. And if you were to look at Atria's occupancy growth -- if you go a little further back from the low point and start back, for instance, December 31, they've grown 372 basis points versus the rest of our SHOP, our SHOP in total, which would be like 227 basis points. And so they are an absolute bonafied leader in driving occupancy volume. 
They chose to stay with the discounting. Into recent months, we've noticed on the underlying trends that they're starting to tighten. They also have a higher absolute occupancy than the rest of our portfolio and a lot of operators in the sector. So we believe that they are well positioned to start to push pricing in markets where they're seeing stabilization. That's their intent, they started to do it. They'll continue to do it. And they have a long track record of driving both occupancy and price, and we're in the very early stages of this recovery. So we're comfortable and confident that over time, they'll deliver. 
One other point, and that is that we have Sunrise Senior Living in our portfolio. Sunrise is a 9,000 REVPOR. They're sitting at 72% occupied. They've been driving a lot of occupancy growth as well. And the mix shift that I mentioned that kind of went the other way with LGM outperforming will shift the other way as Sunrise starts to grow. So I think our REVPOR outlook will be fine in the long term."

So first and foremost, we just want to make sure, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks and I'd like to say this a lot, that we're in the right markets, with the right asset and the right operator managing that asset. So that might be memory care or assisted living or independent living. They -- really, all the product types have good characteristics. The -- it's just the living and memory care are more need-driven. They do have higher price point. They also do run of higher costs. And so depending on the REVPOR associated with your product, your margins can vary. 
But it's a product that does tend to recover quickly. It did after the financial crisis, doing really well after the pandemic so far. So it's a great to have exposure as long as you're in the right markets with the right operator to that product. 
Independent living has a longer length of stay. It also has less new competition facing it. In the case of New Senior, there's extreme affordability relative to an AL product, it's about at least twice as good in terms of -- if you're a resident making a choice within your local market for a New Senior independent living versus for AL. So it reaches a broader audience. It also has pricing upside through investment and faces the same strong demographic wave that I was describing earlier. 
One other thing about independent living is because it faces less new competition, it does have a higher ceiling. Pre pandemic, it was outpacing AL and memory care by about 400 basis points. We don't see any reason why coming out the other side of that, it doesn't also have a higher ceiling moving forward."

Now those do convert at a lower rate though, but the more the merrier. So in addition to that, there's 3 other lead sources, there's res pit and professional referrals and personal referrals. Personal referrals in the second quarter for us, we're at 110% at pre-pandemic levels. So those have come roaring back professional still down around 74%, 75%, and are just under that.

The next is, I call it, typical seasonal cost increase in the third quarter. Utilities is the easy one, repair and convenience is another. But you see that every third quarter. The third bucket is really a function of occupancy growth and activity levels increasing in the communities. And obviously, you have incremental costs associated with that, which is a good thing.

As a consequence of having come out the other side, flexing labor, as you say, which should reach a level where then there is some scale advantage, if you like, that you can then hold off until you get to the next level of occupancy.

And I guess, just tied to that, a lot of smaller operators surveyed by Nick do have a view that they could get back to pre-COVID occupancy next year. I want to just ask you from your perspective, like do you think that's too optimistic? What's your sort of broad view on the puts and takes? I recognize the strategies are different in terms of occupancy versus rents, et cetera. But where do you think -- A, do you think those smaller operators are maybe too bullish? Or what are the puts and takes?"

And so we do think the combination of Atria and Holiday provides strategic benefits to us. And as an owner of Atria, we like that. We like the growth in Atria's platform.

Congratulations.Well, good morning, everyone. I want to welcome our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.Ventas delivered an outstanding second quarter.",1423,"Sarah, well done, your first public company merger. Congratulations.
Well, good morning, everyone. I want to welcome our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.
Ventas delivered an outstanding second quarter. And we have strong momentum across the board in health and safety; capital deployment and access; realization of the benefits of prior successful investments; financial strength; and most importantly, in portfolio growth, led by our high-quality SHOP business with significant contributions from Office and stability in our triple-net lease business. We see a clear path to growth in our demographically driven, diversified enterprise through capturing the embedded upside in our senior housing business; the benefit of external investments; reliable cash flow from our Office and triple net businesses; and delivery and stabilization of ongoing developments, primarily in the life sciences, research & innovation and Canadian senior housing areas. Our experienced team is committed to winning the recovery for all of our stakeholders.
Let me first turn to our second quarter results.
We posted $0.73 of normalized FFO per share, which is above the high end of our previously provided guidance. I'm delighted that our same-store property portfolio grew 3.6% sequentially. Our outperformance was driven by SHOP, which produced $111 million in quarterly NOI, a recovery of $50 million of annualized NOI, representing industry-leading growth in same-store cash NOI and occupancy. July continued these positive SHOP trends, for the fifth consecutive month of occupancy growth. Importantly, by the end of July, lease reached their highest level since the pandemic began. Justin will unpack these trends more fully in his remarks.
As a result, we've never been more confident that the senior living business is supported by powerful demand that is growing and resilient while supply remains constrained. If the last 18 months have taught us anything, it is that, as soon as our communities and care providers are ready to welcome residents and their families, we experience a surge of leads and move-ins almost immediately which then builds sustainably and rapidly. That said, given the macro uncertainty in the COVID-19 environment, particularly the national and regional rise in cases and the measures that have been taken or may be taken to contain COVID spread, the path to full recovery may not be a straight line, but we believe it will point inexorably upwards. In our third quarter outlook, we have assumed the increase in COVID cases throughout the U.S. may have some impact on the velocity of leasing and expenses.
Rounding out our portfolio performance. Office grew nicely in the quarter, and our triple net portfolio continued its stability. Pete's efforts to increase leasing, keep high retention rates, improve customer relationships and grow NOI are showing results. Our on-campus and affiliated MOB strategy with leading health systems continues to shine.
Turning to health systems. Our investment in Ardent also continues to deliver benefits. In addition to strong cash flow coverage on our $1.3 billion leasehold position, our 10% equity stake in the Ardent enterprise is benefiting from excellent Ardent results; and our prior purchase of $200 million of Ardent senior notes recently paid off with a $15 million prepayment fee, providing us with a 13% unlevered return on our investment in the Ardent notes. When all is said and done, I believe and hope that our Ardent investment in real estate, equity and debt will prove to be one of our best risk-adjusted-return investments.
Turning to other capital allocation priorities. We certainly are on our front foot regarding external investments. In total, in 2021, we have over $3.5 billion in investments completed, pending or underway; with another $1 billion life science, research & innovation pipeline, with our exclusive development partner Wexford right behind that. Our team is also busy evaluating attractive deals across our asset classes. This year-to-date, we have already reviewed about as many investment opportunities as we saw in all of 2019. We will pursue those that meet our multifactor investment philosophy which is focused on growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk-adjusted returns, taking into account factors such as cost per square foot or unit, downside protection and ultimate potential for cash flow growth and asset appreciation.
Our $2.3 billion pending investment in New Senior announced in the second quarter is a great example. In this deal, we are acquiring over 100 high-quality independent living communities that are well invested and located in advantaged market at compelling pricing. The per unit cost is estimated to be 20% to 30% below replacement cost. The 5% cash going in cap rate is expected to grow to a 6% cap rate on expected 2022 NOI, with upside as the senior housing recovery continues. And the FFO multiple of less than 12x post-synergized 2022 estimated FFO are all attractive valuation metrics. I commend Susan Givens and her team for doing a tremendous job creating and realizing value for their stakeholders. We are also confident that Ventas shareholders will receive immediate and long-term accretion and upside from the deal as senior housing recovers and the large middle-market demographic expands significantly in the near term. As Justin will describe, the New Senior portfolio also fits in with our senior housing strategy and framework. New Senior also performed well in Q2 and into July, with occupancy increasing in its same-store portfolio for 5 straight months.
A unique strategic advantage of the New Senior transaction is the long-standing relationship we have with the principal managers of the portfolio, Atria and Holiday, 2 leading operators who recently combined to form the second largest senior housing manager. As a 1/3 owner of Atria, we are excited about the opportunities the combination creates. We will directly benefit from growth in Atria's management platform. And we welcome the combination of Atria and Holiday's talent in Atria's advanced enterprise. Congratulations to Atria for pulling together this industry-changing transaction.
Switching to our attractive life science, research & innovation business. It continues to provide us with value-creating opportunities to invest capital. The Ventas life science portfolio now exceeds 9 million square feet. It's located in 3 of the top 5 cluster markets, includes 3 ongoing development projects and is affiliated with over 16 of the nation's top research universities. We also have an incremental $1 billion in potential projects we are working on with Wexford. The first and largest new life science project in the pipeline totaling about $0.5 billion in costs is gaining steam. Expected to be 60% pre-leased to a major public research university that ranks in the top 5% of NIH funding, this project will be located on the West Coast and should break ground in the first half of 2022. Wexford, with its exceptional reputation among universities, is also exploring significant additional life science potential projects beyond those in our existing pipeline.
North of the border, we continued to invest capital in high-end, large-scale independent living communities with our partner Le Groupe Maurice in Qu√©bec. We have always tried to create value through both internal and external growth, and we're pleased that we've returned to being a net acquirer in 2021. Our team is active and engaged beyond our announced deals and our pipeline of potential investments across asset classes. To fund new investments, we have access to significant liquidity and a wide array of capital sources, including the asset dispositions and receipt of loan repayments, as Bob will describe in greater detail. The demand for senior housing has been robust and sustainable, proving out the value proposition our communities and care providers offer to seniors and their families. The SHOP recovery has begun, and we've started capturing the significant upside embedded in our existing senior housing portfolio from both pandemic recovery and the 17.5% growth in the senior population projected over the next few years. Our diversified business model continues to provide uplifts and stability to our enterprise. We are investing nearly $4 billion in announced deals and development projects, and our access to and pricing of capital are positive.
In closing. The U.S. is in the midst of an impressive economic recovery. That, together with demographic demand for all our asset classes, will benefit our business. We embrace the opportunity to take on any near-term challenges that are temporarily caused by the strength and speed of this recovery, especially because now, unlike last year and the beginning of 2021, our employees, residents, tenants and caregivers are largely safe and healthy. As a team at Ventas, we're incredibly pleased about the results we've delivered and the strength and momentum we've demonstrated.
Justin, over to you."

Although we are still in the early stages of the recovery, we are off to a very st",1506,"Thank you, Debbie.
We remain excited about delivering industry-leading occupancy and NOI growth, and we are encouraged about recent trends in the senior housing portfolio. Although we are still in the early stages of the recovery, we are off to a very strong start. Ventas is well positioned to benefit from significant senior housing tailwinds, including the sector recovery upside, supportive demand fundamentals and continued improvement in leading indicators. I'll review 3 topics today: first, our second quarter performance; second, our perspective on the senior housing operating environment; and third, our continued execution of our senior housing strategy. I'll start by covering our second quarter performance.
In SHOP, leading indicators continued to trend favorably and accelerated during the quarter, as leads and move-ins each surpassed 100% of 2019 levels while move-outs remained steady. June marked the best month for lease and move-ins since the start of the pandemic, and July has sustained strong momentum. Strong sales activity has now driven 5 consecutive months of occupancy growth, inclusive of July. In the second quarter, approximate spot occupancy from March 31 to June 30 increased 229 basis points, led by the U.S. with growth of 313 basis points from accelerating lease and move-ins. In Canada, the trends were more muted due to a slower vaccine rollout, but approximate spot occupancy still increased during the second quarter, driven by 33 basis points of growth in June. Leading indicators remained strong in our portfolio, as the digital footprint of our operators has significantly expanded over the past year, casting a wider net as traditional high-converting lead sources such as personal referrals, respite and professional referrals continue recovering.
Turning to the SHOP operating results. Same-store revenue in the second quarter increased sequentially by $3.5 million, as strong occupancy growth was partially offset by the impact of new resident move-in incentives and pricing, specifically at Atria. I will touch on that more in a minute. Operating expenses declined sequentially by $9.2 million or 2.3%, excluding the impact of HHS grants received in the first quarter, driven by a better-than-expected reduction of COVID-19 operating costs, partially offset by a modest increase in routine operating expenses.
For the sequential same-store pool, SHOP generated approximately $111 million of NOI received in the first quarter, which represents a sequential increase of $12.4 million or 12.6% when excluding the impact of HHS grants. This marks the first quarter of sequential underlying NOI growth since the onset of COVID-19 and approximates a nearly $50 million NOI improvement on an annualized basis. During the quarter, we saw solid contribution to sequential NOI growth from both revenue and operating expenses as average occupancy increased 110 basis points and COVID-19 costs declined substantially and ahead of expectations.
Turning to triple net. Sequential same-store cash NOI was largely stable in the second quarter, and 98% of all contractual triple net rent was received from the company's tenants. Our trailing 12-month cash flow coverage for senior housing, which is reported 1 quarter in arrears, is 1.2x and down versus the prior quarter, reflecting the timing associated with coverage reporting which now includes effectively 4 full quarters of operations impacted by COVID.
Moving on to the current operating environment, which is full of green shoots. Our market-leading operators continued to demonstrate their strong market position through broad occupancy gains; Sunrise, by the way, with 627 basis points of spot occupancy growth from the low point in mid-March through the end of July, benefiting from a rejuvenated management team, significantly well-invested communities and a balanced approach, demonstrating very strong occupancy gains and pricing power. We would like to congratulate Sunrise's CEO, Jack Callison, for adding experience and depth to his management team with his recently announced hires. Atria, which benefits from a higher absolute occupancy of 81.8% at July end, continues to deliver solid volume growth. Spot occupancy in July increased 529 basis points since the low point in mid-March, resulting from the combination of their industry-leading vaccine mandate and strategic price incentives to capture movements. Atria anticipates tightening incentives moving forward as pricing power recovers and occupancy stabilizes. Supporting all of this is Atria's industry-leading vaccination rates, which are impressively high at nearly 100% of both residents and employees.
Looking ahead. As Debbie mentioned, the third quarter is off to a strong start, with July spot occupancy increasing 74 basis points versus June and lease continuing to stand strong at 105% of pre-pandemic levels. Our operators have been prioritizing resident safety; and weathering several nearer-term headwinds, including the delta variant and transitory wage pressures from staffing shortages in select markets.
Underpinning our leading operating partner relationships and recent sales momentum is our attractive market footprint which positions us to benefit from the compelling supply-and-demand outlook in the senior housing sector. Our communities in the U.S. are poised for improving performance over time due to our strong presence in submarkets that outpaced the U.S. national average and aging population growth and wealth demographics but with significantly lower exposure to new construction starts and construction as a percentage of inventory. Approximately 30% of our SHOP portfolio on a stabilized basis is located in Canada. The senior housing sector in Canada has performed exceptionally well, with occupancy exceeding 90% every year from 2010 to 2020 and demand outpacing new supply in 8 of that 11 years. As a foundation to these attractive fundamentals, the 75-plus population in Canada is projected to grow more than 20% over the next 5 years, about twice the pace of the U.S.
The Ventas team has been busy executing our senior housing strategy driven by experiential operating expertise and underpinned by our analytical capabilities to further strengthen our senior housing business. The underlying goal of our strategy is simply to execute portfolio actions that ensure we are located in the right markets with the right operator, with assets with strong local market positioning. A notable example of our strategy execution is the New Senior transaction. New Senior has a track record of strong operating performance, benefits from a geographically diverse footprint with favorable exposure to compelling market fundamentals and demographics and represents a well-invested high-quality portfolio catering to an attractive market segment. The acquisition also represents an excellent opportunity to further expand our relationships with 2 long-standing operators in Holiday Retirement and Atria Senior Living and with new relationships [ such as ] Hawthorn Senior Living.
New Senior will strengthen our existing senior housing business from several strategic perspectives. Operationally, New Senior will enhance Ventas' cash flow generation profile. Its margin has remained resilient in the 35%-plus range during the COVID-19, and occupancy has weathered the pandemic headwinds approximately 80 basis points better than the NIC industry average. Most recently, New Senior has seen strong sales trends as we progressed through the early stages of the senior housing recovery, with powerful upside as the portfolio occupancy grew 100 basis points in June. Geographically, New Senior has a diverse presence across 36 states, which includes exposure to markets with high home values and high household income levels, ideal proximity to premium retail and high-visibility locations and favorable supply outlooks versus industry averages. This transaction is a reflection of our focus on adding high-quality assets to our senior housing platform and maintaining balance across independent living and assisted living product types. We see New Senior's independent living assets as complementary to our existing high-end major-market portfolio, as it provides a lower average resident age and longer length of stay at an accessible price point, with REVPOR of approximately $2,700. The purpose-built nature of these communities, which include consistent layouts with 120 units per building, also will strengthen our ability to effectively and efficiently redevelopment -- redevelop and invest in these assets over time.
Moving on to new developments. We continue to drive value from our development pipeline through our relationship with Le Groupe Maurice, where we have opened 3 communities with more than 1,000 units over the past year. 2 of the 3 developments were delivered in the fourth quarter of 2020. Both projects have substantial pre-leasing activity and have already stabilized at approximately 95% occupancy. The third project, a 287-unit expansion of an existing Le Groupe Maurice community in Montreal, was delivered in June of this year. Initial leasing activity has been strong, with more than half of the new units occupied as of the end of July. Our plans across our broader SHOP portfolio include significant deployment of refresh and redevelopment capital, strengthening our market-leading position where we expect to realize occupancy growth and pricing upside over the next few years. We continue to actively manage our portfolio with the disposition of nonstrategic assets and the transition of operators in select markets to position our senior housing business for long-term success.
In summary. Our recovery is off to a strong start. We are well positioned in markets that benefit from outsized aging and wealth demographics, with less [indiscernible] we are executing our senior housing strategy to help ensure success in the near and long term.

I'll cover the Office and health care triple net segments. Together, these segments represents over 50% of Ventas' NOI. They continue to produce positive and reliable results.
Within these segments, we're seeing a changing business climate. Health system and university business confidence is rising, leading to longer-term commitments and strategic growth investments. During the pandemic, we kept our business confidence. We remain focused on growth, and we continue to invest in incremental leasing resources and in creating a leasing center of excellence led by an industry veteran. She is now 2 years in. We've built a technical engineering team to assist our local property teams in running our buildings more efficiently, also led by an industry veteran. He is now 18 months in. We doubled our capital invested in our MOBs to ensure their competitiveness, including major redevelopments in Phoenix, Atlanta and Austin, Texas. We expanded our tenant satisfaction programs under the leadership of our new property management leader. He is also 18 months in. Because of this focus, I'm proud to say that our MOBs now rank in the top quartile of tenant overall satisfaction as surveyed by Kingsley, the national real estate survey leader. Happy tenants equals higher occupancy.
Our focus on the fundamentals and growth is showing results. Let me describe them now.
Office, which includes our medical office and research and innovation segments, performed well, delivering 10.5% sequential same-store growth. Office quarterly same-store growth was 12.6% year-on-year. The R&I portfolio benefited from a $12 million termination fee from a large tenant in the Winston-Salem innovation center anchored by Wake Forest. Adjusted for the termination fee, Office sequential same-store growth was 90 basis points, and 2.8% for year-on-year same-store quarterly growth, a strong quarter. Medical office same-store sequential growth was 80 basis points, and year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 2.4%. For the quarter, we executed 230,000 square feet in office new leasing; and 460,000 square feet year-to-date, a 78% improvement from prior year. Medical office had strong same-store retention of 94% for the quarter and 85% for the trailing 12 months. The result is the total MOB occupancy increased 20 basis points sequentially. Total office leasing was 750,000 square feet for the quarter and 1.8 million square feet year-to-date. We were also pleased that our annual escalators for the new MOB leases averaged 2.9% for the quarter, which caused MOB same-store portfolio annual rent escalators to increase from 2.4% to 2.6%.
Our R&I business continues to excel as it strives to provide effective facilities to support the record level of investment into life sciences research. Same-store sequential growth was 38.9%. Adjusted for the termination fee, same-store sequential growth was 1.1%. Year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was 42.6%. Adjusted for the termination fee, year-on-year quarterly same-store growth was a strong 3.9%. Quarterly same-store occupancy was an outstanding 94%, with sequential occupancy increasing by 10 basis points. Looking forward, we have 3 R&I buildings comprising of 1.2 million square feet of space under construction. Collectively, they are 78% leased or committed. Of the 2 buildings in our uCity complex in Philadelphia, the Drexel building is 100% leased, while One uCity Square is over 55% leased or committed. We are oversubscribed for the remaining space, with 11 above-pro-forma proposals currently outstanding. In Pittsburgh, our new building is 70% pre-leased, University of Pittsburgh and UPMC, with significant activity on the remaining space. At our recently opened project with Arizona State University in Phoenix, we are 86% leased or committed and expect to be 100% leased shortly. These performance numbers reflect the quality of our well-located R&I assets.
Now let's turn to health care triple net. During the second quarter, our health care triple net assets showed continued strength and reliability with 100% rent collections. Second quarter same-store cash NOI growth was 2.5% year-on-year. Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage through June 30 was strong across the portfolio. Health systems trailing 12-month coverage was an excellent 3.6x in the first quarter, a 10 basis point sequential improvement.
As Debbie mentioned, Ardent continues to perform extremely well in this dynamic market. Urban LTAC coverage improved 20 basis points to 1.9x in the first quarter, buoyed by strong business results. Although skilled nursing declined 10 basis points to 1.8x as the pandemic continued to impact census, total post acute coverage increased sequentially by 20 basis points to 1.9x in the first quarter of '21.
Finally, several of our partners have been approached for M&A opportunities. Kindred is expected to merge with LifePoint, and Spire recently entertained multiple offers by Ramsay. It is a testament to the underlying value of our health care operators and the associated real estate.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."
398549,1674658513,2368536,"Ventas, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2021",2021-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Pete.In my remarks today, I'll cover our second quarter results; our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities; and finally, our expectations for the third quarter of '21.Starting with our results in the second quarter. Ventas rep",926,"Thanks, Pete.
In my remarks today, I'll cover our second quarter results; our recent liquidity, balance sheet and capital activities; and finally, our expectations for the third quarter of '21.
Starting with our results in the second quarter. Ventas reported strong second quarter net income of $0.23 per share and normalized funds from operations of $0.73 per share. Normalized FFO per share was $0.02 above the high end of our initial guidance range of $0.67 to $0.71 for the quarter and is consistent with our June update to be at the high end or better than that original range. The Q2 outturn was driven by growth in Office, continued stable performance from triple net, strong results from margins and better-than-expected NOI in our SHOP portfolio.
Turning to capital. We've been busy in proactively managing our capital structure, duration of debt and liquidity since our last earnings call. First, following the announcement of the New Senior agreement, we raised $300 million in equity at an average gross price of approximately $58.60 per share under our ATM program. This $300 million equity raise, together with $800 million of new equity to be issued to New Senior shareholders [ per ] the fixed exchange ratio and $1.2 billion of New Senior debt to be assumed or refinanced, constitutes the overall $2.3 billion funding of the New Senior transaction.
[ Second ], through August 5, we've received $450 million of disposition proceeds and receipts of loan receivables. Included in the $450 million received to date is repayment of 2 well-structured loans in July: Ardent's redemption of $200 million of 9.75% senior notes due 2026 and Holiday's repayment of $66 million of 9.4% notes due 2025. Medical office buildings sold during the second quarter also resulted in proceeds of approximately $107 million. Using proceeds from these dispositions, in the third quarter, Ventas will improve its near-term debt maturity profile further by fully repaying a total of $664 million in outstanding 3.25% senior notes due August '22 and 3.13% notes due June of 2023.
As a result of the recovery in senior housing NOI and our capital structure actions, we're seeing strengthening credit metrics. Reported Q2 net debt-EBITDA was better than expectations, improving 10 basis points sequentially to 7x. Within that 10 basis points improvement, underlying SHOP annualized EBITDA improved nearly $50 million or a 25 basis point beneficial impact to the ratio in just 1 quarter. This organic improvement was offset by the elimination of SHOP HHS grants in Q2. This provides a proof point of the anticipated material improvement in leverage resulting from the underlying recovery in senior housing over time. Pro forma [ for ] announced ATM issuance and capital activities, Ventas' Q2 net debt-to-EBITDA moved lower from 7x to 6.8x. I would highlight that the New Senior transaction is expected to be 30 basis points levering on projected New Senior 2022 NOI and is supported by the forecasted growth in cash flows from the New Senior portfolio.
Ventas has ample liquidity totaling $3.3 billion. As of August 5, the company had $2.7 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, $600 million cash and no commercial paper outstanding.
Let's finish with our Q3 guidance. Third quarter net income is estimated to range from flat to $0.05 per fully diluted share. Our guidance range for normalized FFO for Q3 is $0.70 to $0.74 per share. The Q3 FFO midpoint of $0.72 can be bridged from Q2, of $0.73, by a $0.02 benefit from the Ardent loan prepayment fee in Q3, net of the Ardent HHS grants in Q2, offset by $0.02 from lost interest income on the loan prepayments and the July equity raise [ and the line ] reduction from assets intended for disposition [ described last time ].
Key third quarter assumptions underlying our guidance are as follows. SHOP Q3 spot occupancy from June 30 to September 30 is forecast to increase between 150 to 250 basis points, with the midpoint roughly assuming a continuation of occupancy growth trends observed in July. REVPOR is expected to be roughly flat sequentially, and move-in incentives are expected to narrow in the quarter. Sequential SHOP revenue growth is expected to be offset by increasing operating costs due to an additional day in the quarter; higher occupancy; labor; and routine seasonal items, including repair and maintenance and utility costs.
No HHS grants are assumed to be received in the third quarter. Stable performance is expected in the Office and triple net segments. We continue to expect $1 billion in asset sales and loan repayments for the full year 2021, with line of sight for the remaining balance in the second half of this year. Fully diluted share count is now 383 million shares, reflecting the equity raise in anticipation of New Senior.
Guidance does not include any unannounced capital markets activity. Our Q3 guide excludes any impacts from the pending acquisition of New Senior. The New Senior transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021 and, once closed, is forecast to be between $0.09 to $0.11 accretive to normalized FFO per share in 2022. I'd like to underscore that we're still in a highly uncertain environment. Though trends in SHOP are positive, the pandemic's impact on our business remains very difficult to predict.
Ventas is excited about our business and our future. And we believe we have the well-diversified portfolio, best-in-class operators and experienced team to win the recovery that is now underway.
That concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call back to the operator."

So if you were to look at our year-over-year REVPOR and you exclude Atria which as I mentioned in the prepared remarks had some discounting, and I'll come back to that, and exclude LGM which performed really well in this past year but they're operating a lower-price-point active living product in Canada -- so there's a mix shift impact from LGM. So if you were to take those two out, our REVPOR would have increased 1.8%.
So set LGM aside. Let's get back to Atria. You might remember that Atria, starting back during the pandemic, had positioned themselves to go for volume a few different ways. Very early on, they were the first to execute testing, broadly. As they moved throughout the pandemic, they saw an opportunity for volume ahead of the worst part of the pandemic, which was emerging in the fall and then into the winter, so they offered price incentives. And if you were to look at Atria's occupancy growth, if you go a little further back from the low point and start back, for instance, December 31, they've grown 372 basis points versus the rest of our SHOP with -- or SHOP in total which would be like 227 basis points. And so they are an absolute, bona fide leader in driving occupancy volume. They chose to stay with the discounting. Into recent months, we've noticed in the underlying trends that they're starting to tighten. They also have a higher absolute occupancy than the rest of our portfolio and a lot of operators in the sector, so we believe that they are well positioned to start to push pricing in markets where they're seeing stabilization. That's their intent. They've started to do it. They'll continue to do it, and they have a long track record of driving both occupancy and price. And we're in the very early stages of this recovery, so we're comfortable and confident that, over time, they'll deliver.
One other point, and that is that we have Sunrise Senior Living in our portfolio. Sunrise is a $9,000 REVPOR. They're sitting at 72% occupied. They've been driving a lot of occupancy growth as well. And the mix shift that I mentioned that kind of went the other way with LGM outperforming will shift the other way as Sunrise starts to grow, so I think our REVPOR outlook will be [ fine ] in the long term."

So first and foremost, we just want to make sure, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks and I like to say this a lot, that we're in the right markets, with the right asset and the right operator managing that asset. And so that might be memory care or assisted living or independent living. They -- really all the product types have good characteristics, but assisted living and memory care are more need-driven. They do have higher price point. They also do run with higher costs. And so depending on the REVPOR associated with your product, your margins can vary, but it's a product that does tend to recover quickly. It did after the financial crisis. It's doing really well after the pandemic, so far, so it's great to have exposure, as long as you're in the right markets with the right operator to that product. Independent living has a longer length of stay. It also has less new competition facing it. In the case of New Senior, there's extreme affordability relative to an AL product. It's about at least twice as good in terms of if you're a resident making a choice within your local market for a New Senior independent living versus for AL. So it reaches a broader audience. It also has pricing upside through investment and faces the same strong demographic wave that I was describing earlier.
One other thing about independent living is, because it faces less new competition, it does have a higher ceiling. Pre pandemic, it was outpacing AL and memory care by about 400 basis points. We don't see any reason why, coming out the other side of that, it doesn't also have higher ceiling moving forward."

Plus, there should be some more occupancy upside than we were seeing at that time, so we feel good about the flow-through.

And that is an environment that we're -- we feel very comfortable kind of managing through to the other side because, when you step back, it's really all about that demand, the demographics, building that occupancy and pricing power and capturing that embedded upside in both Ventas senior housing as well as now New Senior. So we'd rather have this environment and many others. And I think we can successfully really manage through it because of the demand that is right in front of us."

So referral agencies and Internet-based leads are way over 100%, 150%, 160%, of pre-pandemic levels. And so they've played a huge role in driving leads. That's maybe a silver lining that came from the pandemic, where it forced operators to invest into that source of referrals. And it's a game changer really. And so we've seen those leads pick up. Now those do convert at a lower rate, though, but the more the merrier. So in addition to that, there's 3 other lead sources. There's respite and professional referrals and personal referrals. Personal referrals in the second quarter for us we're at 110% of pre-pandemic levels, so those have come roaring back. Professional is still down, around 74%, 75%. And respites are just under that, so there's still a ways to go yet with professional and respites to recover and which we think is encouraging because the lead levels have been quite strong."

The next is, I call it, typical seasonal cost increase in the third quarter. Utilities is the easy one. Repairs and maintenance is another, but you see that every third quarter. The third bucket is really a function of occupancy growth and activity levels increasing in the communities; and obviously you have incremental costs associated with that, which is a good thing. And kind of overlaying all that is back to this question of short-term wage pressure in light of the labor market, which is effectively embedded in the thinking, but there's a series of different bucket that all together add up to that third quarter expense number."

We're growing labor as we're growing occupancy right now as a consequence of having come out the other side flexing labor, as you say, which should reach a level where then there is some scale advantage, if you like, that you can then hold off until you get to the next level of occupancy.

Because if I look at the third quarter guidance, it does feel like your margin is going to be about 20% in SHOP.

And we don't really have the crystal ball in terms of when we stabilize, but I was thinking more on a stabilized basis.

And then from there, pricing power and occupancy upside could support even higher margins over time. So that's all I was saying.

And welcome to the Ventas Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm so happy to be hosting this call in person with my trusted colleagues for the first time since early 2020. V",902,"Thanks, Sarah, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm so happy to be hosting this call in person with my trusted colleagues for the first time since early 2020. Ventas delivered positive results in the third quarter, saw outstanding sequential SHOP average occupancy growth, benefited from its large medical office, life science and health care triple-net businesses, and executed on its investment priorities, delivering $0.73 of normalized FFO per share, which is in the upper half of our guidance range. 
Our same-store SHOP portfolio increased rate and grew occupancy at record levels in Q3 despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in a broader environment. Occupancy in this portfolio has now increased for 8 consecutive months through October. Demonstrating powerful demand, our U.S. same-store SHOP portfolio has increased occupancy 750 basis points since in mid-March 2021, lifting the entire same-store shop portfolio, nearly 600 basis points during the same period. 
I'm also encouraged that our year-over-year SHOP occupancy turned positive for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. So a robust senior housing recovery is well underway. But as we stated, it may not progress in a straight line. Consistent with macro trends, and as we anticipated in our last call with you, the pandemic has created a tight labor market, resulting in labor cost pressures that accelerated in September. 
Looking ahead, we expect to see meaningful revenue increases in the first quarter of 2022 and improving pricing power. At a macro level, many economists forecast that labor force participation will expand from its current low rate for a variety of reasons. These factors should cause current conditions to ease considerably over time. Even more importantly, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who has been consistently the most accurate expert throughout the pandemic stated today that the COVID-19 pandemic is effectively behind us in the U.S. given all the tools we now have to combat it, including Pfizer's new treatment. 
If Scott continues to be right, it is a momentous day for all of us. We continue to be delighted that 1/3 of our business consists of medical office outpatient and life science, research & innovation. Our operational initiatives in medical office and aggressive capital deployment in life science are providing reliable growth and value creation for our enterprise and stakeholders. Turning to capital allocation. We have been highly active with $3.7 billion of investments announced or closed year-to-date. 
Our current capital allocation focus remains senior living, selective private medical office building opportunities and life science R&I. Let me highlight a few new investments we've made. We've completed $2.5 billion in independent living investments including our accretive acquisition of new seniors 100-plus independent living communities at an attractive valuation well below replacement cost and a 6-community Canadian senior living portfolio with one of the new senior operators, Hawthorn. 
In medical office, we've completed or announced $300 million of investments. First, establishing a new relationship with industry leader Eating Recovery Center, we acquired a Class A asset under a long-term lease in this rapidly growing sector. Second, by acquiring our partner, PMB's interest in the Sutter Van Ness, Trophy MOB in downtown San Francisco. We now own 100% of this asset at a 6% yield. With 92% of the MOB already leased, we intend to capture additional NOI growth and value. 
Finally, we intend to expand our relationship with Ardent Healthcare by acquiring 18 of their 100% leased medical office buildings for $200 million by year-end. On our third capital allocation priority, we are delighted to announce that we have commenced development of a 1 million square foot life science project anchored by Premier Research University, UC Davis, with our exclusive partner, Wexford. Purpose built for clinical research, this project will be 60% pre-leased to UC Davis, and total project costs are expected to be $0.5 billion. 
Turning to our robust investment pipeline. Our team remains busy evaluating attractive opportunities. In fact, we've now reviewed more deal volume this year than we saw in all of 2019, over $40 billion. And we continue to pursue those that meet our multifactor investment framework. Capital continues to flow into our sectors as global institutional investors agree with our thesis on the favorable trends benefiting all of our asset classes. These strong capital flows are also supporting our intention to recycle $1 billion of capital this year to enhance both our balance sheet and our portfolio. 
Our diversified business model continues to provide significant benefits. Our early and aggressive investments into medical office and life science are creating significant value. We are also proud to be associated with so many leading care providers, operators and developers in all our business lines and to be establishing new platforms for growth, through both our investment and our portfolio actions. In closing, the U.S. is in the midst of an impressive economic recovery that together with demographic demand for our asset classes, gives us confidence and optimism in our future. 
We believe that the more widespread administration of vaccines and new efficacious treatments for COVID-19, will benefit both the broader economic recovery and our company. Our aligned and experienced team continues to be focused on capturing the double upside in senior housing from both pandemic recovery and the projected growth in the senior population and also to continuing our long track record of external growth.

I'll start by saying it is very exciting to see the strong supply-demand fundamentals supporting occupancy growth in the senior housing sector. We have been busy taking actions through acquisitions, dispositions and transitions to ensure we are strongly positioned during this period of sector recovery. Our industry-leading operators are successfully driving revenue growth in the early stages of the recovery and taking actions to address elevated labor costs driven by the macro backdrop. 
Moving on to third quarter performance. In SHOP, leading indicators continue to trend favorably during the quarter as leads and move-ins each surpassed 100% of 2019 levels, while move-outs remains steady. Strong sales activity has now driven 8 consecutive months of occupancy growth inclusive of October. In the third quarter, average occupancy grew by 230 basis points over the second quarter, led by the U.S. with growth of 290 basis points and 110 basis points in Canada, which is over 93% occupied. October leading indicators remain solid as leads and move-ins continue to perform above pre-pandemic levels and move-outs remained relatively stable. 
Turning to SHOP operating results. Same-store revenue in the third quarter increased sequentially by $13.6 million or 3.1%, driven by strong occupancy growth and slight rate growth. Regarding rate growth, our operators have proposed rent increases to their residents of 8% in the U.S. and 4% in Canada, which on a blended basis is approximately 200 basis points higher than the historical levels. We also continue to see improvement in our re-leasing spreads, which are trending close to pre-pandemic levels. 
Operating expenses increased sequentially by $16.7 million or 5.4%, of which, approximately half is due to overtime and agency costs. Although we largely anticipated the additional labor costs, September spiked and represented approximately half of the sequential agency expense increase. We carried the elevated September cost forward in our Q4 guidance, which Bob will cover shortly. Despite the higher agency and overtime costs, our operators are now witnessing net positive hiring and are actively addressing labor challenges through a number of initiatives. 
These include centralized recruitment of line staff, implementation of applicant tracking systems, delivering on the increased demand by employees for flexible schedules and other workplace improvements to become more competitive. For the sequential same-store pool, SHOP generated $106.7 million of NOI in the third quarter, which represents a sequential decrease of $3.7 million or 3.4%. Moving on to portfolio actions. Our new senior acquisition closed on September 21. 
The portfolio consists of 103 independent living communities located in attractive markets with favorable demand characteristics. Integration efforts have gone extremely smoothly, and we are on track to realize our expected synergies. We are pleased with the performance and operating trends of the portfolio. Its third quarter spot occupancy grew 110 basis points sequentially. The same-store pool, which excludes the 33 communities that transitioned to new operators this year, grew 180 basis points in the third quarter and then another 10 basis points in October, marking occupancy growth in 6 out of the past 7 months. 
We have also recently closed on an acquisition in Canada, which includes 5 independent living and 1 assisted living communities. These acquisitions expand our independent living exposure to 59% of NOI on a stabilized basis. We believe the structural benefits of the independent living model present attractive opportunities to further strengthen our senior housing NOI margin through less intensive staffing requirements, low resident length of stays and accessible price points, all underpinned by exposure to a large and growing middle market. 
This is in combination with our existing portfolio positions us well to capture demographic demand with the 80-plus population expected to grow over 17% over the next 5 years while facing less new supply versus historical levels. I'd also like to note our previously announced transition of 90 assisted living and memory care communities is off to a solid start as 65 communities have already transitioned and the rest are planned by year-end. 
We believe the enhanced oversight provided by the experienced mid-market, midsized assisted living operators will improve the execution of local market strategy and with increased accountability. I have long-standing relationships and familiarity with the incoming CEOs. And I can say they are really fired up about their new portfolios. They are actively engaged with personal visits to the communities and transition planning. Ventas has 37 operator relationships, including 7 of the top 10 largest operators in the sector and 8 new relationships added this year. 
We look forward to the opportunity to grow our relationships with these companies over time. In summary, the senior housing sector is benefiting from a strong macro supply/demand backdrop. We are actively positioning ourselves for success through portfolio actions, and our operators are driving revenue and managing the elevated labor situation. We look forward to forging ahead during a very exciting time of sector recovery. Bob?"

I'll close out our prepared remarks by quickly touching on our third quarter office and enterprise results, discussing our recent balance sheet and capital activities and laying out our fourth quarter expectations. Our life science and MOB",797,"Thanks, Justin. I'll close out our prepared remarks by quickly touching on our third quarter office and enterprise results, discussing our recent balance sheet and capital activities and laying out our fourth quarter expectations. Our life science and MOB businesses, led by Pete Bulgarelli and which represent nearly 1/3 of our company's NOI, once again delivered robust and reliable growth in the third quarter. These businesses, taken together, increased same-store NOI by 4.2% year-over-year and increased 1.2% sequentially on an adjusted basis. 
MOB NOI grew 3.2% year-over-year and R&I increased 7.1%. Some stats of interest that underpin this strong performance. MOB occupancy is up 130 basis points year-to-date; same-store MOB occupancy of 91.3%, is at its highest point since the first quarter of 2018. MOB tenant retention was 91% in the third quarter, and MOB new leasing increased 43% versus prior year. R&I occupancy remains outstanding at 94.4% and improved 50 basis points sequentially due to exciting demand for lab space. 
MOB expenses increased less than 1% year-on-year as a result of completed energy conservation projects in sourcing initiatives. And for the second year in a row, we rank in the top quartile of our peer group for tenant satisfaction as measured by Kingsley Associates. 2021 rankings for each major key performance indicator increased when compared to 2020. At the enterprise level, we delivered $0.73 of FFO per share in the third quarter. This result is at the higher end of our $0.70 to $0.74 guidance range and benefited from the stable performance of our diversified portfolio as well as a $0.04 Ardent bond prepayment fee that was included in our guidance. 
We are also very active in the third quarter, managing our balance sheet and capital structure. Consistent with our prior $1 billion disposition guidance, we now have $875 million of disposition proceeds in the bank with $170 million of senior housing and MOB portfolios under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter. These dispositions have enhanced and reshaped our portfolio, and we've used these proceeds to reduce $1.1 billion of near-term debt so far this year. 
We also issued $1.4 billion of equity in the third quarter including $800 million for new senior and $600 million in ATM issuance at $58 a share. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, excluding New Senior, improved sequentially to 6.9x. While including New Senior, Q3 leverage was better than forecast at 7.2x. As an administrative side note, we plan to enter into a new ATM program, replacing our 2018 program, which is nearly complete. 
Turning to Q4 guidance. We expect fourth quarter net income will range from $0.01 to $0.05 per fully diluted share. Q4 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.67 to $0.71 per share. The Q4 FFO midpoint of $0.69 can be bridged from Q3 of $0.73 and by $0.01 net impact of tenant fees. The impact of capital recycling for debt reduction and prefunding of new investments is $0.02, and various items round up to explain the last penny. Our SHOP portfolio NOI is estimated to be flat sequentially. 
Key fourth quarter assumptions underlying our guidance are as follows: starting with our SHOP same-store expectations. SHOP Q4 average occupancy is forecast to increase between 80 and 120 basis points versus the Q3 average, growing ahead of pre-pandemic levels, while following seasonal trends. At the guidance midpoint, spot occupancy, September 30 to December 31 is expected to be approximately flat. The resulting sequential SHOP revenue growth is expected to be offset by increased operating expenses due to continued elevated labor costs. 
No HHS grants are assumed to be received in the fourth quarter. Though our licensed assisted living communities have applied for qualified grants under Phase 4 of the provider relief fund for COVID losses incurred at the communities. Outside of SHOP, continued stable performance is expected in the office and triple-net segments. We expect to receive an M&A fee in Q4 of $0.03 for the announced Kindred sale, which Kindred communicated is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, subject to customary closing conditions. 
We continue to expect $1 billion in asset sales and loan repayments for the full year 2021 at a blended yield in the high 5s. And our fully diluted share count is now 403 million shares, reflecting the equity raised to date. I'd like to underscore that we are still in a highly uncertain environment, and the pandemic's impact on our business remains very difficult to predict. To close, my colleagues and I are excited for the future of Ventas given the expected robust recovery in senior housing and the external growth opportunities, both under our belt and that lie ahead. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator."

The front of the train really is leads. Leads come first, that drives move-ins. Net move-in activity drives occupancy. Pricing certainly supports revenue growth as well, and then there's expense management.

Clearly, in the near term, there's expense pressure due to labor that we mentioned, but the macro backdrop does seem to be improving. And as I mentioned, our operators are taking significant actions to address the issue."

And those include children back in school, children vaccinated, the expiration of public policy such as the federal stipend on unemployment and also just people's savings running out as a result of that and schools being open and the like. 
And so all of those factors really play into the macro thinking around easing of current labor conditions. I think, again, if you just step back, what's great about this recovery is that demand has sprung back, not just in our business, but broadly speaking, it has surged. And the supply chain and the labor force are still adapting and adjusting and haven't caught up yet. And over time, those things will get more in balance. And that's kind of what the economists forecast, and that's why -- those are the factors that you would expect to improve the workforce participation.

I'd reinforce the fact -- in our guidance for the fourth, we saw this acceleration in contract labor in September. 
We effectively assume that to continue through the fourth quarter in light of the backdrop. Important to note that contract labor is at least 2x as expensive as in-house labor. And so these initiatives that Justin laid out to increase staffing, reduce that contract labor and would have a positive mix benefit. But quantitatively, that hopefully helps you."

So there's a huge opportunity to grow revenue. This is a consistent process. It's tried and true. It's just that we're going to pass along more rent increases this year. And I'll just add that our operators are very careful about -- and taking local market considerations into their planning so that they're in line with market and they can successfully execute. And then there's also a level of care, which is really acuity-driven and that can increase throughout the year as well, both in terms of how much we charge, but also the acuity level of the resident would drive additional charges, and that's just a standard as part of our -- the revenue package that operators offer."

And you'll notice on Page 13, on the right-hand side that we highlight this. We selected operators that have experience. They have experience within these markets, and they have experience running regional markets. And one thing I've been very encouraged about is that the CEOs of these companies have been actively engaged in the transitions. 
We have a cooperative transition with the former manager. So we've actually been able to get on the ground into the communities, start assessing, getting to know people and be ready to try to get off to a strong start when the transition begins. And you have the advantage when you have a midsized company with a regional presence is that you have senior management that is very close to the community. 
So we do expect the oversight to be very strong. And then these companies are excited to grow. And there's just an energy to it that's really positive and it's well assessed, and we look forward to positive results. Having said that, we would expect to have some transition noise in the early going. That was factored into the fourth quarter. And I'll hand over to Bob."

One thing -- there's kind of a series of steps that operators take. The first thing they do is they try to make sure that they're utilizing all the full-time hours available for their existing staff. Most operators don't schedule the 40-hour weeks, and so there's always room to expand a little bit, so they'll do that first. 
Next step is they'll use overtime. Obviously, you have your -- continuity of your existing staff to deliver care and services. And then the last resort is really to add agency. And one interesting tidbit around this is that there's not really a certain MSA where we're seeing agency use. It's clearly a macro backdrop issue. But within MSAs, there are certain communities that really have an outsized amount of agency that's being utilized, which points to the opportunity for an operational solution. So we have plenty of evidence that this can be managed. And as I said in prepared remarks, we're already starting to see hiring picking up across the operators."

And welcome to the Ventas Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm so happy to be hosting this call in person with my trusted colleagues for the first time since early 2020. V",906,"Thanks, Sarah, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm so happy to be hosting this call in person with my trusted colleagues for the first time since early 2020. Ventas delivered positive results in the third quarter, saw outstanding sequential SHOP average occupancy growth, benefited from its large medical office, life science and health care triple-net businesses, and executed on its investment priorities, delivering $0.73 of normalized FFO per share, which is in the upper half of our guidance range. 
Our same-store SHOP portfolio increased rate and grew occupancy at record levels in Q3 despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in a broader environment. Occupancy in this portfolio has now increased for 8 consecutive months through October. Demonstrating powerful demand, our U.S. same-store SHOP portfolio has increased occupancy 750 basis points since mid-March 2021, lifting the entire same-store SHOP portfolio nearly 600 basis points during the same period. 
I'm also encouraged that our year-over-year SHOP occupancy turned positive for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. So a robust senior housing recovery is well underway. But as we stated, it may not progress in a straight line. Consistent with macro trends, and as we anticipated in our last call with you, the pandemic has created a tight labor market, resulting in labor cost pressures that accelerated in September. 
Looking ahead, we expect to see meaningful revenue increases in the first quarter of 2022 and improving pricing power. At a macro level, many economists forecast that labor force participation will expand from its current low rate for a variety of reasons. These factors should cause current conditions to ease considerably over time. Even more importantly, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who has been consistently the most accurate expert throughout the pandemic stated today that the COVID-19 pandemic is effectively behind us in the U.S. given all the tools we now have to combat it, including Pfizer's new treatment. 
If Scott continues to be right, it is a momentous day for all of us. We continue to be delighted that 1/3 of our business consists of medical office, outpatient; and life science, research & innovation. Our operational initiatives in medical office and aggressive capital deployment in life science are providing reliable growth and value creation for our enterprise and stakeholders. [ Turning to capital allocation. We have been highly ] active with $3.7 billion of investments announced or closed year-to-date. 
[ Our current capital allocation focus remains ] senior living, selective private medical office building opportunities and life science R&I. Let me highlight a few new investments we've made. We've completed $2.5 billion in independent living investments including our accretive acquisition of New Seniors 100-plus independent living communities at an attractive valuation well below replacement cost and a 6 community Canadian senior living portfolio with one of the New Senior operators, Hawthorn. 
In medical office, we've completed or announced $300 million of investments. First, establishing a new relationship with industry leader Eating Recovery Center, we acquired a Class A asset under a long-term lease in this rapidly growing sector. Second, by acquiring our partner, PMB's interest in the Sutter Van Ness, trophy MOB in downtown San Francisco, we now own 100% of this asset at a 6% yield. With 92% of the MOB already leased, we intend to capture additional NOI growth and value. 
Finally, we intend to expand our relationship with Ardent Healthcare by acquiring 18 of their 100% leased medical office buildings for $200 million by year-end. On our third capital allocation priority, we are delighted to announce that we have commenced development of a 1 million square foot life science project anchored by premier research university, UC Davis, with our exclusive partner, Wexford. Purpose built for clinical research, this project will be 60% pre-leased to UC Davis, and total project costs are expected to be $0.5 billion. 
Turning to our robust investment pipeline. Our team remains busy evaluating attractive opportunities. In fact, we've now reviewed more deal volume this year than we saw in all of 2019, over $40 billion. And we continue to pursue those that meet our multifactor investment framework. Capital continues to flow into our sectors as global institutional investors agree with our thesis on the favorable trends benefiting all of our asset classes. These strong capital flows are also supporting our intention to recycle $1 billion of capital this year to enhance both our balance sheet and our portfolio. 
Our diversified business model continues to provide significant benefits. Our early and aggressive investments into medical office and life science are creating significant value. We are also proud to be associated with so many leading care providers, operators and developers in all our business lines and to be establishing new platforms for growth, through both our investment and our portfolio actions. In closing, the U.S. is in the midst of an impressive economic recovery that together with demographic demand for our asset classes, gives us confidence and optimism in our future. 
We believe that the more widespread administration of vaccines and new efficacious treatments for COVID-19, will benefit both the broader economic recovery and our company. Our aligned and experienced team continues to be focused on capturing the double upside in senior housing from both pandemic recovery and the projected growth in the senior population and also to continuing our long track record of external growth.

I'll start by saying it is very exciting to see the strong supply-demand fundamentals supporting occupancy growth in the senior housing sector. We have been busy taking actions through acquisitions, dispositions and transitions to ensure we are strongly positioned during this period of sector recovery. Our industry-leading operators are successfully driving revenue growth in the early stages of the recovery and taking actions to address elevated labor costs driven by the macro backdrop. 
Moving on to third quarter performance. In SHOP, leading indicators continue to trend favorably during the quarter as leads and move-ins each surpassed 100% of 2019 levels, while move-outs remain steady. Strong sales activity has now driven 8 consecutive months of occupancy growth inclusive of October. In the third quarter, average occupancy grew by 230 basis points over the second quarter, led by the U.S. with growth of 290 basis points and 110 basis points in Canada, which is over 93% occupied. October leading indicators remain solid as leads and move-ins continue to perform above pre-pandemic levels and move-outs remained relatively stable. 
Turning to SHOP operating results. Same-store revenue in the third quarter increased sequentially by $13.6 million or 3.1%, driven by strong occupancy growth and slight rate growth. Regarding rate growth, our operators have proposed rent increases to their residents of 8% in the U.S. and 4% in Canada, which on a blended basis is approximately 200 basis points higher than the historical levels. We also continue to see improvement in our re-leasing spreads, which are trending close to pre-pandemic levels. 
Operating expenses increased sequentially by $16.7 million or 5.4%, of which, approximately half is due to overtime and agency costs. Although we largely anticipated the additional labor costs, September spiked and represented approximately half of the sequential agency expense increase. We carried the elevated September cost forward in our Q4 guidance, which Bob will cover shortly. Despite the higher agency and overtime costs, our operators are now witnessing net positive hiring and are actively addressing labor challenges through a number of initiatives. 
These include centralized recruitment of line staff, implementation of applicant tracking systems, delivering on the increased demand by employees for flexible schedules and other workplace improvements to become more competitive. For the sequential same-store pool, SHOP generated $106.7 million of NOI in the third quarter, which represents a sequential decrease of $3.7 million or 3.4%. Moving on to portfolio actions. Our New Senior acquisition closed on September 21. 
The portfolio consists of 103 independent living communities located in attractive markets with favorable demand characteristics. Integration efforts have gone extremely smoothly, and we are on track to realize our expected synergies. We are pleased with the performance and operating trends of the portfolio. Its third quarter spot occupancy grew 110 basis points sequentially. The same-store pool, which excludes the 33 communities that transitioned to new operators this year, grew 180 basis points in the third quarter and then another 10 basis points in October, marking occupancy growth in 6 out of the past 7 months. 
We have also recently closed on an acquisition in Canada, which includes 5 independent living and 1 assisted living communities. These acquisitions expand our independent living exposure to 59% of NOI on a stabilized basis. We believe the structural benefits of the independent living model present attractive opportunities to further strengthen our senior housing NOI margin through less intensive staffing requirements, longer resident length of stays and accessible price points, all underpinned by exposure to a large and growing middle market. 
This in combination with our existing portfolio positions us well to capture demographic demand with the 80-plus population expected to grow over 17% over the next 5 years while facing less new supply versus historical levels. I'd also like to note our previously announced transition of 90 assisted living and memory care communities is off to a solid start as 65 communities have already transitioned and the rest are planned by year-end. 
We believe the enhanced oversight provided by the experienced mid-market, midsized assisted living operators will improve the execution of local market strategy and with increased accountability. I have long-standing relationships and familiarity with the incoming CEOs. And I can say they are really fired up about their new portfolios. They are actively engaged with personal site visits to the communities and transition planning. Ventas has 37 operator relationships, including 7 of the top 10 largest operators in the sector and 8 new relationships added this year. 
We look forward to the opportunity to grow our relationships with these companies over time. In summary, the senior housing sector is benefiting from a strong macro supply/demand backdrop. We are actively positioning ourselves for success through portfolio actions, and our operators are driving revenue and managing the elevated labor situation. We look forward to forging ahead during a very exciting time of sector recovery. Bob?"

I'll close out our prepared remarks by quickly touching on our third quarter Office and enterprise results, discussing our recent balance sheet and capital activities and laying out our fourth quarter expectations. Our life science and MOB",800,"Thanks, Justin. I'll close out our prepared remarks by quickly touching on our third quarter Office and enterprise results, discussing our recent balance sheet and capital activities and laying out our fourth quarter expectations. Our life science and MOB businesses, led by Pete Bulgarelli and which represent nearly 1/3 of our company's NOI, once again delivered robust and reliable growth in the third quarter. These businesses, taken together, increased same-store NOI by 4.2% year-over-year and increased 1.2% sequentially on an adjusted basis. 
MOB NOI grew 3.2% year-over-year and R&I increased 7.1%. [ Some stats ] of interest that underpin this strong performance. MOB occupancy is up 130 basis points year-to-date; same-store MOB occupancy of 91.3%, is at its highest point since the first quarter of 2018. MOB tenant retention was 91% in the third quarter, and MOB new leasing increased 43% versus prior year. R&I occupancy remains outstanding at 94.4% and improved 50 basis points sequentially due to exciting demand for lab space. 
MOB expenses increased less than 1% year-on-year as a result of completed energy conservation projects [ and ] sourcing initiatives. And for the second year in a row, we rank in the top quartile of our peer group for tenant satisfaction as measured by Kingsley Associates. 2021 rankings for each major key performance indicator increased when compared to 2020. At the enterprise level, we delivered $0.73 of FFO per share in the third quarter. This result is at the higher end of our $0.70 to $0.74 guidance range and benefited from the stable performance of our diversified portfolio as well as a $0.04 Ardent bond prepayment fee that was included in our guidance. 
We were also very active in the third quarter, managing our balance sheet and capital structure. Consistent with our prior $1 billion disposition guidance, we now have $875 million of disposition proceeds in the bank with $170 million of senior housing and MOB portfolios under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter. These dispositions have enhanced and reshaped our portfolio, and we've used these proceeds to reduce $1.1 billion of near-term debt so far this year. 
We also issued $1.4 billion of equity in the third quarter including $800 million for New Senior and $600 million in ATM issuance at $58 a share. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, excluding New Senior, improved sequentially to 6.9x. While including New Senior, Q3 leverage was better than forecast at 7.2x. As an administrative side note, we plan to enter into a new ATM program, replacing our 2018 program, which is nearly complete. 
Turning to Q4 guidance. We expect fourth quarter net income will range from $0.01 to $0.05 per fully diluted share. Q4 normalized FFO is expected to range from $0.67 to $0.71 per share. The Q4 FFO midpoint of $0.69 can be bridged from Q3 of $0.73 by $0.01 net impact of tenant fees. The impact of capital recycling for debt reduction and prefunding of new investments is $0.02, and various items round up to explain the last penny. Our SHOP portfolio NOI is estimated to be flat sequentially. 
Key fourth quarter assumptions underlying our guidance are as follows: starting with our SHOP same-store expectations. SHOP Q4 average occupancy is forecast to increase between 80 and 120 basis points versus the Q3 average, growing ahead of pre-pandemic levels, while following seasonal trends. At the guidance midpoint, spot occupancy, September 30 to December 31 is expected to be approximately flat. The resulting sequential SHOP revenue growth is expected to be offset by increased operating expenses due to continued elevated labor costs. 
No HHS grants are assumed to be received in the fourth quarter. Though our licensed assisted living communities have applied for qualified grants under Phase 4 of the provider relief fund for COVID losses incurred at the communities. Outside of SHOP, continued stable performance is expected in the Office and triple-net segments. We expect to receive an M&A fee in Q4 of $0.03 for the announced Kindred sale, which Kindred communicated is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, subject to customary closing conditions. 
We continue to expect $1 billion in asset sales and loan repayments for the full year 2021 at a blended yield in the high 5s. And our fully diluted share count is now 403 million shares, reflecting the equity raised to date. I'd like to underscore that we are still in a highly uncertain environment, and the pandemic's impact on our business remains very difficult to predict. To close, my colleagues and I are excited for the future of Ventas given the expected robust recovery in senior housing and the external growth opportunities, both under our belt and that lie ahead. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator."

The front of the train really is leads. Leads come first, that drives move-ins. Net move-in activity drives occupancy. Pricing certainly supports revenue growth as well, and then there's expense management. And over time, we certainly expect that there will be margin expansion for 2 reasons: one is that the supply-demand characteristics that we're facing do support occupancy growth and should present opportunity for pricing power. 
Clearly, in the near term, there's expense pressure due to labor that we mentioned, but the macro backdrop does seem to be improving. And as I mentioned, our operators are taking significant actions to address the issue."

And those include children back in school, children vaccinated, the expiration of public policy such as the federal stipend on unemployment and also just people's savings running out as a result of that and schools being open and the like. 
And so all of those factors really play into the macro thinking around easing of current labor conditions. I think, again, if you just step back, what's great about this recovery is that demand has sprung back, not just in our business, but broadly speaking, it has surged. And the supply chain and the labor force are still adapting and adjusting and haven't caught up yet. And over time, those things will get more in balance.

We effectively assume that to continue through the fourth quarter in light of the backdrop. Important to note that contract labor is at least 2x as expensive as in-house labor. And so these initiatives that Justin laid out to increase staffing, reduce that contract labor and would have a positive mix benefit. But quantitatively, that hopefully helps you."

So there's a huge opportunity to grow revenue. This is a consistent process. It's tried and true. It's just that we're going to pass along more rent increases this year. And I'll just add that our operators are very careful about -- and taking local market considerations into their planning so that they're in line with market and they can successfully execute.

But just curious on a couple of fronts on the data analytics front, what you guys are doing? And maybe some hires you've made there and the efforts that are being put forth? And then secondly, just as we look forward, should we expect more dispositions heading into '22, given some of the stuff that was on the market didn't transact? And you haven't necessarily sold a ton of assets and the leverage is still a little bit high. So just curious on go-forward dispositions kind of thinking about '22 and any cleanup that you guys want to do for the portfolio kind of as we exit COVID?"

One thing -- there's kind of a series of steps that operators take. The first thing they do is they try to make sure that they're utilizing all the full-time hours available for their existing staff. Most operators don't schedule the 40-hour weeks, and so there's always room to expand a little bit, so they'll do that first. 
Next step is they'll use overtime. Obviously, you have your  continuity of your existing staff to deliver care and services. And then the last resort is really to add agency. And one interesting tidbit around this is that there's not really a certain MSA where we're seeing agency use. It's clearly a macro backdrop issue. But within MSAs, there are certain communities that really have an outsized amount of agency that's being utilized, which points to the opportunity for an operational solution. So we have plenty of evidence that this can be managed. And as I said in prepared remarks, we're already starting to see hiring picking up across the operators."

One is mix, which is really just the REVPOR -- the contribution of REVPOR from certain product types. And we are benefiting this year. I've mentioned this before that we would benefit from the U.S. recovery because we'll see our higher price point product, particularly in Sunrise, for instance, that's a driver of REVPOR overall. So we're getting some mix shift benefit. 
Probably more importantly, though, is we're getting the benefit of better re-leasing spreads. And that's been consistent. We saw the underlying trends in the second quarter. We saw it through the third quarter. And when we get into next year, obviously, we have the in-house rent increases that we mentioned, but the pricing power should continue to improve because what starts to happen is you're covering movements that occurred in 2020, that came in at a relatively low rate. And as the momentum picks up in the sector, our operators are able to charge more. And so we're looking forward to a period of really improved pricing and REVPOR moving ahead."
