I'll start today by discussing Amgen's performance in 2020, and then provide some perspective on our priorities for 2021. By any measure, 2020 was a very successful year for us. Despit",791,"Great. Thank you, Arvind, and thank all of you for joining our call. I'll start today by discussing Amgen's performance in 2020, and then provide some perspective on our priorities for 2021. 
By any measure, 2020 was a very successful year for us. Despite the disruption of COVID-19, we delivered strong sales and earnings, driven by volume growth of 15% for our products. We advanced our innovative pipeline, most notably sotorasib and tezepelumab, both of which have received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. 
We successfully integrated Otezla, strengthening our decades-long leadership in inflammation with a $2 billion-plus product that we believe has runway for further global growth. We grew our sales outside the U.S. to more than $6 billion, delivering on long-term goals by expanding our presence in China and Japan with successful transactions in both markets. We did all this while staying focused on the health and safety of our 24,000 employees around the world. And to all of them, I want to say thank you for a job well done. 
As we look to 2021, we're embracing 3 realities. First, COVID-19 is leading to some lasting changes in how we do business. For example, we expect to continue leveraging digital capabilities, call on customers and run clinical trials around the world with improved speed, efficiency and effectiveness. 
Second, we expect ongoing pressure on drug prices across the industry. We are fortunate to have products like Repatha, Prolia and Aimovig that meet the needs of millions of patients and can grow through increased penetration of the appropriate patient populations. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is also well positioned for the future. 
Third is capital continues to flow into our sector. We've entered a time of intense competition, where speed of execution is paramount. We've built a track record, featuring quality and speed. We've shown that with innovative first-in-class medicines like Repatha, the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor; and Aimovig, the first approved CGRP inhibitor. We showed it also with biosimilars like MVASI and KANJINTI, the first approved biosimilars to Avastin and Herceptin here in the U.S. And we're doing it right now with sotorasib, the first KRAS G12C inhibitor to be filed for approval just 28 months after we dosed our first patient. And we expect to do it again later in the year with tezepelumab as the first TSLP inhibitor. 
We're excited about our pipeline and plan on increasing our R&D investment in 2021. Dave will speak in a moment about some of our promising mid-stage pipeline candidates. But since this is the time of year when I like to address our long-term investments, I want to focus for a moment on a couple of areas central to our early research strategy. These are areas where we are building differentiated capabilities. 
First, in human genetics, where we have industry leading capabilities, we are adding to our database approximately 1 million subjects from the U.S. and the U.K. for whom we will have extensive phenotypic and genotypic information. This will augment the data we already have on in excess of 1.5 million individuals. 
In addition, we're pioneering the use of large-scale proteomics to measure the relative levels of some 5,000 different proteins in the blood. We're excited about the insights we're generating from this genomic proteomic work and expect to benefit in the selection of new drug targets and clinical trial design. 
As growing interest in our industry in the area of targeted protein degradation, we believe the opportunity is broader than that, and our efforts are not just limited to degrading proteins. We're looking at degrading other biologic molecules as well. We're designing molecules to have multi-specific activity through a principle we call induced proximity. The idea is to use this platform to dramatically expand the universe of drugable targets. It's still early days in the field, but I wanted to flag it as an area where we want to emerge through time as an industry leader. 
All of our work is taking place at a time when more is expected of companies than ever before. Amgen is advancing an ambitious ESG agenda that includes providing medicines at no cost to low-income patients and funding world-class STEM education programs. 
With respect to the environment, we're committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2027, along with a 40% reduction in water use and a 75% reduction in waste. 
In summary, our success in 2020 gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver in 2021 and beyond. The world needs more innovation, not less, and we've proven ourselves ready, willing and able to provide it. 
I look forward to your questions a little later on in the call. Right now, let me turn over to Dave Reese, our Head of R&D."
24816,702219050,2188842,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.

I'll begin today with sotorasib, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. To date, more than 700 patients have been treated across 5 continents, and we are accelerating this groundbreaking program into new indications and earlier lines of therapy. 
A few days ago, we presented the first pivotal data for a KRAS G12C inhibitor at the World Conference on Lung Cancer, where we reported on 126 patients with second-line plus non-small cell lung cancer. Sotorasib drove rapid, deep and durable responses across a broad range of mutational profiles and subgroups with poor prognoses. And a centrally adjudicated intent-to-treat analysis, the objective response rate was 37%, including 3 complete remissions, progression-free survival was 6.8 months and duration of response was 10 months. Importantly, sotorasib demonstrated a very tolerable and differentiated clinical profile. And based on these data, we completed regulatory submissions in the United States and EU in December. 
More recently, we submitted files in Canada, the U.K., Brazil and Australia with additional global submissions anticipated in the coming weeks and months and launch preparations are well advanced. The Phase III non-small cell lung cancer monotherapy study versus docetaxel continues to advance nicely, as do our 10 combination cohorts and Phase II colorectal study, with data expected from these latter 2 beginning in the first half of this year. 
We will initiate a Phase II study in first line non-small cell lung cancer in the second quarter, where we will investigate sotorasib monotherapy in patients most likely to benefit based on tumor profiling. For example, those tumors harboring STK11 mutations. 
Finally, we recently cleared the safety hurdle at the full sotarasib dose in our MEK inhibitor combination study and have completed enrollment in an expansion cohort. 
In inflammation, along with our partner, AstraZeneca, we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase III NAVIGATOR study at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Virtual Annual Meeting. Also known as Quad AI, at the end of February. You may have seen the abstract posting yesterday, which results from the primary and key secondary endpoints data that, in our view, provide a compelling rationale for the potential utility of tezepelumab in a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, including those with low eosinophil counts or we have breakthrough therapy designation in the United States. 
We are working closely with AstraZeneca on our U.S. and EU filing packages, which we expect to submit in the first half. 
Turning to our BiTE platform. We are particularly excited about the rapid progress we are making with 2 solid tumor programs, AMG 160, targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, for castrate-resistant prostate cancer; and AMG 757, targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. AMG 160 is currently in dose expansion, and we expect to advance AMG 757 into dose expansion in the coming months. We are quite pleased with the clinical profiles we are seeing with both of these molecules. And as you will see in our press release, we also continue to actively prioritize our oncology portfolio. 
In migraine, Aimovig continues to demonstrate important benefits for patients as our colleagues at Novartis announced positive Phase IV results showing superior efficacy and safety of Aimovig over topiramate in the migraine prevention setting. 
Finally, our biosimilars portfolio continues to advance, and we have completed enrollment in our Phase III study of AVP 959, our biosimilar Soliris. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our staff for their ongoing efforts to deliver our portfolio for patients. Murdo?"
24816,702219050,2188842,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave. 2020 product sales grew 9% year-over-year, driven by 15% volume growth, with roughly equal growth rates in the U.S. and internationally.

Starting with our innovative portfolio, Prolia grew year-over-year despite significant impacts from the pandemic. And Evenity sales increased 85% year-over-year, driven by strong volume growth. Repatha is now annualizing at over $1 billion in revenues with 67% year-over-year volume growth. 
In the first full year since acquisition, we've seamlessly integrated Otezla growing total prescriptions by 13% year-over-year. And finally, our biosimilars portfolio totaled $1.7 billion in sales. 
Moving to fourth quarter performance. Product sales grew 8% year-over-year, driven by 13% volume growth. In our bone franchise, we remain focused on ensuring patient continuity. By year-end, osteoporosis diagnoses reached approximately 80% of pre-COVID levels, leading to a positive trend in new patient starts entering 2021. 
In Q4, Prolia's repeat patient numbers were lower than historical trends as a result of the echo effect of cover disruption in Q2. Evenity sales grew quarter-over-quarter. We believe EvenIty's unique bone building profile will continue to drive growth in our franchise as physicians appreciate its benefit risk profile for treating their high-risk post fracture patients. 
In cardiovascular, Repatha remains the global PCSK9 leader. Net sales in Q4 were $253 million, driven by sequential volume growth and stable U.S. net price. As we enter 2021, we expect continued momentum for this brand globally, driven by growth from international markets, improved U.S. PBM formulary position and relatively stable net price in the U.S. 
Moving on to Aimovig, which is the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class, volumes grew 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but remained flat quarter-over-quarter as the pandemic negatively impacted new patient starts. 
Next to Parsabiv. Q4 sales declined 8% quarter-over-quarter in the U.S. as some customers decreased utilization, while others built inventory in advance of the January reimbursement change. With Parsabiv inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundle, we expect sales to decline by approximately 40% to 50% in 2021 as U.S. dialysis centers update their treatment protocols to accommodate generic forms of cinacalcet. 
We also expect sales in Q1 to be the lowest of the year as customers deplete $40 million of inventory build in the second half of 2020. For patients on hemodialysis, Parsabiv is the only IV-administered calcimimetic that lowers and maintains key secondary hyperthyroidism lab values. Also, Parsabiv offers providers control over calcimimetic delivery and the opportunity to reduce patient pill burden. 
Transitioning to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales were $617 million in Q4, driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in total U.S. prescriptions. We see attractive future growth opportunities through global launches, and our planned submission for the mild to moderate psoriasis indication in the U.S. in the coming weeks. 
With Enbrel, fourth quarter sales declined 5% year-over-year. Volumes declined from gradual share loss, coupled with slower growth in the rheumatology segment, which we attribute in part to the pandemic. 
For 2020, net price declined in the low single digits, and we expect volume and net price trends to persist in 2021. 
Enbrel has an established record of safety and efficacy, and we will continue to invest in innovative solutions to enhance the patient experience. 
Switching to biosimilars. Q4 sales were $541 million, driven by volume growth which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We are leading in biosimilar share in Europe for Amgevita and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, with a respective 48% and 41% average share in Q4. 
We recently launched our fifth biosimilar, RIABNI, a biosimilar to Rituxan. For 2021, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be partially offset by a decline in net selling prices due to increased competition. 
In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF with 54% share of volume in the quarter. Onpro continues to demonstrate the value of innovation allowing patients to receive their GCSF treatment without having to return to their doctor's office or other site of care for administration. 
Overall, Neulasta sales decreased 19% year-over-year, driven by declines in volume and net selling price. And the most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 28% year-over-year. Going forward, we expect the price and volume trends to persist as biosimilar competition increases. 
Looking ahead, we're excited about new opportunities across our business. Internationally, we recently received national reimbursement drug listing for Prolia, which will accelerate growth in China. In Japan, we're preparing for the launch of Aimovig, and we're planning for the launch of our biosimilar brands across multiple markets in 2021. 
Finally, our team is ready to launch so Tarasi upon approval, and we're excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. And we're also preparing for the launch of tezepelumab with our partner, AstraZeneca, and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q4 and full year performance and look forward to Amgen serving more patients in 2021. 
And I'll turn it over to Peter."
24816,702219050,2188842,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. We are pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. In Q4, we delivered 7% revenue and 5% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. For the full",1087,"Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. We are pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. In Q4, we delivered 7% revenue and 5% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. For the full year, we delivered 9% revenue and 12% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. 
As Murdo mentioned, both Q4 and the full year benefited from volume-driven sales growth of 13% and 15%, respectively. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as spend accelerated to advance our innovative pipeline, drive volume growth for much of our portfolio around the globe and prepare for future launches, particularly for soda acid and tezepelumab. 
Operating expense grew 7% for the full year, including a full year of Otezla-related activities and expenses. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year was $2.0 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively. 
Now turning to the outlook for business for 2021 on Page 37. We look forward to investing in innovation in 2021 and in launching new products. We will also continue to execute on our volume-driven growth strategy. 
Due to COVID, we also anticipate some uncertainty and quarter-to-quarter variability in revenue and earnings throughout 2021. And with potential recovery later in the year, contingent upon the speed and effectiveness of global vaccination. 
Our 2021 revenue guidance is $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion, and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $16 to $17 per share. GAAP earnings per share guidance is $12.12 per share to $13.17 per share. 
Now let me mention several key assumptions embedded in our guidance. First, our revenue range reflects volume growth from Prolia, Otezla Repatha, Evenity, Aimovig and our biosimilars portfolio and importantly, our innovative oncology portfolio. 
At 'the same time, we expect continued competition against our filgrastim and ESA franchises. As well as accelerating erosion in U.S. Parsabiv sales, as Murdo highlighted, we experienced a 6% decline in net selling prices globally in 2020. 
For 2021, we again expect mid- single-digit price declines. A couple of points to recall when considering Q1 of 2021. Historically, the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter of the year, with planned changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, especially for products, including Enbrel, Otezla and Aimovig. 
Additionally, I want to remind everyone that in Q1 2020, Embrel benefited from approximately $115 of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and the entire portfolio saw roughly $100 million in inventory bill due to COVID. 
So as a proportion of our full year sales, we expect Q1 2021 to be a slightly lower percentage than the 24% it was in Q1 2020. We expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year 2021. This includes revenues from COVID-19 antibody manufacturing and profit share agreement with Lilly, under which we expect to begin shipping in the second quarter. 
We expect 2021 total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at a rate similar to the 7% 2020 non-GAAP operating expense growth, as we continue to invest in innovation, launches of new products and digitization efforts. We have created an industry-leading cost structure, and expect an operating margin of roughly 50% in 2021. 
Cost of sales as a percent of product sales will increase to a range of 16% to 17% due to an evolving product mix, and higher royalties and profit share payments. Additionally, cost of sales will increase in connection with our manufacturing agreement with Lilly. As I mentioned previously, the revenues and profit share will be included in other revenue. 
Research and development expenses will increase as our pipeline advances with year-over-year increases in early and late-stage investments. And SG&A will decline primarily due to changes in our commercial model including an increased focus on digital efforts. 
Now let me take a moment to explain an update we are making to our non-GAAP policy. Effective January 2021, our non-GAAP results will no longer include fair value adjustments to equity investments. These adjustments to equity investments have historically been recorded in other income and expenses and we're positive in our 2020 non-GAAP results. This change will not apply to our strategic investment in BeiGene, which is included in our non-GAAP results and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The press release contains the pro forma 2020 results by quarter under our updated policy. 
We will also now use updated adjusted 2020 amounts that conform to this policy for comparison purposes going forward. Under our updated non-GAAP policy that I just explained, here is our guidance for other income and expense. 
We anticipate non-GAAP other income expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of expense. This 2021 guidance reflects incorporation of 4 quarters of BeiGene's results versus 3 quarters in 2020, which are recorded on a 1 quarter leg. Recall that we only use the limited publicly available consensus estimates for BeiGene in connection with our guidance, and thus may experience additional variability depending on BeiGene's actual results. 
Our basis in BeiGene as of December 31, 2020, was approximately $2.9 billion, and this long-term investment is valued at approximately $6 billion today based upon the current U.S. market price. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is 13% to 14%, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $900 million this year. Including investments in additional manufacturing and other capacity to support our volume-driven growth strategy as well as an environmental sustainability initiatives that will enable our global operations to achieve carbon neutrality by 2027 and also in our digitization efforts to continue to scale up and integrate data and analytics in everything we do at Amgen. 
And finally, our capital allocation hierarchy remains unchanged. And after both internal and external innovation and then investing in our capital expenditures, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of growing dividends. Including the 10% increase in the first quarter of 2021 to $1.76 per share. We anticipate opportunistic share repurchases in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, subject to our Board's authorization. 
So in summary, we delivered for patients every patient every time. And for our investors in a challenging year that included the greatest public health crisis in 100 years, and the greatest economic disruption since the great depression. And we are confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2021 and beyond. 
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call back over to Bob."

Yes. Thanks for the questions. In regards to the combinations, the ones you mentioned are all actively in dose escalation, looking at either different doses or in some cases, even scheduling, depending on the agents. This is standard Phase Ib oncology drug development. 
I feel good about how quickly we're moving. And we'll provide guidance as we expect those data to emerge. With tezepelumab, as you mentioned, the abstract is out now.

Obviously, we're quite excited about solar asset. But I want to complement Dave and his team how fast they've moved in developing this product and also just the number of regulatory submissions, they've been able to affect in a very compressed time frame. So we are optimistic and hopeful that we'll get a fairly quick review in multiple markets around the world. And so we would expect sort of asset to contribute to revenue. We don't give product-specific guidance, but this is a very large population of high unmet medical need. There's not a lot of choice for these advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. So we do anticipate that there'll be a  potential market with a high need there. 
The one caution that I'll put out is just the actual percentage of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients that have a KRAS G12C status result in their file and their medical record. Right now, we ascertain that to be at about 50%. So we've got work to do to grow that number. And obviously, we've seen with other targeted therapies. When you have an actionable mutation, the testing rate rises fairly rapidly. So we would expect upon approval to be able to do that. 
But nonetheless, we think sotorasib will be a meaningful contribution to at least revenue in the U.S. and then Tesi, we'll see what the regulatory authorities do with the filing, obviously, given that we had breakthrough designation. And obviously, given the pan-eosinophilic results that we've seen, and now you guys can see the breakdown in that in the abstract. We think this is an important medicine to get to market very quickly. 
The last question you asked about COVID, in fact, Geoff, was just -- I think we actually anticipate COVID will have a fairly significant impact on the market. Through the better part of the year, beyond the midpoint of the year. I hope we're wrong, and I hope that vaccination programs will improve.

The other thing that's worth mentioning is we'll be taking a leading role in establishing access for tezepelumab with payers. And again, our extensive biologics contracting experience in Part D and the government programs will help us secure broad access for tezepelumab for a broad range of patients. As you saw, we have a nice product profile here that will benefit a lot of patients regardless of their eosinophilic status. 
And then Dave Reese's team is obviously building out medical capabilities for the same customer-facing group. So we're excited about it. It's a focused effort. The beauty of focusing on allergis is they're very productive prescribers, but they're a relatively small audience size. So we'll be quite focused on addressing that. 
When it comes to kind of how we're looking at our oncology portfolio, we've got a very strong base right now in oncology between our hematology business, our solid tumor therapeutics that we have now our overall biosimilar portfolio and our supportive care, basically 1 in 5 oncology patients today receives an Amgen therapy. And so bringing sotorasib into that mix and then the potential of AMG 160 and 757 and 701, I think, is a fairly action-packed next few years in oncology that we can build on the current strength that we have, and we're excited about that.

So one thing that we're seeing in Embassy is actually the number of cycles of bevacizumab overall is growing. And so even holding share in that molecule actually holds up quite well. We also have less competition. That's the other factor.

The first part of the question I understood was how are we sourcing our Evenity growth? Is it from existing anabolic patients? Or are we expanding and treating new patients? I didn't catch the second part of the question, but let me address the first part. 
Overall, we're pleased with how Evenity has evolved. We've got nice evolution in our Japan business. In Japan, it's obviously -- we've been in the market a little bit longer. So one thing that we're seeing with Evenity is patients are on the product for a 12-month duration of treatment. And so you have to replenish those new patients. You do have to source those new patients. And so I think the team in Japan is quite experienced now at sourcing new patients and not necessarily where we got our early growth was from which was switching from other anabolics. 
And there are -- unfortunately, there are a lot of aging patients in these markets where osteoporosis goes unchecked and patients suffer factors and these high-risk patients need a solid bone builder like of entity to be able to improve their clinical outcomes. 
So I think in Japan, we're sourcing now more de novo growth than we were perhaps 6 to 12 months ago. Whereas in the U.S., it's much more of a mix of de novo and switch, the other thing that's helping us in the U.S. is, of course, having both Prolia and Evenity for the customer. A lot of the time when a patient will come in and have a fracture despite their prolia treatment, they're a really good candidate for Evenity. So we're often getting patients on both treatments. 
And sometimes after the 12 months of Evenity treatment are up, they'll roll back on to Prolia. So it's a nice franchise to have and have both an anti-resort of than a bone-building agent for our customers. So I think the future growth looks very good. Obviously, our partners at UCB are just getting going in Europe as they establish reimbursement for the product. But I'm quite excited about what if entity could become for these bone-building for these very high-risk post fracture patients."

There were a couple of factors that went into our recent reorganization of our field force. One is just portfolio evolution and creating capacity for the new product launches and then reallocating from the older side of the portfolio. And depending on which region you're talking about in the world with Amgen, we're in very different stages of development. So for example, we're placing large investments in field force in Japan and in China, even in Russia and some other markets that are emerging for us as being important growth drivers. And in the U.S. We're really paying close attention to the forces in the market beyond COVID. We're looking at potential negative net price effects and/or price reform, as Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, as being a bit of a prevailing wind here. And so what we're doing is looking at our overall commercial model. 
And to your point, making it more productive and making it more efficient. So we're  largely on track with that plan. We were able to move very rapidly last year and build out our digital capabilities to an even greater extent than we had historically. We are seeing customers willing to engage in those channels. And we think some of those engagements will be persistent beyond COVID, quite frankly, and it's that persistency that we're betting on. What we haven't done is compromised the ability to have competitive share of voice in our field facing interactions, both on the medical side, both on the commercial side, in front of the customer. And so we think we'll continue to be able to compete effectively in the categories we're in, as well as augment that with highly efficient digital channels of communication."

We do see some of the international expansion maturing now. We've got a good business for Otezla in Japan. We're pursuing registration in China, and we recently secured reimbursement in Australia, so we're evolving the global footprint of Otezla beyond where the legacy Celgene efforts had it. So that one source of growth. But as Bob mentioned, we're also pursuing in the U.S. mild to moderate approval on the basis of the positive data set we have there. And that will allow us to move Otezla into a patient population that really is still an unmet need. These are patients who have enough skin surface area that they might be seeking an alternative to messy and inconvenient topical agents. And I think Otezla can play a very important role there in helping treat those patients. We're also in making investments in Otezla by expanding the promotional footprint of the product to include primary care promotion, something that Celgene had not done historically. So we're doing that both for the moderate to severe patient, but as well for that mild to moderate indication in anticipation of that potential approval. 
And the only other thing I would say is while we are seeing a little bit of softness in psoriasis and broader rheumatology, for the category due to COVID, Otezla being an oral has held up quite well, and the execution has been strong. 
I also think that the established safety and efficacy profile of Otezla is highly appreciated, given recent news in the broader rheumatology category of other orals where perhaps that risk-benefit equation is different than it is where it's very strong with Otezla. So we think we've got a good opportunity for growth. We also said when we gave that guidance, it assumed a successful competitive program from the TYK2 asset. And of course, that was confirmed today."

And then one thing that we're looking at quite carefully is the epidemiology of G12C mutations. There is a suggestion that it may be a little lower in prevalence in Asian populations. Probably because they are mutually exclusive with mutations in EGFR, which are quite high in these populations, up to 40% in China and Japan, for example.

I'll start today by discussing Amgen's performance in 2020, and then provide some perspective on our priorities for 2021. By any measure, 2020 was a very successful year for us. Despit",791,"Great. Thank you, Arvind, and thank all of you for joining our call. I'll start today by discussing Amgen's performance in 2020, and then provide some perspective on our priorities for 2021. 
By any measure, 2020 was a very successful year for us. Despite the disruption of COVID-19, we delivered strong sales and earnings, driven by volume growth of 15% for our products. We advanced our innovative pipeline, most notably sotorasib and tezepelumab, both of which have received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. 
We successfully integrated Otezla, strengthening our decades-long leadership in inflammation with a $2 billion-plus product that we believe has runway for further global growth. We grew our sales outside the U.S. to more than $6 billion, delivering on long-term goals by expanding our presence in China and Japan with successful transactions in both markets. We did all this while staying focused on the health and safety of our 24,000 employees around the world. And to all of them, I want to say thank you for a job well done. 
As we look to 2021, we're embracing 3 realities. First, COVID-19 is leading to some lasting changes in how we do business. For example, we expect to continue leveraging digital capabilities, call on customers and run clinical trials around the world with improved speed, efficiency and effectiveness. 
Second, we expect ongoing pressure on drug prices across the industry. We are fortunate to have products like Repatha, Prolia and Aimovig that meet the needs of millions of patients and can grow through increased penetration of the appropriate patient populations. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is also well positioned for the future. 
Third is capital continues to flow into our sector. We've entered a time of intense competition, where speed of execution is paramount. We've built a track record, featuring quality and speed. We've shown that with innovative first-in-class medicines like Repatha, the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor; and Aimovig, the first approved CGRP inhibitor. We showed it also with biosimilars like MVASI and KANJINTI, the first approved biosimilars to Avastin and Herceptin here in the U.S. And we're doing it right now with sotorasib, the first KRAS G12C inhibitor to be filed for approval just 28 months after we dosed our first patient. And we expect to do it again later in the year with tezepelumab as the first TSLP inhibitor. 
We're excited about our pipeline and plan on increasing our R&D investment in 2021. Dave will speak in a moment about some of our promising mid-stage pipeline candidates. But since this is the time of year when I like to address our long-term investments, I want to focus for a moment on a couple of areas central to our early research strategy. These are areas where we are building differentiated capabilities. 
First, in human genetics, where we have industry leading capabilities, we are adding to our database approximately 1 million subjects from the U.S. and the U.K. for whom we will have extensive phenotypic and genotypic information. This will augment the data we already have on in excess of 1.5 million individuals. 
In addition, we're pioneering the use of large-scale proteomics to measure the relative levels of some 5,000 different proteins in the blood. We're excited about the insights we're generating from this genomic proteomic work and expect to benefit in the selection of new drug targets and clinical trial design. 
As growing interest in our industry in the area of targeted protein degradation, we believe the opportunity is broader than that, and our efforts are not just limited to degrading proteins. We're looking at degrading other biologic molecules as well. We're designing molecules to have multi-specific activity through a principle we call induced proximity. The idea is to use this platform to dramatically expand the universe of drugable targets. It's still early days in the field, but I wanted to flag it as an area where we want to emerge through time as an industry leader. 
All of our work is taking place at a time when more is expected of companies than ever before. Amgen is advancing an ambitious ESG agenda that includes providing medicines at no cost to low-income patients and funding world-class STEM education programs. 
With respect to the environment, we're committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2027, along with a 40% reduction in water use and a 75% reduction in waste. 
In summary, our success in 2020 gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver in 2021 and beyond. The world needs more innovation, not less, and we've proven ourselves ready, willing and able to provide it. 
I look forward to your questions a little later on in the call. Right now, let me turn over to Dave Reese, our Head of R&D."
24816,702219050,2188849,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.

I'll begin today with sotorasib, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. To date, more than 700 patients have been treated across 5 continents, and we are accelerating this groundbreaking program into new indications and earlier lines of therapy. 
A few days ago, we presented the first pivotal data for a KRAS G12C inhibitor at the World Conference on Lung Cancer, where we reported on 126 patients with second-line plus non-small cell lung cancer. Sotorasib drove rapid, deep and durable responses across a broad range of mutational profiles and subgroups with poor prognoses. And a centrally adjudicated intent-to-treat analysis, the objective response rate was 37%, including 3 complete remissions, progression-free survival was 6.8 months and duration of response was 10 months. Importantly, sotorasib demonstrated a very tolerable and differentiated clinical profile. And based on these data, we completed regulatory submissions in the United States and EU in December. 
More recently, we submitted files in Canada, the U.K., Brazil and Australia with additional global submissions anticipated in the coming weeks and months and launch preparations are well advanced. The Phase III non-small cell lung cancer monotherapy study versus docetaxel continues to advance nicely, as do our 10 combination cohorts and Phase II colorectal study, with data expected from these latter 2 beginning in the first half of this year. 
We will initiate a Phase II study in first line non-small cell lung cancer in the second quarter, where we will investigate sotorasib monotherapy in patients most likely to benefit based on tumor profiling. For example, those tumors harboring STK11 mutations. 
Finally, we recently cleared the safety hurdle at the full sotarasib dose in our MEK inhibitor combination study and have completed enrollment in an expansion cohort. 
In inflammation, along with our partner, AstraZeneca, we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase III NAVIGATOR study at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Virtual Annual Meeting. Also known as Quad AI, at the end of February. You may have seen the abstract posting yesterday, which results from the primary and key secondary endpoints data that, in our view, provide a compelling rationale for the potential utility of tezepelumab in a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, including those with low eosinophil counts or we have breakthrough therapy designation in the United States. 
We are working closely with AstraZeneca on our U.S. and EU filing packages, which we expect to submit in the first half. 
Turning to our BiTE platform. We are particularly excited about the rapid progress we are making with 2 solid tumor programs, AMG 160, targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, for castrate-resistant prostate cancer; and AMG 757, targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. AMG 160 is currently in dose expansion, and we expect to advance AMG 757 into dose expansion in the coming months. We are quite pleased with the clinical profiles we are seeing with both of these molecules. And as you will see in our press release, we also continue to actively prioritize our oncology portfolio. 
In migraine, Aimovig continues to demonstrate important benefits for patients as our colleagues at Novartis announced positive Phase IV results showing superior efficacy and safety of Aimovig over topiramate in the migraine prevention setting. 
Finally, our biosimilars portfolio continues to advance, and we have completed enrollment in our Phase III study of AVP 959, our biosimilar Soliris. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our staff for their ongoing efforts to deliver our portfolio for patients. Murdo?"

Starting with our innovative portfolio, Prolia grew year-over-year despite significant impacts from the pandemic. And Evenity sales increased 85% year-over-year, driven by strong volume growth. Repatha is now annualizing at over $1 billion in revenues with 67% year-over-year volume growth. 
In the first full year since acquisition, we've seamlessly integrated Otezla growing total prescriptions by 13% year-over-year. And finally, our biosimilars portfolio totaled $1.7 billion in sales. 
Moving to fourth quarter performance. Product sales grew 8% year-over-year, driven by 13% volume growth. In our bone franchise, we remain focused on ensuring patient continuity. By year-end, osteoporosis diagnoses reached approximately 80% of pre-COVID levels, leading to a positive trend in new patient starts entering 2021. 
In Q4, Prolia's repeat patient numbers were lower than historical trends as a result of the echo effect of cover disruption in Q2. Evenity sales grew quarter-over-quarter. We believe EvenIty's unique bone building profile will continue to drive growth in our franchise as physicians appreciate its benefit risk profile for treating their high-risk post fracture patients. 
In cardiovascular, Repatha remains the global PCSK9 leader. Net sales in Q4 were $253 million, driven by sequential volume growth and stable U.S. net price. As we enter 2021, we expect continued momentum for this brand globally, driven by growth from international markets, improved U.S. PBM formulary position and relatively stable net price in the U.S. 
Moving on to Aimovig, which is the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class, volumes grew 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but remained flat quarter-over-quarter as the pandemic negatively impacted new patient starts. 
Next to Parsabiv. Q4 sales declined 8% quarter-over-quarter in the U.S. as some customers decreased utilization, while others built inventory in advance of the January reimbursement change. With Parsabiv inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundle, we expect sales to decline by approximately 40% to 50% in 2021 as U.S. dialysis centers update their treatment protocols to accommodate generic forms of cinacalcet. 
We also expect sales in Q1 to be the lowest of the year as customers deplete $40 million of inventory build in the second half of 2020. For patients on hemodialysis, Parsabiv is the only IV-administered calcimimetic that lowers and maintains key secondary hyperthyroidism lab values. Also, Parsabiv offers providers control over calcimimetic delivery and the opportunity to reduce patient pill burden. 
Transitioning to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales were $617 million in Q4, driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in total U.S. prescriptions. We see attractive future growth opportunities through global launches, and our planned submission for the mild to moderate psoriasis indication in the U.S. in the coming weeks. 
With Enbrel, fourth quarter sales declined 5% year-over-year. Volumes declined from gradual share loss, coupled with slower growth in the rheumatology segment, which we attribute in part to the pandemic. 
For 2020, net price declined in the low single digits, and we expect volume and net price trends to persist in 2021. 
Enbrel has an established record of safety and efficacy, and we will continue to invest in innovative solutions to enhance the patient experience. 
Switching to biosimilars. Q4 sales were $541 million, driven by volume growth which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We are leading in biosimilar share in Europe for Amgevita and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, with a respective 48% and 41% average share in Q4. 
We recently launched our fifth biosimilar, RIABNI, a biosimilar to Rituxan. For 2021, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be partially offset by a decline in net selling prices due to increased competition. 
In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF with 54% share of volume in the quarter. Onpro continues to demonstrate the value of innovation allowing patients to receive their GCSF treatment without having to return to their doctor's office or other site of care for administration. 
Overall, Neulasta sales decreased 19% year-over-year, driven by declines in volume and net selling price. And the most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 28% year-over-year. Going forward, we expect the price and volume trends to persist as biosimilar competition increases. 
Looking ahead, we're excited about new opportunities across our business. Internationally, we recently received national reimbursement drug listing for Prolia, which will accelerate growth in China. In Japan, we're preparing for the launch of Aimovig, and we're planning for the launch of our biosimilar brands across multiple markets in 2021. 
Finally, our team is ready to launch so Tarasi upon approval, and we're excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. And we're also preparing for the launch of tezepelumab with our partner, AstraZeneca, and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q4 and full year performance and look forward to Amgen serving more patients in 2021. 
And I'll turn it over to Peter."
24816,702219050,2188849,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. We are pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. In Q4, we delivered 7% revenue and 5% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. For the full",1087,"Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. We are pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. In Q4, we delivered 7% revenue and 5% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. For the full year, we delivered 9% revenue and 12% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. 
As Murdo mentioned, both Q4 and the full year benefited from volume-driven sales growth of 13% and 15%, respectively. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as spend accelerated to advance our innovative pipeline, drive volume growth for much of our portfolio around the globe and prepare for future launches, particularly for soda acid and tezepelumab. 
Operating expense grew 7% for the full year, including a full year of Otezla-related activities and expenses. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year was $2.0 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively. 
Now turning to the outlook for business for 2021 on Page 37. We look forward to investing in innovation in 2021 and in launching new products. We will also continue to execute on our volume-driven growth strategy. 
Due to COVID, we also anticipate some uncertainty and quarter-to-quarter variability in revenue and earnings throughout 2021. And with potential recovery later in the year, contingent upon the speed and effectiveness of global vaccination. 
Our 2021 revenue guidance is $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion, and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $16 to $17 per share. GAAP earnings per share guidance is $12.12 per share to $13.17 per share. 
Now let me mention several key assumptions embedded in our guidance. First, our revenue range reflects volume growth from Prolia, Otezla Repatha, Evenity, Aimovig and our biosimilars portfolio and importantly, our innovative oncology portfolio. 
At 'the same time, we expect continued competition against our filgrastim and ESA franchises. As well as accelerating erosion in U.S. Parsabiv sales, as Murdo highlighted, we experienced a 6% decline in net selling prices globally in 2020. 
For 2021, we again expect mid- single-digit price declines. A couple of points to recall when considering Q1 of 2021. Historically, the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter of the year, with planned changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, especially for products, including Enbrel, Otezla and Aimovig. 
Additionally, I want to remind everyone that in Q1 2020, Embrel benefited from approximately $115 of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and the entire portfolio saw roughly $100 million in inventory bill due to COVID. 
So as a proportion of our full year sales, we expect Q1 2021 to be a slightly lower percentage than the 24% it was in Q1 2020. We expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year 2021. This includes revenues from COVID-19 antibody manufacturing and profit share agreement with Lilly, under which we expect to begin shipping in the second quarter. 
We expect 2021 total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at a rate similar to the 7% 2020 non-GAAP operating expense growth, as we continue to invest in innovation, launches of new products and digitization efforts. We have created an industry-leading cost structure, and expect an operating margin of roughly 50% in 2021. 
Cost of sales as a percent of product sales will increase to a range of 16% to 17% due to an evolving product mix, and higher royalties and profit share payments. Additionally, cost of sales will increase in connection with our manufacturing agreement with Lilly. As I mentioned previously, the revenues and profit share will be included in other revenue. 
Research and development expenses will increase as our pipeline advances with year-over-year increases in early and late-stage investments. And SG&A will decline primarily due to changes in our commercial model including an increased focus on digital efforts. 
Now let me take a moment to explain an update we are making to our non-GAAP policy. Effective January 2021, our non-GAAP results will no longer include fair value adjustments to equity investments. These adjustments to equity investments have historically been recorded in other income and expenses and we're positive in our 2020 non-GAAP results. This change will not apply to our strategic investment in BeiGene, which is included in our non-GAAP results and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The press release contains the pro forma 2020 results by quarter under our updated policy. 
We will also now use updated adjusted 2020 amounts that conform to this policy for comparison purposes going forward. Under our updated non-GAAP policy that I just explained, here is our guidance for other income and expense. 
We anticipate non-GAAP other income expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of expense. This 2021 guidance reflects incorporation of 4 quarters of BeiGene's results versus 3 quarters in 2020, which are recorded on a 1 quarter leg. Recall that we only use the limited publicly available consensus estimates for BeiGene in connection with our guidance, and thus may experience additional variability depending on BeiGene's actual results. 
Our basis in BeiGene as of December 31, 2020, was approximately $2.9 billion, and this long-term investment is valued at approximately $6 billion today based upon the current U.S. market price. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is 13% to 14%, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $900 million this year. Including investments in additional manufacturing and other capacity to support our volume-driven growth strategy as well as an environmental sustainability initiatives that will enable our global operations to achieve carbon neutrality by 2027 and also in our digitization efforts to continue to scale up and integrate data and analytics in everything we do at Amgen. 
And finally, our capital allocation hierarchy remains unchanged. And after both internal and external innovation and then investing in our capital expenditures, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of growing dividends. Including the 10% increase in the first quarter of 2021 to $1.76 per share. We anticipate opportunistic share repurchases in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, subject to our Board's authorization. 
So in summary, we delivered for patients every patient every time. And for our investors in a challenging year that included the greatest public health crisis in 100 years, and the greatest economic disruption since the great depression. And we are confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2021 and beyond. 
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call back over to Bob."

Yes. Thanks for the questions. In regards to the combinations, the ones you mentioned are all actively in dose escalation, looking at either different doses or in some cases, even scheduling, depending on the agents. This is standard Phase Ib oncology drug development.

Obviously, we're quite excited about solar asset. But I want to complement Dave and his team how fast they've moved in developing this product and also just the number of regulatory submissions, they've been able to affect in a very compressed time frame. So we are optimistic and hopeful that we'll get a fairly quick review in multiple markets around the world. And so we would expect sort of asset to contribute to revenue. We don't give product-specific guidance, but this is a very large population of high unmet medical need. There's not a lot of choice for these advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. So we do anticipate that there'll be a  potential market with a high need there. 
The one caution that I'll put out is just the actual percentage of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients that have a KRAS G12C status result in their file and their medical record. Right now, we ascertain that to be at about 50%. So we've got work to do to grow that number. And obviously, we've seen with other targeted therapies. When you have an actionable mutation, the testing rate rises fairly rapidly. So we would expect upon approval to be able to do that. 
But nonetheless, we think sotorasib will be a meaningful contribution to at least revenue in the U.S. and then Tesi, we'll see what the regulatory authorities do with the filing, obviously, given that we had breakthrough designation. And obviously, given the pan-eosinophilic results that we've seen, and now you guys can see the breakdown in that in the abstract. We think this is an important medicine to get to market very quickly. 
The last question you asked about COVID, in fact, Geoff, was just -- I think we actually anticipate COVID will have a fairly significant impact on the market. Through the better part of the year, beyond the midpoint of the year. I hope we're wrong, and I hope that vaccination programs will improve.

The other thing that's worth mentioning is we'll be taking a leading role in establishing access for tezepelumab with payers. And again, our extensive biologics contracting experience in Part D and the government programs will help us secure broad access for tezepelumab for a broad range of patients. As you saw, we have a nice product profile here that will benefit a lot of patients regardless of their eosinophilic status. 
And then Dave Reese's team is obviously building out medical capabilities for the same customer-facing group. So we're excited about it. It's a focused effort. The beauty of focusing on allergis is they're very productive prescribers, but they're a relatively small audience size. So we'll be quite focused on addressing that. 
When it comes to kind of how we're looking at our oncology portfolio, we've got a very strong base right now in oncology between our hematology business, our solid tumor therapeutics that we have now our overall biosimilar portfolio and our supportive care, basically 1 in 5 oncology patients today receives an Amgen therapy. And so bringing sotorasib into that mix and then the potential of AMG 160 and 757 and 701, I think, is a fairly action-packed next few years in oncology that we can build on the current strength that we have, and we're excited about that.

And the differences are twofold. There's more than that ballistic to the 2 major ones. Bevacizumab as a molecule is actually growing, whereas trastuzumab as a molecule is flat to declining. So one thing that we're seeing in Embassy is actually the number of cycles of bevacizumab overall is growing. And so even holding share in that molecule actually holds up quite well. We also have less competition. That's the other factor.

The first part of the question I understood was how are we sourcing our Evenity growth? Is it from existing anabolic patients? Or are we expanding and treating new patients? I didn't catch the second part of the question, but let me address the first part. 
Overall, we're pleased with how Evenity has evolved. We've got nice evolution in our Japan business. In Japan, it's obviously -- we've been in the market a little bit longer. So one thing that we're seeing with Evenity is patients are on the product for a 12-month duration of treatment. And so you have to replenish those new patients. You do have to source those new patients. And so I think the team in Japan is quite experienced now at sourcing new patients and not necessarily where we got our early growth was from which was switching from other anabolics. 
And there are -- unfortunately, there are a lot of aging patients in these markets where osteoporosis goes unchecked and patients suffer factors and these high-risk patients need a solid bone builder like of entity to be able to improve their clinical outcomes. 
So I think in Japan, we're sourcing now more de novo growth than we were perhaps 6 to 12 months ago. Whereas in the U.S., it's much more of a mix of de novo and switch, the other thing that's helping us in the U.S. is, of course, having both Prolia and Evenity for the customer. A lot of the time when a patient will come in and have a fracture despite their prolia treatment, they're a really good candidate for Evenity. So we're often getting patients on both treatments. 
And sometimes after the 12 months of Evenity treatment are up, they'll roll back on to Prolia. So it's a nice franchise to have and have both an anti-resort of than a bone-building agent for our customers. So I think the future growth looks very good.

There were a couple of factors that went into our recent reorganization of our field force. One is just portfolio evolution and creating capacity for the new product launches and then reallocating from the older side of the portfolio. And depending on which region you're talking about in the world with Amgen, we're in very different stages of development. So for example, we're placing large investments in field force in Japan and in China, even in Russia and some other markets that are emerging for us as being important growth drivers. And in the U.S. We're really paying close attention to the forces in the market beyond COVID. We're looking at potential negative net price effects and/or price reform, as Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, as being a bit of a prevailing wind here. And so what we're doing is looking at our overall commercial model. 
And to your point, making it more productive and making it more efficient. So we're  largely on track with that plan. We were able to move very rapidly last year and build out our digital capabilities to an even greater extent than we had historically. We are seeing customers willing to engage in those channels. And we think some of those engagements will be persistent beyond COVID, quite frankly, and it's that persistency that we're betting on. What we haven't done is compromised the ability to have competitive share of voice in our field facing interactions, both on the medical side, both on the commercial side, in front of the customer. And so we think we'll continue to be able to compete effectively in the categories we're in, as well as augment that with highly efficient digital channels of communication."

We do see some of the international expansion maturing now. We've got a good business for Otezla in Japan. We're pursuing registration in China, and we recently secured reimbursement in Australia, so we're evolving the global footprint of Otezla beyond where the legacy Celgene efforts had it. So that one source of growth. But as Bob mentioned, we're also pursuing in the U.S. mild to moderate approval on the basis of the positive data set we have there. And that will allow us to move Otezla into a patient population that really is still an unmet need. These are patients who have enough skin surface area that they might be seeking an alternative to messy and inconvenient topical agents. And I think Otezla can play a very important role there in helping treat those patients. We're also in making investments in Otezla by expanding the promotional footprint of the product to include primary care promotion, something that Celgene had not done historically. So we're doing that both for the moderate to severe patient, but as well for that mild to moderate indication in anticipation of that potential approval. 
And the only other thing I would say is while we are seeing a little bit of softness in psoriasis and broader rheumatology, for the category due to COVID, Otezla being an oral has held up quite well, and the execution has been strong. 
I also think that the established safety and efficacy profile of Otezla is highly appreciated, given recent news in the broader rheumatology category of other orals where perhaps that risk-benefit equation is different than it is where it's very strong with Otezla. So we think we've got a good opportunity for growth. We also said when we gave that guidance, it assumed a successful competitive program from the TYK2 asset. And of course, that was confirmed today."

And then one thing that we're looking at quite carefully is the epidemiology of G12C mutations. There is a suggestion that it may be a little lower in prevalence in Asian populations. Probably because they are mutually exclusive with mutations in EGFR, which are quite high in these populations, up to 40% in China and Japan, for example.

I'll start today by discussing Amgen's performance in 2020, and then provide some perspective on our priorities for 2021.  By any measure, 2020 was a very successful year for us. Despi",790,"Great. Thank you, Arvind, and thank all of you for joining our call. I'll start today by discussing Amgen's performance in 2020, and then provide some perspective on our priorities for 2021.  
By any measure, 2020 was a very successful year for us. Despite the disruption of COVID-19, we delivered strong sales and earnings, driven by volume growth of 15% for our products. We advanced our innovative pipeline, most notably sotorasib and tezepelumab, both of which have received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA.  
We successfully integrated Otezla, strengthening our decades-long leadership in inflammation with a $2 billion-plus product that we believe has runway for further global growth. We grew our sales outside the U.S. to more than $6 billion, delivering on long-term goals by expanding our presence in China and Japan with successful transactions in both markets. We did all this while staying focused on the health and safety of our 24,000 employees around the world. And to all of them, I want to say thank you for a job well done.  
As we look to 2021, we're embracing 3 realities. First, COVID-19 is leading to some lasting changes in how we do business. For example, we expect to continue leveraging digital capabilities, call on customers and run clinical trials around the world with improved speed, efficiency, effectiveness.  
Second, we expect ongoing pressure on drug prices across the industry. We are fortunate to have products like Repatha, Prolia and Aimovig that meet the needs of millions of patients and can grow through increased penetration of the appropriate patient populations. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is also well positioned for the future.  
Third is capital continues to flow into our sector. We've entered a time of intense competition, where speed of execution is paramount. We've built a track record, featuring quality and speed. We've shown that with innovative first-in-class medicines like Repatha, the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor; and Aimovig, the first approved CGRP inhibitor. We showed it also with biosimilars like MVASI and KANJINTI, the first approved biosimilars to Avastin and Herceptin here in the U.S. And we're doing it right now with sotorasib, the first KRAS G12C inhibitor to be filed for approval just 28 months after we dosed our first patient. And we expect to do it again later in the year with tezepelumab as the first TSLP inhibitor.  
We're excited about our pipeline and plan on increasing our R&D investment in 2021. Dave will speak in a moment about some of our promising mid-stage pipeline candidates. But since this is the time of year when I like to address our long-term investments, I want to focus for a moment on a couple of areas central to our early research strategy. These are areas where we are building differentiated capabilities.  
First, in human genetics, where we have industry leading capabilities, we are adding to our database approximately 1 million subjects from the U.S. and the U.K. for whom we will have extensive phenotypic and genotypic information. This will augment the data we already have on in excess of 1.5 million individuals.  
In addition, we're pioneering the use of large-scale proteomics to measure the relative levels of some 5,000 different proteins in the blood. We're excited about the insights we're generating from this genomic proteomic work and expect to benefit in the selection of new drug targets and clinical trial design.  
There's growing interest in our industry in the area of targeted protein degradation, we believe the opportunity is broader than that, and our efforts are not just limited to degrading proteins. We're looking at degrading other biologic molecules as well. We're designing molecules to have multi-specific activity through a principle we call induced proximity. The idea is to use this platform to dramatically expand the universe of druggable targets. It's still early days in the field, but I wanted to flag it as an area where we want to emerge through time as an industry leader.  
All of our work is taking place at a time when more is expected of companies than ever before. Amgen is advancing an ambitious ESG agenda that includes providing medicines at no cost to low-income patients and funding world-class STEM education programs. With respect to the environment, we're committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2027, along with a 40% reduction in water use and a 75% reduction in waste.  
In summary, our success in 2020 gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver in 2021 and beyond. The world needs more innovation, not less, and we've proven ourselves ready, willing and able to provide it.  
I look forward to your questions a little later on in the call. Right now, let me turn over to Dave Reese, our Head of R&D."

I'll begin today with sotorasib, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. To date, more than 700 patients have been treated across 5 continents, and we are accelerating this groundbreaking program into new indications and earlier lines of therapy. A few days ago, we presented the first pivotal data for a KRAS G12C inhibitor at the World Conference on Lung Cancer, where we reported on 126 patients with second-line plus non-small cell lung cancer. 
Sotorasib drove rapid, deep and durable responses across a broad range of mutational profiles and subgroups with poor prognoses. And a centrally adjudicated intent-to-treat analysis, the objective response rate was 37%, including 3 complete remissions, progression-free survival was 6.8 months and duration of response was 10 months. Importantly, sotorasib demonstrated a very tolerable and differentiated clinical profile. And based on these data, we completed regulatory submissions in the United States and EU in December.  
More recently, we submitted files in Canada, the U.K., Brazil and Australia with additional global submissions anticipated in the coming weeks and months and launch preparations are well advanced. The Phase III non-small cell lung cancer monotherapy study versus docetaxel continues to advance nicely, as do our 10 combination cohorts and Phase II colorectal study, with data expected from these latter 2 beginning in the first half of this year.  
We will initiate a Phase II study in first line non-small cell lung cancer in the second quarter, where we will investigate sotorasib monotherapy in patients most likely to benefit based on tumor profiling. For example, those tumors harboring STK11 mutations.  
Finally, we recently cleared the safety hurdle at the full sotorasib dose in our MEK inhibitor combination study and have completed enrollment in an expansion cohort.  
In inflammation, along with our partner, AstraZeneca, we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase III NAVIGATOR study at the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology Virtual Annual Meeting, also known as AAAAI, at the end of February. You may have seen the abstract posting yesterday, which results from the primary and key secondary end points data that, in our view, provide a compelling rationale for the potential utility of tezepelumab in a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, including those with low eosinophil counts or we have Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the United States. We are working closely with AstraZeneca on our U.S. and EU filing packages, which we expect to submit in the first half.  
Turning to our BiTE platform. We are particularly excited about the rapid progress we are making with 2 solid tumor programs, AMG 160, targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, for castrate-resistant prostate cancer; and AMG 757, targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. AMG 160 is currently in dose expansion, and we expect to advance AMG 757 into dose expansion in the coming months. We are quite pleased with the clinical profiles we are seeing with both of these molecules. 
And as you will see in our press release, we also continue to actively prioritize our oncology portfolio. In migraine, Aimovig continues to demonstrate important benefits for patients as our colleagues at Novartis announced positive Phase IV results showing superior efficacy and safety of Aimovig over topiramate in the migraine prevention setting. Finally, our biosimilars portfolio continues to advance, and we have completed enrollment in our Phase III study of ABP 959, our biosimilar Soliris.  
In closing, I'd like to thank our staff for their ongoing efforts to deliver our portfolio for patients. Murdo?"

Starting with our innovative portfolio, Prolia grew year-over-year despite significant impacts from the pandemic. And EVENITY sales increased 85% year-over-year, driven by strong volume growth. Repatha is now annualizing at over $1 billion in revenues with 67% year-over-year volume growth.  
In the first full year since acquisition, we've seamlessly integrated Otezla growing total prescriptions by 13% year-over-year. And finally, our biosimilars portfolio totaled $1.7 billion in sales.  
Moving to fourth quarter performance. Product sales grew 8% year-over-year, driven by 13% volume growth. In our bone franchise, we remain focused on ensuring patient continuity. By year-end, osteoporosis diagnoses reached approximately 80% of pre-COVID levels, leading to a positive trend in new patient starts entering 2021.  
In Q4, Prolia's repeat patient numbers were lower than historical trends as a result of the echo effect of COVID disruption in Q2. EVENITY sales grew quarter-over-quarter. We believe EVENITY's unique bone building profile will continue to drive growth in our franchise as physicians appreciate its benefit-risk profile for treating their high-risk post fracture patients.  
In cardiovascular, Repatha remains the global PCSK9 leader. Net sales in Q4 were $253 million, driven by sequential volume growth and stable U.S. net price. As we enter 2021, we expect continued momentum for this brand globally, driven by growth from international markets, improved U.S. PBM formulary position and relatively stable net price in the U.S.  
Moving on to Aimovig, which is the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class, volumes grew 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but remained flat quarter-over-quarter as the pandemic negatively impacted new patient starts.  
Next to Parsabiv. Q4 sales declined 8% quarter-over-quarter in the U.S. as some customers decreased utilization, while others built inventory in advance of the January reimbursement change. With Parsabiv inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundle, we expect sales to decline by approximately 40% to 50% in 2021 as U.S. dialysis centers update their treatment protocols to accommodate generic forms of cinacalcet.  
We also expect sales in Q1 to be the lowest of the year as customers deplete $40 million of inventory build in the second half of 2020. For patients on hemodialysis, Parsabiv is the only IV-administered calcimimetic that lowers and maintains key secondary hyperthyroidism lab values. Also, Parsabiv offers providers control over calcimimetic delivery and the opportunity to reduce patient pill burden.  
Transitioning to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales were $617 million in Q4, driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in total U.S. prescriptions. We see attractive future growth opportunities through global launches, and our planned submission for the mild to moderate psoriasis indication in the U.S. in the coming weeks.  
With Enbrel, fourth quarter sales declined 5% year-over-year. Volumes declined from gradual share loss, coupled with slower growth in the rheumatology segment, which we attribute in part to the pandemic.  
For 2020, net price declined in the low single digits, and we expect volume and net price trends to persist in 2021. Enbrel has an established record of safety and efficacy, and we will continue to invest in innovative solutions to enhance the patient experience.  
Switching to biosimilars. Q4 sales were $541 million, driven by volume growth which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We are leading in biosimilar share in Europe for AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, with a respective 48% and 41% average share in Q4.  
We recently launched our fifth biosimilar, RIABNI, a biosimilar to Rituxan. For 2021, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be partially offset by a decline in net selling prices due to increased competition.  
In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting G-CSF with 54% share of volume in the quarter. Onpro continues to demonstrate the value of innovation allowing patients to receive their G-CSF treatment without having to return to their doctor's office or other site of care for administration.  
Overall, Neulasta sales decreased 19% year-over-year, driven by declines in volume and net selling price. And the most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 28% year-over-year. Going forward, we expect the price and volume trends to persist as biosimilar competition increases.  
Looking ahead, we're excited about new opportunities across our business. Internationally, we recently received national reimbursement drug listing for Prolia, which will accelerate growth in China. In Japan, we're preparing for the launch of Aimovig, and we're planning for the launch of our biosimilar brands across multiple markets in 2021.  
Finally, our team is ready to launch sotorasib upon approval, and we're excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. And we're also preparing for the launch of tezepelumab with our partner, AstraZeneca, and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q4 and full year performance and look forward to Amgen serving more patients in 2021.  
And I'll turn it over to Peter."
24816,702219050,2189077,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. We are pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. In Q4, we delivered 7% revenue and 5% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. For the full",1088,"Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. We are pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. In Q4, we delivered 7% revenue and 5% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. For the full year, we delivered 9% revenue and 12% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth.  
As Murdo mentioned, both Q4 and the full year benefited from volume-driven sales growth of 13% and 15%, respectively. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as spend accelerated to advance our innovative pipeline, drive volume growth for much of our portfolio around the globe and prepare for future launches, particularly for sotorasib and tezepelumab.  
Operating expense grew 7% for the full year, including a full year of Otezla-related activities and expenses. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year was $2.0 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively.  
Now turning to the outlook for business for 2021 on Page 37. We look forward to investing in innovation in 2021 and in launching new products. We will also continue to execute on our volume-driven growth strategy. Due to COVID, we also anticipate some uncertainty and quarter-to-quarter variability in revenue and earnings throughout 2021, with potential recovery later in the year, contingent upon the speed and effectiveness of global vaccination.  
Our 2021 revenue guidance is $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion, and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $16 to $17 per share. GAAP earnings per share guidance is $12.12 per share to $13.17 per share.  
Now let me mention several key assumptions embedded in our guidance. First, our revenue range reflects volume growth from Prolia, Otezla, Repatha, EVENITY, Aimovig and our biosimilars portfolio and importantly, our innovative oncology portfolio.  
At the same time, we expect continued competition against our filgrastim and ESA franchises as well as accelerating erosion in U.S. Parsabiv sales, as Murdo highlighted. We experienced a 6% decline in net selling prices globally in 2020.  
For 2021, we again expect mid-single-digit price declines. A couple of points to recall when considering Q1 of 2021. Historically, the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter of the year, with planned changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, especially for products, including Enbrel, Otezla and Aimovig.  
Additionally, I want to remind everyone that in Q1 2020, Enbrel benefited from approximately $115 (sic) [ $115 million ] of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and the entire portfolio saw roughly $100 million in inventory bill due to COVID.  
So as a proportion of our full year sales, we expect Q1 2021 to be a slightly lower percentage than the 24% it was in Q1 2020. We expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year 2021. This includes revenues from COVID-19 antibody manufacturing and profit share agreement with Lilly, under which we expect to begin shipping in the second quarter.  
We expect 2021 total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at a rate similar to the 7% 2020 non-GAAP operating expense growth. As we continue to invest in innovation, launches of new products and digitization efforts. We have created an industry-leading cost structure, and expect an operating margin of roughly 50% in 2021.  
Cost of sales as a percent of product sales will increase to a range of 16% to 17% due to an evolving product mix, and higher royalties and profit share payments. Additionally, cost of sales will increase in connection with our manufacturing agreement with Lilly. As I mentioned previously, the revenues and profit share will be included in other revenue.  
Research and development expenses will increase as our pipeline advances with year-over-year increases in early and late-stage investments. And SG&A will decline primarily due to changes in our commercial model including an increased focus on digital efforts.  
Now let me take a moment to explain an update we are making to our non-GAAP policy. Effective January 2021, our non-GAAP results will no longer include fair value adjustments to equity investments. These adjustments to equity investments have historically been recorded in other income and expenses and we're positive in our 2020 non-GAAP results. This change will not apply to our strategic investment in BeiGene, which is included in our non-GAAP results and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The press release contains the pro forma 2020 results by quarter under our updated policy.  
We will also now use updated adjusted 2020 amounts that conform to this policy for comparison purposes going forward. Under our updated non-GAAP policy that I just explained, here is our guidance for other income and expense.  
We anticipate non-GAAP other income expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of expense. This 2021 guidance reflects incorporation of 4 quarters of BeiGene's results versus 3 quarters in 2020, which are recorded on a 1 quarter lag. Recall that we only use the limited publicly available consensus estimates for BeiGene in connection with our guidance, and thus may experience additional variability depending on BeiGene's actual results. Our basis in BeiGene as of December 31, 2020, was approximately $2.9 billion, and this long-term investment is valued at approximately $6 billion today based upon the current U.S. market price.  
Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is 13% to 14%. And we expect capital expenditures of approximately $900 million this year, including investments in additional manufacturing and other capacity to support our volume-driven growth strategy as well as an environmental sustainability initiatives that will enable our global operations to achieve carbon neutrality by 2027 and also in our digitization efforts to continue to scale up and integrate data and analytics in everything we do at Amgen.  
And finally, our capital allocation hierarchy remains unchanged. After both internal and external innovation and then investing in our capital expenditures, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of growing dividends, including the 10% increase in the first quarter of 2021 to $1.76 per share. We anticipate opportunistic share repurchases in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, subject to our Board's authorization.  
So in summary, we deliver for patients, every patient every time. And for our investors in a challenging year that included the greatest public health crisis in 100 years, and the greatest economic disruption since the great depression. And we are confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2021 and beyond.  
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call back over to Bob."

Obviously, we're quite excited about sotorasib. And I want to compliment Dave and his team how fast they've moved in developing this product and also just the number of regulatory submissions, they've been able to affect in a very compressed time frame. So we are optimistic and hopeful that we'll get a fairly quick review in multiple markets around the world. And so we would expect sotorasib to contribute to revenue. We don't give product-specific guidance, but this is a very large population of high unmet medical need. There's not a lot of choice for these advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. So we do anticipate that there'll be a potential market with a high need there. 
The one caution that I'll put out is just the actual percentage of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients that have a KRAS G12C status result in their file and their medical record. Right now, we ascertain that to be at about 50%. So we've got work to do to grow that number. And obviously, we've seen with other targeted therapies. When you have an actionable mutation, the testing rate rises fairly rapidly. So we would expect upon approval to be able to do that. 
But nonetheless, we think sotorasib will be a meaningful contribution to at least revenue in the U.S. And then teze, we'll see what the regulatory authorities do with the filing, obviously, given that we had Breakthrough Designation. And obviously, given the pan-eosinophilic results that we've seen, and now you guys can see the breakdown in that in the abstract. We think this is an important medicine to get to market very quickly. 
The last question you asked about COVID, in fact, Geoff, was just -- I think we actually anticipate COVID will have a fairly significant impact on the market through the better part of the year, beyond the midpoint of the year. I hope we're wrong, and I hope that vaccination programs will improve. But right now, we think that COVID will be with us for the majority of 2021."

The other thing that's worth mentioning is we'll be taking a leading role in establishing access for tezepelumab with payers. And again, our extensive biologics contracting experience in Part D and the government programs will help us secure broad access for tezepelumab for a broad range of patients. As you saw, we have a nice product profile here that will benefit a lot of patients regardless of their eosinophilic status. 
And then Dave Reese's team is obviously building out medical capabilities for the same customer-facing group. So we're excited about it. It's a focused effort. The beauty of focusing on allergist is they're very productive prescribers, but they're a relatively small audience size. So we'll be quite focused on addressing that. 
When it comes to kind of how we're looking at our oncology portfolio, we've got a very strong base right now in oncology between our hematology business, our solid tumor therapeutics that we have now, our overall biosimilar portfolio and our supportive care, basically 1 in 5 oncology patients today receives an Amgen therapy.

And the differences are twofold. There's more than that ballistic to the 2 major ones. Bevacizumab as a molecule is actually growing, whereas trastuzumab as a molecule is flat to declining. So one thing that we're seeing in MVASI is actually the number of cycles of bevacizumab overall is growing. And so even holding share in that molecule actually holds up quite well. We also have less competition. That's the other factor. 
So there's less competition for now in the bevacizumab molecule, whereas with trastuzumab, we have more competitors. And so I think going forward, you would see competitive dynamics shaping those 2 brands a little bit differently."

The first part of the question I understood was how are we sourcing our EVENITY growth? Is it from existing anabolic patients? Or are we expanding and treating new patients? I didn't catch the second part of the question, but let me address the first part. 
Overall, we're pleased with how EVENITY has evolved. We've got nice evolution in our Japan business. In Japan, it's obviously -- we've been in the market a little bit longer. So one thing that we're seeing with EVENITY is patients are on the product for a 12-month duration of treatment. And so you have to replenish those new patients. You do have to source those new patients. And so I think the team in Japan is quite experienced now at sourcing new patients and not necessarily where we got our early growth was from which was switching from other anabolics. 
And there are -- unfortunately, there are a lot of aging patients in these markets where osteoporosis goes unchecked and patients suffer fractures and these high-risk patients need a solid bone builder like EVENITY to be able to improve their clinical outcomes. 
So I think in Japan, we're sourcing now more de novo growth than we were perhaps 6 to 12 months ago. Whereas in the U.S., it's much more of a mix of de novo and switch, the other thing that's helping us in the U.S. is, of course, having both Prolia and EVENITY for the customer. A lot of the time when a patient will come in and have a fracture despite their Prolia treatment, they're a really good candidate for EVENITY. So we're often getting patients on both treatments. 
And sometimes after the 12 months of EVENITY treatment are up, they'll roll back on to Prolia. So it's a nice franchise to have and have both an anti-resort and a bone-building agent for our customers. So I think the future growth looks very good. Obviously, our partners at UCB are just getting going in Europe as they establish reimbursement for the product. But I'm quite excited about what EVENITY could become for these -- for bone-building for these very high-risk post fracture patients."

There were a couple of factors that went into our recent reorganization of our field force. One is just portfolio evolution and creating capacity for the new product launches and then reallocating from the older side of the portfolio. And depending on which region you're talking about in the world with Amgen, we're in very different stages of development. So for example, we're placing large investments in field force in Japan and in China, even in Russia and some other markets that are emerging for us as being important growth drivers. And in the U.S., we're really paying close attention to the forces in the market beyond COVID. We're looking at potential negative net price effects and/or price reform, as Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, as being a bit of a prevailing wind here. And so what we're doing is looking at our overall commercial model. 
And to your point, making it more productive and making it more efficient. So we're largely on track with that plan. We were able to move very rapidly last year and build out our digital capabilities to an even greater extent than we had historically. We are seeing customers willing to engage in those channels. And we think some of those engagements will be persistent beyond COVID, quite frankly, and it's that persistency that we're betting on. What we haven't done is compromised the ability to have competitive share of voice in our field facing interactions, both on the medical side, both on the commercial side, in front of the customer. And so we think we'll continue to be able to compete effectively in the categories we're in as well as augment that with highly efficient digital channels of communication."

We do see some of the international expansion maturing now. We've got a good business for Otezla in Japan. We're pursuing registration in China, and we recently secured reimbursement in Australia, so we're evolving the global footprint of Otezla beyond where the legacy Celgene efforts had it. So that is one source of growth. But as Bob mentioned, we're also pursuing in the U.S. mild to moderate approval on the basis of the positive data set we have there. And that will allow us to move Otezla into a patient population that really is still an unmet need. These are patients who have enough skin surface area that they might be seeking an alternative to messy and inconvenient topical agents. And I think Otezla can play a very important role there in helping treat those patients. We're also in making investments in Otezla by expanding the promotional footprint of the product to include primary care promotion, something that Celgene had not done historically. So we're doing that both for the moderate to severe patient, but as well for that mild to moderate indication in anticipation of that potential approval. 
And the only other thing I would say is while we are seeing a little bit of softness in psoriasis and broader rheumatology, for the category due to COVID, Otezla being an oral has held up quite well, and the execution has been strong. 
I also think that the established safety and efficacy profile of Otezla is highly appreciated, given recent news in the broader rheumatology category of other orals where perhaps that risk-benefit equation is different than it is where it's very strong with Otezla. So we think we've got a good opportunity for growth. We also said when we gave that guidance, it assumed a successful competitive program from the TYK2 asset. And of course, that was confirmed today."

And then one thing that we're looking at quite carefully is the epidemiology of G12C mutations. There is a suggestion that it may be a little lower in prevalence in Asian populations. Probably because they are mutually exclusive with mutations in EGFR, which are quite high in these populations, up to 40% in China and Japan, for example.

Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We've had a busy start to 2021 and a first quarter that's something of a mere image to what we experienced a year ago.

We've had a busy start to 2021 and a first quarter that's something of a mere image to what we experienced a year ago. Last year, if you recall, we came out of the gate with a very strong January and February and then started to really feel the impact of the pandemic in March. This year, especially in the U.S., it was almost the reverse. We felt the impact of the pandemic in January and February, and we began to see a recovery in March, a trend that seems to be holding in April as well. 
Setting aside the pandemic, we executed effectively in the first quarter, and this is reflected in the strong competitive performance of our brands globally. Our strong biosimilars showing, the rapid progress of our lead pipeline molecules and the addition of an attractive Phase III-ready molecule in oncology. Altogether, we remain confident in our full year outlook. 
We're fortunate to have a diverse portfolio of newer products that continue to show strong volume growth. Repatha, for example, delivered 36% volume growth in the first quarter. It remains the clear leader of the PCSK9 market globally and will soon reach the milestone of 1 million patients served. 
We're also the global leader in bone health with Prolia and EVENITY, generating double-digit volume in the quarter. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is annualizing above the $2 billion mark, and I would remind you that we have 3 additional biosimilars in Phase III development and look forward to a flow of new launch opportunities for these and AMGEVITA over the next few years. 
As we've shared with you many times in the past, we're active in business development, looking to complement our internally developed innovation with compelling external opportunities, and our recent acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics is a good example of that. 
As you know, one of the molecules we acquired in that deal, bemarituzumab, was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA as a first-line therapy for a subset of patients with gastric cancer. More than 1 million new gastric cancer cases are diagnosed annually, and the disease is particularly prevalent in the Asia Pacific region, which we've said previously will account for approximately 25% of our growth over the next decade. Bemarituzumab is now our third late-stage clinical medicine to be granted breakthrough therapy status joining sotorasib for which the trade name LUMAKRAS has now been provisionally approved for use in the U.S. And tezepelumab also has earned that breakthrough therapy distinction. 
With a strong balance sheet, healthy cash flows and our proven ability to integrate, we'll continue to look for external opportunities that strengthen us in our stated areas of focus. 
Before I turn things over to our CFO, Peter Griffith, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering results for our stakeholders. I look forward to our Q&A session a little later in our call. 
For now, over to you, Peter."

Let me first confirm our predictable consistent capital allocation hierarch",1026,"Thank you, Bob. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on the strong fundamentals of the business and further to reaffirm our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. 
Let me first confirm our predictable consistent capital allocation hierarchy as seen in our Q1 activity. It always begins with investing in internal innovation. LUMAKRAS and tezepelumab, both internally discovered and each branded breakthrough therapy designation are excellent examples of this. We also patiently pursue external business development opportunities that clear our hurdle rate and that are consistent with our areas of therapeutic focus in which we are confident of integrating into Amgen efficiently and effectively on a timely basis. We allocated $2 billion of our shareholders' capital to the Five Prime acquisition in the second quarter and have committed additional R&D funding to pursue other indications for the lead molecule demo. 
Our capital expenditures remain a high priority, including investments in our industry-leading protein manufacturing, our ESG initiatives, including enabling carbon neutrality by 2027 and digitization imperatives. We continue to return capital to our shareholders. First, we paid dividends of $1.76 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from 2020. This year marks our 11th year dividends with meaningful increases in each of those years. Second, we repurchased 3.7 million shares in the first quarter at a cost of roughly [ $865 ] million. Finally, our capital allocation hierarchy always builds on our efficient capital structure, which results in an optimal weighted average cost of capital. 
Now I will briefly walk through our first quarter financial results. Recall that in 2021, we are now comparing to our recast 2020 results that exclude the impact of fair value adjustments to equity investments that were historically included in non-GAAP OI&E. In Q1, revenues decreased 4%. Historically, first quarter sales have been the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year. As we entered 2021, we knew that COVID would likely introduce some variability. And as the quarter progressed, and we saw a continuing cumulative effect of COVID cases on prescribing patterns, we anticipated that Q1 would be more negatively impacted, which led us to disclose in March that it would be moderately below 2020's percentage of the full year. 
First quarter sales benefited from 4% volume growth. Looking back to Q1 of 2020, we recorded approximately $150 million of favorable changes to estimated sales deduction, creating a negative impact on year-over-year growth comparisons in Q1 2021. As we get underway with the second quarter, we expect there to be some continuing cumulative COVID impacts. We expect to see improvements in the rate of recovery. That recovery will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter increased 2% year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Effective Q2 2021, cost of sales will increase as a percent of product sales in connection with our first shipments of antibody to Lilly. Recall that revenue from shipments of these antibodies will be recorded in other revenues. For the full year, we expect R&D spend will increase as our innovative pipeline continues to progress, which now includes bema from the Five Prime acquisition as well as the Rodeo acquisition. And for the full year, we expect SG&A spend to decline. We continue our focus on digitization imperatives. 
Non-GAAP OI&E was a net $375 million expense in Q1. This is unfavorable by $79 million on a year-over-year basis due to the recording of our portion of BeiGene's loss this quarter. Recall the recognition of BeiGene's results did not start until Q2 2020. The effects year-over-year of the adjustments in sales deductions, combined with the recognition of the BeiGene results, totaled about $0.29 and decreased EPS on a comparison basis for Q1 '21 and explain a large portion of the 12% decline in EPS year-over-year. 
Now turning to the outlook for the business for 2021. Based on underlying market dynamics and our investment plan, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance with a revenue range of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion and a non-GAAP EPS range of $16 to $17. 
Important additional points to consider as you model the remainder of 2021. We are providing more specific quarter-over-quarter guidance given the unprecedented continuing cumulative COVID impacts on the operating environment, but we do not expect to provide such guidance on an ongoing basis. We see the recovery from COVID-19 more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. And for the second quarter, we expect total revenues to grow between 7% and 10% sequentially from the first quarter. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to increase by about 7% over last year, with an operating margin of roughly 50%, which includes operating expenses for Five Prime and Rodeo. Historically, the Q2 quarter-over-quarter operating expense increase is about 10%. But in the second quarter this year, we expect quarter-over-quarter operating expenses to increase in the mid-teens percentage range, reflecting the impact of our Lilly COVID-19 antibody manufacturing agreement, investments for growth, including the Five Prime acquisition as well as increasing activity levels, including launch preparations. 
For the full year, we continue to anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be a net expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Our capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at $900 million. And based on our confidence in the long-range outlook of the business, we are raising the upper end of our share repurchase range to 5 billion for 2021 versus prior guidance of 4 billion. So our range for share repurchases in 2021 is now $3 billion to $5 billion. Additionally, we're updating our non-GAAP tax rate guidance to 13.5% to 14.5% versus prior guidance of 13% to 14%. 
My confidence is strong in the long-term outlook for Amgen given the strength of the business and the strength of our outstanding and dedicated team of 23,000 plus colleagues that deliver every day to patients and also deliver long-term growth to our shareholders. 
This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Murdo. Murdo?"

Net selling price declined 7%, and the year-over-year comparison",1227,"Thanks, Peter. First quarter product sales declined 5% year-over-year. Volumes grew 4% driven by double-digit growth for a number of products, including Prolia, Repatha, MVASI and KANJINTI. Net selling price declined 7%, and the year-over-year comparison was negatively affected by 2% due to a benefit in Q1 2020 from approximately $150 million of changes to estimated sales deductions that did not reoccur to the same magnitude in Q1 of 2021. 
In the first quarter, the cumulative effect of the COVID pandemic on missed patient visits and diagnoses impacted our business. January and February were clearly affected by post-holiday COVID spikes, and March showed demand improvement across most brands, which has continued into April. Despite the impact of the pandemic, our teams have found solutions to address the continuity of care, stabilizing our continuing patient volume. We also saw improvement in customer-facing execution throughout the quarter across all communication channels, including face-to-face and virtual activities. We expect some COVID-19-related disruptions still in the second quarter with steady recovery thereafter. 
I'll now review some product details, beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia grew 16% year-over-year, recording over $500 million of U.S. sales in the U.S. for the first time. As a majority of osteoporosis patients in the U.S. have been vaccinated and diagnosis rates are at approximately 90% to pre-COVID-19 levels, we're confident in Prolia's continued growth in 2021. EVENITY sales increased 7% year-over-year driven by strong volume growth. Given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of postmenopausal women, EVENITY provides an excellent therapy to build bone first, which should then be followed by treatment with Prolia. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year to a quarterly sales record of $286 million driven by 36% volume growth, and we maintain global leadership in the PCSK9 class. Sales outside the U.S. grew by 40% driven by strong patient demand. 
In the U.S., we continue to see strength in new patient starts with new-to-brand prescriptions growing 54% quarter-over-quarter helped by favorable pharmacy benefit manager formulary changes. U.S. volume growth demonstrates that we've made good progress against our strategy to provide Repatha at an affordable price to patients, particularly those with Medicare Part D coverage. This acceleration in Medicare Part D growth has increased our exposure to the so-called doughnut hole, which creates some negative impact on overall net price. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients. 
Next to Aimovig, which remains the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class. Aimovig volumes grew 20% year-over-year in the first quarter with a 45% average total prescription share and 38% average new-to-brand prescription share. Year-over-year net selling price declined, primarily driven by increased rebates to maintain patient access. Unfortunately, millions of patients suffering from migraine are suboptimally treated with older, less effective therapies. Given the head-to-head data we've generated showing Aimovig's superiority against to [indiscernible], we're confident we can help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine. 
Turning to our inflammation portfolio where Otezla has demonstrated a robust safety and efficacy profile with over 6 years of real-world experience in market with more than 500,000 patients treated globally. Enbrel similarly has served millions of patients globally since 1998. Otezla sales were $476 million in the quarter. Volume growth was 9% driven primarily by 11% total prescription growth in the U.S. Otezla remains the market-leading branded systemic medication for psoriasis with an approximately 30% share of first-line treatment. However, new-to-brand prescription volume remained flat as COVID-19 continued to suppress the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis patients. Year-over-year growth was also negatively impacted given pandemic-related inventory stocking in Q1 of 2020. Otezla has more than 90% commercial payer coverage in the U.S. without requiring a biological step and is an affordable, safe and efficacious option for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We see attractive growth opportunities for Otezla as the pandemic recovery progresses. In addition, geographic expansion and the anticipated approval later this year of the mild to moderate psoriasis indication will contribute to future Otezla growth. 
In 2021, year-over-year comparisons for Enbrel are adversely impacted by $255 million of favorable estimated sales deductions that were recorded in 2020, $115 million of which were in Q1 of 2020. In the quarter, Embrel sales decreased 20% year-over-year with declines in both unit volume and net selling price. Moving forward, we expect volume and net price trends to continue. 
Parsabiv sales decreased 55% year-over-year driven by [ 65% ] volume declines. With Parsabiv inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundle in the U.S., we have seen dialysis clinics quickly implement new treatment protocols, switching patients from Parsabiv to generic cinacalcet. 
Switching to biosimilars. Q1 sales were $570 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe for AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, where we saw average shares of 50% and 43%, respectively, in Q1. For the remainder of the year, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition. Longer term, growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products to new markets and launches of additional biosimilar molecules such as AMGEVITA in the U.S. and biosimilars for SOLIRIS, STELARA and [indiscernible]. 
In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF, with 54% share of volume in the quarter. In Q1, we surpassed 1 million patients who, with the help of Onpro, were able to receive their GCSF treatment while reducing the need to return to their doctor's office or other side of care for administration. Consistent with recent trends, Neulasta's U.S. average selling price declined 30% on a year-over-year basis, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition. 
XGEVA sales decreased 3% year-over-year for the first quarter as volume growth in Asia was offset by lower net selling price in that region. U.S. unit volumes declined year-over-year driven by demand impacts in January and February, with recovery beginning in March and into April. 
KYPROLIS sales decreased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter as the pandemic has suppressed the number of new patients starting treatment for multiple myeloma. Moving forward, we expect promotion to drive growth in second line and beyond as a result of our launch of the combination indication of KYPROLIS and DARZALEX plus dexamethasone, or DKD. The combination of KYPROLIS with [indiscernible] and dexamethasone, or [ ESA KD ], was also approved in the quarter. 
As Bob mentioned, our team is ready to launch sotorasib or LUMAKRAS upon approval, and we are excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. We've already launched our biomarker assist program, which removes access barriers to testing and helps appropriate patients without a pocket costs. And we're also preparing for the launch of tezepelumab with our partner, AstraZeneca, and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the more than 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our Q1 execution given the pandemic-related disruption of new patient diagnoses and treatment, and we'll continue our focused execution during Q2 and are projecting recovery over the second half of the year. 
With that, I'll turn it to Dave."

First, we are excited to welcome our new colleagues from Five Prime therapeutics and begin work on bemarituzumab. The integration is going well, and we have hit the ground running with Phase III planning activities. As Bob mentioned, we received breakthrough therapy designation from FDA and look forward to discussions with regulators on the development program, including Phase III in the near future. We will also investigate bemarituzumab in other indications where FGFR2b may play a role, including squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and we'll have more to say on the entire development program as those plans are finalized. 
In inflammation, I would like to highlight our acquisition of Rodeo Therapeutics and their 15 prostaglandin dehydrogenase program, which was motivated by compelling preclinical data from Rodeo and valuable insights from deCODE. This is a nice illustration of our use of human genetic data to inform drug discovery and development. 
The LUMAKRAS program continues to advance with several regulatory milestones in the first quarter, including global submissions for advanced non-small cell lung cancer and a priority review from FDA with a regulatory action date of August [ 16 ]. We are having productive interactions with the FDA and multiple other regulatory agencies that will include Japan with today's anticipated submission, and we look forward to making LUMAKRAS available to patients as soon as possible. We are also pleased to receive temporary authorization for use status in France. This designation is to promote fast access to innovative medicines before marketing authorization and conventional access, and we have received a large number of requests. 
In the clinical development program, we completed enrollment in the Phase III study versus docetaxel in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Based on the overall efficacy and safety profile of LUMAKRAS and discussions with regulators we, reduced the sample size in this study while maintaining appropriate statistical power to assess the progression-free survival primary endpoint. The time lines of the study have not changed as the primary endpoint remains event-driven. 
While we have demonstrated that the 960-milligram dose is safe and efficacious in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, we continue to explore different doses and regimens as is common in oncology drug development. As part of this effort, we are initiating a new cohort to determine whether a once-daily oral dose of 240 milligrams maintains the safety and efficacy profile of the 960-milligram dose in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Should a lower dose is safe and efficacious as 960 milligrams, it may further enhance the patient experience with once-daily LUMAKRAS. We expect the results from this study in late 2022 or early 2023 and do not expect any impact on the time lines of our ongoing priority review. 
We also continue to make good progress in evaluating combination regimens. Efficacy cohorts are underway for our MEK inhibitor, EGFR antibody and oral EGFR inhibitor combinations, and we expect to present updates on these regimens at medical meetings in the second half of the year. We continue to evaluate doses and regimens to find the optimal options for patients in our other combinations, including PD-1 and SHIP2. 
Finally, we are initiating triplet cohorts in colorectal cancer of LUMAKRAS with standard of care chemotherapy and either an anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF antibody. 
In our BiTE programs, we have initiated several new studies, including new indications for AMG 160, targeting PSMA in non-small cell lung cancer, and AMG 757, targeting DLL3, now also being investigated in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Details on these and other development programs, including small molecules, can be found in our press release. 
Turning to tezepelumab. Developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca, the Phase III NAVIGATOR data were well received by clinicians, and additional analyses will be presented at the American Thoracic Society Meeting in May. We remain on track to submit regulatory filings this quarter and believe the data support tezepelumab as a first-line biologic therapy for a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We are also investigating other indications with Phase II studies in COPD and chronic spontaneous urticaria and, most recently, a Phase III study for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 
Finally, on Otezla, we submitted a supplemental new drug application to FDA based on the Phase III ADVANCE study in mild to moderate psoriasis. The positive results from ADVANCE were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology, or AAD, meeting a few days ago. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our staff for continuing to deliver for patients. Bob?"

The first thing I would just reiterate is that we anticipated that the Duke data would indeed show what they did show. And we assume that in the model that we put together for the transaction, and we've assumed that for the balance of this year. 
What I would say is that we continue to believe that Otezla is really ideally positioned in the first-line prebiologic psoriasis market. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've been on the market for 6 years now. We have in market cumulative patient experience with over 500,000 individuals globally. We have excellent commercial and payer coverage at over 90% of covered lives. And we continue to make really good progress, holding a 30% share in the market with really outstanding customer-facing capabilities. 
The other thing that we, of course, look at is positioning in the market and how that holds up against not just Duke but other competitors. And we think that we really are the first kind of option prebiologic post topical. And dermatologists have become very comfortable using Otezla that way. Payer coverage is consistent with that position in the market. And with the mild to -- pending mild to moderate indication data, which were presented at the same AAD meeting, which look quite compelling, we expect to be able to expand our utilization of Otezla and psoriasis population in the milder patient type. 
So overall, we like our position in the market. The way I see it is we still have to see how the full detailed safety data look for the TYK2 product given that it is part of the JAK family. And it took 6 years and over 200,000 patients for us to understand the [ Zelgen ] safety profile. So I think there's a lot still to be understood here but not necessarily the safety and efficacy of Otezla."

Thanks, Mike. Both great questions. I think our anticipation is that at meetings right after the second half -- right into the start of the second half of the year, we'll start to see some of the cohort data that we outlined, MEK and then both EGFR antibody and small molecule inhibitor combinations. And you can probably see those come out sequentially over the second half of the year as we accumulate data. I would say that the combination therapy programs are moving along quite rapidly. And as we mentioned, we've opened some new triplet combinations. So I feel very good about where we are in the status of combination regimens. 
In terms of the dose comparison study, we've now got long-term data from both our Phase I trial as well as the Phase II trial, updated target coverage, information, pharmacokinetics as well as, of course, efficacy and safety data. And based on modeling, we wondered could we achieve adequate target coverage at 2 50 and preserve potentially the same efficacy profile that we've seen at 960 milligrams. And so that's just a question that we're going to ask. It's quite common to continue dose exploration in oncology molecules. And I would view this as par for the course. We are very pleased with the tolerability profile. And as you pointed out, at 960 milligrams, we've had an outstanding experience. In fact, this is one of the best tolerated drugs that I've been involved with in 30 years in oncology drug development. And that's not really what a driver is here, but can we potentially get by with efficacy at a lower 240-milligram dose and enhance the patient experience."

As we noted, we completed enrollment in what's a robust Phase II trial that actually completed enrollment ahead of schedule. And what we'll be looking for as we unveil those data, Jay, are, first of all, longer-term follow-up, meaning sufficient long-term suppression of Lp(a) levels. And our targets would be in the range of the Phase I data that we presented last November at the American Heart Association meeting and then, of course, additional safety data. And of course, we are exploring different dose levels as is pretty much standard in a program like this. And so this would be in part for dose selection for Phase III going forward. We are very actively engaged already in Phase III planning and what the design of that sort of trial may look like. Based on the data that we've seen to date, one of our goals may be relatively infrequent dosing given the duration of effect that we observed in the Phase I trial, and that's one thing that we'll be taking a close look at as well in Phase II."

We are pleased obviously with the quarter for Repatha, and it's been a bit of a journey getting here and trying to ensure that patients have affordable access to Repatha, particularly in Medicare Part D, as you point out. I would say that we are anticipating -- with one exception, we are anticipating relatively stable net price for the remainder of the year. And the exception that I'm pointing out is that as we expand our penetration of Medicare Part D, we will have some drag on our net price as a function of patients entering and staying in the doughnut hole for a period of time. So that's the one downside of helping patients in Medicare Part D. There is still a coverage gap in that benefit. And of course, the -- given the durability of treatment and the chronic nature of Repatha, they can be in that coverage gap for quite a bit. So we do have more exposure to the doughnut hole over time. But as you could tell from the first quarter, we were more than able to offset that small drag on net price. And we anticipate that we'll continue to penetrate that patient population given the very strong payer coverage we have there with -- between commercial and Medicare, we've got over 80% covered lives for this important product. And there are still millions of patients out there who are suboptimally treated for their hyperlipidemia given that they're at very high risk of cardiovascular events.

In regards to the Phase III trial, as you note, we changed the powering to really -- we have good power on the progression-free survival endpoint. That was done in concert with regulators. We will be able to take a look at overall survival. The power will be somewhat reduced in terms of the overall survival endpoint.

And Alethia, as I mentioned earlier in response to the question on the TYK2 data that were recently presented, we -- as I've mentioned in the past, we have begun primary care promotion for Otezla in the currently labeled mild to moderate patient population and have seen good response there in terms of uptake with 11% TRx year-on-year performance for the quarter. We're pretty pleased with that evolution. 
What we are seeing is a slowdown in the psoriasis patient population in the newly diagnosed patient population, in particular. And we think this is a direct impact of COVID, causing patients with psoriasis not to see their dermatologist starting really at the beginning of the pandemic. But what's happened is the cumulative effect of this is starting now to impact the patients that have passed through some of the topical options, and we depend on bio naive patients for our growth. So we are definitely a prebiologic option for dermatologists. So we are watching that closely, and we think that, that could continue to create some softness in the prebiologic psoriasis patient market opportunity into Q2 with recovery thereafter because we are seeing much more patient volume in dermatology offices in March and into April. So we think that things are recovering, but it'll take a while for that cumulative effect of new patient softness to work its way through the market. 
In terms of overall positioning in the market, we continue to think that our safety and efficacy profile is a very attractive option for patients and dermatologists as that first systemic agent prebiologic. And I think really, these days in rheumatology and dermatology, physicians are much more aware of the different categories of options that they have and the different profiles of the different classes of drug. And I think that with recent data in the JAK category, there'll be some speculation and some hesitancy to use a product like the TYK2 as a first bio naive option to treat patients."

So the question for me, which is a follow-up to some of sotorasib questions, is really -- maybe since people have been asking about fairly specific things, I think what everyone is trying to analyze in some of the updates if we're really only getting longer-term follow-up on your pivotal data set at ASCO is what's the team's view right now of the ability to move sotorasib into the front-line setting in lung. A lot of us had thought that you would need a combination -- successful combination with PD-1 to move in the front-line setting. Obviously, we haven't seen you guys start a pivotal data set, and you just said it might take longer to figure out that algorithm. Alternatively, you go down the SHIP2 pathway. Do you, one, have a time line for showing us SHIP2 combination data? And two, is there an alternative path for getting sotorasib into the front line lung setting that we should be thinking about that we might be missing on this call right now?"

SHIP2, I would also consider an additional hit on the pathway and would also fall into that grouping. So I think we'll be guided by emerging data, but all of those would be potential avenues into earlier lines of therapy, in addition, also potentially avenues into other indications such as colorectal cancer and some of the other solid tumors where G12C mutations occur."

We've had a busy start to 2021 and a first quarter that's something of a mere image to what we experienced a year ago. Last year, if you recall, we came out of the gate with a very strong January and February and then started to really feel the impact of the pandemic in March. This year, especially in the U.S., it was almost the reverse. We felt the impact of the pandemic in January and February, and we began to see a recovery in March, a trend that seems to be holding in April as well.  
Setting aside the pandemic, we executed effectively in the first quarter. And this is reflected in the strong competitive performance of our brands globally, our strong biosimilars showing, the rapid progress of our lead pipeline molecules and the addition of an attractive Phase III-ready molecule in oncology. Altogether, we remain confident in our full year outlook.  
We're fortunate to have a diverse portfolio of newer products that continue to show strong volume growth. Repatha, for example, delivered 36% volume growth in the first quarter. It remains the clear leader of the PCSK9 market globally and will soon reach the milestone of 1 million patients served.  
We're also the global leader in bone health with Prolia and EVENITY, generating double-digit volume in the quarter. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is annualizing above the $2 billion mark, and I would remind you that we have 3 additional biosimilars in Phase III development and look forward to a flow of new launch opportunities for these and AMGEVITA over the next few years.  
As we've shared with you many times in the past, we're active in business development, looking to complement our internally developed innovation with compelling external opportunities, and our recent acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics is a good example of that.  
As you know, one of the molecules we acquired in that deal, bemarituzumab, was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA as a first-line therapy for a subset of patients with gastric cancer. More than 1 million new gastric cancer cases are diagnosed annually, and the disease is particularly prevalent in the Asia Pacific region, which we've said previously will account for approximately 25% of our growth over the next decade. Bemarituzumab is now our third late-stage clinical medicine to be granted breakthrough therapy status joining sotorasib for which the trade name LUMAKRAS has now been provisionally approved for use in the U.S. And tezepelumab also has earned that breakthrough therapy distinction.  
With a strong balance sheet, healthy cash flows and our proven ability to integrate, we'll continue to look for external opportunities that strengthen us in our stated areas of focus.  
Before I turn things over to our CFO, Peter Griffith, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering results for our stakeholders. I look forward to our Q&A session a little later in our call. But for now, over to you, Peter."

Let me first confirm our predictable consistent capital allocation hierarch",1025,"Thank you, Bob. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on the strong fundamentals of the business and further to reaffirm our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. 
Let me first confirm our predictable consistent capital allocation hierarchy as seen in our Q1 activity. It always begins with investing in internal innovation. LUMAKRAS and tezepelumab, both internally discovered and each branded breakthrough therapy designation, are excellent examples of this. We also patiently pursue external business development opportunities that clear our hurdle rate and that are consistent with our areas of therapeutic focus in which we are confident of integrating into Amgen efficiently and effectively on a timely basis. We allocated $2 billion of our shareholders' capital to the Five Prime acquisition in the second quarter and have committed additional R&D funding to pursue other indications for the lead molecule bema.
Our capital expenditures remain a high priority, including investments in our industry-leading protein manufacturing, our ESG initiatives, including enabling carbon neutrality by 2027 and digitization imperatives. We continue to return capital to our shareholders. First, we paid dividends of $1.76 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from 2020. This year marks our 11th year of dividends with meaningful increases in each of those years. Second, we repurchased 3.7 million shares in the first quarter at a cost of roughly $865 million. Finally, our capital allocation hierarchy always builds on our efficient capital structure, which results in an optimal weighted average cost of capital.  
Now I will briefly walk through our first quarter financial results. Recall that in 2021, we are now comparing to our recast 2020 results that exclude the impact of fair value adjustments to equity investments that were historically included in non-GAAP OI&E. In Q1, revenues decreased 4%. Historically, first quarter sales have been the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year. As we entered 2021, we knew that COVID would likely introduce some variability. And as the quarter progressed, and we saw a continuing cumulative effect of COVID cases on prescribing patterns, we anticipated that Q1 would be more negatively impacted, which led us to disclose in March that it would be moderately below 2020's percentage of the full year.  
First quarter sales benefited from 4% volume growth. Looking back to Q1 of 2020, we recorded approximately $150 million of favorable changes to estimated sales deduction, creating a negative impact on year-over-year growth comparisons in Q1 2021. As we get underway with the second quarter, we expect there to be some continuing cumulative COVID impacts. While we expect to see improvements in the rate of recovery, that recovery will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year.  
Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter increased 2% year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Effective Q2 2021, cost of sales will increase as a percent of product sales in connection with our first shipments of antibody to Lilly. Recall that revenue from shipments of these antibodies will be recorded in other revenues. For the full year, we expect R&D spend will increase as our innovative pipeline continues to progress, which now includes bema from the Five Prime acquisition as well as the Rodeo acquisition. And for the full year, we expect SG&A spend to decline. We continue our focus on digitization imperatives.  
Non-GAAP OI&E was a net $375 million expense in Q1. This is unfavorable by $79 million on a year-over-year basis due to the recording of our portion of BeiGene's loss this quarter. Recall the recognition of BeiGene's results did not start until Q2 2020.  
The effects year-over-year of the adjustments in sales deductions, combined with the recognition of the BeiGene results, totaled about $0.29 and decreased EPS on a comparison basis for Q1 '21 and explain a large portion of the 12% decline in EPS year-over-year.  
Now turning to the outlook for the business for 2021. Based on underlying market dynamics and our investment plan, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance with a revenue range of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion and a non-GAAP EPS range of $16 to $17. Important additional points to consider as you model the remainder of 2021. 
We are providing more specific quarter-over-quarter guidance given the unprecedented continuing cumulative COVID impacts on the operating environment, but we do not expect to provide such guidance on an ongoing basis. We see the recovery from COVID-19 more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. And for the second quarter, we expect total revenues to grow between 7% and 10% sequentially from the first quarter. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to increase by about 7% over last year, with an operating margin of roughly 50%, which includes operating expenses for Five Prime and Rodeo. 
Historically, the Q2 quarter-over-quarter operating expense increase is about 10%. But in the second quarter this year, we expect quarter-over-quarter operating expenses to increase in the mid-teens percentage range, reflecting the impact of our Lilly COVID-19 antibody manufacturing agreement, investments for growth, including the Five Prime acquisition as well as increasing activity levels, including launch preparations.  
For the full year, we continue to anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be a net expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Our capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at $900 million. And based on our confidence in the long-range outlook of the business, we are raising the upper end of our share repurchase range to $5 billion for 2021 versus prior guidance of $4 billion. So our range for share repurchases in 2021 is now $3 billion to $5 billion. Additionally, we're updating our non-GAAP tax rate guidance to 13.5% to 14.5% versus prior guidance of 13% to 14%.  
My confidence is strong in the long-term outlook for Amgen given the strength of the business and the strength of our outstanding and dedicated team of 23,000-plus colleagues that deliver every day to patients and also deliver long-term growth to our shareholders.  
This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Murdo. Murdo?"

Net selling price declined 7%, and the year-over-year comparison",1221,"Thanks, Peter. First quarter product sales declined 5% year-over-year. Volumes grew 4% driven by double-digit growth for a number of products, including Prolia, Repatha, MVASI and KANJINTI. Net selling price declined 7%, and the year-over-year comparison was negatively affected by 2% due to a benefit in Q1 2020 from approximately $150 million of changes to estimated sales deductions that did not reoccur to the same magnitude in Q1 of 2021.  
In the first quarter, the cumulative effect of the COVID pandemic on missed patient visits and diagnoses impacted our business. January and February were clearly affected by post-holiday COVID spikes, and March showed demand improvement across most brands, which has continued into April. Despite the impact of the pandemic, our teams have found solutions to address the continuity of care, stabilizing our continuing patient volume. We also saw improvement in customer-facing execution throughout the quarter across all communication channels, including face-to-face and virtual activities. We expect some COVID-19-related disruptions still in the second quarter with steady recovery thereafter.  
I'll now review some product details, beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia grew 16% year-over-year, recording over $500 million of U.S. sales in the U.S. for the first time. As a majority of osteoporosis patients in the U.S. have been vaccinated and diagnosis rates are at approximately 90% to pre-COVID-19 levels, we're confident in Prolia's continued growth in 2021. EVENITY sales increased 7% year-over-year driven by strong volume growth. Given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of postmenopausal women, EVENITY provides an excellent therapy to build bone first, which should then be followed by treatment with Prolia. 
Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year to a quarterly sales record of $286 million driven by 36% volume growth, and we maintain global leadership in the PCSK9 class. Sales outside the U.S. grew by 40% driven by strong patient demand.  
In the U.S., we continue to see strength in new patient starts with new-to-brand prescriptions growing 54% quarter-over-quarter helped by favorable pharmacy benefit manager formulary changes. U.S. volume growth demonstrates that we've made good progress against our strategy to provide Repatha at an affordable price to patients, particularly those with Medicare Part D coverage. This acceleration in Medicare Part D growth has increased our exposure to the so-called doughnut hole, which creates some negative impact on overall net price.  
We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients.  
Next to Aimovig, which remains the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class. Aimovig volumes grew 20% year-over-year in the first quarter with a 45% average total prescription share and 38% average new-to-brand prescription share. Year-over-year net selling price declined, primarily driven by increased rebates to maintain patient access. Unfortunately, millions of patients suffering from migraine are sub-optimally treated with older, less effective therapies. Given the head-to-head data we've generated showing Aimovig's superiority against topiramate, we're confident we can help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine.  
Turning to our inflammation portfolio where Otezla has demonstrated a robust safety and efficacy profile with over 6 years of real-world experience in market with more than 500,000 patients treated globally. Enbrel similarly has served millions of patients globally since 1998. Otezla sales were $476 million in the quarter. Volume growth was 9%, driven primarily by 11% total prescription growth in the U.S. Otezla remains the market-leading branded systemic medication for psoriasis with an approximately 30% share of first-line treatment. However, new-to-brand prescription volume remained flat as COVID-19 continued to suppress the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis patients. 
Year-over-year growth was also negatively impacted given pandemic-related inventory stocking in Q1 of 2020. Otezla has more than 90% commercial payer coverage in the U.S. without requiring a biological step and is an affordable, safe and efficacious option for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We see attractive growth opportunities for Otezla as the pandemic recovery progresses. In addition, geographic expansion and the anticipated approval later this year of the mild to moderate psoriasis indication will contribute to future Otezla growth.  
In 2021, year-over-year comparisons for Enbrel are adversely impacted by $255 million of favorable estimated sales deductions that were recorded in 2020, $115 million of which were in Q1 of 2020. In the quarter, Enbrel sales decreased 20% year-over-year with declines in both unit volume and net selling price. Moving forward, we expect volume and net price trends to continue.  
Parsabiv sales decreased 55% year-over-year driven by 65% volume declines. With Parsabiv inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundle in the U.S., we have seen dialysis clinics quickly implement new treatment protocols, switching patients from Parsabiv to generic cinacalcet.  
Switching to biosimilars. Q1 sales were $570 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe for AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, where we saw average shares of 50% and 43%, respectively, in Q1. For the remainder of the year, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition. Longer term, growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products to new markets and launches of additional biosimilar molecules such as AMGEVITA in the U.S. and biosimilars for SOLIRIS, STELARA and EYLEA. 
In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting G-CSF, with 54% share of volume in the quarter. In Q1, we surpassed 1 million patients who, with the help of Onpro, were able to receive their G-CSF treatment while reducing the need to return to their doctor's office or other side of care for administration. Consistent with recent trends, Neulasta's U.S. average selling price declined 30% on a year-over-year basis, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition. 
XGEVA sales decreased 3% year-over-year for the first quarter as volume growth in Asia was offset by lower net selling price in that region. U.S. unit volumes declined year-over-year driven by demand impacts in January and February, with recovery beginning in March and into April. 
KYPROLIS sales decreased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter as the pandemic has suppressed the number of new patients starting treatment for multiple myeloma. Moving forward, we expect promotion to drive growth in second line and beyond as a result of our launch of the combination indication of KYPROLIS and DARZALEX plus dexamethasone or DKD. The combination of KYPROLIS with SARCLISA and dexamethasone, or Isa-Kd ,was also approved in the quarter.
As Bob mentioned, our team is ready to launch sotorasib or LUMAKRAS upon approval, and we are excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. We've already launched our biomarker assist program, which removes access barriers to testing and helps appropriate patients without a pocket costs. And we're also preparing for the launch of tezepelumab with our partner, AstraZeneca, and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the more than 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our Q1 execution given the pandemic-related disruption of new patient diagnoses and treatment, and we'll continue our focused execution during Q2 and are projecting recovery over the second half of the year. 
With that, I'll turn it to Dave."

The integr",766,"Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with 2 new programs that are strong strategic fits within our portfolio. 
First, we are excited to welcome our new colleagues from Five Prime therapeutics and begin work on bemarituzumab. The integration is going well, and we have hit the ground running with Phase III planning activities. As Bob mentioned, we received breakthrough therapy designation from FDA and look forward to discussions with regulators on the development program, including Phase III in the near future. We will also investigate bemarituzumab in other indications where FGFR2b may play a role, including squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and we'll have more to say on the entire development program as those plans are finalized. 
In inflammation, I would like to highlight our acquisition of Rodeo Therapeutics and their 15 prostaglandin dehydrogenase program, which was motivated by compelling preclinical data from Rodeo and valuable insights from deCODE. This is a nice illustration of our use of human genetic data to inform drug discovery and development. 
The LUMAKRAS program continues to advance with several regulatory milestones in the first quarter, including global submissions for advanced non-small cell lung cancer and a priority review from FDA with a regulatory action date of August 16. We are having productive interactions with the FDA and multiple other regulatory agencies that will include Japan with today's anticipated submission, and we look forward to making LUMAKRAS available to patients as soon as possible. We are also pleased to receive temporary authorization for use status in France. This designation is to promote fast access to innovative medicines before marketing authorization and conventional access, and we have received a large number of requests. 
In the clinical development program, we completed enrollment in the Phase III study versus docetaxel in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Based on the overall efficacy and safety profile of LUMAKRAS and discussions with regulators we reduced the sample size in this study while maintaining appropriate statistical power to assess the progression-free survival primary end point. The time lines of the study have not changed as the primary endpoint remains event-driven. 
While we have demonstrated that the 960 milligram dose is safe and efficacious in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, we continue to explore different doses and regimens as is common in oncology drug development. As part of this effort, we are initiating a new cohort to determine whether a once-daily oral dose of 240 milligrams maintains the safety and efficacy profile of the 960-milligram dose in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Should a lower dose is safe and efficacious as 960 milligrams, it may further enhance the patient experience with once-daily LUMAKRAS. We expect the results from this study in late 2022 or early 2023 and do not expect any impact on the time lines of our ongoing priority review. 
We also continue to make good progress in evaluating combination regimens. Efficacy cohorts are underway for our MEK inhibitor, EGFR antibody and oral EGFR inhibitor combinations, and we expect to present updates on these regimens at medical meetings in the second half of the year. We continue to evaluate doses and regimens to find the optimal options for patients in our other combinations, including PD-1 and SHIP2. 
Finally, we are initiating triplet cohorts in colorectal cancer of LUMAKRAS with standard of care chemotherapy and either an anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF antibody. 
In our BiTE programs, we have initiated several new studies, including new indications for AMG 160, targeting PSMA in non-small cell lung cancer and AMG 757, targeting DLL3, now also being investigated in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Details on these and other development programs, including small molecules, can be found in our press release. 
Turning to tezepelumab. Developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca, the Phase III NAVIGATOR data were well received by clinicians, and additional analyses will be presented at the American Thoracic Society Meeting in May. We remain on track to submit regulatory filings this quarter and believe the data support tezepelumab as a first-line biologic therapy for a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We are also investigating other indications with Phase II studies in COPD and chronic spontaneous urticaria and, most recently, a Phase III study for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 
Finally, on Otezla, we submitted a supplemental new drug application to FDA based on the Phase III ADVANCE study in mild to moderate psoriasis. The positive results from ADVANCE were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology, or AAD, meeting a few days ago. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our staff for continuing to deliver for patients. Bob?"

The first thing I would just reiterate is that we anticipated that the Duke data would indeed show what they did show. And we assume that in the model that we put together for the transaction, and we've assumed that for the balance of this year. 
What I would say is that we continue to believe that Otezla is really ideally positioned in the first-line prebiologic psoriasis market. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've been on the market for 6 years now. We have in-market cumulative patient experience with over 500,000 individuals globally. We have excellent commercial and payer coverage at over 90% of covered lives. And we continue to make really good progress, holding a 30% share in the market with really outstanding customer-facing capabilities. 
The other thing that we, of course, look at is positioning in the market and how that holds up against not just Duke but other competitors. And we think that we really are the first kind of option prebiologic post-topical. And dermatologists have become very comfortable using Otezla that way. Payer coverage is consistent with that position in the market. And with the mild -- pending mild to moderate indication data, which were presented at the same AAD meeting, which look quite compelling, we expect to be able to expand our utilization of Otezla and psoriasis population in the milder patient type. 
So overall, we like our position in the market. The way I see it is we still have to see how the full detailed safety data look for the TYK2 product given that it is part of the JAK family. And it took 6 years and over 200,000 patients for us to understand the Zelgen safety profile. So I think there's a lot still to be understood here but not necessarily the safety and efficacy of Otezla."

I think our anticipation is that at meetings right after the second half -- right into the start of the second half of the year, we'll start to see some of the cohort data that we outlined, MEK and then both EGFR antibody and small molecule inhibitor combinations. And you can probably see those come out sequentially over the second half of the year as we accumulate data. I would say that the combination therapy programs are moving along quite rapidly. And as we mentioned, we've opened some new triplet combinations. So I feel very good about where we are in the status of combination regimens. 
In terms of the dose comparison study, we've now got long-term data from both our Phase I trial as well as the Phase II trial, updated target coverage, information, pharmacokinetics as well as, of course, efficacy and safety data. And based on modeling, we wondered could we achieve adequate target coverage at 250 and preserve potentially the same efficacy profile that we've seen at 960 milligrams. And so that's just a question that we're going to ask. It's quite common to continue dose exploration in oncology molecules. And I would view this as par for the course. 
We are very pleased with the tolerability profile. And as you pointed out, at 960 milligrams, we've had an outstanding experience. In fact, this is one of the best tolerated drugs that I've been involved with in 30 years in oncology drug development. And that's not really what a driver is here, but can we potentially get by with efficacy at a lower 240-milligram dose and enhance the patient experience?"

And our targets would be in the range of the Phase I data that we presented last November at the American Heart Association meeting and then, of course, additional safety data. And of course, we are exploring different dose levels as is pretty much standard in a program like this. And so this would be in part for dose selection for Phase III going forward. We are very actively engaged already in Phase III planning and what the design of that sort of trial may look like. Based on the data that we've seen to date, one of our goals may be relatively infrequent dosing given the duration of effect that we observed in the Phase I trial, and that's one thing that we'll be taking a close look at as well in Phase II."

I would say that we are anticipating -- with one exception, we are anticipating relatively stable net price for the remainder of the year. And the exception that I'm pointing out is that as we expand our penetration of Medicare Part D, we will have some drag on our net price as a function of patients entering and staying in the doughnut hole for a period of time. So that's the one downside of helping patients in Medicare Part D. 
There is still a coverage gap in that benefit. And of course, the -- given the durability of treatment and the chronic nature of Repatha, they can be in that coverage gap for quite a bit. So we do have more exposure to the doughnut hole over time. But as you could tell from the first quarter, we were more than able to offset that small drag on net price. And we anticipate that we'll continue to penetrate that patient population given the very strong payer coverage we have there with -- between commercial and Medicare, we've got over 80% covered lives for this important product. 
And there are still millions of patients out there who are sub-optimally treated for their hyperlipidemia given that they're at very high risk of cardiovascular events. So -- and globally, we're seeing some really strong performance in Europe, in the Americas.

In regards to the Phase III trial, as you note, we changed the powering to really -- we have good power on the progression-free survival end point. That was done in concert with regulators. We will be able to take a look at overall survival. The power will be somewhat reduced in terms of the overall survival end point.

What you know and what we experienced probably more than some of our peer companies in the first quarter given the nature of our portfolio is more net negative price evolution because of patients renewing in their benefits and going through benefit reverification and hitting their kind of out-of-pocket resets. 
And so our co-pay assistance programs have more drag. We did activate more payer access at the end of last year into this. So we did have, on some brands, some increased payer coverage at the cost of some net price negative evolution.

And Alethia, as I mentioned earlier in response to the question on the TYK2 data that were recently presented, we -- as I've mentioned in the past, we have begun primary care promotion for Otezla in the currently labeled mild to moderate patient population and have seen good response there in terms of uptake with 11% TRx year-on-year performance for the quarter. We're pretty pleased with that evolution. 
What we are seeing is a slowdown in the psoriasis patient population in the newly diagnosed patient population, in particular. And we think this is a direct impact of COVID, causing patients with psoriasis not to see their dermatologist starting really at the beginning of the pandemic. But what's happened is the cumulative effect of this is starting now to impact the patients that have passed through some of the topical options, and we depend on bio-naive patients for our growth. So we are definitely a prebiologic option for dermatologists. 
So we are watching that closely, and we think that that could continue to create some softness in the prebiologic psoriasis patient market opportunity into Q2 with recovery thereafter because we are seeing much more patient volume in dermatology offices in March and into April. So we think that things are recovering, but it'll take a while for that cumulative effect of new patient softness to work its way through the market. 
In terms of overall positioning in the market, we continue to think that our safety and efficacy profile is a very attractive option for patients and dermatologists as that first systemic agent prebiologic. And I think really, these days in rheumatology and dermatology, physicians are much more aware of the different categories of options that they have and the different profiles of the different classes of drug. And I think that with recent data in the JAK category, there'll be some speculation and some hesitancy to use a product like the TYK2 as a first bio-naive option to treat patients."

Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. 
Through the first 6 months of the year, Amgen has continued to execute well, driving demand for our current products globally while also paving the way for growth from future products. Total revenues in the second quarter increased 5% over the prior year and 11% over the prior quarter. We achieved this growth despite the lingering effects of COVID-19 and increased competition in many of our therapeutic categories. 
We continue to see strong volume-driven growth from Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and EVENITY and a number of our oncology biosimilar -- or excuse me, oncology medicines as well, all of which address significant health challenges. 
We also saw strong growth in the quarter from our biosimilars, supporting our commitment to deliver value to health care systems around the world. We generated volume growth of 22% outside the United States, and we're particularly encouraged by our progress in the Asia Pacific region where 2 notable approvals in the second quarter should provide additional growth moving forward. 
In China, our partner, BeiGene, secured approval for BLINCYTO and XGEVA in our oncology collaboration there. And in Japan, the approval of Aimovig for migraine marks another important milestone for us in that market. In the U.S., we're excited by the strong launch of LUMAKRAS, which is providing hope to lung cancer patients in need of new treatment options. Very pleased with the enthusiasm LUMAKRAS has generated in the oncology community. 
We're also excited that the FDA granted priority review to tezepelumab, further confirming our belief that it offers significant advantages over currently available treatment alternatives for people with severe asthma, a debilitating disease that affects millions worldwide. 
We've long sought to complement our internal innovation efforts with the best available external innovation. And in the first half of this year, we've executed on several compelling business development transactions, which fits squarely in our stated areas of interest. 
The acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics and our partnership with Kyowa Kirin, for example, have added 2 potential first-in-class Phase III-ready assets in cancer and inflammation, 2 therapeutic categories where there remains high unmet need. 
The acquisition of Teneobio, which Dave will address in a moment, will significantly strengthen our protein engineering capabilities across therapeutic areas. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows will enable us to take advantage of additional business development opportunities like these as they arise. 
All the work we do is focused on advancing our mission to serve patients and to do so in a way that helps to address the many challenges facing society. You may have seen our recently announced plans to invest approximately $1 billion to build 2 new manufacturing facilities, 1 in North Carolina and the other in Ohio, to meet the demand for our medicines. Both facilities will utilize cutting-edge technologies to be much more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional plants, supporting our goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2027. Both plants will also draw from very diverse talent pools as we, along with a number of other large companies that are part of the 1 10 coalition, look to collectively hire 1 million black Americans into well-paying jobs over the next 10 years. You can learn more about our commitment to good corporate citizenship by reading our ESG report, which can be found in the responsibility section of amgen.com. 
Finally, before I turn things over to Murdo, let me thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering strong performance across all aspects of our business.

Second quarter product sales increased 3% year-over-year.

Volumes increased 8% driven by double-digit growth across a number of our products, including Prolia, Repatha and our biosimilar products [indiscernible] and KANJINTI. Our ex-U.S. business grew 18%, with volume growth of 22% year-over-year. 
We continue to see gradual recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Q2 when compared to Q1  2021. Patient visits and lab test procedure trends continue to improve but remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. We remain focused on customer execution. Overall, U.S. field activity improved quarter-over-quarter, reaching 80% of pre-COVID levels. Face-to-face customer interactions are increasing and accounted for 60% of activity during the second quarter. 
Over the course of the pandemic, the cumulative decline in diagnoses has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which we expect will continue to impact our business during the second half of the year. 
Now let me review some product details, beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia increased 24% year-over-year driven primarily by volume growth. In the second quarter, osteoporosis diagnosis rates remained at approximately 90% of prepandemic levels. We remain focused on driving patient growth and are optimistic about Prolia's strength in the second half of the year. 
EVENITY sales increased 30% year-over-year driven by 32% volume growth. In the U.S., sales nearly doubled year-over-year as we saw an acceleration in demand trends driven by new and continuing patients. We believe EVENITY's unique bone-building attributes will continue to drive revenue growth. 
Moving to Repatha, which has reached more than 1 million patients since launch. Repatha sales increased 43% year-over-year driven by 49% volume growth, and we maintained U.S. and global share leadership in the PCSK9 class. 
In the U.S., total volumes grew 37% year-over-year. And outside the U.S., volumes grew 66% year-over-year. The volume growth in the quarter was partially offset by lower net selling price resulting from an increase in Medicare Part D patients receiving Repatha and entering the coverage gap. Looking forward, we expect some ongoing reduction in global net selling price on a sequential basis. Overall, we're confident in our ability to grow Repatha to help more patients at risk of developing a heart attack or stroke. 
Now on to Aimovig, which grew 24% quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net sales declined 16%. Volumes grew 11% but were more than offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. 
In the U.S., Aimovig TRx volume grew 7% year-on-year, and the brand maintained total prescription share leadership among subcutaneous CGRPs. Looking ahead, we see continued rebate pressure as oral CGRPs compete for share in the market. 
To date, more than 0.5 million patients worldwide have been prescribed Aimovig, and we believe Aimovig has significant potential to help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine given the clinical data that will be published soon showing Aimovig superiority versus topiramate. 
Moving to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales were $534 million in the quarter, with 5% volume growth, more than offset by unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. In the U.S., Otezla maintained first-line share leadership in psoriasis. New-to-brand prescription volumes grew 10% year-over-year even as patient visits to dermatologists remained 15% below prepandemic levels. 
The number of new patients who started treatment with Otezla in Q2 was near prepandemic levels, but those gains were largely offset by a lower percentage of 90-day prescription fills and lower prescription refill rates for Otezla. We expect that pandemic recovery in the dermatology segment will progress over the coming quarters. 
Looking forward, we're preparing for the anticipated approval of the mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication in the U.S. later this year and for the launch of Otezla in China. 
Enbrel sales decreased 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower net selling prices and [indiscernible] favorable changes to estimated sales deductions. On a year-over-year basis, volumes declined 1%, supported by Enbrel's long track record of efficacy and safety. 
Turning to biosimilars. Q2 sales were $567 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe for AMGEVITA andin the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI. For the remainder of the year, we expect worldwide biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition. 
Longer term, growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products in new markets and launches of additional biosimilar molecules, such as AMGEVITA in the U.S. and biosimilars for SOLIRIS, STELARA and EYLEA. 
In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF, with 52% volume share in the quarter. Sales declined 18% year-over-year driven by lower net selling price and lower volume. This was partially offset by a $75 million year-over-year benefit from favorable changes in reimbursement mix. 
Neulasta's U.S. average selling price declined 35% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. We expect this trend will continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition. 
KYPROLIS sales increased 11% year-over-year, primarily driven by volume growth and net selling price. Moving forward, we expect growth from KYPROLIS use in combination with CD38 antibodies, including DARZALEX and [indiscernible]. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to comment on our recent launch with [indiscernible], which is off to a strong start with unaided brand awareness increasing 20 points since launch. KRAS testing in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer now stands at 60%, and 46 of the top 50 testing labs now identify KRAS G12C as actionable in their laboratories. We're very pleased with the positive reaction from the oncology community, and we'll be working closely with them to ensure access for patients who can benefit from this breakthrough medicine. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our Q2 execution given the sustained impact of COVID-19 on our business. We closely monitor the course of the pandemic and its impact on patients and physician behavior during the second half of the year. We'll maintain our focus on execution to ensure our medicines continue to reach the patients they can benefit. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Dave."

We made several important advances in R&D last quarter, and I will begin with our acquisition of Teneobio, which will strengthen Amgen's leadership in developing engineered protein-based medicines to treat patients with serious illnesses. There are 3 important components to the acquisition. First, Teneobio's core antibody technology will enable the development of multispecific biologics directed against targets and a wide range of diseases across our key therapeutic areas. Teneobio's antibody platform offers capabilities complementary to our Xeno miles. It is genetically modified to express human IgG molecules comprising only a heavy chain. A small single chain antigen binding VH domains from these molecules are soluble and stable and can be easily strung together like beads on a string to generate multispecific molecules. 
In addition, Teneobio also brings a novel lower affinity CD3 engaging technology that complements our BiTE platform. The availability of a second CD3 engager will allow us to broaden our bispecifics capabilities and enable customization of the T-cell engaging domain, depending on the disease and target. Finally, we are acquiring clinical and preclinical oncology programs directed against high-value targets of interest, which we specifically selected based on our own discovery efforts and target validation. These include a Phase I bispecific antibody for prostate cancer that complements acapatamab, AMG 160, also targeting PSMA, and AMG 509 targeting STEAP1, which was recently granted fast-track designation by the FDA. 
Turning to oncology. We continue to advance LUMAKRAS registration around the globe, with regulatory reviews and progress in multiple jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan. Feedback from the medical community on the LUMAKRAS launch in the U.S. has been overwhelmingly positive, and I've heard personally from oncologists who are excited to have LUMAKRAS available and are heavily screening their patients for KRAS G12C mutations. 
I'm pleased to report that more than 2,000 patients have received LUMAKRAS across more than 1,000 sites and 900 investigators or treating physicians, including to our global early access programs. 
In the LUMAKRAS development program, we continue to advance our broad-based combination efforts. Initial data from our Vectibix combination in colorectal cancer have been accepted for presentation at ESMO in September. And the MEK and oral EGFR combination abstracts will be submitted to a medical meeting in the fourth quarter. 
To expand our LUMAKRAS experience with SHIP2 inhibition, along with our ongoing collaboration with revolution medicines, we have also entered into a collaboration with Novartis for a SHIP2 combination trial. 
Updates from our monotherapy, non-small cell lung cancer study, including additional biomarker analyses as well as data in patients with stable brain metastases, have been accepted for presentation at the World Congress on lung cancer. Recall that we are also investigating LUMAKRAS in patients with active brain metastases. We also plan on initiating a Phase II first-line non-small cell lung cancer study in patients with PD-L1 negative and/or STK 11 mutant tumors in the third quarter. 
In the bemarituzumab program, we are having good discussions with regulators on the Phase III gastric cancer development path and plan to initiate a registrational program by year-end. This will include 2 Phase III trials: one, investigating utility of bemarituzumab in combination with chemotherapy; and the other evaluating the addition of bemarituzumab to chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor. We are also planning a potentially pivotal Phase II study with [indiscernible], AMG 757, our half-life extended BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer, and we look forward to discussing next steps with regulators in the coming weeks. 
I'm also pleased to report that we have completed enrollment in the castrate-resistant prostate cancer expansion cohort for acapatamab or AMG 160. 
In inflammation, continuing our leadership in dermatology, we are working closely with Kyowa Kirin to advance AMG [indiscernible], also known as KHK 4083, a first-in-class [indiscernible] antibody into Phase III for atopic dermatitis. We look forward to the presentation of the Phase II atopic dermatitis data at the annual meeting of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology at the end of September as well as initiating discussions with regulators on our Phase III development plans in the coming months. 
In addition, the FDA accepted the Otezla supplemental filing for mild-to-moderate psoriasis. 
Finally, we and our partners, AstraZeneca, were very pleased that the FDA granted tezepelumab priority review for the treatment of asthma, reflecting significant unmet medical need. 
In closing, I would like to thank the entire organization for continuing to advance important medicines for our patients. Peter?"

I will briefly walk through our second quarter financial results before discussing 2021 guidance. 
The second quarter marked another period of solid performance as we grew volumes 8%, increased investment in both internal and external innovation, and delivered 4% year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth. 
As stated earlier, Q2 revenues at $6.5 billion increased 5% year-over-year. Other revenues at $412 million increased 38% year-over-year, primarily driven by shipments of the COVID-19 antibody therapy to Lilly. We continue to expect full year 2021 other revenues to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. 
Second quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 15% year-over-year as we continue to make investments to drive growth and maximize shareholder value. We expect full year operating expenses, including approximately $200 million of operating expenses related to the Rodeo, Five Prime and Teneobio acquisitions, and also to the Kyowa Kirin collaboration on an absolute basis to increase about 6% to 7% over last year, while delivering a full year operating margin of roughly 50%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 4.1 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 16.9% driven primarily by product mix, including COVID-19 antibody shipments to Lilly as well as profit share and royalties. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Our cost of sales has increased as products with royalties and product share -- profit share payments have increased. 
As a reminder, a few of our products subject to royalties, our Aimovig and biosimilars, such as [indiscernible] and KANJINTI. Those subject to profit sharing arrangements are EVENITY and tezepelumab upon approval and launch. 
Non-GAAP R&D spend increased 11% year-over-year due to investments in bema acquired in Q2 as part of the Five Prime acquisition and increased investments in discovery research. For the full year, we continue to expect non-GAAP R&D spend will increase as we progress our innovative early and late-stage pipeline programs. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to decline. Non-GAAP, other income and expenses were favorable by $146 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to our portion of BeiGene's results, which we record [indiscernible] in arrears. Q1 BeiGene results reflect the upfront payment BeiGene received in connection with the collaboration agreement. We expect our Q3 and Q4 non-GAAP other income and expense to be more in range with our Q1 and expect full year net expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. 
Now turning to the outlook for the business for 2021. We are excited by our pipeline. This innovation is augmented and balanced by the business development that we have announced this year. Based on underlying market dynamics and our investment plans, we are reaffirming our 2020 revenue guidance range of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion and our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $16 to $17, notwithstanding absorbing the roughly $200 million of operating expenses mentioned above related to business development activities, including Five Prime, Rodeo, Teneobio and the Kyowa Kirin collaboration. These ranges reflect uncertainty continuing in the second half of the year related to emerging variants. Patient visits and lab test procedure trends in the United States continue to improve but still remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance remains unchanged at 13.5% to 14.5%. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at $900 million, and our capital expenditures continue to reflect our investments in our manufacturing and related facilities, including improving their environmental footprints, investments in digital technologies throughout our business and increasing ESG investments. 
We expect share repurchases for 2021 to be in the upper range of $3 billion to $5 billion. 
This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A."

In fact, STK11 mutational status may help confer resistance to checkpoint inhibition. So that is the population that we're targeting. Whether this can be potentially registration-enabling or not, I think it's too early to speculate. The FDA has generally been clear that in first-line lung cancer, they wish to see randomized trials. So one would have to anticipate having a pretty spectacular efficacy readout to lead to registration based on a single-arm Phase II trial. Obviously, if we saw compelling data, we would have the appropriate conversations going forward."

So of course, we'll take a look at that to get a better sense in the second half of the year of the event rates, but I would really point to the primary analysis in the first half of next year as the major event. 
And then in first line, as I said, the -- we think that there is significant unmet medical need in the PD-L1 negative, STK11 mutant and/or STK11 mutant population given the relative refractoriness of those tumors to currently available treatments. And so we're very much looking forward to getting that study launch shortly and seeing the data readout. We'll provide guidance on time lines as soon as enrollment is really underway."

But what I'd -- and I'd really like to say, our North Star around this, we always pause and think about our objective is to grow our after-tax cash flows for the enterprise versus targeting specific operating margin or OpEx growth rates. So we're going to continue to make prudent investments that lead to that objective. So I would just note, we're continuing to invest in internal and external innovation. You've seen the fruits of that in the second quarter, the launches of new products, broader digitalization efforts. Secondly, we highlighted our expectation that R&D expenses are going to grow year-over-year as we increase our spend on AMG 160 and 757 in dose expansion. We're going to rapidly advance those assets in prostate and small cell lung cancer. We have 3 biosimilars in Phase III, 3 inflam assets in Phase II. 
Third, I'll just note, Terence, that we're absorbing the upfront costs related to the acquisition of Rodeo as well as the cost of the Five Prime acquisition, our recent collaboration with Kyowa Kirin and our recently announced acquisition of Teneobio, which we do expect to close in the second half of 2021. 
We also plan to rapidly progress these Phase III-ready molecules in development of [indiscernible]. We began seeing higher manufacturing costs in Q2. Those were related to the Lilly COVID antibody efforts. That adds to the OpEx build for the rest of the year, too. But on a year-over-year basis, remember, we're comparing a depressed spend in Q2 and Q3 2020 due to Covet. So at the end of the day, there's any number of financial metrics that we expect to be measured on by our investors and the analysts. And we take pride in knowing that we want to end up really in the top of the group in terms of our operating efficiency. So that's very important to us.

Thanks, Matt. And I'm glad you brought up AMG 592, our IL-2 mutein. Just to remind everyone, this is a molecule designed to enhance the number and function of T regulatory cells, some of the key modulatory cells in the immune system in many autoimmune diseases. The T regulatory axis is out of whack. 
As you mentioned, we anticipate sharing Phase Ib data in lupus at a medical meeting towards the end of the year, and we look forward to being able to share those data with you. In addition, a Phase II trial in lupus is actively enrolling now. And then finally, as you mentioned, Matt, we are launching a study in ulcerative colitis, another autoimmune disorder in which there's quite a bit of evidence of dysregulation of the T reg axis. So I think it's really the Phase II readouts here that will be critical as we accrue those data. As always, we'll look to make sure that we are adding something to what is standardly available. 
In lupus, there remains very large residual unmet medical need. There was an approval within the last day or 2, of course, but only the second drug in 40 years and a very large patient population. They are still requiring active medicines. Ulcerative colitis, particularly for long-term remission, is also an area with substantial unmet medical needs.

I would say throughout the course of last year, we saw a slowdown in the number of bio naive psoriasis patients moving into the market just based on COVID disruption to patient visits. And given that Otezla is an early option in the treatment of psoriasis, we were impacted by that, I would say, more than the biologics, which tend to gain growth from Otezla and from each other. So that slowdown in the new patient diagnosis last year, compounds into our growth rate this year. The good news on quarter is we saw new patient trends tick up. So we did see 10% growth in new patient -- new-to-brand prescriptions in the quarter. However, this was somewhat offset by an increase in the number of patients that switched away from Otezla to another treatment. And we think that, that was pent-up treatment decision-making that didn't happen because patients weren't going to see their dermatologist last year. 
There were some price reductions, mostly related to our co-pay programs, but that's usually a good indication of new patients starting. So overall, I would say it's primarily COVID impact. With 
respect to other products coming in, I'm not sure how to answer that. What I can say is we continue to like our share position. Our share has held in the share of bio naive psoriasis patients, and we continue to feel optimistic about the growth of Otezla, given the pending indication in mild-to-moderate patients, which should come, hopefully by the end of this year. Teams continue to execute well. Our field execution, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is improving, and we're very focused on making sure we continue to grow Otezla over the long haul."

Thanks for the question, Ronny. I'm hesitant to go out too far. What we are seeing, of course, in inflammation right now is a lot of new entrants, a lot of new mechanisms and a lot of competition, which is increasing the gross to nets, that new entrants have to pay to secure access. We're also seeing increased management by the large national PBMs of national formularies as to which mechanisms get placed in a preferred status versus being held in reserve after patients fail in earlier lines of therapy. So if we take rheumatoid arthritis for, as an example, I do see TNS continuing to entrench themselves in that first-line position and novel mechanisms are likely to be in second and perhaps even third line after patients have failed to have resolution of their RA symptoms or improve their -- the progression of their disease. 
In the biosimilar dynamics, I think we're seeing now the increase in interest from both payers and PBMs and providers given some of the trends that we're seeing with the early biosimilars in the inflammation category. And I do think that interest in biosimilars will increase, and I think that biosimilar penetration of parent molecule or originator molecule will accelerate with new entrants. So we're expecting that to be the condition on the ground by the time we launch AMGEVITA in the U.S. 
But overall, I would just come back to the strength that we have as a company given our portfolio of innovator and originator molecules enhanced with the presence of our biosimilar portfolio. And I think that affords us an opportunity to serve many patients across a host of autoimmune diseases as well as sort of providers, payers and PBMs with a lot of value to deliver to the health care system."

In terms of the MEK or EGFR combinations, as I've said before, in terms of response rate, it's going to vary by line of therapy and indication in terms of what sort of increments that you want to see. But generally, 10%, 20%, 30% relative improvement in response rates and progression-free survival certainly beyond first-line is typically what we would want to see.

We've reached 1 million patients now with Repatha. So quite a milestone. 
The overall dynamic that is dragging price down is really a U.S. Part D patient dynamic as patients enter into the coverage gap or as we sometimes refer to, the doughnut hole. And as we expand our percentage or share of business in the Part D or Medicare Part D business and segment of the market, we will see some net negative price drag quarter-over-quarter. Now it's not going to be as precipitous as the price changes that we've made historically. So our volumes outpacing that, and we will see that drop to the net sales line. So overall good evolution. 
We're also seeing nice growth on Repatha ex U.S. where price is relatively stable year-on-year. So that part of the mix is helping bolster price evolution over time as well. But some slight drag will continue. But again, it's a good sign because it means we're expanding that Medicare pool of patients much more rapidly than we did historically."

Slides are up. Quick reminder that we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation, and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob?"

Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Through the first 6 months of the year, Amgen has continued to execute well, driving demand for our current products globally while also paving the way for growth from future products. 
Total revenues in the second quarter increased 5% over the prior year and 11% over the prior quarter. We achieved this growth despite the lingering effects of COVID-19 and increased competition in many of our therapeutic categories. 
We continue to see strong volume-driven growth from Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and EVENITY and a number of our oncology biosimilar -- or excuse me, oncology medicines as well, all of which address significant health challenges. 
We also saw strong growth in the quarter from our biosimilars, supporting our commitment to deliver value to health care systems around the world. We generated volume growth of 22% outside the United States, and we're particularly encouraged by our progress in the Asia Pacific region where 2 notable approvals in the second quarter should provide additional growth moving forward. 
In China, our partner, BeiGene, secured approval for KYPROLIS, which joins BLINCYTO and XGEVA in our oncology collaboration there. And in Japan, the approval of Aimovig for migraine marks another important milestone for us in that market. In the U.S., we're excited by the strong launch of LUMAKRAS, which is providing hope to lung cancer patients in need of new treatment options. We're very pleased with the enthusiasm LUMAKRAS has generated in the oncology community. 
We're also excited that the FDA granted priority review to tezepelumab, further confirming our belief that it offers significant advantages over currently available treatment alternatives for people with severe asthma, a debilitating disease that affects millions worldwide. 
We've long sought to complement our internal innovation efforts with the best available external innovation. And in the first half of this year, we've executed on several compelling business development transactions, which fits squarely in our stated areas of interest. 
The acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics and our partnership with Kyowa Kirin, for example, have added 2 potential first-in-class Phase III-ready assets in cancer and inflammation, 2 therapeutic categories where there remains high unmet need. 
The acquisition of Teneobio, which Dave will address in a moment, will significantly strengthen our protein engineering capabilities across therapeutic areas. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows will enable us to take advantage of additional business development opportunities like these as they arise. 
All the work we do is focused on advancing our mission to serve patients and to do so in a way that helps to address the many challenges facing society. You may have seen our recently announced plans to invest approximately $1 billion to build 2 new manufacturing facilities, 1 in North Carolina and the other in Ohio, to meet the demand for our medicines. Both facilities will utilize cutting-edge technologies to be much more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional plants, supporting our goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2027. Both plants will also draw from very diverse talent pools as we, along with a number of other large companies that are part of the OneTen Coalition, look to collectively hire 1 million black Americans into well-paying jobs over the next 10 years. You can learn more about our commitment to good corporate citizenship by reading our ESG report, which can be found in the responsibility section of amgen.com. 
Finally, before I turn things over to Murdo, let me thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering strong performance across all aspects of our business. 
Murdo, over to you."

Second quarter product sales increased 3% year-over-year.

Volumes increased 8% driven by double-digit growth across a number of our products, including Prolia, Repatha and our biosimilar products MVASI and KANJINTI. Our ex-U.S. business grew 18%, with volume growth of 22% year-over-year. 
We continue to see gradual recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Q2 when compared to Q1 2021. Patient visits and lab test procedure trends continue to improve but remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. We remain focused on customer execution. Overall, U.S. field activity improved quarter-over-quarter, reaching 80% of pre-COVID levels. Face-to-face customer interactions are increasing and accounted for 60% of activity during the second quarter. 
Over the course of the pandemic, the cumulative decline in diagnoses has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which we expect will continue to impact our business during the second half of the year. 
Now let me review some product details, beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia increased 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by volume growth. In the second quarter, osteoporosis diagnosis rates remained at approximately 90% of prepandemic levels. We remain focused on driving patient growth and are optimistic about Prolia's strength in the second half of the year. 
EVENITY sales increased 30% year-over-year driven by 32% volume growth. In the U.S., sales nearly doubled year-over-year as we saw an acceleration in demand trends driven by new and continuing patients. We believe EVENITY's unique bone-building attributes will continue to drive revenue growth. 
Moving to Repatha, which has reached more than 1 million patients since launch. Repatha sales increased 43% year-over-year driven by 49% volume growth, and we maintained U.S. and global share leadership in the PCSK9 class. 
In the U.S., total volumes grew 37% year-over-year. And outside the U.S., volumes grew 66% year-over-year. The volume growth in the quarter was partially offset by lower net selling price resulting from an increase in Medicare Part D patients receiving Repatha and entering the coverage gap. Looking forward, we expect some ongoing reduction in global net selling price on a sequential basis. Overall, we're confident in our ability to grow Repatha to help more patients at risk of developing a heart attack or stroke. 
Now on to Aimovig, which grew 24% quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net sales declined 16%. Volumes grew 11% but were more than offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. 
In the U.S., Aimovig TRx volume grew 7% year-on-year, and the brand maintained total prescription share leadership among subcutaneous CGRPs. Looking ahead, we see continued rebate pressure as oral CGRPs compete for share in the market. 
To date, more than 0.5 million patients worldwide have been prescribed Aimovig, and we believe Aimovig has significant potential to help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine given the clinical data that will be published soon showing Aimovig superiority versus topiramate. 
Moving to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales were $534 million in the quarter, with 5% volume growth, more than offset by unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. In the U.S., Otezla maintained first-line share leadership in psoriasis. New-to-brand prescription volumes grew 10% year-over-year even as patient visits to dermatologists remained 15% below prepandemic levels. 
The number of new patients who started treatment with Otezla in Q2 was near prepandemic levels, but those gains were largely offset by a lower percentage of 90-day prescription fills and lower prescription refill rates for Otezla. We expect that pandemic recovery in the dermatology segment will progress over the coming quarters. 
Looking forward, we're preparing for the anticipated approval of the mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication in the U.S. later this year and for the launch of Otezla in China. 
Enbrel sales decreased 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower net selling prices and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. On a year-over-year basis, volumes declined 1%, supported by Enbrel's long track record of efficacy and safety. 
Turning to biosimilars. Q2 sales were $567 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe for AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI. For the remainder of the year, we expect worldwide biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition. 
Longer term, growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products in new markets and launches of additional biosimilar molecules, such as AMGEVITA in the U.S. and biosimilars for SOLIRIS, STELARA and EYLEA. 
In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting G-CSF, with 52% volume share in the quarter. Sales declined 18% year-over-year driven by lower net selling price and lower volume. This was partially offset by a $75 million year-over-year benefit from favorable changes in reimbursement mix. 
Neulasta's U.S. average selling price declined 35% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. We expect this trend will continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition. 
KYPROLIS sales increased 11% year-over-year, primarily driven by volume growth and net selling price. Moving forward, we expect growth from KYPROLIS use in combination with CD38 antibodies, including DARZALEX and SARCLISA. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to comment on our recent launch of LUMAKRAS, which is off to a strong start with unaided brand awareness increasing 20 points since launch. KRAS testing in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer now stands at 70%, and 46 of the top 50 testing labs now identify KRAS G12C as actionable in their laboratories. We're very pleased with the positive reaction from the oncology community, and we'll be working closely with them to ensure access for patients who can benefit from this breakthrough medicine. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our Q2 execution given the sustained impact of COVID-19 on our business. We closely monitor the course of the pandemic and its impact on patients and physician behavior during the second half of the year. We'll maintain our focus on execution to ensure our medicines continue to reach the patients they can benefit. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Dave."

We made several important advances in R&D last quarter, and I will begin with our acquisition of Teneobio, which will strengthen Amgen's leadership in developing engineered protein-based medicines to treat patients with serious illnesses. There are 3 important components to the acquisition. First, Teneobio's core antibody technology will enable the development of multispecific biologics directed against targets and a wide range of diseases across our key therapeutic areas. Teneobio's antibody platform offers capabilities complementary to our XenoMouse. It is genetically modified to express human IgG molecules comprising only a heavy chain. A small single chain antigen binding VH domains from these molecules are soluble and stable and can be easily strung together like beads on a string to generate multispecific molecules. 
In addition, Teneobio also brings a novel lower affinity CD3 engaging technology that complements our BiTE platform. The availability of a second CD3 engager will allow us to broaden our bispecifics capabilities and enable customization of the T-cell engaging domain, depending on the disease and target. 
Finally, we are acquiring clinical and preclinical oncology programs directed against high-value targets of interest, which we specifically selected based on our own discovery efforts and target validation. These include a Phase I bispecific antibody for prostate cancer that complements acapatamab, AMG 160, also targeting PSMA, and AMG 509 targeting STEAP1, which was recently granted fast-track designation by the FDA. 
Turning to oncology. We continue to advance LUMAKRAS registration around the globe, with regulatory reviews and progress in multiple jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan. Feedback from the medical community on the LUMAKRAS launch in the U.S. has been overwhelmingly positive, and I've heard personally from oncologists who are excited to have LUMAKRAS available and are heavily screening their patients for KRAS G12C mutations. I'm pleased to report that more than 2,000 patients have received LUMAKRAS across more than 1,000 sites and 900 investigators or treating physicians, including to our global early access programs. 
In the LUMAKRAS development program, we continue to advance our broad-based combination efforts. Initial data from our Vectibix combination in colorectal cancer have been accepted for presentation at ESMO in September and the MEK and oral EGFR combination abstracts will be submitted to a medical meeting in the fourth quarter. 
To expand our LUMAKRAS experience with SHIP2 inhibition, along with our ongoing collaboration with Revolution Medicines, we have also entered into a collaboration with Novartis for a SHIP2 combination trial. 
Updates from our monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer study, including additional biomarker analyses as well as data in patients with stable brain metastases, have been accepted for presentation at the World Congress on Lung Cancer (sic) [ World Conference on Lung Cancer ]. Recall that we are also investigating LUMAKRAS in patients with active brain metastases. We also plan on initiating a Phase II first-line non-small cell lung cancer study in patients with PD-L1 negative and/or STK 11 mutant tumors in the third quarter. 
In the bemarituzumab program, we are having good discussions with regulators on the Phase III gastric cancer development path and plan to initiate a registrational program by year-end. This will include 2 Phase III trials: one investigating utility of bemarituzumab in combination with chemotherapy; and the other evaluating the addition of bemarituzumab to chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor. We are also planning a potentially pivotal Phase II study with  Tarlatamab, AMG 757, our half-life extended BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer, and we look forward to discussing next steps with regulators in the coming weeks. 
I'm also pleased to report that we have completed enrollment in the castrate-resistant prostate cancer expansion cohort for acapatamab or AMG 160. 
In inflammation, continuing our leadership in dermatology, we are working closely with Kyowa Kirin to advance AMG 451, also known as KHK4083, a first-in-class OX-40 antibody into Phase III for atopic dermatitis. We look forward to the presentation of the Phase II atopic dermatitis data at the annual meeting of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology at the end of September as well as initiating discussions with regulators on our Phase III development plans in the coming months. 
In addition, the FDA accepted the Otezla supplemental filing for mild-to-moderate psoriasis. 
Finally, we and our partners, AstraZeneca, were very pleased that the FDA granted tezepelumab priority review for the treatment of asthma, reflecting significant unmet medical need. 
In closing, I would like to thank the entire organization for continuing to advance important medicines for our patients. Peter?"

I will briefly walk through our second quarter financial results before discussing 2021 guidance. 
The second quarter marked another period of solid performance as we grew volumes 8%, increased investment in both internal and external innovation and delivered 4% year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth. 
As stated earlier, Q2 revenues at $6.5 billion increased 5% year-over-year. Other revenues at $412 million increased 38% year-over-year, primarily driven by shipments of the COVID-19 antibody therapy to Lilly. We continue to expect full year 2021 other revenues to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. 
Second quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 15% year-over-year as we continue to make investments to drive growth and maximize shareholder value. We expect full year operating expenses, including approximately $200 million of operating expenses related to the Rodeo, Five Prime and Teneobio acquisitions, and also to the Kyowa Kirin collaboration on an absolute basis to increase about 6% to 7% over last year, while delivering a full year operating margin of roughly 50%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 4.1 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 16.9% driven primarily by product mix, including COVID-19 antibody shipments to Lilly as well as profit share and royalties. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Our cost of sales has increased as products with royalties and product share -- profit share payments have increased. 
As a reminder, a few of our products subject to royalties, our Aimovig and biosimilars, such as MVASI and KANJINTI. Those subject to profit sharing arrangements are EVENITY and tezepelumab upon approval and launch. 
Non-GAAP R&D spend increased 11% year-over-year due to investments in bema, acquired in Q2 as part of the Five Prime acquisition, and increased investments in discovery research. For the full year, we continue to expect non-GAAP R&D spend will increase as we progress our innovative early and late-stage pipeline programs. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to decline. 
Non-GAAP other income and expenses were favorable by $146 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to our portion of BeiGene's results, which we record one quarter in arrears. Q1 BeiGene results reflect the upfront payment BeiGene received in connection with the collaboration agreement. We expect our Q3 and Q4 non-GAAP other income and expense to be more in range with our Q1 and expect full year net expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. 
Now turning to the outlook for the business for 2021. We are excited by our pipeline. This innovation is augmented and balanced by the business development that we have announced this year. Based on underlying market dynamics and our investment plans, we are reaffirming our 2020 revenue guidance range of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion and our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $16 to $17, notwithstanding absorbing the roughly $200 million of operating expenses mentioned above related to business development activities, including Five Prime, Rodeo, Teneobio and the Kyowa Kirin collaboration. These ranges reflect uncertainty continuing in the second half of the year related to emerging variants. Patient visits and lab test procedure trends in the United States continue to improve but still remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance remains unchanged at 13.5% to 14.5%. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at $900 million, and our capital expenditures continue to reflect our investments in our manufacturing and related facilities, including improving their environmental footprints, investments in digital technologies throughout our business and increasing ESG investments. 
We expect share repurchases for 2021 to be in the upper range of $3 billion to $5 billion. 
This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A."

In fact, STK11 mutational status may help confer resistance to checkpoint inhibition. So that is the population that we're targeting. 
Whether this can be potentially registration-enabling or not, I think it's too early to speculate. The FDA has generally been clear that in first-line lung cancer, they wish to see randomized trials. So one would have to anticipate having a pretty spectacular efficacy readout to lead to registration based on a single-arm Phase II trial. Obviously, if we saw compelling data, we would have the appropriate conversations going forward."

And then in first line, as I said, the -- we think that there is significant unmet medical need in the PD-L1 negative, STK11 mutant and/or STK11 mutant population given the relative refractoriness of those tumors to currently available treatments.

We strongly believe the IRS' position is without merit, and we have appropriate tax reserves, and this dispute will take several years to resolve. 
I would like to note, Salim, that Puerto Rico is our flagship manufacturing facility, responsible for the majority of Amgen's global manufacturing. We're proud of our Puerto Rico operations, very proud of them and our colleagues there. We've had a major manufacturing presence in Puerto Rico for about 30 years. We have more than 2,200 highly skilled colleagues in Puerto Rico and who produce very sophisticated biologic medicines for patients all over the world with serious diseases. We've invested nearly $4 billion to expand and modernize those facilities in Puerto Rico, and we're proud to be consistently recognized as one of the island's best and most responsible employers.

But what I'd -- and I'd really like to say, our North Star around this, we always pause and think about our objective is to grow our after-tax cash flows for the enterprise versus targeting specific operating margin or OpEx growth rates. So we're going to continue to make prudent investments that lead to that objective. So I would just note, we're continuing to invest in internal and external innovation. You've seen the fruits of that in the second quarter, the launches of new products, broader digitalization efforts. 
Secondly, we highlighted our expectation that R&D expenses are going to grow year-over-year as we increase our spend on AMG 160 and 757 in dose expansion. We're going to rapidly advance those assets in prostate and small cell lung cancer. We have 3 biosimilars in Phase III, 3 inflam assets in Phase II. 
Third, I'll just note, Terence, that we're absorbing the upfront costs related to the acquisition of Rodeo as well as the cost of the Five Prime acquisition, our recent collaboration with Kyowa Kirin and our recently announced acquisition of Teneobio, which we do expect to close in the second half of 2021. 
We also plan to rapidly progress these Phase III-ready molecules in development of bema and KHK4083. We began seeing higher manufacturing costs in Q2. Those were related to the Lilly COVID antibody efforts, and that adds to the OpEx build for the rest of the year, too. But on a year-over-year basis, remember, we're comparing a depressed spend in Q2 and Q3 2020 due to COVID. So at the end of the day, there's any number of financial metrics that we expect to be measured on by our investors and the analysts. And we take pride in knowing that we want to end up really in the top of the group in terms of our operating efficiency. So that's very important to us. So you can rest assured that we'll continue to stay focused on that."

Just to remind everyone, this is a molecule designed to enhance the number and function of T regulatory cells, some of the key modulatory cells in the immune system. In many autoimmune diseases, the T regulatory axis is out of whack. 
As you mentioned, we anticipate sharing Phase Ib data in lupus at a medical meeting towards the end of the year, and we look forward to being able to share those data with you. In addition, a Phase II trial in lupus is actively enrolling now. And then finally, as you mentioned, Matt, we are launching a study in ulcerative colitis, another autoimmune disorder in which there's quite a bit of evidence of dysregulation of the T reg axis. So I think it's really the Phase II readouts here that will be critical as we accrue those data. As always, we'll look to make sure that we are adding something to what is standardly available. 
In lupus, there remains very large residual unmet medical need. There was an approval within the last day or 2, of course, but only the second drug in 40 years and a very large patient population there still requiring active medicines. Ulcerative colitis, particularly for long-term remission, is also an area with substantial unmet medical need. So it's full speed ahead in the IL-2 mutein program, and we'll look forward to sharing these data with you."

I would say throughout the course of last year, we saw a slowdown in the number of bio naive psoriasis patients moving into the market just based on COVID disruption to patient visits. And given that Otezla is an early option in the treatment of psoriasis, we were impacted by that, I would say, more than the biologics, which tend to gain growth from Otezla and from each other. So that slowdown in the new patient diagnosis last year compounds into our growth rate this year. The good news on quarter is we saw new patient trends tick up. So we did see 10% growth in new patient -- new-to-brand prescriptions in the quarter. However, this was somewhat offset by an increase in the number of patients that switched away from Otezla to another treatment. And we think that, that was pent-up treatment decision-making that didn't happen because patients weren't going to see their dermatologist last year. 
There were some price reductions, mostly related to our co-pay programs, but that's usually a good indication of new patients starting. So overall, I would say it's primarily COVID impact. With respect to other products coming in, I'm not sure how to answer that. What I can say is we continue to like our share position. Our share has held in the share of bio naive psoriasis patients, and we continue to feel optimistic about the growth of Otezla, given the pending indication in mild-to-moderate patients, which should come, hopefully by the end of this year. Teams continue to execute well. Our field execution, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is improving, and we're very focused on making sure we continue to grow Otezla over the long haul."

Thanks for the question, Ronny. I'm hesitant to go out too far. What we are seeing, of course, in inflammation right now is a lot of new entrants, a lot of new mechanisms and a lot of competition, which is increasing the gross to nets that new entrants have to pay to secure access. We're also seeing increased management by the large national PBMs of national formularies as to which mechanisms get placed in a preferred status versus being held in reserve after patients fail in earlier lines of therapy. So if we take rheumatoid arthritis for -- as an example, I do see TNFs continuing to entrench themselves in that first-line position and novel mechanisms are likely to be in second and perhaps even third line after patients have failed to have resolution of their RA symptoms or improve their -- the progression of their disease. 
In the biosimilar dynamics, I think we're seeing now the increase in interest from both payers and PBMs and providers given some of the trends that we're seeing with the early biosimilars in the inflammation category. And I do think that interest in biosimilars will increase, and I think that biosimilar penetration of parent molecule or originator molecule will accelerate with new entrants. So we're expecting that to be the condition on the ground by the time we launch AMGEVITA in the U.S. 
But overall, I would just come back to the strength that we have as a company given our portfolio of innovator and originator molecules enhanced with the presence of our biosimilar portfolio. And I think that affords us an opportunity to serve many patients across a host of autoimmune diseases as well as serve providers, payers and PBMs with a lot of value to deliver to the health care system."

We've reached 1 million patients now with Repatha. So quite a milestone. 
The overall dynamic that is dragging price down is really a U.S. Part D patient dynamic as patients enter into the coverage gap or as we sometimes refer to, the doughnut hole. And as we expand our percentage or share of business in the Part D or Medicare Part D business and segment of the market, we will see some net negative price drag quarter-over-quarter. Now it's not going to be as precipitous as the price changes that we've made historically. So our volume's outpacing that, and we will see that drop to the net sales line. So overall good evolution. 
We're also seeing nice growth on Repatha ex U.S. where price is relatively stable year-on-year. So that part of the mix is helping bolster price evolution over time as well.

Patients often cycle through therapies given the novel mechanism of action you're targeting the OX-40 pathway, we think there is quite a big opportunity to have a real impact in this field. 
As I mentioned, we'll be presenting the Phase IIb data at the end of September at one of the major European dermatology meetings. And I think there, you'll get a sense of our thoughts on dosing and what things may look like going forward. And of course, as we have discussions with regulators, we'll outline our plans on the Phase III program, which will, in all likelihood, be a suite of studies. Let me ask Murdo to comment a little further here."

And durable responses here are vanishingly rare. So that, I think, is, in addition, what really gives us encouragement here. 
As we discuss potential registrational path with the FDA in the coming weeks, I think we'll focus on the patient population. But I think the initial foray is likely to be those later lines of therapy.

Earnings per share for the quarter grew 11%, thanks to disciplined management of our operating expenses.
Shifting to the future. As we begin to see beyond COVID-19, I believe we've set ourselves up well to deliver attractive growth over the long term. By way of example, I'll draw your attention to our immunology and oncology portfolios where we are building on our successful track record through a combination of internally generated innovation and strategic business development, which we expect to contribute to our long-term growth. In inflammation, we're very excited about tezepelumab, a first-in-class treatment for severe asthma that we hope to launch in the U.S. next year. Given the millions of patients for whom existing asthma therapies are inadequate, we believe tezepelumab will be a significant growth driver for us for years to come. This product builds on our many years of success in inflammation, first with Enbrel and now, of course, with Otezla. We remain optimistic about the growth potential of Otezla. And as the next step, we're eagerly awaiting an expanded indication in the U.S. for mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, particularly at a time when concerns have emerged for some potential new competitors.
We also continue to grow Otezla globally with the product now available in over 40 countries, up from 32 countries when we acquired it. Looking a bit further into the future, we expect to bring AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to HUMIRA to the U.S. in 2023. We expect to replicate the success we've had with AMGEVITA in many other markets around the world. We're also enthusiastic about AMG 451, a Phase III-ready potential first-in-class treatment for atopic dermatitis that we're studying with our partners, Kyowa Kirin, as well as a number of Amgen discovered therapies currently in Phase II for lupus and celiac disease.
In oncology, we're happy with the recent launch in the U.S. of LUMAKRAS, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor, which treats non-small cell lung cancer and we look forward to additional approvals and launches in major markets around the world as we roll forward. LUMAKRAS joins a portfolio of medicines already generating some $10 billion a year in sales. Several of these medicines delivered double-digit sales growth in the third quarter, including KYPROLIS, BLINCYTO and MVASI.
Looking ahead, we're excited about the growth potential of several other oncology assets in our pipeline. We've initiated already our first Phase III trial for bemretuzumab, a potential first-in-class molecule to treat gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers. We're also making good progress with several of our internally discovered solid BiTE -- solid tumor BiTE molecules, including 1 for prostate cancer and another for small cell lung cancer. In short, we have a number of products now on the market with plenty of room to grow, more coming over the next several years from our pipeline, a compelling discovery research engine to continuously replenish that pipeline and the wherewithal to take advantage of compelling business development opportunities as they arise. All that gives me confidence in our ability to serve more patients around the world and to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders.
One final note, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to patients and to our business. We were delighted to be named last week by Fortune Magazine as 1 of the 25 best workplaces in the world and that's a reflection of our people and the passion and excellence they bring to their work.

I would like to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from Teneobio, who bring expertise and technologies that will accelerate our innovation.

I would like to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from Teneobio, who bring expertise and technologies that will accelerate our innovation. One of our core areas of interest in research and molecular engineering is the development of multi-specific drugs to make undruggable targets tractable. The Teneobio acquisition, combined with our previous incorporation of new evolution and its DNA encoded library technology provides capabilities to develop both large and small molecule multi-specifics and is a good example of how we are combining internal and external sources of innovation to advance the R&D portfolio.
More than 60% of the molecules in our preclinical pipeline are multi-specifics. We will have more to say as those programs advance. Across R&D, we have focused on building a portfolio of complementary assets in certain disease areas to help drive the long-term growth of the company.
Turning to our clinical programs, I'll highlight a few areas where we have made significant progress and are advancing multiple first-in-class molecules. In oncology, 1 key area of focus is lung cancer. As you'll hear from Murdo, the LUMAKRAS launch is off to an excellent start, and the clinical programs remain on track. We have initiated the Phase II study of LUMAKRAS monotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer for patients with STK11 mutant and/or PD-L1 negative tumors. We continue to expect the top line results from the Phase III confirmatory study versus docetaxel as well as data from our PD-1 combination and ship combination cohorts in the first half of next year.
In the tarlatimab, or AMG 757 BiTE program targeting DLL3 in small cell lung cancer some patients with very advanced disease in the Phase I trial have now had responses lasting over a year, supporting our potentially registrational Phase II study, which we intend to launch by year-end. Finally, in squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we will initiate a Phase Ib study of bemarituzumab directed against FGFR2b in the coming months.
Turning to gastrointestinal cancers. We will begin enrolling a Phase III trial of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in third-line colorectal cancer in the coming weeks. In first-line gastric cancer, we have initiated the first of multiple Phase III studies with bemarituzumab with additional trial starts in the coming months. These studies will address regional differences in the treatment of gastric cancer by exploring bemarituzumab in combination with either backbone chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor. Prostate cancer is another area of focus in oncology. With the acquisition of TeneoBio, we now have 2 distinct bispecific T cell engager technologies targeting PSMA. We anticipate decision enabling data from the expansion cohort in the AMG 160 program in the first half of next year and are now exploring outpatient administration. AMG 340, formerly TNB 585 continues to progress through dose escalation, and we anticipate having informative data by the middle of next year as well, allowing us to determine the best path forward for 1 or both of these PSMA molecules.
Finally, rounding out our prostate cancer portfolio is AMG 509, targeting STEAP1, which is also progressing through dose escalation. We anticipate having decision-making data next year. In inflammation, we spoke at length a few weeks ago about the increasing activity in our portfolio of both innovative and biosimilar molecules, regulatory approvals and launches expected in each of the next several years. In the tezepelumab program, regulatory reviews in severe asthma are proceeding with an FDA action date in the first quarter of 2022. Studies in 3 additional indications are in progress to investigate the utility of tezepelumab across a range of inflammatory diseases.
In skin autoimmune diseases, the FDA review of Otezla for mild to moderate psoriasis continues with a PDUFA date in December. A few weeks ago, we presented results from a Phase II study of AMG 451, KHK4083, a the first-in-class dual action anti-OX40 antibody we are developing for atopic dermatitis in collaboration with Kyowa Kirin. These data were very well received by the medical community as there is a clear need for innovative therapies with differentiated mechanisms of action for these patients. We have had productive regulatory interactions on the program and plan to launch Phase III trials in the first half of 2022.
Finally, we also expect Phase III data from biosimilar candidates to STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS in the inflammation portfolio next year. In cardiometabolic disease, in atherosclerosis, the Repatha Vesalius trial, Phase III outcome study of approximately 12,000 patients at high cardiovascular risk, but without prior myocardial infarction or stroke is expected to complete enrollment in the coming weeks. Olpasiran, a small interfering RNA targeting Lp(a) and our first RNA-based therapy remains on track to read out Phase IIb data by the middle of 2022 and provides a potential complement to Repatha in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, by serving patients whose pathology is not driven by LDL-cholesterol.
In conclusion, with an innovative portfolio where approximately 3/4 of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential and a growing portfolio of biosimilars, we are well positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients and growth for shareholders over the near and long term.

24816,1685022043,2421973,"Amgen Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Third quarter product sales increased 4% year-over-year.

Volumes increased 8% globally, and we had record quarterly sales for several of our key products, including EVENITY, KYPROLIS, XGEVA and Nplate. Our ex U.S. business grew 19% with volume growth of 25% year-over-year. We continue to execute our volume-driven growth strategy and see gradual recovery in our business from the impact of the pandemic. During the early part of Q3, we saw volatility in patient care dynamics due to a surge in COVID-19. As we progressed through the quarter, we saw improvement in patient visits and diagnoses.
Total customer activity improved during Q3. However, face-to-face customer interactions remain below 2019 levels. Now let me review some product details, beginning with our General Medicine portfolio, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha, and Imavic. Overall revenue for our General Medicine portfolio grew 22% year-over-year with 24% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 15% year-over-year, driven by double-digit volume growth. In the third quarter, new and repeat patient demand continued to improve as osteoporosis diagnosis rates reached over 90% of pre-COVID levels. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bond portfolio, had record sales of $149 million for the third quarter, driven by strong volume growth. Given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of postmenopausal women, EVENITY provides an excellent therapy to build bone first.
Moving to Repatha, which remains the global leader in the PCSK9 class. Repatha sales increased 33% year-over-year, driven by 42% volume growth. In the U.S., we saw 64% year-over-year volume growth. This was partially offset by lower net selling price stemming from an increase in the number of Medicare Part D patients receiving Repatha and who entered the doughnut hole. Outside the U.S., volumes grew 24% year-over-year. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients.
Moving to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales increased 13% year-over-year with 7% volume growth. Since its launch, Otezla has been used by over 750,000 patients globally. And in the U.S., it is the leader in bio-naive psoriasis patient share. Otezla has 92% commercial payer coverage and is an affordable, safe and efficacious option for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We are now preparing for the anticipated U.S. approval of the mild to moderate psoriasis indication in the fourth quarter when we will have the opportunity for the first time to promote the use of Otezla in this patient population. Enbrel sales decreased 3% year-over-year, driven by a 2% decline in volume. This is the second straight quarter of slowing volume declines, thanks to Enbrel's long track record of efficacy and safety.
Together with our partner, AstraZeneca, we're preparing for the launch of tezepelumab in the U.S. with an expected PDUFA date in early Q1 2022. Our sales force is fully staffed, trained and has been deployed to provide disease state education. We are actively engaging with payers to ensure access to patients for this breakthrough medicine. We look forward to bringing tezepelumab to the 2.5 million people around the world who live with severe uncontrolled asthma.
Moving to the hematology and oncology business. Sales of our 6 innovative products and our MVASI and KANJINTI biosimilars collectively totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter, growing 12% year-over-year. Several brands had record sales in the quarter, including XGEVA, KYPROLIS, Nplate, and BLINCYTO. Neulasta Onpro maintained 50% volume share in the quarter and continues to be the preferred choice for physicians and patients. The most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 38% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter.
Going forward, we expect increased competition to result in continued net price and volume erosion. Our launch of LUMAKRAS is off to a strong start with revenues of $36 million in Q3 and cumulative sales of $45 million through the end of the third quarter. LUMAKRAS has been prescribed by over 500 oncologists in both academic and community settings. A majority of clinical laboratories have updated their testing reports to reflect KRAS G12C as an actionable mutation and approximately 75% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer are now being tested for the mutation at the time of diagnosis. Having been a part of several lung cancer launches in my career, I'm very pleased with the LUMAKRAS launch uptake in the U.S. thanks to our broad payer access and the positive reaction from the oncology community. Outside the U.S., health authorities have also approved LUMAKRAS in Canada and LUMAKRAS in the U.K. Overall, I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, our record sales across a number of products and are increasing levels of customer activity. And with that, I'll turn it to Peter."
24816,1685022043,2421973,"Amgen Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murdo. I will briefly walk through our third quarter financial results before discussing 2021 guidance.

I will briefly walk through our third quarter financial results before discussing 2021 guidance. Our team's quality of execution during the past 18 challenging months continues to provide us with the strength to make timely prudent investments as we see them in both internal and external innovation that will deliver long-term growth.
Let's now turn to the business. The third quarter marked another period of solid performance with year-over-year revenue growth of 4% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 11%. As Murdo described, strong volume growth continued in the quarter with 8% year-over-year growth driven by Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha, and MVASI. In addition, this quarter includes $147 million of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions previously recorded. In the third quarter last year, the favorable estimated sales deductions were $36 million, resulting in a $111 million year-over-year benefit in this quarter.
Our established products, which include Neulasta, NEUPOGEN, EPOGEN, Aranesp, Parsabiv and Sensipar declined 21% year-over-year, driven by volume declines and lower net selling price. These products will continue to contribute meaningful cash flows to our broader portfolio and also to innovation. We do expect increased competition to result in additional erosion of these established products. Other revenues at $386 million increased 21% year-over-year primarily driven by shipments of the COVID-19 antibody therapy to Lilly. We expect full year 2021 other revenues to be in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.
Third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year as continued focus on execution, productivity and efficiency fueled investments to drive long-term growth, including the third quarter share of the approximately $200 million of operating expenses expected for the full year related to the Rodeo, Five Prime and TeneoBio acquisitions as well as the Kyowa Kirin collaboration. Through focused expense discipline, we now expect full year operating expenses on an absolute basis to increase approximately 3% to 4% over last year inclusive of the approximately $200 million related to these transactions.
We will continue to execute on opportunities to allocate capital to important internal and external innovation opportunities. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 15.8%, driven primarily by product mix including COVID-19 antibody shipments to Lilly. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter decreased 4% year-over-year. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP R&D spend will increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range as we progress our innovative pipeline programs, including the launch of registration-enabling trials in lung and gastric cancer.
Non-GAAP SG&A expense in the quarter decreased 5% and we expect the full year to also decline as we continue our focus on execution efficiency and digitalization. Non-GAAP other income and expense net expenses increased on a year-over-year basis due to increased losses from our 20% share of BeiGene's results recorded under the equity method of accounting 1 quarter in arrears. We expect full year net expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. We have financial flexibility with $12.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet and strong cash flows.
Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1.76 per share, an increase of 10% over last year. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2021. We have invested in internal and external innovation to advance our pipeline in 2021 and continue to set ourselves up well for long-term growth.
Moving to revenue. Based on underlying market dynamics, we are updating our 2021 revenue guidance range to $25.8 billion to $26.2 billion. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $16.50 to $17.10. Our non-GAAP tax rate range is updated to 13.0% to 14.0%. Our capital expenditure guidance remains at $900 million, and our capital expenditures continue to include investments supporting our environmental activities and also support our commitment to attain carbon neutrality. We expect share repurchases for 2021 to be in the upper end of our range of $3 billion to $5 billion. We executed effectively in the third quarter and are well positioned for long-term growth.
Before turning it over to Bob, I'd like to thank and recognize our 24,000 Amgen colleagues around the world for delivering another strong quarter of execution. Bob?"

The first thing I would say is Aimovig continues to be an important product to help patients suffering from migraine. And we continue to believe that there is a large population of migraine sufferers who have yet to be helped by the advent of the CGRP category. Obviously, as the market leaders in the subcutaneous category of CGRP products, we have given up share to the orals as they've come into the market, but they've also expanded the market beyond the preventative setting and into the acute setting. And even the preventative setting has grown with the advent of the oral. So we expect that the market still has quite a bit of growth and headroom for growth. We expect to be able to continue to maintain our leadership share position in total prescriptions. We have over 5 years now of safety and efficacy data in the market. We continue now to have all of the U.S. commercial responsibility for Aimovig given recent work to consolidate what Novartis was previously contributing.
So we've actually increased our neurology presence in the last few months. And then the last piece that we're excited about is we're awaiting our head-to-head superiority data versus topiramate to be published and after which we'll be able to promote that to general neurologists, headache specialists and even the many primary care physicians who are using Aimovig to help their patients who are chronic migraine sufferers. So a bit of headroom. You're right on the oral evolution taking some growth out and also a little bit of net price in the quarter, taking some growth out as well."

Volume growth year-over-year from products, Prolia, Otezla, Repatha, EVENITY biosimilars, competition against the mature products, as I mentioned, but great cash flow producers for us. Look, the sharper recovery we had anticipated early hasn't materialized at the rate we projected, but the recovery continues at a steady but more gradual rate, as Murdo described for you. So we continue to build into guidance, mid-single-digit net price declines in '21. We've got other revenue at 1.5 to 1.7. The increase year-over-year driven primarily by the Lilly manufacturing reimbursement profit share, which began in the second quarter, as we've said. And so those are the dynamics around the top side of the guidance."

So by now looking the retrospectoscope, it's pretty clear that the surge had an impact on the number of patients going to see the doctors and in turn, prescriptions being written. So I don't think we're experiencing anything different from our peers. But at the start of the year, we were hopeful that vaccines and other things might have made us -- enabled us to be further along in saying goodbye to this pandemic than I think we are right now. But again, otherwise, business is performing well and and consistent with where we hope to end the year."

So Repatha in the quarter is more a function of what we've been able to do since lowering the price in terms of increasing our penetration in the Medicare Part D population. So we've seen some really nice growth there. But what happens when you grow in Medicare Part D is you also grow in the number of patients that enter the donut hole. And that's what we're really seeing in Q3, and we expect that to continue in Q4. The good news side of that equation is we're growing nicely in Medicare. We're seeing much less patient abandonment in Medicare, and that should be a compounding source of growth for us on a go-forward basis. But I would expect a pattern of Q3 and Q4 net price drag as a function of the Medicare Part D coverage gap. Unless, of course, that changes in whatever is brewing in D.C. But that's how it's happened right now. On Aimovig, it's a little bit different. It's just -- it's really the annualization of contracted business with PBMs in general. There's been fairly competitive activity there to maintain preferred formulary positions on national PBMs. And we don't have the same amount of volume growth on Aimovig, but we do expect that to be more stable going forward. So overall, I think our major price effects have stabilized, and we're actually now seeing some good top line volume drop to the bottom."

As you know, there is another molecule ahead of us. We have a slightly different mechanism as a small interfering RNA. We like the molecule quite a bit. This is a large population of patients.

So hypothetically speaking, should there be an out-of-pocket cap for patients in Part D introduced in some change in legislation? I think it would help in our portfolio. We've been advocates for changes to Part D in that regard for quite a while, where we do think that the out-of-pocket expenditures and the list price equation for co-pays for patients or disincentives to drug adherence and maybe even for initial fill. So I think products like Repatha, where we are largely a Medicare Part D population, could benefit from out-of-pocket caps. Now it would depend obviously, what that travels with. Does it travel with more commitment from the manufacturer in the catastrophic phase, where we pick up more of the tab. So it needs to be equated with other things that could be in any proposed legislation. But I hope that out-of-pocket caps come into play because I think patients who are in Part D are sometimes treated poorly and are suboptimally treated because of that, and it would improve their affordability.
To the question on the AMGEVITA interchangeability study, we continue to feel very good about our opportunity with AMJEVITA, being in that first wave and potentially alone in the first wave of biosimilar launches to HUMIRA in the U.S. affords us an opportunity to work with payers, work with the PBMs and with providers to establish a leadership position. We look at every parameter of a biosimilar product, and this is experienced from AMGEVITA itself in Europe, but it's also experience from our other biosimilar portfolio in the U.S., and we look at things like latex free, recite free. We look at needle gauge, we look at device. And of course, we look at interchangeability. So while we don't think it's essential, we think it's just another attribute of the product that could augment our success in that launch in 2023. So that's really why we've initiated the trial, Ronny."

And the team has done an excellent job of executing across the payer customers, our provider customers and of course, for patients and I was very proud of what our R&D organization was able to do and the speed at which they brought this product to market, and I feel that the medical and commercial organizations have taken the customer-facing stage and the go-to-market stage of this launch extremely seriously and with a lot of responsibility.
And so far, it's early days, but so far, they've done very, very well. And so I'm pleased with the trajectory. What we're seeing is many academic centers are changing their testing protocols in lung cancer so that everybody knows their KRAS G12C status. Many large community oncology networks have done the same. Now we still have a few large community oncology networks to go. So we will be working on those in the fourth quarter, but I couldn't be more pleased with the way in which we've entered the market. And I think  that bodes well for our ability to establish a strong leadership position and help many, many patients who are unfortunately progressing from first line into second-line disease before competitors come in. It's hugely rewarding to launch a product like this where you hear stories of patients who have been told that their options are limited and that they should sign up for hospice care, coming out of hospice and getting treated with LUMAKRAS with commercial drug and responding.

Now that data, of course, generates drug targets and pathways. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are building extensive capabilities for the development of multi-specific molecules, either small molecules, large molecules or hybrid molecules. About 80% to 85% of the currently validated targets are currently not approachable with existing technologies, and we are building the capability to go after what I think will be a good traction of those undruggable targets.

When we acquired Otezla, I thought it would be a really good add to the portfolio and our strength in immunology, both with dermatology and with rheumatology. And obviously, we had to make a certain set of assumptions about how that product would evolve in our ownership. And so far, I have to say I'm even more pleased with the strength that the product brings to Amgen. We've been successful, as you highlight, in demonstrating the product's efficacy and safety in the mild to moderate patient setting, which is a perfect sweet spot for this product, given the convenience of its oral dosing, given the well demonstrated safety and efficacy of the product.
We also recently had a decision on the patent for Otezla, which definitely helps make it a very strategic product for us, a very important product for the growth of the company. And the fit is just perfect. We have integrated the legacy Celgene team fully into Amgen. We've got both Enbrel and Otezla now being promoted in rheumatology and dermatology. And we've seen volume growth improve in most markedly in the last part of Q3, but that continues into Q4. We didn't plan on a pandemic when we did the transaction, obviously, but we've weathered it well. The team is staying focused, and we are well prepared for the mild-to-moderate launch. We're anticipating a decision on that soon from the FDA. We have the resources available. We have the teams trained. We have an increased footprint in dermatology in anticipation of the approval. And we expect to be able to execute very effectively.
We also have very, very strong payer coverage here. And we think that the majority of these mild to moderate patients, and we're targeting a specific subset. We're targeting those patients that have larger body surface area or very difficult to treat areas with topicals. So that's about a 1.5 million patient population. So it's a large opportunity. But we think that the profile of the product, the price point of the product versus biologics puts us in a very, very strong position to treat these patients. The other thing I would add that we expect to benefit from somewhat more so in the PSA area versus psoriasis, but the safety concerns of the JAKs right now, quite frankly, are helping Otezla and the overall perception of our safety and our efficacy. And I think that might bode well for future competition that's currently in the process, I guess, of being filed with the FDA."

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. It was another solid quarter of growth for Amgen with total revenues rising 4%, driven by volume growth of 8% which reflects the strong global demand for many of our innovative medicines such as Repatha and Prolia as well as for our high-quality biosimilars. Earnings per share for the quarter grew 11%, thanks to disciplined management of our operating expenses.
Shifting to the future. As we begin to see beyond COVID-19, I believe we've set ourselves up well to deliver attractive growth over the long term. By way of example, I'll draw your attention to our immunology and oncology portfolios where we are building on our successful track record through a combination of internally generated innovation and strategic business development, which we expect to contribute to our long-term growth.
In inflammation, we're very excited about tezepelumab, a first-in-class treatment for severe asthma that we hope to launch in the U.S. next year. Given the millions of patients for whom existing asthma therapies are inadequate, we believe tezepelumab will be a significant growth driver for us for years to come. This product builds on our many years of success in inflammation, first with Enbrel and now, of course, with Otezla. We remain optimistic about the growth potential of Otezla. And as the next step, we're eagerly awaiting an expanded indication in the U.S. for mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, particularly at a time when concerns have emerged for some potential new competitors.
We also continue to grow Otezla globally with the product now available in over 40 countries, up from 32 countries when we acquired it. Looking a bit further into the future, we expect to bring AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to HUMIRA to the U.S. in 2023. We expect to replicate the success we've had with AMGEVITA in many other markets around the world. We're also enthusiastic about AMG 451, a Phase III-ready potential first-in-class treatment for atopic dermatitis that we're studying with our partners, Kyowa Kirin, as well as a number of Amgen-discovered therapies currently in Phase II for lupus and celiac disease.
In oncology, we're happy with the recent launch in the U.S. of LUMAKRAS our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor, which treats non-small cell lung cancer and we look forward to additional approvals and launches in major markets around the world as we roll forward. LUMAKRAS joins a portfolio of medicines already generating some $10 billion a year in sales. Several of these medicines delivered double-digit sales growth in the third quarter, including KYPROLIS, BLINCYTO and MVASI.
Looking ahead, we're excited about the growth potential of several other oncology assets in our pipeline. We've initiated already our first Phase III trial for bemarituzumab, a potential first-in-class molecule to treat gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers. We're also making good progress with several of our internally discovered solid BiTE -- solid tumor BiTE molecules, including 1 for prostate cancer and another for small cell lung cancer.
In short, we have a number of products now on the market with plenty of room to grow, more coming over the next several years from our pipeline, a compelling discovery research engine to continuously replenish that pipeline and the wherewithal to take advantage of compelling business development opportunities as they arise. All that gives me confidence in our ability to serve more patients around the world and to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders.
One final note, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to patients and to our business. We were delighted to be named last week by Fortune Magazine as one of the 25 best workplaces in the world and that's a reflection of our people and the passion and excellence they bring to their work.
Dave, let me turn it over to you."

I would like to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from Teneobio, who bring expertise and technologies that will accelerate our innovation.

I would like to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from Teneobio, who bring expertise and technologies that will accelerate our innovation. One of our core areas of interest in research and molecular engineering is the development of multi-specific drugs to make undruggable targets tractable. The Teneobio acquisition, combined with our previous incorporation of Nuevolution and its DNA encoded library technology provides capabilities to develop both large and small molecule multi-specifics and is a good example of how we are combining internal and external sources of innovation to advance the R&D portfolio. More than 60% of the molecules in our preclinical pipeline are multi-specifics. We will have more to say as those programs advance. Across R&D, we have focused on building a portfolio of complementary assets in certain disease areas to help drive the long-term growth of the company.
Turning to our clinical programs, I'll highlight a few areas where we have made significant progress and are advancing multiple first-in-class molecules. In oncology, one key area of focus is lung cancer. As you'll hear from Murdo, the LUMAKRAS launch is off to an excellent start, and the clinical programs remain on track. We have initiated the Phase II study of LUMAKRAS monotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer for patients with STK11 mutant and/or PD-L1 negative tumors. We continue to expect the top line results from the Phase III confirmatory study versus docetaxel as well as data from our PD-1 combination and SHP combination cohorts in the first half of next year.
In the tarlatamab or AMG 757 BiTE program targeting DLL3 in small cell lung cancer, some patients with very advanced disease in the Phase I trial have now had responses lasting over a year, supporting our potentially registrational Phase II study, which we intend to launch by year-end. Finally, in squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we will initiate a Phase Ib study of bemarituzumab directed against FGFR2b in the coming months.
Turning to gastrointestinal cancers. We will begin enrolling a Phase III trial of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in third-line colorectal cancer in the coming weeks. In first-line gastric cancer, we have initiated the first of multiple Phase III studies with bemarituzumab with additional trial starts in the coming months. These studies will address regional differences in the treatment of gastric cancer by exploring bemarituzumab in combination with either backbone chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor.
Prostate cancer is another area of focus in oncology. With the acquisition of Teneobio, we now have 2 distinct BiTE-specific T cell engager technologies targeting PSMA. We anticipate decision enabling data from the expansion cohort in the acapatamab, AMG 160 program, in the first half of next year and are now exploring outpatient administration. AMG 340, formerly TNB-585 continues to progress through dose escalation, and we anticipate having informative data by the middle of next year as well, allowing us to determine the best path forward for one or both of these PSMA molecules. Finally, rounding out our prostate cancer portfolio is AMG 509, targeting STEAP1, which is also progressing through dose escalation. We anticipate having decision-making data next year.
In inflammation, we spoke at length a few weeks ago about the increasing activity in our portfolio of both innovative and biosimilar molecules, regulatory approvals and launches expected in each of the next several years. In the tezepelumab program, regulatory reviews in severe asthma are proceeding with an FDA action date in the first quarter of 2022. Studies in 3 additional indications are in progress to investigate the utility of tezepelumab across a range of inflammatory diseases.
In skin autoimmune diseases, the FDA review of Otezla for mild-to-moderate psoriasis continues with a PDUFA date in December. A few weeks ago, we presented results from a Phase II study of AMG 451, KHK4083, a the first-in-class dual action anti-OX40 antibody we are developing for atopic dermatitis in collaboration with Kyowa Kirin. These data were very well received by the medical community as there is a clear need for innovative therapies with differentiated mechanisms of action for these patients. We have had productive regulatory interactions on the program and plan to launch Phase III trials in the first half of 2022. Finally, we also expect Phase III data from biosimilar candidates to STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS in the inflammation portfolio next year.
In cardiometabolic disease, in atherosclerosis, the Repatha of the VESALIUS trial, Phase III outcome study of approximately 12,000 patients at high cardiovascular risk, but without prior myocardial infarction or stroke is expected to complete enrollment in the coming weeks. Olpasiran, a small interfering RNA targeting Lp(a) and our first RNA-based therapy remains on track to read out Phase IIb data by the middle of 2022 and provides a potential complement to Repatha in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, by serving patients whose pathology is not driven by LDL-cholesterol.
In conclusion, with an innovative portfolio where approximately 3/4 of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential and a growing portfolio of biosimilars, we are well positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients and growth for shareholders over the near and long term.

Third quarter product sales increased 4% year-over-year. Volumes increased 8% globally, and we had record quarterly sales for several of our key products, including EVENITY, KYPROLIS, XGEVA and Nplate. Our ex U.S. business grew 19% with v",783,"Thank you, Dave. Third quarter product sales increased 4% year-over-year. Volumes increased 8% globally, and we had record quarterly sales for several of our key products, including EVENITY, KYPROLIS, XGEVA and Nplate. Our ex U.S. business grew 19% with volume growth of 25% year-over-year. We continue to execute our volume-driven growth strategy and see gradual recovery in our business from the impact of the pandemic. During the early part of Q3, we saw volatility in patient care dynamics due to a surge in COVID-19. As we progressed through the quarter, we saw improvement in patient visits and diagnoses. Total customer activity improved during Q3. However, face-to-face customer interactions remain below 2019 levels.
Now let me review some product details, beginning with our general medicine portfolio, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha, and Aimovig. Overall revenue for our general medicine portfolio grew 22% year-over-year with 24% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 15% year-over-year, driven by double-digit volume growth. In the third quarter, new and repeat patient demand continued to improve as osteoporosis diagnosis rates reached over 90% of pre-COVID levels. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $149 million for the third quarter, driven by strong volume growth. Given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of postmenopausal women, EVENITY provides an excellent therapy to build bone first.
Moving to Repatha, which remains the global leader in the PCSK9 class. Repatha sales increased 33% year-over-year, driven by 42% volume growth. In the U.S., we saw 64% year-over-year volume growth. This was partially offset by lower net selling price stemming from an increase in the number of Medicare Part D patients receiving Repatha and who entered the doughnut hole. Outside the U.S., volumes grew 24% year-over-year. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients.
Moving to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales increased 13% year-over-year with 7% volume growth. Since its launch, Otezla has been used by over 750,000 patients globally. And in the U.S., it is the leader in bio-naive psoriasis patient share. Otezla has 92% commercial payer coverage and is an affordable, safe and efficacious option for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We are now preparing for the anticipated U.S. approval of the mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication in the fourth quarter when we will have the opportunity for the first time to promote the use of Otezla in this patient population. Enbrel sales decreased 3% year-over-year, driven by a 2% decline in volume. This is the second straight quarter of slowing volume declines, thanks to Enbrel's long track record of efficacy and safety.
Together with our partner, AstraZeneca, we're preparing for the launch of tezepelumab in the U.S. with an expected PDUFA date in early Q1 2022. Our sales force is fully staffed, trained and has been deployed to provide disease state education. We are actively engaging with payers to ensure access to patients for this breakthrough medicine. We look forward to bringing tezepelumab to the 2.5 million people around the world who live with severe uncontrolled asthma.
Moving to the hematology and oncology business. Sales of our 6 innovative products and our MVASI and KANJINTI biosimilars collectively totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter, growing 12% year-over-year. Several brands had record sales in the quarter, including XGEVA, KYPROLIS, Nplate, and BLINCYTO. Neulasta Onpro maintained 50% volume share in the quarter and continues to be the preferred choice for physicians and patients. The most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 38% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. Going forward, we expect increased competition to result in continued net price and volume erosion.
Our launch of LUMAKRAS is off to a strong start with revenues of $36 million in Q3 and cumulative sales of $45 million through the end of the third quarter. LUMAKRAS has been prescribed by over 500 oncologists in both academic and community settings. A majority of clinical laboratories have updated their testing reports to reflect KRAS G12C as an actionable mutation and approximately 75% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer are now being tested for the mutation at the time of diagnosis. Having been a part of several lung cancer launches in my career, I'm very pleased with the LUMAKRAS launch uptake in the U.S. Thanks to our broad payer access and the positive reaction from the oncology community. Outside the U.S., health authorities have also approved LUMAKRAS in Canada and LUMAKRAS in the U.K.
Overall, I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, our record sales across a number of products and our increasing levels of customer activity. And with that, I'll turn it to Peter."

I will briefly walk through our third quarter financial results before discussing 2021 guidance. Our team's quality of execution during the past 18 challenging months continues to provide us with the strength to make timely prudent investments as we see them in both internal and external innovation that will deliver long-term growth.
Let's now turn to the business. The third quarter marked another period of solid performance with year-over-year revenue growth of 4% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 11%. As Murdo described, strong volume growth continued in the quarter with 8% year-over-year growth driven by Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and MVASI. In addition, this quarter includes $147 million of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions previously recorded. In the third quarter last year, the favorable estimated sales deductions were $36 million, resulting in a $111 million year-over-year benefit in this quarter.
Our established products, which include Neulasta, NEUPOGEN, EPOGEN, Aranesp, Parsabiv and Sensipar declined 21% year-over-year, driven by volume declines and lower net selling price. These products will continue to contribute meaningful cash flows to our broader portfolio and also to innovation. We do expect increased competition to result in additional erosion of these established products.
Other revenues at $386 million increased 21% year-over-year primarily driven by shipments of the COVID-19 antibody therapy to Lilly. We expect full year 2021 other revenues to be in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.
Third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year as continued focus on execution, productivity and efficiency fueled investments to drive long-term growth, including the third quarter share of the approximately $200 million of operating expenses expected for the full year related to the Rodeo, Five Prime and Teneobio acquisitions as well as the Kyowa Kirin collaboration. Through focused expense discipline, we now expect full year operating expenses on an absolute basis to increase approximately 3% to 4% over last year inclusive of the approximately $200 million related to these transactions. We will continue to execute on opportunities to allocate capital to important internal and external innovation opportunities.
On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 15.8%, driven primarily by product mix including COVID-19 antibody shipments to Lilly. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter decreased 4% year-over-year. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP R&D spend will increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range as we progress our innovative pipeline programs, including the launch of registration-enabling trials in lung and gastric cancer.
Non-GAAP SG&A expense in the quarter decreased 5% and we expect the full year to also decline as we continue our focus on execution efficiency and digitalization. Non-GAAP other income and expense net expenses increased on a year-over-year basis due to increased losses from our 20% share of BeiGene's results recorded under the equity method of accounting 1 quarter in arrears. We expect full year net expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. We have financial flexibility with $12.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet and strong cash flows. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1.76 per share, an increase of 10% over last year.
Turning to the outlook for the business for 2021. We have invested in internal and external innovation to advance our pipeline in 2021 and continue to set ourselves up well for long-term growth. Moving to revenue. Based on underlying market dynamics, we are updating our 2021 revenue guidance range to $25.8 billion to $26.2 billion. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $16.50 to $17.10. Our non-GAAP tax rate range is updated to 13.0% to 14.0%. Our capital expenditure guidance remains at $900 million, and our capital expenditures continue to include investments supporting our environmental activities and also support our commitment to attain carbon neutrality. We expect share repurchases for 2021 to be in the upper end of our range of $3 billion to $5 billion. We executed effectively in the third quarter and are well positioned for long-term growth.
Before turning it over to Bob, I'd like to thank and recognize our 24,000 Amgen colleagues around the world for delivering another strong quarter of execution. Bob?"

Thanks, Chris. The first thing I would say is Aimovig continues to be an important product to help patients suffering from migraine and we continue to believe that there is a large population of migraine sufferers who have yet to be helped by the advent of the CGRP category. Obviously, as the market leaders in the subcutaneous category of CGRP products, we have given up share to the orals as they've come into the market, but they've also expanded the market beyond the preventative setting and into the acute setting. And even the preventative setting has grown with the advent of the oral. So we expect that the market still has quite a bit of growth and headroom for growth. We expect to be able to continue to maintain our leadership share position in total prescriptions. We have over 5 years now of safety and efficacy data in the market. We continue now to have all of the U.S. commercial responsibility for Aimovig given recent work to consolidate what Novartis was previously contributing. So we've actually increased our neurology presence in the last few months.
And then the last piece that we're excited about is we're awaiting our head-to-head superiority data versus topiramate to be published and after which we'll be able to promote that to general neurologists, headache specialists and even the many primary care physicians who are using Aimovig to help their patients who are chronic migraine sufferers. So a bit of headroom. You're right on the oral evolution taking some growth out and also a little bit of net price in the quarter taking some growth out as well."

So Repatha in the quarter is more a function of what we've been able to do since lowering the price in terms of increasing our penetration in the Medicare Part D population. So we've seen some really nice growth there. But what happens when you grow in Medicare Part D is you also grow in the number of patients that enter the donut hole. And that's what we're really seeing in Q3, and we expect that to continue in Q4. The good news side of that equation is we're growing nicely in Medicare. We're seeing much less patient abandonment in Medicare, and that should be a compounding source of growth for us on a go-forward basis. But I would expect a pattern of Q3 and Q4 net price drag as a function of the Medicare Part D coverage gap. Unless, of course, that changes in whatever is brewing in D.C. but that's how it's happened right now.
On Aimovig, it's a little bit different. It's just -- it's really the annualization of contracted business with PBMs in general. There's been fairly competitive activity there to maintain preferred formulary positions on national PBMs. And we don't have the same amount of volume growth on Aimovig, but we do expect that to be more stable going forward.

So hypothetically speaking, should there be an out-of-pocket cap for patients in Part D introduced in some change in legislation, I think it would help in our portfolio. We've been advocates for changes to Part D in that regard for quite a while, where we do think that the out-of-pocket expenditures and the less price equation for co-pays for patients or disincentives to drug adherence and maybe even for initial fill. So I think products like Repatha, where we are largely a Medicare Part D population, could benefit from out-of-pocket caps. Now it would depend obviously, what that travels with. Does it travel with more commitment from the manufacturer in the catastrophic phase, where we pick up more of the tab. So it needs to be equated with other things that could be in any proposed legislation. But I hope that out-of-pocket caps come into play because I think patients who are in Part D are sometimes treated poorly and are sub-optimally treated because of that, and it would improve their affordability.
To the question on the AMGEVITA interchangeability study, we continue to feel very good about our opportunity with AMGEVITA, being in that first wave and potentially alone in the first wave of biosimilar launches to HUMIRA in the U.S. affords us an opportunity to work with payers, work with the PBMs and with providers to establish a leadership position. We look at every parameter of a biosimilar product, and this is experienced from AMGEVITA itself in Europe, but it's also experience from our other biosimilar portfolio in the U.S., and we look at things like latex free, citrate free, we look at needle gauge, we look at device, and of course, we look at interchangeability. So while we don't think it's essential, we think it's just another attribute of the product that could augment our success in that launch in 2023. So that's really why we've initiated the trial, Ronny."

I've worked in oncology for many years now, and I've been a part of some important lung cancer product launches. And this launch after 40 years of trying to solve the KRAS G12C conundrum in lung cancer, this launch has been very special. And the team has done an excellent job of executing across the payer customers, our provider customers and of course, for patients. And I was very proud of what our R&D organization was able to do and the speed at which they brought this product to market, and I feel that the medical and commercial organizations have taken the customer-facing stage and the go-to-market stage of this launch extremely seriously and with a lot of responsibility. And so far, it's early days, but so far, they've done very, very well. And so I'm pleased with the trajectory.
What we're seeing is many academic centers are changing their testing protocols in lung cancer so that everybody knows their KRAS G12C status. Many large community oncology networks have done the same. Now we still have a few large community oncology networks to go. So we will be working on those in the fourth quarter, but I couldn't be more pleased with the way in which we've entered the market. And I think  that bodes well for our ability to establish a strong leadership position and help many, many patients who are unfortunately progressing from first-line into second-line disease before competitors come in.
It's hugely rewarding to launch a product like this where you hear stories of patients who have been told that their options are limited and that they should sign up for hospice care, coming out of hospice and getting treated with LUMAKRAS with commercial drug and responding. And the drug is working well in the marketplace. We're hearing those anecdotal stories coming back from prescribers, and we will continue to do everything within our power to continue to launch LUMAKRAS quickly around the world and help many, many more patients."

And what I've seen since coming to Amgen is real strength in the legacy of Amgen, which is, of course, the support of care products that we have. We've augmented that recently with the launch of our biosimilar portfolio. And then most recently, of course, with the launch of LUMAKRAS. And when I sit down with CEOs of cancer networks or academic cancer centers, they are very interested in talking to Amgen. And they are also interested in talking to us about the very rich pipeline of products that David Reese and his R&D colleagues are developing. So I think we are very much a leader in oncology.
I think that our commercial position with innovative products and biosimilars and launches of new therapeutics puts us in a very strong account position. And I think in a world where a lot of care is delivered in community oncology, our relationships there are extremely strong. I've been able to make some customer visits this year despite some of the interruptions of the pandemic. And most of my visits have been in support of the LUMAKRAS launch. And I can tell you they have been very, very good at working with us to develop testing programs, look back programs, entering flags and EMRs and making sure patients are flagged for treatment. And it's those systems and those processes that being first on the ground, we should be able to build and sustain. Longer term, of course, it will be the continuation of being first with indications and being broad in the development of the asset and then supporting it with additional products in lung cancer that Dave is developing in our pipeline."

Yes, in terms of toolkits, we could obviously talk probably for hours about the toolkits that we've got in discovery research and our clinical trials. Let me focus on just a couple of things for the purposes of this discussion. We are building what I think is an industry-leading capability in what I call human data, which means the collection, integration and interrogation of data ranging from various omic data, genomic data, transcriptomic data, proteomic data through clinical trials data through real-world evidence in real-world data. And it's one of our core beliefs that the coming few decades will be won by those who understand how to make use of and, in particular, analyze the giant tsunami of data that is now starting to wash over us.
Now that data, of course, generates drug targets and pathways. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are building extensive capabilities for the development of multi-specific molecules, either small molecules, large molecules or hybrid molecules. About 80% to 85% of the currently validated targets are currently not approachable with existing technologies, and we are building the capability to go after what I think will be a good traction of those undruggable targets. So I feel great about the platforms that we've got in place and are continuing to build on and a lot more on this over the next year or 2."

When we acquired Otezla, I thought it would be a really good add to the portfolio and our strength in immunology, both with dermatology and with rheumatology. And obviously, we had to make a certain set of assumptions about how that product would evolve in our ownership. And so far, I have to say I'm even more pleased with the strength that the product brings to Amgen. We've been successful, as you highlight, in demonstrating the product's efficacy and safety in the mild-to-moderate patient setting, which is a perfect sweet spot for this product, given the convenience of its oral dosing, given the well demonstrated safety and efficacy of the product.
We also recently had a decision on the patent for Otezla, which definitely helps make it a very strategic product for us, a very important product for the growth of the company. And the fit is just perfect. We have integrated the legacy Celgene team fully into Amgen. We've got both Enbrel and Otezla now being promoted in rheumatology and dermatology. And we've seen volume growth improve in most markedly in the last part of Q3, but that continues into Q4. We didn't plan on a pandemic when we did the transaction, obviously, but we've weathered it well. The team is staying focused, and we are well prepared for the mild-to-moderate launch. We're anticipating a decision on that soon from the FDA. We have the resources available. We have the teams trained. We have an increased footprint in dermatology in anticipation of the approval. And we expect to be able to execute very effectively.
We also have very, very strong payer coverage here. And we think that the majority of these mild-to-moderate patients, and we're targeting a specific subset. We're targeting those patients that have larger body surface area or very difficult to treat areas with topicals. So that's about a 1.5 million patient population. So it's a large opportunity. But we think that the profile of the product, the price point of the product versus biologics puts us in a very, very strong position to treat these patients.
The other thing I would add that we expect to benefit from somewhat more so in the PSA area versus psoriasis, but the safety concerns of the JAKs right now, quite frankly, are helping Otezla and the overall perception of our safety and our efficacy. And I think that might bode well for future competition that's currently in the process, I guess, of being filed with the FDA."
