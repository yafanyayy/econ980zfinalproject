As we reported last night, we delivered record results in the fourth quarter, and we could not have done so without the hard work and dedication of our whole team of associates and partners. We'd like to express our deep appreciation for their continued dedication and efforts.
Before we take your questions this morning, I thought it would be appropriate to take a few minutes to reflect on the year we just completed, which presented many challenges, but at the same time, yielded so many accomplishments in our business. To highlight just a few of these accomplishments for L Brands in total: we led with our values and an emphasis on safety, so we could be confident in our decisions and actions to support associates customers and our business; we shifted how we ran the business and thanks the technology didn't miss a beat in managing the calendar and processes that drive our businesses each day; we created ways to navigate the pandemic and support our associates and partners to ensure we could continue to deliver results; we took significant actions to increase liquidity and ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash and delivered $1.8 billion in free cash flow; we restructured the organization to prepare us to operate as 2 separate businesses go forward; we successfully spread business across the fall season with sales volume and margin rates that outpaced expectations.
While the above comments reflect what we did tactically, it's also important to reflect on how we got there, particularly in a year where we saw a substantial social unrest and political divisiveness. The leadership of the business focused on advancing a healthy, high-performance culture, including efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion for ourselves, our business and our communities. In addition to continuing to develop our internal leadership talent, we also recruited a number of new leaders in important roles that both deepen our capability and add to the diversity of our team.
Shifting now to accomplishments that relate specifically to Bath & Body Works. For the year, we increased sales by $1.1 billion or 20%, and operating income by over $600 million or 50%, and delivered results we could not have predicted in the middle of a global pandemic and a year of significant change. We further enhanced our brand positioning with evolved designs, strong product acceptance, emotionally-compelling on-trend, seasonally-right merchandise and marketing. We matched our customers' mindset about wellness, self-care and nesting at home. And we established soaps and sanitizers as true traffic drivers and a solid third pillar of the business. We continue to leverage our speed and agility and made smart choices to plan and replan the business and manage inventory to commercialize, chase and allocate product, and divert and move inventory where it was most needed while also building continuity and capacity into our supply chain and a larger network of fulfillment and distribution centers, all of which gave us a velocity of inventory flow to match increased demands for our products.
We more than doubled our U.S. direct business to $2 billion or 31% of the total business inside of 12 months, breaking high watermarks multiple times during the year. And importantly, we were among the safest as well as most fun and festive place in the mall for Christmas. We expect that 2021 will not be easy as the world, the retail environment and our enterprise and business continue to evolve and as we lap these extraordinary 2020 results. But with continued smart management of the brand and business, I know we can become a fully separate, stand-alone public corporation and proactively accelerate to our next phase of growth.
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Martin Waters."

The Victoria's Secret team, led by Stuart, has accomplished a remarkable turnaround in the last 6 months. In the full season, we delivered about a $400 million or 300% increase in operating income at a profit rate of 15% of sales. And that's a result of improved merchandise assortments, more disciplined inventory management, better management of promotions, effective selling execution online and in stores, and of course, the positive impact of our profit improvement plan. While much has already been accomplished, I'm highly energized by the opportunities that we have in front of us to reposition and grow this iconic brand as a stand-alone business.

So on your first part of the question, in terms of growth outside of soaps and sanitizers, I think it's just important to remind everyone, and we've said it in the prepared remarks in both Q3 and Q4. Soaps and sanitizer was a significant growth driver for the business in 2020, really the whole year. But as we called out, we saw about 2/3 of the growth come from outside of soaps and sanitizers. And as we've said on prior calls, really, the biggest trend within that 2/3 has been in our home fragrance business. As we've seen the customer. Clearly, he or she is spending more time at home and spending more attention on making their home a comfortable place to do business, schooling, et cetera. We've seen, again, continued strong growth there.
But importantly, on the year, we did see strong double-digit comp growth in all of our categories. So again, a very balanced performance with the exception, as you mentioned, of soaps and sanitizers that really experienced outsized growth across the entire time frame.
When you think -- when we think about customer behavior in general, we did see that our customer spending across all categories and across both channels, was up significantly year-over-year. From a total number of customers, because we had stores closed for about 90 days in the first half of the year, and because the store customer -- store-only customer at the beginning of the year represented a little over 3/4 of our total customers. That did mean that we saw a decline in number of customers who shopped in stores for fiscal 2020, but we were able to almost fully offset that by the increase that we saw in our direct customers and in our dual-channel customers. So while we finished 2020 with a slight decline in the total number of customers, we did see customer engagement metrics improved substantially. So spending by all customers up over 20%, and importantly, strong growth in both direct and dual customers. And as a reminder, dual customer -- dual-channel customers spend on order of magnitude more than 3x a single channel customer.
And then the last piece I would emphasize is that, again, we saw strong cross-category growth in customers. Meaning number of customers who shop multiple categories within the business as opposed to just 1. And as we saw that strong growth really led by customers engaging in soaps and sanitizers, we saw that spending also increased substantially. So hopefully, that helps."

So obviously, we went into a little bit of detail in our prepared remarks last evening. So important to recognize that 2020 was definitely an outlier year in terms of the operating margin results that we achieved at $28.",518,"Lorraine, thanks for the question. So obviously, we went into a little bit of detail in our prepared remarks last evening. So important to recognize that 2020 was definitely an outlier year in terms of the operating margin results that we achieved at $28.5 million, which, as you're pointing out, was up substantially to even 2018 and 2019, which were very good years for the business, up over 500 basis points. When we look at that operating margin improvement, about half of that improvement came from significant gains in merchandise margin rates. And again, those merchandise margin rate improvements were achieved by significantly reducing promotional activity within the year. And that promotional activity was against all of our different vehicles. So we saw less clearance selling, more full price selling, we saw fewer days of power traffic-driving promotions. We were able to actually take promotion on pricing, up even on essentially flat ticket pricing. And we had fewer shop-wide discounts than we had offered historically through e-mail or direct mail. So as we think about that level of improvement, our assumption is that we will have to give some of that improvement that we saw in fiscal 2020 back as we move beyond the snapback, if you will, the stores got reopened and the tremendous growth that we saw in our direct channel demand up over 100% for the year. So as we begin to lap some of that activity, we do expect that some of that merchandise margin gain, we will have to give back. But as you know and we've talked about on many calls in the past, we are constantly doing read-and-react testing to understand what our customers are responding to in terms of promotions, what it's required to drive both traffic as well as customer acquisition and unit selling to maintain market share or gain market share. So those are all important considerations that we will use as we move through 2021 and beyond.
The other half of the operating margin improvement that we saw in 2020 was really driven by leverage of both SG&A and buying occupancy on, obviously, the very high sales growth. Total sales grew by 20% for the year. And comp sales in the time frame that we were open grew by 45%. So obviously, we do not expect that level of ongoing sales growth. And so there will be some deleverage as we return to more normal sales growth go forward and as we continue to make investments into our operating costs around safety and supplies into wages and labor in stores and supply chain and into investments in capability in digital and omnichannel.
So the net-net of all that is, as we said in our prepared remarks, we do believe that the right long-term operating margin structure for the BBW segment as it currently exists is in that low to mid-20s. But the pace at which we get to that will be completely dependent on the business results that we see. And as I described, the continuous testing that we'll do throughout the year. Hopefully, that makes sense."

So as you point out in your question, I -- we're pursuing a dual path approach to the separation of Victoria's Secret. Dual path, meaning looking at a spin option where Victoria's would become its own public company. And separately, a sale option where we would sell it to a third-party. And I think as you mentioned in your question, a sales scenario, very likely to have a significant tax cost to it. Whereas a spin-off done in the appropriate way, which would certainly be our intent, would be a tax-free transaction. So it's 1 of many considerations. But obviously, the tax leakage could be significant in the sales scenario. And that with a range of other factors will be considered by the Board as we work through this process, we'll get the right advice from legal and banking council and so on. But the spin option is a tax-free option, we believe it can be accomplished in that way. And that would be one of the advantages of a spin option. So that would be our perspective on that.
And then, Ike, as we commented on in our prepared comments that got circulated in terms of the profitability of VS NewCo what we mentioned and what I believe, Martin believes, we believe, is that the business can be managed well and deliver meaningful growth. In an operating income rate range, an EBIT range of between 10% and 15%. And as many of you have recognized, we're basically in that range at this point. With the meaningful progress that we made in the back half of the year. So this should be a 10% to 15% business. We'll obviously shift more to growth as we move forward. And the dollarization of that is meaningful, whether it's on an EBIT basis or an EBITDA basis. And we're excited about the growth of the business."

International, as we called out in our remarks, had a strong year. International, in many ways, mirrored the results we saw in North America in terms of challenging business in the first quarter and first half of the year with store closures. But our international partners, franchise partners did a very, very good job of building substantially their digital capabilities and capacity through 2020, which led to closing the year in a very strong way for both Q4 and the year, growing sales and operating income nicely.
And as you saw in our materials, we're also planning, our partners are very bullish on the business. So we are planning further growth in 2021 of 50 to 75 stores in primarily existing markets that our franchise partners already operate strongly in. And so they are bullish, we are bullish on the continued opportunity for growth there.
To your specific question around are we contemplating or would we contemplate moving from the franchise model to an owned store model. I think the short answer on that is right now, no. We are very comfortable and pleased with the model that we have in place, the results that we're getting, the relationships we have with our partners. I'll never say never, but again, not part of our growth strategy here in the next several years.
And to the second part of your question, again, we called out specifically in our prepared remarks that with the tremendous growth of digital and with the continued change in our portfolio to focus on off-mall stores we're down to only about 35% of our revenue coming from mall stores. So obviously, the other almost 2/3 coming from digital and off-mall, your question around what are the type of operating performance we see out of those off-mall stores. Again, as Bath & Body Works has become much more of a destination in and of itself, what we see in our off-mall locations, not surprisingly, is significantly higher conversion rates than we see in mall stores. If someone is coming into an off-mall location, they almost certainly have already decided before they made the trip that they intend to make a purchase. And so that operating profile is certainly stronger in our off-mall locations. And probably not surprisingly, our operating costs, in general, are lower in our off-mall locations. And so their profit rates tend to be on par or better than an average mall store.
And then importantly, again, I think, partly driven by the pandemic, but also probably driven by just a longer-term shift in customer behavior. We saw a pretty substantial outperformance of our off-mall locations this year versus our mall-based locations. So about a comp about twice as high in off-malls versus malls for the full year.
And so that, again, are important elements and why we continue to move in the direction strategy wise that we've articulated in terms of shifting more and more to off-mall locations. Hopefully, that helps."

So Matt, as you point out, we've generated a lot of cash, and we're holding a lot of cash. And the business, and it was an intensive effort, including support from lots of people, including our partners and then a strong operating result. But we are -- we ended the year with $3.9 billion of cash. And so as we think about where we are and as we think about the next roundly 6 months, 5 or 6 months with respect to the separation, we are evaluating the subject that you asked about, which is what are you going to do with all this money? And how do you think about it? We haven't made any decisions. We are getting outside advice. We've retained Goldman and JPMorgan to help us with the separation, and they're giving us their perspectives on the subject you asked about as well. So we're evaluating options. The Board, obviously, will review thinking and will approve anything that we do. But in answer to your question, what are we thinking most about? We're thinking about reducing debt. We're thinking about buying stock. We do believe in the opportunity to drive appreciation in the stock, including through a re-rating of Bath & Body Works. And we're also thinking about resuming a dividend. But these are all things that we're just thinking about. No decisions have been made. Obviously, when we make decisions, we'll communicate those. And we're thinking about the timing of that evaluation and the timing of those decisions in terms of before or after or multi-step or single step with respect to the separation.
So it's a big subject. The good news is we're in a good place. So we've accumulated a lot of cash. The maturity profile, as you know, is very healthy. We took a number of actions this year to improve that maturity profile. So we start the subject in a very sound position. But again, we believe it appropriate to reduce debt. There is absolutely an opportunity, we think, with respect to the repurchase of shares. And the company paid a dividend for a long period of time, and that is an important form of return for shareholders in a company like this. So we're evaluating all of it, but have not made any decisions."

So it wouldn't be appropriate to kind of speculate on what the numerical threshold would be we could all throw numbers against the wall. And those numbers -- what I will say is those numbers are substantially greater than they were a year ago. So I think we all appreciate that based on the performance of the business. But the judgment involved in that is important and is not based on a single factor. But obviously, valuation and cash generation are important considerations as we evaluate the plus minus. But again, I think as you appreciate the -- we could all do math and speculate, but it's more involved in that.
And the good news is, as we think about what the valuation of the business may be in the public markets, again, we can all do that math, and it certainly implies a bigger numbers with respect to what would be required to tilt the scale, if you will. So it's a good question. An important question, but not one that will throw a number out on a call this morning. And again, the Board will make that determination.
With respect to leverage, what we would say is we're doing the capital structure work. We do believe that a leverage in the 2.5% to 3% range on a lease-adjusted basis, feels like a good target, but we're continuing to refine our views on that.
And then with respect to when might we see some action, as I mentioned in the comments with respect to Matt's question, we're looking at the subjects. Important judgment to make about timing of actions and a 2-step thing or a 1-step thing and in terms of decisions and actions, and we're evaluating those things.

And I couldn't be more delighted to be leading the work to refresh the brand positioning to make it more relevant, to make it more inclusive, to make it more consistent with the attitude and lifestyle of the modern woman. And so we've listened to her and we've carefully decided to make some change. And that change is summarized by here asking us to move away from telling her what we think is sexy and what we think she should wear and how we think she should look. To being there to help aircraft the story that she wants to tell. So our job is to support her in whatever way that she needs us to. And we know that she's rooting for us, the engagement that we saw in the fourth quarter was up significantly to previous years, both in social channels and obviously, in digital commerce generally. And we're winning her back by celebrating her and inspiring her and supporting her to show up, however she wants to show up.
So you will see significant change in the way that the brand is presented. And rather than expecting a big reveal or a big relaunch of the brand, this will -- the change in the positioning that I've just described will show up in everything that we do on a day-to-day basis. And that means, whether it be the imagery when you turn on the screen on our website, on your phone, on the e-mail that you get every day, in our social media, in the magalog that arrives for The Swim on Monday, every single interaction that we have with the consumer, either polishes or tarnishes the brand and we are determined that we will have polish mentality in everything that we do from here onwards. So hopefully, that helps give some color, and I'm happy to talk more about it privately if people want to hear more."

And then importantly, as I mentioned, specifically on that second group that would now be considered a dual channel customer, the spending associated with those customers relative to the spending of a customer who shops only online or only in stores. Is order of magnitude 3x greater.

You probably noticed, we've had significantly less promotionality. And the reason for that is we've got better merchandise. So if you've got better stuff and you've got inventories managed more tightly than good things happened to the margin, and we saw that particularly in January where we didn't need to lap the extensive SAS from prior year, and we didn't need to lap the same number of panty parties, et cetera, et cetera. So we're seeing just a much healthier business right now that's less dependent on promotions and more dependent on talking about new and back and free rather than off. We're also seeing very good momentum in PINK as well as lingerie and in beauty.
So all in all, we feel like we're on a good track. And I think the word you used is balance, and that's how I think about it. But we -- while we want to ensure that the quality of earnings is good and that the profitability of the sales is positive. At the same time, we want to drive volume. So we want to be the market leader. We want to have deep shares in all of the core categories in which we operate. So we're trying to keep a very careful balance on the tiller to ensure that we're getting the right level of promotional support to drive volume. And at the same time, hang on to the terrific gains that we've made already.
And the way I would say it is that for the first half of the year, we expect that trend to continue. Because we're up against a difficult period from 2020 last year. And as we move towards the back half of the year, well, that will ameliorate a little bit because we were already starting to see significant improvement in performance.

Obviously, sales up over 100%. Fourth quarter sales growth was lower at about 75%. Certainly, part of the reason that, that sales growth moderated was what you're poking on in terms of some of the constraints we saw specifically with shippers, UPS, Fedex, et cetera, and their ability to handle the total industry level growth. But it's also important to remember that fourth quarter and specifically, the holiday time frame within fourth quarter is such a steep slope for the Bath & Body Works online business that putting up even that 75% growth in Q4 was a remarkable achievement and significantly above our expectations.
So to the second part of your question around how are we thinking about the growth go forward. We're continuing to make big investments into our overall fulfillment capacity. We saw remarkable progress there 2020 versus 2019, fulfillment capacity, up over 50%. But we recognize that's an area that we need to continue to make investments in go forward.
And so short answer, I do not see shipping or fulfillment constraints as an impediment to the business growth as we move into 2021 and beyond."

And so certainly, I think it's only natural as we approach 2021 to be more conservative in terms of what we assume will be growth in that channel, specifically for this year. And we won't know the answer to some of those questions until we start to lap the time frame from a year ago in a couple of weeks when stores were closed and direct was our only channel operating. So we'll certainly be smarter over the next 90 to 180 days, but a lot to still learn.
As we think about the business long term, though. So again, prior to 2020, the direct penetration to the total business was in the high teens percent, and we got all the way to 31% of the business in 2020. And we view that over time, that number should grow to the mid- to high 30s, perhaps as high as 40% over the next several years. But importantly, our goal is to continue to have strong growth in the direct channel, but also to maintain a strong, vibrant, growing store environment. That is still the ultimate expression of the Bath & Body Works brand, in terms of being able to really stand for our tremendous fragrance experience and the interaction that we have between our associates and our customers, which we believe is such a strong part of the brand."

We think that it's reasonable to expect for the next year, 30 to 50 stores, and we'll continue to review the fleet on a month-to-month basis. Reminder, about 96% of our fleet is cash flow positive. So we don't feel like there's a burning platform to close hundreds of stores. And implied in your question is that we might be 30 to 50 stores a year forever and ever, Amen, and I don't think that's so. So I would take it 1 year at a time, expect 30 to 50, and we'll continue to update guidance as we go.
As it relates to AUR growth, we have seen pretty consistent AUR growth across the categories. We saw particularly good growth in the sleep and lounge categories, good categories during COVID time, stay at home time, but also in our core lingerie. So I don't think there's a big difference there. Similarly, in PINK, good AUR growth. I think Beauty is probably the 1 category where there has been less to go at on the AUR growth. But overall, we should expect a continuation of the trend that you've seen in Q4, at least through the spring season."

So I think the part of our brand that has the most clearly defined demographic targeting is PINK, where clearly, we're going after the Gen Z consumer, very important part of that brand. And we know that our messaging around diversity, equity inclusion, sustainability is really resonating with that consumer. So that's the most targeted. I think as it relates to Victoria's, we have a pretty broad church, don't we? And actually, we want that church to be even broader than it has been. If anything, we've been too specific in our target. And we think that as part of the brand narrative that I described earlier that we should be appealing to more women, more of the time for more stages of their life. And that means that we'll be there for in significantly more ways than we have been historically, whether that be through swim or whether it be through vacation or whatever it may be, different life stages. So I would expect us to be less focused on a specific demographic target and more focused on being broadly inclusive of all women of all shapes and sizes and colors and ethnicities and genders and areas of interest.
As it relates to good, better, best, I think we are critical of ourselves of saying that we haven't always had that balance right. And that has led to some opportunity for competitors to attack us in our core space. The fundamentals of merchandising take us back to those core principles. Make sure you have really good opening price points in all of the key threshold categories. Make sure that you're able to represent the brand each of the good, better, best areas.
And so I think the way we showed up in fall was a significant improvement on where we've been year-over-year or credit to the team. And as we brought new players into our team with different merchandising experience, they have observations about areas where we can see even further improvement during the fall and into next year's season.
So hopefully, that gives you a bit more color of how we're thinking about it."

As we reported last night, we delivered record results in the fourth quarter, and we could not have done so without the hard work and dedication of our whole team of associates and partners. We'd like to express our deep appreciation for their continued dedication and efforts.
Before we take your questions this morning, I thought it would be appropriate to take a few minutes to reflect on the year we just completed, which presented many challenges but, at the same time, yielded so many accomplishments in our business. To highlight just a few of these accomplishments for L Brands in total: we led with our values and an emphasis on safety so we could be confident in our decisions and actions to support associates customers and our business. We shifted how we ran the business and, thanks the technology, didn't miss a beat in managing the calendar and processes that drive our businesses each day. We created ways to navigate the pandemic and support our associates and partners to ensure we could continue to deliver results. We took significant actions to increase liquidity and ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash and delivered $1.8 billion in free cash flow. We restructured the organization to prepare us to operate as 2 separate businesses go forward. We successfully spread business across the fall season with sales volume and margin rates that outpaced expectations.
While the above comments reflect what we did tactically, it's also important to reflect on how we got there, particularly in a year where we saw a substantial social unrest and political divisiveness. The leadership of the business focused on advancing a healthy, high-performance culture, including efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion for ourselves, our business and our communities. In addition to continuing to develop our internal leadership talent, we also recruited a number of new leaders in important roles that both deepen our capability and add to the diversity of our team.
Shifting now to accomplishments that relate specifically to Bath & Body Works. For the year, we increased sales by $1.1 billion or 20%, and operating income by over $600 million or 50%, and delivered results we could not have predicted in the middle of a global pandemic and a year of significant change. We further enhanced our brand positioning with evolved designs, strong product acceptance, emotionally-compelling on-trend, seasonally-right merchandise and marketing. We matched our customers' mindset about wellness, self-care and nesting at home. And we established soaps and sanitizers as true traffic drivers and a solid third pillar of the business. 
We continue to leverage our speed and agility and made smart choices to plan and replan the business and manage inventory to commercialize, chase and allocate product and divert and move inventory where it was most needed while also building continuity and capacity into our supply chain and a larger network of fulfillment and distribution centers, all of which gave us a velocity of inventory flow to match increased demands for our products.
We more than doubled our U.S. direct business to $2 billion or 31% of the total business inside of 12 months, breaking high watermarks multiple times during the year. And importantly, we were among the safest as well as most fun and festive place in the mall for Christmas. We expect that 2021 will not be easy as the world, the retail environment and our enterprise and business continue to evolve and as we lap these extraordinary 2020 results. But with continued smart management of the brand and business, I know we can become a fully separate, stand-alone public corporation and proactively accelerate to our next phase of growth.
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Martin Waters."

And that's a result of improved merchandise assortments, more disciplined inventory management, better management of promotions, effective selling execution online and in stores and, of course, the positive impact of our profit improvement plan.

Soaps and san",425,"Yes. Thank you, Simeon, for the question. So on your first part of the question, in terms of growth outside of soaps and sanitizers, I think it's just important to remind everyone, and we've said it in the prepared remarks in both Q3 and Q4. Soaps and sanitizer was a significant growth driver for the business in 2020, really the whole year. But as we called out, we saw about 2/3 of the growth come from outside of soaps and sanitizers. And as we've said on prior calls, really, the biggest trend within that 2/3 has been in our home fragrance business. As we've seen the customer, clearly, he or she is spending more time at home and spending more attention on making their home a comfortable place to do business, schooling, et cetera. We've seen, again, continued strong growth there.
But importantly, on the year, we did see strong double-digit comp growth in all of our categories. So again, a very balanced performance with the exception, as you mentioned, of soaps and sanitizers that really experienced outsized growth across the entire time frame.
When you think -- when we think about customer behavior in general, we did see that our customer spending across all categories and across both channels was up significantly year-over-year. From a total number of customers, because we had stores closed for about 90 days in the first half of the year and because the store customer -- store-only customer at the beginning of the year represented a little over 3/4 of our total customers. That did mean that we saw a decline in number of customers who shopped in stores for fiscal 2020, but we were able to almost fully offset that by the increase that we saw in our direct customers and in our dual-channel customers. So while we finished 2020 with a slight decline in the total number of customers, we did see customer engagement metrics improved substantially.  So spending by all customers up over 20% and, importantly, strong growth in both direct and dual customers. And as a reminder, dual customer -- dual-channel customers spend on order of magnitude more than 3x a single channel customer.
And then the last piece I would emphasize is that, again, we saw strong cross-category growth in customers, meaning number of customers who shop multiple categories within the business as opposed to just 1. And as we saw that strong growth really led by customers engaging in soaps and sanitizers, we saw that spending also increased substantially. So hopefully, that helps."

So obviously, we went into a little bit of detail in our prepared remarks last evening. So important to recognize that 2020 was definitely an outlier year in terms of the operating margin results that we achieved at $28.",518,"Lorraine, thanks for the question. So obviously, we went into a little bit of detail in our prepared remarks last evening. So important to recognize that 2020 was definitely an outlier year in terms of the operating margin results that we achieved at $28.5 million, which, as you're pointing out, was up substantially to even 2018 and 2019, which were very good years for the business, up over 500 basis points. When we look at that operating margin improvement, about half of that improvement came from significant gains in merchandise margin rates. 
And again, those merchandise margin rate improvements were achieved by significantly reducing promotional activity within the year. And that promotional activity was against all of our different vehicles. So we saw less clearance selling, more full price selling. We saw fewer days of power traffic-driving promotions. We were able to actually take promotion on pricing, up even on essentially flat ticket pricing. And we had fewer shop-wide discounts than we had offered historically through e-mail or direct mail. 
So as we think about that level of improvement, our assumption is that we will have to give some of that improvement that we saw in fiscal 2020 back as we move beyond the snapback, if you will. The stores got reopened and the tremendous growth that we saw in our direct channel demand up over 100% for the year. So as we begin to lap some of that activity, we do expect that some of that merchandise margin gain, we will have to give back. But as you know and we've talked about on many calls in the past, we are constantly doing read-and-react testing to understand what our customers are responding to in terms of promotions, what it's required to drive both traffic as well as customer acquisition and unit selling to maintain market share or gain market share. So those are all important considerations that we will use as we move through 2021 and beyond.
The other half of the operating margin improvement that we saw in 2020 was really driven by leverage of both SG&A and buying occupancy on, obviously, the very high sales growth. Total sales grew by 20% for the year. And comp sales in the time frame that we were open grew by 45%. So obviously, we do not expect that level of ongoing sales growth. And so there will be some deleverage as we return to more normal sales growth go forward and as we continue to make investments into our operating costs around safety and supplies into wages and labor in stores and supply chain and into investments in capability in digital and omnichannel.
So the net-net of all that is, as we said in our prepared remarks, we do believe that the right long-term operating margin structure for the BBW segment as it currently exists is in that low to mid-20s. But the pace at which we get to that will be completely dependent on the business results that we see and, as I described, the continuous testing that we'll do throughout the year. Hopefully, that makes sense."

So as you point out in your question, I -- we're pursuing a dual path approach to the separation of Victoria's Secret. Dual path, meaning looking at a spin option where Victoria's would become its own public company. And separately, a sale option where we would sell it to a third-party. And I think as you mentioned in your question, a sales scenario, very likely to have a significant tax cost to it. Whereas a spin-off done in the appropriate way, which would certainly be our intent, would be a tax-free transaction. So it's one of many considerations. But obviously, the tax leakage could be significant in the sales scenario. And that with a range of other factors will be considered by the Board as we work through this process, we'll get the right advice from legal and banking council and so on. But the spin option is a tax-free option where we believe it can be accomplished in that way. And that would be one of the advantages of a spin option. So that would be our perspective on that.
And then, Ike, as we commented on in our prepared comments that got circulated in terms of the profitability of VS NewCo, what we mentioned and what I believe, Martin believes, we believe, is that the business can be managed well and deliver meaningful growth. In an operating income rate range, an EBIT range of between 10% and 15%. And as many of you have recognized, we're basically in that range at this point with the meaningful progress that we made in the back half of the year. So this should be a 10% to 15% business. We'll obviously shift more to growth as we move forward. And the dollarization of that is meaningful, whether it's on an EBIT basis or an EBITDA basis. And we're excited about the growth of the business."

International, as we called out in our remarks, had a strong year. International, in many ways, mirrored the results we saw in North America in terms of challenging business in the first quarter and first half of the year with store closures. But our international partners, franchise partners did a very, very good job of building substantially their digital capabilities and capacity through 2020, which led to closing the year in a very strong way for both Q4 and the year, growing sales and operating income nicely.
And as you saw in our materials, we're also planning, our partners are very bullish on the business, so we are planning further growth in 2021 of 50 to 75 stores in primarily existing markets that our franchise partners already operate strongly in. And so they are bullish. We are bullish on the continued opportunity for growth there.
To your specific question around are we contemplating or would we contemplate moving from the franchise model to an own-store model, I think the short answer on that is right now, no. We are very comfortable and pleased with the model that we have in place, the results that we're getting, the relationships we have with our partners. I'll never say never, but again, not part of our growth strategy here in the next several years.
And to the second part of your question, again, we called out specifically in our prepared remarks that with the tremendous growth of digital and with the continued change in our portfolio to focus on off-mall stores, we're down to only about 35% of our revenue coming from mall stores. So obviously, the other almost 2/3 coming from digital and off-mall. Your question around what are the type of operating performance we see out of those off-mall stores, again, as Bath & Body Works has become much more of a destination in and of itself, what we see in our off-mall locations, not surprisingly, is significantly higher conversion rates than we see in mall stores. If someone is coming into an off-mall location, they almost certainly have already decided before they made the trip that they intend to make a purchase. And so that operating profile is certainly stronger in our off-mall locations. And probably not surprisingly, our operating costs, in general, are lower in our off-mall locations. And so their profit rates tend to be on par or better than an average mall store.
And then importantly, again, I think, partly driven by the pandemic but also probably driven by just a longer-term shift in customer behavior, we saw a pretty substantial outperformance of our off-mall locations this year versus our mall-based locations. So about a comp about twice as high in off-malls versus malls for the full year.
And so that, again, are important elements and why we continue to move in the direction strategy-wise that we've articulated in terms of shifting more and more to off-mall locations. Hopefully, that helps."

And so as we think about where we are and as we think about the next roundly 6 months, 5 or 6 months with respect to the separation, we are evaluating the subject that you asked about, which is what are you going to do with all this money and how do you think about it? 
We haven't made any decisions. We are getting outside advice. We've retained Goldman and JPMorgan to help us with the separation, and they're giving us their perspectives on the subject you asked about as well. So we're evaluating options. The Board, obviously, will review thinking and will approve anything that we do. But in answer to your question, what are we thinking most about? We're thinking about reducing debt. We're thinking about buying stock. We do believe in the opportunity to drive appreciation in the stock, including through a re-rating of Bath & Body Works. And we're also thinking about resuming a dividend. 
But these are all things that we're just thinking about. No decisions have been made. Obviously, when we make decisions, we'll communicate those. And we're thinking about the timing of that evaluation and the timing of those decisions in terms of before or after or multi-step or single step with respect to the separation.
So it's a big subject. The good news is we're in a good place. So we've accumulated a lot of cash. The maturity profile, as you know, is very healthy. We took a number of actions this year to improve that maturity profile, so we start the subject in a very sound position. But again, we believe it appropriate to reduce debt. There is absolutely an opportunity, we think, with respect to the repurchase of shares. And the company paid a dividend for a long period of time, and that is an important form of return for shareholders in a company like this. So we're evaluating all of it but have not made any decisions."

And then just a follow-up on the debt question. Do you have a sort of targeted leverage ratio for BBW and/or Victoria's Secret that you'd like to get to? And any thoughts on when we might see some action on debt paydown?"

And that's a judgment that the Board will make. So it wouldn't be appropriate to kind of speculate on what the numerical threshold would be. We could all throw numbers against the wall. And those numbers -- what I will say is those numbers are substantially greater than they were a year ago. So I think we all appreciate that based on the performance of the business. 
But the judgment involved in that is important and is not based on a single factor. But obviously, valuation and cash generation are important considerations as we evaluate the plus minus. But again, I think as you appreciate the -- we could all do math and speculate, but it's more involved in that.
And the good news is, as we think about what the valuation of the business may be in the public markets, again, we can all do that math, and it certainly implies a bigger numbers with respect to what would be required to tilt the scale, if you will. So it's a good question, an important question but not one that we'll throw a number out on a call this morning. And again, the Board will make that determination.
With respect to leverage, what we would say is we're doing the capital structure work. We do believe that a leverage in the 2.5% to 3% range on a lease-adjusted basis feels like a good target, but we're continuing to refine our views on that.
And then with respect to when might we see some action, as I mentioned in the comments with respect to Matt's question, we're looking at the subjects. Important judgment to make about timing of actions and a 2-step thing or a 1-step thing and in terms of decisions and actions, and we're evaluating those things. And the Board, again, will make those determinations. But nothing to announce today."

With respect to the digital business and did it improve its profit rate meaningfully year-on-year, the answer to that is it did. And that was driven by the improvement in merchandise margin rates that we saw across the business. And so that effect was significant in the online business, and it's a very profitable business and a good business.  And in addition to growing top line, the profit rate in the business improved meaningfully, again, driven by the improvement in the merchandise margin rate."

So firstly, it's about establishing a happy and healthy culture within the business. Secondly, it's about really improving our product offer, focusing on the architecture of our good, better, best pricing and being really sharp on opening price points. Thirdly, it's about leaning into digital so that we adop a digital-first mentality, and we expect it to be probably 50% of our business going forward. And then fourthly and very importantly, it's about pacing into the brand repositioning work. And I couldn't be more delighted to be leading the work to refresh the brand positioning to make it more relevant, to make it more inclusive, to make it more consistent with the attitude and lifestyle of the modern woman. 
And so we've listened to her, and we've carefully decided to make some change. And that change is summarized by her asking us to move away from telling her what we think is sexy and what we think she should wear and how we think she should look, to being there to help her craft the story that she wants to tell. So our job is to support her in whatever way that she needs us to. And we know that she's rooting for us. The engagement that we saw in the fourth quarter was up significantly to previous years, both in social channels and obviously, in digital commerce generally. And we're winning her back by celebrating her and inspiring her and supporting her to show up however she wants to show up.
So you will see significant change in the way that the brand is presented. And rather than expecting a big reveal or a big relaunch of the brand, this will -- the change in the positioning that I've just described will show up in everything that we do on a day-to-day basis. And that means, whether it be the imagery when you turn on the screen on our website, on your phone, on the e-mail that you get every day, in our social media, in the magalog that arrives with The Swim on Monday, every single interaction that we have with the consumer either polishes or tarnishes the brand. And we are determined that we will have a polish mentality in everything that we do from here onwards. So hopefully, that helps give some color. And I'm happy to talk more about it privately if people want to hear more."

And about the other half were new to the channel, meaning they were making their first direct purchase but had historically made a purchase in stores. And again, I'm speaking to the full year there.
And then importantly, as I mentioned, specifically on that second group that would now be considered a dual channel customer, the spending associated with those customers relative to the spending of a customer who shops only online or only in stores is, order of magnitude, 3x greater. So we're very excited about that growth in dual-channel customers, and we'll work very hard to both retain those customers and to continue to drive their behavior go forward."

You probably noticed, we've had significantly less promotionality. And the reason for that is we've got better merchandise. So if you've got better stuff and you've got inventories managed more tightly, then good things happen to the margin. And we saw that particularly in January where we didn't need to lap the extensive SAS from prior year, and we didn't need to lap the same number of panty parties, et cetera, et cetera. So we're seeing just a much healthier business right now that's less dependent on promotions and more dependent on talking about new and back and free rather than off. We're also seeing very good momentum in PINK as well as lingerie and in beauty.
So all in all, we feel like we're on a good track. And I think the word you used is balance, and that's how I think about it. That we -- while we want to ensure that the quality of earnings is good and that the profitability of the sales is positive, at the same time, we want to drive volume. So we want to be the market leader. We want to have deep shares in all of the core categories in which we operate. So we're trying to keep a very careful balance on the tool to ensure that we're getting the right level of promotional support to drive volume and, at the same time, hang on to the terrific gains that we've made already.
And the way I would say it is that for the first half of the year, we expect that trend to continue. Because we're up against a difficult period from 2020 last year. And as we move towards the back half of the year, well, that will ameliorate a little bit because we were already starting to see significant improvement in performance. So hopefully, that gives you a bit more color, Kate."

So to the second part of your question around how are we thinking about the growth go forward, we're continuing to make big investments into our overall fulfillment capacity. We saw remarkable progress there. 2020 versus 2019 fulfillment capacity, up over 50%. But we recognize that's an area that we need to continue to make investments in go forward.

As we think about the business long term, though. So again, prior to 2020, the direct penetration to the total business was in the high teens percent, and we got all the way to 31% of the business in 2020. And we view that over time, that number should grow to the mid- to high 30s, perhaps as high as 40% over the next several years.

So as you know, we closed 250 stores. Took that opportunity during the pandemic. We think that it's reasonable to expect, for the next year, 30 to 50 stores, and we'll continue to review the fleet on a month-to-month basis. Reminder, about 96% of our fleet is cash flow positive. So we don't feel like there's a burning platform to close hundreds of stores. And implied in your question is that we might be 30 to 50 stores a year forever and ever, amen, and I don't think that's so. So I would take it 1 year at a time. Expect 30 to 50, and we'll continue to update guidance as we go.
As it relates to AUR growth, we have seen pretty consistent AUR growth across the categories. We saw particularly good growth in the sleep and lounge categories, good categories during COVID time, stay-at-home time, but also in our core lingerie. So I don't think there's a big difference there. Similarly, in PINK, good AUR growth. I think Beauty is probably the 1 category where there has been less to go out on the AUR growth. But overall, we should expect a continuation of the trend that you've seen in Q4, at least through the spring season."

So I think the part of our brand that has the most clearly defined demographic targeting is PINK, where clearly, we're going after the Gen Z consumer, very important part of that brand. And we know that our messaging around diversity, equity inclusion, sustainability is really resonating with that consumer. So that's the most targeted. 
I think as it relates to Victoria's, we have a pretty broad church, don't we? And actually, we want that church to be even broader than it has been. If anything, we've been too specific in our target. And we think that as part of the brand narrative that I described earlier that we should be appealing to more women, more of the time for more stages of their life. And that means that we'll be there for her in significantly more ways than we have been historically, whether that be through swim or whether it be through vacation or whatever it may be, different life stages. So I would expect us to be less focused on a specific demographic target and more focused on being broadly inclusive of all women of all shapes and sizes and colors and ethnicities and genders and areas of interest.
As it relates to good, better, best, I think we are critical of ourselves of saying that we haven't always had that balance right. And that has led to some opportunity for competitors to attack us in our core space. And the fundamentals of merchandising take us back to those core principles. Make sure you have really good opening price points in all of the key threshold categories. Make sure that you're able to represent the brand in each of the good, better, best areas.
And so I think the way we showed up in fall was a significant improvement on where we've been year-over-year or credit to the team. And as we brought new players into our team with different merchandising experience, they have observations about areas where we can see even further improvement during the fall and into next year's season.  So hopefully, that gives you a bit more color of how we're thinking about it."

We delivered record results in the first quarter, and we could not have done so without the continued dedication and extraordinary efforts of our team of associates and partners. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 significantly exceeded our initial earnings guidance of $0.35 to $0.45, driven by stronger sales and higher merchandise margin rates than we initially forecasted. Performance was strong across the whole quarter. March benefited from stimulus payments hitting customer bank accounts, and we ended the quarter strong with good Mother's Day holiday performance at both businesses. 
At Bath & Body Works, we continue to deliver record results. Our U.S. and Canada stores increased sales by 47% compared to 2019, and our direct channel sales increased 123% versus 2019. All categories achieved solid growth, and strong sales demand continued to allow us to pull back on promotional activity. 
Operating income in the first quarter was $380 million, an increase of 127% compared to 2019. Our operating income rate for the quarter of 25.9% increased 760 basis points compared to 2019, driven by merchandise margin rate expansion and leverage in both buying and occupancy and SG&A on the high sales growth. 
As we announced last week, our Board has unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into 2 independent public companies: Bath & Body Works, one of the world's leading bath, body and home fragrance retailers; and Victoria's Secret, including Victoria's Secret Lingerie, PINK and Victoria's Secret Beauty, a leading retailer of intimates and beauty products. We expect to create these companies through a tax-free spin-off of Victoria's Secret to L Brands' shareholders. We believe the spin-off will enable each company to maximize management focus and financial flexibility to thrive in an evolving retail environment and to deliver profitable growth. 
The Board evaluated the possibility of either a spin-off or a sale of Victoria's Secret with input from its financial advisers, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Throughout the review process, the company received significant interest from and held substantive discussions with multiple potential buyers. Ultimately, the Board concluded that the spin-off of Victoria's Secret into a separate public company would provide shareholders with more value than a sale. This decision follows a significant progress we have made over the last 10 months in the turnaround of the Victoria's Secret business, implementing merchandise and marketing initiatives to drive top line growth as well as executing on a series of cost-reduction actions, which together have dramatically increased profitability. As a result of these efforts, Victoria's Secret is now well positioned to operate as a stand-alone public company. 
We expect that the balance of 2021 will not be easy as the world, the retail environment and our enterprise and business continue to evolve and we lap extraordinary results. But with continued smart and disciplined management of the business, I know we can proactively accelerate to our next phase of growth. We're excited to share the details of our vision for both companies as we get closer to the targeted spin-off date in August. 
Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Martin."

The Victoria's Secret business continued its transformation with an exceptional first quarter performance. Total comparable sales increased by 9% compared to 2019, and our gross profit rate increased by more than 1,100 basis points. 
Compared to 2019, operating income increased by $213 million or 665% to $245 million with an operating income rate of 15.7%. Customers are noticing and applauding our efforts to reposition the brand. We began that work by listening both to our customers and to our associates. We heard from them what they love about our brand, including the unmatched beauty, quality, fit and innovation in our products. And we also heard clearly what they want from us as a brand, which is all about representing and celebrating all women and being there for every moment of their life, including supporting and advocating the things that matter most to them, and that's exactly what we're doing. 
We're committed to creating lifelong relationships with customers by reflecting them, their stories, their journey, in everything we do. And you're starting to see those changes come to life, most recently with our Mother's Day campaign, our Bombshell Because campaign and the PINK Mental Health Month campaign, which are all great examples of how we're reflecting, celebrating and championing our customers and the different moments and dimensions of their lives. 
Our team is fully dedicated to this repositioning work, and we could not be more excited about where we're going. I look forward to sharing more details as the work progresses. 
We're also heavily focused on the great work that's being done to rebuild a happy and healthy culture at Victoria's. While much has already been accomplished, I'm highly energized by the opportunities that we have in front of us to reposition and grow this iconic brand as a stand-alone public business.

So very pleased with the momentum we continue to see there. 
As you referenced, we are continuing to increase dramatically our fulfillment capacity. We were surprised to the upside last year at the beginning of the pandemic. And while our partners did a great job of expanding capacity throughout the year, we referenced in our script that we were a little bit backlogged at the end of the first quarter last year. And so we'll feel some of that impact on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. 
But as we're looking out to the long term, while we've been very, very satisfied with our ability to work with third-party providers on our fulfillment capability, we also recognize as this business becomes larger and larger, we want the opportunity to also have some of the capability in-house, which is why we are adding the additional center that you're referencing. While we'll start to work in that center through the year this year, it really won't be online for full capacity until the back half of 2022. So while we'll get some benefit from it in early 2022, it's really preparing for the holiday peak at the end of next year that we'll be reliant on that new capability. 
We're also adding a lot of automation into that center, which will be new and cutting edge for us as we continue to figure out how to operate all of our fulfillment centers as both efficiently and effectively as possible go forward."

And as you can imagine, especially here over the last 18 months, the strong answer to that question for the Bath & Body Works business has been an absolute yes, whether it's the soap and sanitizer business that obviously has gotten a lot of momentum appropriately here during the pandemic; but then also our home fragrance business as people have shifted their lifestyles to be spending a lot more time at home; and then our body care business, which represents a real opportunity for people to treat themselves and to have a spa day, if you will, without ever leaving the house. 
And so certainly, those have been great product categories to be in, in the short term here. But we also look at those categories in terms of where they've been over the last 10 years, which has been consistent growth in each of those 3 big market categories. And as we look out into the future, we continue to see a lot of opportunity for growth across the categories themselves, and therefore, our ability to continue to gain and maintain very high market shares in each of them. 
As we think about what innovation will look like within the categories, we are very, very reliant on big key items within our big categories. And those key items represent a disproportionate share of our business. About 75% of our business comes from our biggest 10 or 11 items. So one of the things we're always looking at is the opportunity to launch new key items within our existing categories. So that is certainly something that you'll continue to see us work on whether, for example, things like moisturizing body wash or bar soap or additional candle and soap forms beyond the big forms that we already operate in. 
And then we're obviously very interested in what I'll call adjacent white space to our big 3 existing categories. And so we're constantly testing into things like hair care and skin care that are, again, large market cap areas of opportunity from a mid- to long-term basis. 
The last thing I would emphasize is that across all of our product categories, we're also continuing to focus on innovation and newness around more natural, good-for-you and good-for-the-planet strategies, whether that's around the ingredients themselves or around the packaging. And so those will continue to be efforts that you'll hear -- that you'll see and hear us focus more on as we go forward. So hopefully, that helps in terms of how we're thinking about it."

So similar to what Andrew said, we feel very good about the categories that we operate in. Maybe if I touch on 4 or 5 things that have been really driving the comps, and then I'll address your question about innovation. So what's been really working for us to drive those comps are, firstly, better merchandise, particularly with a focus on good, better, best structures and really sharp opening price points. 
Second thing would be the improved brand positioning, moving from a position of, frankly, being irrelevant to being relevant for being -- for him to -- for her being more inclusive rather than exclusive. And the customer is really noticing and voting with their wallet. So that's great. 
I think thirdly, substantially better merchandise planning and allocation. When we're at our best, we go into the season only 50% bought, and then we chase into real-time winners. And that's worked very well for us in the back half of '20 and into '21. 
And then finally, I would say our enhanced digital capability and our store teams really showing up to make the best of the traffic that they have. Traffic is down significantly in stores, and our store teams have made a great effort to build on dollars per footstep. So those are things that have driven comp to date and will continue to drive comp. 
As it relates to innovation, we feel really good about lots of things that we've got in the hopper, particularly new bra frames. Victoria's, we haven't had new bra launches at the pace or rate that we should have had in the last 3 years, and we're getting back into newness in bras. We're also seeing new technology in fabrication. That's really helping. And of course, we like to think we're at the cutting edge of fashion and color and that we've chosen well in each of those 2 dimensions. So that's really what's driving the business. Thanks for the question, Lorraine."

So if you think about us aspiring to a $7 billion brand, we'd be spending $350 million supporting that brand across a wide range of activities. What's different about that is the way that we spend money in the modern era is completely different than the way we spent money historically. So you should see very significant change there. 
The second part of the question, remind me, Amie -- was about BOPIS. So as you know, we were late to the party on BOPIS and ship from store, but we are there now. So we now have about 100 stores up and running with both of those 2 activities. And we will be moving that to 200 stores by the end of June. That, we think, covers most of the nation. So both of those initiatives are exciting. Obviously, Buy Online Pickup In Store is well regarded by customers. But the ship from store is particularly interesting for us because it enables us to leverage inventory where it exists rather than where we'd like it to be. So very significant there.

And so we got some very critical learning around the capability as we went through the back half of 2020. 
As we come into 2021 now, we've been able to roll out the BOPIS capability to right around 400 stores as we finished off Q1, and we intend to roll that to an additional 100 stores by the end of the second quarter. Primarily, as you might imagine, this is a capability that appears to be most effective and both well received in our off-mall locations, where it's easier for the customer to drive up and enter the store without having to walk through the mall. And we also, in general, have more space in those locations in order to be able to accommodate the packing and checkout required for BOPIS. We're very, very pleased and excited. We've gotten both great qualitative feedback from customers on the capability, and the early financial results are also promising. So definitely something that we're excited about rolling out further. 
And as we think about the future and build-out, especially of our off-mall locations, we'll be taking into account how to design stores in order to even better accommodate the BOPIS and ship-from-store capabilities. Thank you."

And that's really because last year, we had essentially no semiannual sale activity versus this year, a more normal year with more normal approaches to the business, we will have that. 
So historically, if you look back at margin over Q2 compared to Q1, our merchandise margin has tended to decline quarter-over-quarter by about 400 to 500 basis points. And when we look back and compare to 2019, which is really what we're trying to do as a more normal year, that's the type of relationship that we would expect here in the second quarter."

What's also very pleasing is that as store traffic has started to pick up, our digital momentum has not slowed down. So all in all, feeling very positive about both channels of growth. 
Margin has been exceptional, as I said in my opening remarks, up about 900 basis points in merchandise margin to Q1. And we expect Q2 to be about the same level of increase year-over-year. In all major categories, margin growth is outpacing sales growth. So feeling good across the board. 
As it relates to the very back half of the year, don't know. We could expect to see some cost pressure. We might expect to see some impact from COVID in our base of supply. So we're deliberately not giving guidance on the back half of the year at this time. But what can can see for Q2 looks absolutely fine."

We have pretty good techniques for our estimation, so we feel pretty confident in that number. 
As it relates to the international business, the pickup is primarily due to 2 very significant areas of restructure that we put in place during the back half of the year and the early part of 2021. And these are obviously in the U.K. and China. In both cases, we have exited the losses in those businesses through some very, very good work to put them on a much more sound footing going forward. 
So with those losses behind us, we can really focus on the best bits of the business, which are in 2 areas. Firstly, the digital, meaning direct-to-consumer, where we currently ship to about 200 countries and territories around the world. And that business has been booming during COVID, and we see lots of opportunity for growth there, particularly moving to new languages. So we launched in Japanese and Korean within Q2. It should be good opportunities for us. 
And then secondly, in the franchise business, where we feel very good about the partners that we have operating businesses for us around the world. They've been through a tough time with many markets closed, particularly thinking about Continental Europe, very difficult. But the signs for the future are very strong in those regards. 
The one area of international that hasn't come back yet, and I'm not sure it will anytime soon, is travel retail. But happily, that's a relatively small part of our business and not one where we feel exposure from an operating income point of view. So across the board, feeling pretty optimistic, Simeon."

Thanks for the question, Roxanne. So I'm actually going to answer the second part of your question first, just to talk about general customer performance and growth because I think it plays into then our approach on the loyalty program that you were asking about. 
So as a reminder, when we talked about customers through the year in 2020, despite very, very strong customer response and reactivation through the back half of 2020 and based on the fact that our stores were essentially closed for 90 days in the first half of 2020, we did actually finish the year in customer count at Bath & Body Works down in the low single digits percentage-wise to last year. What's great news to be able to report is that tremendously strong performance in Q1 has not only closed that gap, but we're now running up low single digits on a rolling 12 basis to 2 years ago. And so a very nice turnaround based on strong customer acquisition and customer retention that we saw in really the last 3 quarters sequentially. 
So as we then think about, to your question, the loyalty program, the loyalty program is one that we have been piloting for the last several years. As a reminder, it's in just under 300 stores that we've been conducting those pilots in. And while we've been very pleased with the results in those areas, we have not been all that pleased with the flexibility of our loyalty application, the actual program itself. And so as discussed on prior calls, we are in the process of updating that program and that application. And we will be rolling it out to additional markets, about another 50-or-so stores later this year. And again, assuming good response to that, our intent would be to roll it out more fully sometime in 2022. 
The results that we see with that loyalty program even as it exists today, though, is better retention, obviously, of our customers and better overall responsiveness, both things that we'll really be excited to be able to further leverage once we have that program rolled out more fully."

I wanted to dig a bit more into how your thinking has shifted around VS margins now that you're managing to a mid-teens target. Could you walk us through how you got to the mid-teens as the appropriate level? And maybe how quickly you think VS can get there given its current trajectory? And as a quick follow-up, VS margins are clearly on a very robust trajectory right now as a result of the changes you've made. Is there any reason to expect that margin should not continue to expand relative to 2020 through the remainder of the year? Is there anything in the cost structure that needs to normalize the second half that might result in margins being flat or maybe down?"

I think you probably have the history, but our OI rate is close to our historical high for a Q1. So operating income at $245 million is about to where we were in 2017. Only 2016 was higher at $280 million. 
The 15.7% that we proved for that quarter, we feel good about that kind of level go forward. We've said that we expect to manage the business to a mid-teens operating income. That's below where we've been on the historical high. And that kind of reflects the need for some further investments in the business where we haven't made investment in the last few years because times have been tough. 
So we don't want to overpromise on the margin. We want to give ourselves some room to be able to reinvest in the business, particularly in marketing strategies, but also reinvestment in our stores, which have been somewhat light in terms of investment over recent years. 
The good news that I can tell you is that, that margin growth is across all categories, and we do expect it to continue into the back half of the year. All of that said, we don't want to get too fascinated with our merchandise margin rates being at peak highs. We want to be more satisfied with delighting our customers, making sure we're reinvesting in the brand and putting our best foot forward for the long term. But absolutely no reason to doubt that we can operate this brand in the mid-teens."

And in particular -- the PINK business particularly accelerated towards the back half of the quarter and is having an excellent May. So super strong performance, really good reaction to the new merchandise that Amy and the team have developed, but also to the brand positioning that they are pursuing. 
I think that, that strength is driven more by good fashion, being in good categories and delivering great marketing strategies rather than a return to campus. So we don't -- in campuses and towns and cities where we see a higher level of return of students, we don't really see a difference in performance there. The same is true with states where COVID has been relaxed. We're not really seeing a material difference. 
So what that tells us is the main thing is the main thing in the fashion business, which is having good merchandise and good marketing. So feel great about that. I think if Amy was on the call, she would remind me to point out that the growth has been particularly strong in intimates because that's our core. So double-digit comp same-store sales growth in our intimates business. 
Super strong performance in the logo business, which is particularly encouraging for the health of the brand. And maybe a couple of other snippets would be shorts are in. It's a good season for shorts. It's a good season for tiete. It's a good season for yellow. And we've been on all of those trends. So big congrats to the PINK team. 
As it relates to the Victoria's business, yes, lounge has been great for us during COVID, and we intend to continue to invest in that category. The merchants in that area have just done a superb job. And we're starting to get to the point where we say, ""Wow, our stores are too small again"" because there's so much good merchandise coming. 
All of that said, we are a bra business. We are fundamentally a lingerie business. The most important category for us to win in is the bra business, and that has the most attention around here. And we're determined to win back customers in that core category of intimates. And what we're seeing in terms of results is that, that is working. 
So the mantra that I would remind you, Susan, is growth from the core, most important. Sports bras, we've been underweight. It's a category where we've been too light. We haven't had enough investment, and we will be course correcting that in the back half of the year. Hope that helps."

I'll try and be brief. 
It starts with the notion of redefining our purpose. We have a clear reason why we exist at Victoria's now, and that is to inspire women around the world with products and experiences that uplift them and champion them and support their journey. It's their narrative, not ours. 
And so how will we accomplish that? Well, we think about it in terms of creating lifelong relationships with women by reflecting what's important to them, what journey they're on, what stage in their life they're at, and perhaps more importantly, creating positive change for women through the power of our products and our platform and also our advocacy. So advocacy is a big, big word for us going forward. And I have a bold ambition that Victoria's should be the world's biggest and best advocate for women. And that's incredibly powerful vision and mission for us to aim towards, and it's energizing for all of our people. And it does reflects a very significant turnaround from where we've been, where we're moving from what men want to what women want. We're moving from sexy for a few to sexy for all. We're moving from a look to a feeling. It's about including most women rather than excluding most women and being grounded in real life rather than mostly unattainable. 
So I couldn't underscore how significant this turnaround and this repositioning is. It's a very dramatic change for us, and we have significant proof points already at this early stage in our journey that this is what the customer wants from us. So expect more. Thanks, Marni."

We delivered record results in the first quarter, and we could not have done so without the continued dedication and extraordinary efforts of our team of associates and partners. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 significantly exceeded our initial earnings guidance of $0.35 to $0.45, driven by stronger sales and higher merchandise margin rates than we initially forecasted. 
Performance was strong across the whole quarter. March benefited from stimulus payments hitting customer bank accounts, and we ended the quarter strong with good Mother's Day holiday performance at both businesses.  
At Bath & Body Works, we continue to deliver record results. Our U.S. and Canada stores increased sales by 47% compared to 2019, and our direct channel sales increased 123% versus 2019. All categories achieved solid growth, and strong sales demand continued to allow us to pull back on promotional activity.  
Operating income in the first quarter was $380 million, an increase of 127% compared to 2019. Our operating income rate for the quarter of 25.9% increased 760 basis points compared to 2019, driven by merchandise margin rate expansion and leverage in both buying and occupancy and SG&A on the high sales growth.  
As we announced last week, our Board has unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into 2 independent public companies: Bath & Body Works, one of the world's leading bath, body and home fragrance retailers; and Victoria's Secret, including Victoria's Secret Lingerie, PINK and Victoria's Secret Beauty, a leading retailer of intimates and beauty products. 
We expect to create these companies through a tax-free spin-off of Victoria's Secret to L Brands' shareholders. We believe the spin-off will enable each company to maximize management focus and financial flexibility to thrive in an evolving retail environment and to deliver profitable growth.  
The Board evaluated the possibility of either a spin-off or a sale of Victoria's Secret with input from its financial advisers, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Throughout the review process, the company received significant interest from and held substantive discussions with multiple potential buyers. Ultimately, the Board concluded that the spin-off of Victoria's Secret into a separate public company would provide shareholders with more value than a sale. 
This decision follows a significant progress we have made over the last 10 months in the turnaround of the Victoria's Secret business, implementing merchandise and marketing initiatives to drive top line growth as well as executing on a series of cost-reduction actions, which together have dramatically increased profitability. As a result of these efforts, Victoria's Secret is now well positioned to operate as a stand-alone public company.  
We expect that the balance of 2021 will not be easy as the world, the retail environment and our enterprise and business continue to evolve and we lap extraordinary results. But with continued smart and disciplined management of the business, I know we can proactively accelerate to our next phase of growth. We're excited to share the details of our vision for both companies as we get closer to the targeted spin-off date in August.  
Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Martin."

Compared to 2019, operating income increased by $213 million or 665% to $245 million, with an operating income rate of 15.7%. 
Customers are noticing and applauding our efforts to reposition the brand. We began that work by listening both to our customers and to our associates. We heard from them what they love about our brand, including the unmatched beauty, quality, fit and innovation in our products. And we also heard clearly what they want from us as a brand, which is all about representing and celebrating all women and being there for every moment of their life, including supporting and advocating the things that matter most to them, and that's exactly what we're doing.  
We're committed to creating lifelong relationships with customers by reflecting them, their stories, their journey, in everything we do. And you're starting to see those changes come to life, most recently with our Mother's Day campaign, our Bombshell Because campaign and the PINK mental health month campaign, which are all great examples of how we're reflecting, celebrating and championing our customers and the different moments and dimensions of their lives.  
Our team is fully dedicated to this repositioning work, and we could not be more excited about where we're going. I look forward to sharing more details as the work progresses. 
We're also heavily focused on the great work that's being done to rebuild a happy and healthy culture at Victoria's. While much has already been accomplished, I'm highly energized by the opportunities that we have in front of us to reposition and grow this iconic brand as a stand-alone public business.  
And with that, I'll thank you and pass it over to Amie."

So to your point, yes, we continue to see tremendous growth out of our Bath & Body Works online business. As we just reported, results on a 2-year basis for the direct channel were up 123% in the first quarter, and that's after the full year 2020 where the business essentially doubled. So very pleased with the momentum we continue to see there. 
As you referenced, we are continuing to increase dramatically our fulfillment capacity. We were surprised to the upside last year at the beginning of the pandemic. And while our partners did a great job of expanding capacity throughout the year, we referenced in our script that we were a little bit backlogged at the end of the first quarter last year. And so we'll feel some of that impact on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. 
But as we're looking out to the long term, while we've been very, very satisfied with our ability to work with third-party providers on our fulfillment capability, we also recognize as this business becomes larger and larger, we want the opportunity to also have some of the capability in-house, which is why we are adding the additional center that you're referencing. While we'll start to work in that center through the year this year, it really won't be online for full capacity until the back half of 2022. 
So while we'll get some benefit from it in early 2022, it's really preparing for the holiday peak at the end of next year that we'll be reliant on that new capability. We're also adding a lot of automation into that center, which will be new and cutting edge for us as we continue to figure out how to operate all of our fulfillment centers as both efficiently and effectively as possible go forward."

At the highest level, I would reiterate that the way we look at our business across all of our businesses is asking ourselves the question first, are we, in fact, in the right categories. And as you can imagi",465,"Sure. So thank you for the question, Lorraine. At the highest level, I would reiterate that the way we look at our business across all of our businesses is asking ourselves the question first, are we, in fact, in the right categories. And as you can imagine, especially here over the last 18 months, the strong answer to that question for the Bath & Body Works business has been an absolute yes, whether it's the soap and sanitizer business that obviously has gotten a lot of momentum appropriately here during the pandemic; but then also our home fragrance business as people have shifted their lifestyles to be spending a lot more time at home; and then our body care business, which represents a real opportunity for people to treat themselves and to have a spa day, if you will, without ever leaving the house. 
And so certainly, those have been great product categories to be in, in the short term here. But we also look at those categories in terms of where they've been over the last 10 years, which has been consistent growth in each of those 3 big market categories. And as we look out into the future, we continue to see a lot of opportunity for growth across the categories themselves, and therefore, our ability to continue to gain and maintain very high market shares in each of them. 
As we think about what innovation will look like within the categories, we are very, very reliant on big key items within our big categories. And those key items represent a disproportionate share of our business. About 75% of our business comes from our biggest 10 or 11 items. So one of the things we're always looking at is the opportunity to launch new key items within our existing categories. So that is certainly something that you'll continue to see us work on whether, for example, things like moisturizing body wash or bar soap or additional candle and soap forms beyond the big forms that we already operate in. 
And then we're obviously very interested in, what I'll call, adjacent white space to our big 3 existing categories. And so we're constantly testing into things like hair care and skin care that are, again, large market cap areas of opportunity from a mid- to long-term basis. 
The last thing I would emphasize is that across all of our product categories, we're also continuing to focus on innovation and newness around more natural, good-for-you and good-for-the-planet strategies, whether that's around the ingredients themselves or around the packaging. And so those will continue to be efforts that you'll hear -- that you'll see and hear us focus more on as we go forward. So hopefully, that helps in terms of how we're thinking about it."

So similar to what Andrew said, we feel very good about the categories that we operate in. Maybe if I touch on 4 or 5 things that have been really driving the comps, and then I'll address your question about innovation. So what's been really working for us to drive those comps are, firstly, better merchandise, particularly with a focus on good, better, best structures and really sharp opening price points. 
Second thing would be the improved brand positioning, moving from a position of, frankly, being irrelevant to being relevant, for being for him to for her, being more inclusive rather than exclusive. And the customer is really noticing and voting with their wallet. So that's great. 
I think thirdly, substantially better merchandise planning and allocation. When we're at our best, we go into the season only 50% bought and then we chase into real-time winners. And that's worked very well for us in the back half of '20 and into '21. 
And then finally, I would say our enhanced digital capability and our store teams really showing up to make the best of the traffic that they have. Traffic is down significantly in stores, and our store teams have made a great effort to build on dollars per footstep. So those are things that have driven comp to date and will continue to drive comp. 
As it relates to innovation, we feel really good about lots of things that we've got in the hopper, particularly new bra frames. At Victoria's, we haven't had new bra launches at the pace or rate that we should have had in the last 3 years, and we're getting back into newness in bras. We're also seeing new technology in fabrication. That's really helping. And of course, we like to think we're at the cutting edge of fashion and color and that we've chosen well in each of those 2 dimensions. So that's really what's driving the business. Thanks for the question, Lorraine."

So we were able to roll that out in a limited way last year, really primarily in markets that were either fully shut down or experienced very, very tight capacity constraints. And so we got some very critical learning around the capability as we went through the back half of 2020. 
As we come into 2021 now, we've been able to roll out the BOPIS capability to right around 400 stores as we finished off Q1, and we intend to roll that to an additional 100 stores by the end of the second quarter. Primarily, as you might imagine, this is a capability that appears to be most effective and both well received in our off-mall locations, where it's easier for the customer to drive up and enter the store without having to walk through the mall. And we also, in general, have more space in those locations in order to be able to accommodate the packing and checkout required for BOPIS. 
We're very, very pleased and excited. We've gotten both great qualitative feedback from customers on the capability, and the early financial results are also promising. So definitely something that we're excited about rolling out further. And as we think about the future and build-out, especially of our off-mall locations, we'll be taking into account how to design stores in order to even better accommodate the BOPIS and ship-from-store capabilities.

So when we think about -- I'll comment on merchandise margin, if that's helpful. From a standpoint of merchandise margin improvement that we saw through 2020, as you know, was very significant as we were able to pull back dramatically on promotional activity. And that momentum, as we called out, also continued into the second quarter. 
We would not expect the second quarter merchandise margin on a year-over-year basis to improve. And that's really because last year, we had essentially no semiannual sale activity versus this year, a more normal year with more normal approaches to the business, we will have that. 
So historically, if you look back at margin over -- Q2 compared to Q1, our merchandise margin has tended to decline quarter-over-quarter by about 400 to 500 basis points. And when we look back and compare to 2019, which is really what we're trying to do as a more normal year, that's the type of relationship that we would expect here in the second quarter."

So we accelerated into the back half of the first quarter, meaning that the latter 2 months were stronger than the first month. And May has been about the same as we saw from April, and that's really encouraging given that the stimulus effect has obviously been done and is behind us. So we're seeing very good momentum that we expect to continue. 
What's also very pleasing is that as store traffic has started to pick up, our digital momentum has not slowed down. So all in all, feeling very positive about both channels of growth. 
Margin has been exceptional, as I said in my opening remarks, up about 900 basis points in merchandise margin to Q1. And we expect Q2 to be about the same level of increase year-over-year. In all major categories, margin growth is outpacing sales growth. So feeling good across the board. 
As it relates to the very back half of the year, don't know. We could expect to see some cost pressure. We might expect to see some impact from COVID in our base of supply. So we're deliberately not giving guidance on the back half of the year at this time. But what can see for Q2 looks absolutely fine."

So the flow-through on the stimulus sales was really impressive for both brands. So interestingly, higher at Victoria's. Can you speak to the right way to think about incremental margins at this point? Maybe what in that math is onetime versus more structural and a sustainable reset? And then the VS International operating loss shifting to breakeven was great to see. Congrats on those initiatives. How are you thinking about international profitability or pressure going forward?"

So the stimulus effect was about 1/3 of our beat to the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the quarter. So we think about where we were at the beginning of the quarter and where we ended up, about 1/3 of that beat was due to stimulus, we estimate. We have pretty good techniques for our estimation, so we feel pretty confident in that number. 
As it relates to the international business, the pickup is primarily due to 2 very significant areas of restructure that we put in place during the back half of the year and the early part of 2021. And these are obviously in the U.K. and China. In both cases, we have exited the losses in those businesses through some very, very good work to put them on a much more sound footing going forward. 
So with those losses behind us, we can really focus on the best bits of the business, which are in 2 areas. Firstly, the digital, meaning direct-to-consumer, where we currently ship to about 200 countries and territories around the world. And that business has been booming during COVID. And we see lots of opportunity for growth there, particularly moving to new languages. So we launched in Japanese and Korean within Q2. It should be good opportunities for us. 
And then secondly in the franchise business, where we feel very good about the partners that we have, operating businesses for us around the world. They've been through a tough time with many markets closed, particularly thinking about Continental Europe, very difficult. But the signs for the future are very strong in those regards. 
The one area of international that hasn't come back yet, and I'm not sure it will anytime soon, is travel retail. But happily, that's a relatively small part of our business and not one where we feel exposure from an operating income point of view. So across the board, feeling pretty optimistic, Simeon."

My question is for both Andrew and Martin. I'm just wondering, any initiatives or general updates around customer loyalty and loyalty programs that you can share for each brand? I know that for BBW, it's something that you are testing. Probably the past year hasn't been a great environment to expand that. But curious to get an update as you're thinking about generating that customer loyalty program. And then any steps that you can share about new customer acquisition over the past year, which I'm assuming was fairly robust online?"

Thanks for the question, Roxanne. So I'm actually going to answer the second part of your question first, just to talk about general customer performance and growth because I think it plays into then our approach on the loyalty program that you were asking about. 
So as a reminder, when we talked about customers through the year in 2020, despite very, very strong customer response and reactivation through the back half of 2020 and based on the fact that our stores were essentially closed for 90 days in the first half of 2020, we did actually finish the year in customer count at Bath & Body Works down in the low single digits percentage-wise to last year. 
What's great news to be able to report is that tremendously strong performance in Q1 has not only closed that gap, but we're now running up low single digits on a rolling 12 basis to 2 years ago. And so a very nice turnaround based on strong customer acquisition and customer retention that we saw in really the last 3 quarters sequentially. 
So as we then think about, to your question, the loyalty program, the loyalty program is one that we have been piloting for the last several years. As a reminder, it's in just under 300 stores that we've been conducting those pilots in. And while we've been very pleased with the results in those areas, we have not been all that pleased with the flexibility of our loyalty application, the actual program itself. 
And so as discussed on prior calls, we are in the process of updating that program and that application. And we will be rolling it out to additional markets, about another 50-or-so stores later this year. And again, assuming good response to that, our intent would be to roll it out more fully sometime in 2022. 
The results that we see with that loyalty program even as it exists today, though, is better retention, obviously, of our customers and better overall responsiveness, both things that we will really be excited to be able to further leverage once we have that program rolled out more fully."

And I'm delighted to tell you that after several seasons of decline in the size of our customer file, in the last 1/3 of the year, we've actually seen an increase in our customer file. So that is incredibly encouraging proof points that our repositioning is working. 
As you know, I think our loyalty is tied to a credit card. And that's fine. We enjoy great success and great customer advocacy and communication through that tool. But we are committed to getting into a loyalty program that will not be tied to the credit card. And we will have tests in place on that towards the end of this year, stroke early in 2022.

The 15.7% that we proved for that quarter, we feel good about that kind of level go forward. We've said that we expect to manage the business to a mid-teens operating income. That's below where we've been on the historical high. And that kind of reflects the need for some further investments in the business where we haven't made investment in the last few years because times have been tough. 
So we don't want to overpromise on the margin. We want to give ourselves some room to be able to reinvest in the business, particularly in marketing strategies, but also reinvestment in our stores, which have been somewhat light in terms of investment over recent years. 
The good news that I can tell you is that, that margin growth is across all categories, and we do expect it to continue into the back half of the year. All of that said, we don't want to get too fascinated with our merchandise margin rates being at peak highs. We want to be more satisfied with delighting our customers, making sure we're reinvesting in the brand and putting our best foot forward for the long term.

And in particular -- the PINK business particularly accelerated towards the back half of the quarter and is having an excellent May. So super strong performance, really good reaction to the new merchandise that Amy and the team have developed, but also to the brand positioning that they are pursuing. 
I think that, that strength is driven more by good fashion, being in good categories and delivering great marketing strategies rather than a return to campus. So we don't -- in campuses and towns and cities where we see a higher level of return of students, we don't really see a difference in performance there. The same is true with states where COVID has been relaxed, we're not really seeing a material difference. 
So what that tells us is the main thing is the main thing in the fashion business, which is having good merchandise and good marketing. So feel great about that. I think if Amy was on the call, she would remind me to point out that the growth has been particularly strong in intimates because that's our core. So double-digit comp same-store sales growth in our intimates business. 
Super strong performance in the logo business, which is particularly encouraging for the health of the brand. And maybe a couple of other snippets would be shorts are in. It's a good season for shorts. It's a good season for tie-dyes. It's a good season for yellow. And we've been on all of those trends. So big congrats to the PINK team. 
As it relates to the Victoria's business, yes, lounge has been great for us during COVID, and we intend to continue to invest in that category. The merchants in that area have just done a superb job. And we're starting to get to the point where we say, ""Wow, our stores are too small again"" because there's so much good merchandise coming. 
All of that said, we are a bra business. We are fundamentally a lingerie business. The most important category for us to win in is the bra business, and that has the most attention around here. And we're determined to win back customers in that core category of intimates. And what we're seeing in terms of results is that, that is working. 
So the mantra that I would remind you of, Susan, is growth from the core, most important. Sports bras, we've been underweight. It's a category where we've been too light. We haven't had enough investment, and we will be course-correcting that in the back half of the year. Hope that helps."

And so how will we accomplish that? Well, we think about it in terms of creating lifelong relationships with women by reflecting what's important to them, what journey they're on, what stage in their life they're at, and perhaps more importantly, creating positive change for women through the power of our products and our platform. And also our advocacy. So advocacy is a big, big word for us going forward.

And that's incredibly powerful vision and mission for us to aim towards, and it's energizing for all of our people. And it does reflects a very significant turnaround from where we've been, where we're moving from what men want to what women want. We're moving from sexy for a few to sexy for all. We're moving from a look to a feeling. It's about including most women rather than excluding most women and being grounded in real life rather than mostly unattainable.

The spin decision was made about 10 days ago. We're working with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs on the subjects you asked about. VS is going to have some debt. The proceeds of that debt will be dividended to LB. We want the leverage for both VS and BBW to be well balanced and to compare appropriately to their respective peers. And it's a work in process. And it's all worked that the Board will review and approve as we move through the next month or 2. 
You asked a specific question about BBW go-forward leverage. The range that you mentioned seems about right. But again, it's preliminary. We've got a little bit more work to do. We're going to strike the right balance and more discussion to come with the Board. Thank you, Bill."

We are thrilled to have reached this milestone and to launch Bath & Body Works as a stand-alone company. Innovation remains at the foundation of Bath & Body Works. And with our leadership positions across key product categories, strong performance across channels and a highly loyal and growing customer base, we are poised to continue our track record of industry-leading growth and profitability.
On behalf of the management team and the Board, I'd like to extend our sincere appreciation to all the associates who have worked so hard on the successful spin-off of Victoria's Secret. I am grateful to all of our associates for their contributions to the success of our business as we look forward to capturing the opportunities ahead and we wish the Victoria's Secret business and associates well as they embark on their journey as a stand-alone public company.
Turning to our second quarter performance. we delivered record results, and we could not have done so without the continued hard work and commitment of all of our associates and partners. We'd like to express our deep appreciation for their dedication and efforts.
We reported record second quarter earnings of $1.34 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share last year. These bottom line results were driven by continued strong sales and better-than-expected margin rates at both Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. At Bath & Body Works, we continue to deliver record results, with sales growth of 54% compared to 2019. All categories achieved solid growth and strong sales demand continued to allow us to pull back on promotional activity versus 2019.
The Bath & Body Works segment, operating income in the second quarter was $431 million, an increase of 135% or $247 million compared to 2019 and an increase of 24% or $82 million compared to last year. Our operating income rate for the quarter of 25.3% increased 870 basis points compared to 2019, driven by merchandise margin rate expansion and leverage in both buying and occupancy and SG&A on the high sales growth.
We expect that the remainder of 2021 will not be easy as the world, the real environment and our business continue to evolve and as we lap extraordinary 2020 results. We are optimistic about our fall and holiday product assortment and our continued ability to execute against our plans in stores and online. Risks related to COVID do persist and we will continue to operate both of our channels in a safe manner for our customers and our associates. With continued smart disciplined management of the business, I know we can proactively accelerate to our next phase of growth.
Thank you very much, and I'll turn it over to Amie Preston."

It was previously reported in the other segment. The vast majority of that $25 million is SG&A, so it will be included in SG&A. But the guidance we shared last night is all inclusive of those 2 pieces. So the BBW segment and the corporate overhead.
The other point I would make go forward is we've also disclosed that as we look to separate the 2 businesses, one of the key areas of focus is in the technology area. We do anticipate over a multiyear period that we will incur $100 million to $150 million of cost that will be both capital and expense. That will be a multiyear period, and we'll be working with Victoria's to make sure that we separate the technology in a way that doesn't disrupt business and minimizes the deleverage, but that will be incorporated into our guidance as we go forth into 2022."

But again, we feel very comfortable in those long-term mid- to high single-digit revenue growth rate targets that we provided.
On the promotional side, what I would say there is consistent with how we plan every season. We go into a season with what we hope is a conservative plan, intending to essentially anniversary similar promotional activity from prior year. And then we use our in-season read-and-react capability around testing and constant analysis of our results to determine whether or not we need to increase or have the opportunity to decrease levels of promotion. As you'll remember, in the back half of last year, we were in chase mode for the entire time frame and had very little promotional activity, record low levels of promotional activity, and that's what we're lapping.
So our forecast does assume both a return to a slightly more promotional environment than what we would have experienced last year. And as we delineated in our prepared remarks, we are also seeing some inflationary pressures that will impact our margin as well. Both of those factors are embedded in our guidance."

Again, our total sales performance for the quarter was slightly above our expectations with, I would say, direct, more or less in line or digital, more or less in line with our expectations and stores continuing to perform slightly above our expectations. But again, strong results out of both.
As a reminder, our digital business in the second quarter on a 2-year basis was up 128% to 2019. That was actually slightly better than the performance it saw in Q1, and our stores were up around 39% in Q2, very close to what we achieved in Q1.
In terms of the soap and sanitizer business, as we think about that, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, it did decline on a 1-year basis in Q2 of this year. However, on a 2-year basis, it's continued to be up strongly, up 58% to 2 years ago, which was higher than the total business at up 54% to 2 years ago. Again, as expected, it declined year-over-year where last year, it was experiencing explosive growth.
Our forecast go forward does assume that we'll continue to see some softening in that business on a year-over-year basis. As we talked about at the end of last year, soaps and sanitizer in total had gotten to be about 20% of the total business, up from roughly 14% of the business in the prior 5-year time frame, we would expect that it will normalize somewhere in the mid-teens and that's consistent with what we've seen here through the first 2 quarters of the year. But again, what I would highlight is we were very pleased that even as that business, as expected, softened year-over-year we were able to more than overcome that offset that with strong growth out of our other categories, leading to the total growth that we articulated."

So one, after seeing a year in 2020 where we actually saw fewer customers than we had in the prior year because of the 90-day closure of all of our stores in the first half of 2020. We have now seen 4 quarters in a row of customer growth. And so on a rolling 12 basis, we're now up in customers pretty significantly to where we had finished the year in 2019 and obviously, in 2020. And in terms of the behavior and the profile of those customers, I would say the good news is that the new customers that we've gained along that journey.
While early in their spending habits with Bath & Body Works do appear to be performing very similarly to historical new customers. And our existing customers, as we've talked about on prior calls and in our Investor Days, we've continued to see improvement in their engagements in terms of both their willingness to shop across our 2 channels, digital and in-store as well as to shop across all 3 of our major categories.
So again, we continue to see higher and higher ratios of our customers performing in those 2 ways. And when that occurs, as we've shared customer spend is significantly higher than either a single channel or a single category customer. So very pleased with what we've been able to see so far in terms of the customer behavior that we're experiencing here as we move in through 2021."

So on the first part of your question, as we talked about pretty thoroughly, in our Investor Day as we laid out our multiyear path to driving Bath & Body Works to become a $10 billion business over the next 3 to 5 years. We're really not all that reliant on seeing a yet-to-be-determined category emerge as a strong driver of growth. That said, we have lots of different ideas in the pipeline that we will be looking to test over the next several years. And from a testing standpoint, different than where we may have done things historically, which would have been small cells of store groups.
We'll also be looking to test new product categories in our online digital business as well. As we've talked about, those ideas run the gamut from potentially getting into the skin care business, getting into the hair care business, looking at further line extensions within the home business, whether that's into cleaning products or laundry products, et cetera.
So lots of different ideas that are, again, in the pipeline. We will be testing those as we had discussed prior in both a organic internal development way as well as partnering with third-party brands to sell in our stores to understand which of those categories might emerge as something that the Bath & Body Works customer has the most interest in.
So again, lots of different things in the pipeline. Most of those tests that I'm describing will be ramping up a little bit more in the back half of this year, but much more in 2022 and beyond.
In terms of your question on AUR. So AUR on a 2-year basis for the business up over 20%, and units up a comparable amount on a 2-year basis. On a 1-year basis, we did see more expansion out of units with obviously, the stores having been closed last year. AUR was still up slightly to last year, but more similar in line on a 1-year basis. Hopefully that helps."

But there will be -- there are and will be real cost increases that the business faces and they run the gamut from product input costs to wage pressure to transportation pressure to supply pressure.
On the product input portion, as you know, we work very hard on our ticketing strategy and our promotional strategies, historically, to try to offset cost increases, and we'll certainly try to do that again this quarter and the rest of this year. I think it's important to understand, though, that the base from which we're coming is one where there was so much less promotional activity in the history last year already that curtailing even more promotional activity will be that much more challenging. So a long-winded way to say that our margin forecasts do assume that quite a bit of that inflationary pressure will actually come through to the bottom line."

We are thrilled to have reached this milestone and to launch Bath & Body Works as a stand-alone company. Innovation remains at the foundation of Bath & Body Works. And with our leadership positions across key product categories, strong performance across channels and a highly loyal and growing customer base, we are poised to continue our track record of industry-leading growth and profitability. 
On behalf of the management team and the Board, I'd like to extend our sincere appreciation to all the associates who have worked so hard on the successful spin-off of Victoria's Secret. I am grateful to all of our associates for their contributions to the success of our business as we look forward to capturing the opportunities ahead, and we wish the Victoria's Secret business and associates well as they embark on their journey as a stand-alone public company.  
Turning to our second quarter performance. We delivered record results, and we could not have done so without the continued hard work and commitment of all of our associates and partners. We'd like to express our deep appreciation for their dedication and efforts. We reported record second quarter earnings of $1.34 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share last year. These bottom line results were driven by continued strong sales and better-than-expected margin rates at both Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. 
At Bath & Body Works, we continue to deliver record results, with sales growth of 54% compared to 2019. All categories achieved solid growth, and strong sales demand continued to allow us to pull back on promotional activity versus 2019. The Bath & Body Works' segment operating income in the second quarter was $431 million, an increase of 135% or $247 million compared to 2019 and an increase of 24% or $82 million compared to last year. Our operating income rate for the quarter of 25.3% increased 870 basis points compared to 2019, driven by merchandise margin rate expansion and leverage in both buying and occupancy and SG&A on the high sales growth.  
We expect that the remainder of 2021 will not be easy as the world, the real environment and our business continue to evolve and as we lap extraordinary 2020 results. We are optimistic about our fall and holiday product assortment and our continued ability to execute against our plans in stores and online. Risks related to COVID do persist, and we will continue to operate both of our channels in a safe manner for our customers and our associates. With continued smart and disciplined management of the business, I know we can proactively accelerate to our next phase of growth.  
Thank you very much, and I'll turn it over to Amie Preston."

The other point I would make, go forward, is we've also disclosed that, as we look to separate the 2 businesses, one of the key areas of focus is in the technology area. We do anticipate over a multiyear period that we will incur $100 million to $150 million of costs that will be both capital and expense. That will be a multiyear period. And we'll be working with Victoria's to make sure that we separate the technology in a way that doesn't disrupt either business and minimizes the deleverage, but that will be incorporated into our guidance as we go forth into 2022."

But again, we feel very comfortable in those long-term mid- to high single-digit revenue growth rate targets that we provided.  
On the promotional side, what I would say there is, consistent with how we plan every season, we go into a season with what we hope is a conservative plan, intending to essentially anniversary similar promotional activity from prior year. And then we use our in-season read-and-react capability around testing and constant analysis of our results to determine whether or not we need to increase or have the opportunity to decrease levels of promotion. 
As you'll remember, in the back half of last year, we were in chase mode for the entire time frame and had very little promotional activity, record-low levels of promotional activity, and that's what we're lapping. So our forecast does assume both a return to a slightly more promotional environment than what we would have experienced last year. And as we delineated in our prepared remarks, we are also seeing some inflationary pressures that will impact our margin as well. Both of those factors are embedded in our guidance."

So to your question on channel mix within the second quarter versus our expectations, again, our total sales performance for the quarter was slightly above our expectations with, I would say, direct more or less in line -- or digital more or less in line with our expectations and stores continuing to perform slightly above our expectations. But again, strong results out of both.  
As a reminder, our digital business in the second quarter on a 2-year basis was up 128% to 2019. That was actually slightly better than the performance it saw in Q1, and our stores were up around 39% in Q2, very close to what we achieved in Q1.  
In terms of the soap and sanitizer business, as we think about that, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, it did decline on a 1-year basis in Q2 of this year. However, on a 2-year basis, it's continued to be up strongly, up 58% to 2 years ago, which was higher than the total business at up 54% to 2 years ago. Again, as expected, it declined year-over-year, where, last year, it was experiencing explosive growth.  
Our forecast, go forward, does assume that we'll continue to see some softening in that business on a year-over-year basis. As we talked about at the end of last year, soaps and sanitizer, in total, had gotten to be about 20% of the total business, up from roughly 14% of the business in the prior 5-year time frame. We would expect that it will normalize somewhere in the mid-teens, and that's consistent with what we've seen here through the first 2 quarters of the year. 
But again, what I would highlight is we were very pleased that, even as that business, as expected, softened year-over-year, we were able to more than overcome that, offset that with strong growth out of our other categories, leading to the total growth that we articulated."

The fourth quarter is extremely important to us in terms of cash flow generation. And I'm not sure, history is the best guide here, just given that the business has grown so much as you look at it over a multiyear basis.  
So I'd say, what we're planning to do is we'll get through the important fourth quarter period to generate cash. We -- as we flip the calendar to 2022, we will look at our cash flow, and we'll think about capital allocation and what that means go forward. 
In terms of our plans for the fall season, we -- as we announced today, we're executing a tender offer for the $500 million. In addition, we have about $770 million remaining on our $1.5 billion authorization that we announced in July. So our intent is to execute that $770 million over the fall season in a balanced way. And again, as we get to the end of the holiday period, we'll work with our Board of Directors to determine capital allocation prospectively."

And in the second quarter, where we saw the decline in soaps and sanitizers, obviously, that was true. I do think it's important to point out, though, that body care, our other big category, are actually seeing very strong year-over-year growth as well as on a 2-year growth basis as well, which really gets, I think, to the heart of your question around what have we seen in terms of the customers that we've gained through the pandemic and how has their behavior compare relative to our prior-to-pandemic existing customer base.  
And I think the good news there is a couple of points. So one, after seeing a year in 2020 where we actually saw fewer customers than we had in the prior year because of the 90-day closure of all of our stores in the first half of 2020, we have now seen 4 quarters in a row of customer growth. And so on a rolling 12 basis, we're now up in customers pretty significantly to where we had finished the year in 2019 and, obviously, in 2020. 
And in terms of the behavior and the profile of those customers, I would say the good news is that the new customers that we've gained along that journey, while early in their spending habits with Bath & Body Works, do appear to be performing very similarly to historical new customers. And our existing customers, as we've talked about on prior calls and in our Investor Days, we've continued to see improvement in their engagements in terms of both their willingness to shop across our 2 channels, digital and in-store, as well as to shop across all 3 of our major categories.  
So again, we continue to see higher and higher ratios of our customers performing in those 2 ways. And when that occurs, as we've shared, customer spend is significantly higher than either a single-channel or a single-category customer. So very pleased with what we've been able to see so far in terms of the customer behavior that we're experiencing here as we move in through 2021."

So on the first part of your question, as we talked about pretty thoroughly in our Investor Day, as we laid out our multiyear path to driving Bath & Body Works to become a $10 billion business over the next 3 to 5 years, we're really not all that reliant on seeing a yet-to-be-determined category emerge as a strong driver of growth. That said, we have lots of different ideas in the pipeline that we will be looking to test over the next several years. 
And from a testing standpoint, different than where we may have done things historically, which would have been small cells of store groups.  We'll also be looking to test new product categories in our online digital business as well. As we've talked about, those ideas run the gamut from potentially getting into the skin care business, getting into the hair care business, looking at further line extensions within the home business, whether that's into cleaning products or laundry products, et cetera. 
So lots of different ideas that are, again, in the pipeline. We will be testing those, as we had discussed prior, in both a organic internal development way as well as partnering with third-party brands to sell in our stores, to understand which of those categories might emerge as something that the Bath & Body Works' customer has the most interest in. So again, lots of different things in the pipeline. Most of those tests that I'm describing will be ramping up a little bit more in the back half of this year, but much more in 2022 and beyond.  
In terms of your question on AUR. So AUR, on a 2-year basis, for the business, up over 20%, and units up a comparable amount on a 2-year basis. On a 1-year basis, we did see more expansion out of units with, obviously, the stores having been closed last year. AUR was still up slightly to last year, but more similar, in line, on a 1-year basis. Hopefully that helps."

On the product input portion, we work very hard on our ticketing strategy and our promotional strategies, historically, to try to offset cost increases. And we'll certainly try to do that again this quarter and the rest of this year. I think it's important to understand, though, that the base from which we're coming is one where there was so much less promotional activity in the history last year already, that curtailing even more promotional activity will be that much more challenging. So a long-winded way to say that our margin forecasts do assume that quite a bit of that inflationary pressure will actually come through to the bottom line."

Turning to our third quarter performance. We delivered strong results, and we could not have done so without the continued hard work and commitment of our associates and partners in stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, call centers, at our vendors and our offices. We'd like to express our deep appreciation for their ongoing dedication and efforts. 
We reported adjusted third quarter earnings from continuing operations of $0.92 per share compared to $0.83 per share last year. This result significantly exceeded our third quarter guidance for earnings per share between $0.55 and $0.60. The upside versus our guidance was driven by better-than-forecasted sales and a higher merchandise margin rate. 
We continued our strong momentum in the third quarter. Net sales were $1.681 billion, a decline of just 1% versus last year's exceptionally strong results and a 53% increase compared to 2019, which was consistent with the 2-year growth we delivered in the first half of the year. 
Performance was strong across all months of the quarter as we saw good customer response to our fall seasonal and Halloween merchandise. We also launched 2 new fragrances in the third quarter, Fairytale and Open Sky, both of which exceeded our expectations. 
We are satisfied with our inventory position as we head into holiday. While we are better positioned than most retailers due to our primarily domestic supply chain, we are not immune to challenges. We have proactively managed production and promotions throughout the third quarter and did not experience significant out of stocks. And we do expect our assortments to be full and abundant for holiday. We are partnering closely with our vendors to support production needs in order to continue to meet customer demand. 
In terms of our product offering and marketing stories, we invite you to watch a video showcasing our holiday assortment, which we posted to our website this morning. 
Inflationary pressures in raw materials, wages, supply chain and transportation costs negatively impacted our third quarter results and will put even more pressure on our fourth quarter as we described in the commentary, which we released yesterday evening. We will continue to proactively manage pricing and promotion with the goal of offsetting as much of this cost pressure as possible. 
We are forecasting fourth quarter sales and earnings per share growth over last year and significant growth versus 2019. Specifically, we expect fourth quarter earnings per share between $2.10 and $2.25 compared to earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.96 in 2020 and $1.41 in 2019. And we expect sales growth in the mid- to high single-digit percent range compared to last year. 
We are well positioned as we go into the important holiday season and fourth quarter. We have confidence in our merchandise assortments. And although it is very early, customers are responding positively, and quarter-to-date sales are in line with our expectations. 
Risks related to COVID persist. And we will continue to operate both of our channels in a safe manner for our customers and our associates. With continued smart and disciplined management of the business, I believe we can deliver a strong holiday and fourth quarter. 
Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Amie Preston."

Thanks for the question, Ike. So yes, we've said pretty consistently on earnings calls and in investor meetings that we believe that an operating margin in the low mid-20 range is appropriate for this business because we think it affords us the right balance of investing in our products, our customer experience, our capabilities while also generating a very high return on sales. 
And as we've also talked about, really the driver of the breadth of that range from low to mid is really going to come down to most likely how we're able to maintain the merchandise margin improvement that we've realized here over the last 18 months. And so I would say that our confidence on that from a promotional and pricing power standpoint remains high. 
And as we've seen in each of the first 3 quarters of this year, we've been able to keep promotion levels at or below where we were in 2020 and meaningfully below where we were in 2019. And again, that's a combination of all the different levers that we use in terms of more full price selling, less clearance, fewer days of real power traffic driving promotions, higher prices when we do run promotions, selective, higher tickets and fewer shop-wide discounts. 
Really the wild card that's come into play, though, last quarter, Q3 and this coming quarter and forward is going to be around inflationary pressure. And so again, as you look at our margin improvement in Q3 relative to Q2, it was not as much as it was in the first half of the year. And that difference was really about those inflationary pressures. 
And again, those are in raw materials. They're in transportation and supplies and in wage rates. And we expect those costs, as we disclosed in our comments, to only go up further in the fourth quarter. So that really is, we believe, more of a short term on a rolling 12 basis, probably Q3 of '21 through first half of '22, where we start to lap some of those costs. 
But as we look beyond that, again, it's going to come down to how much of that merchandise margin pricing power are we able to sustain. And again, as of right now, we're still very confident in our ability to do that. Does that address your question, Ike?"

On",372,"Yes. Thanks, Lorraine. So again, as I kind of highlighted there in the prior answer, we have lots of different levers at our disposal around pricing and promotions, including ticket price increases and frequency of promotions and depth of promotions. 
On the ticketing front, as we started to get line of sight to what the inflationary pressures were coming in the end of Q2 and into the back half of the year, we did make select ticket changes. So biggest example would be on our big 3-wick candle business. We did take the ticket up by $1 there. We also selectively took some tickets up in our body care key forms as well as in some of our wallflower heaters. 
More importantly, though, because again, the majority of our sales actually come from everyday promotions, we've also -- based on our testing and our read and react capability, we have been gradually raising the level of promotion prices really across all of our categories here over the last 12 to 18 months. 
And that's frankly something that we do every day, that constant test, read, react and make changes to something we've been doing for years, but honestly, even more important in a time frame like this where we are facing the inflationary pressures. So we continue to do that. We believe we've been successful in that. 
We have not seen negative customer reactions to this point in terms of those changes that we've made either to tickets or the promotional levels. And we'll continue to do more of that. 
I will say, as we move into the fourth quarter, the reality is that fourth quarter is a much more promotional time frame than the other 3 quarters of the year. We, as a business, rely much more on key promotional days that both drive volume traffic and customer acquisition. 
And so while we will still use that read and react capability that I described, as we head into the fourth quarter, we are expecting a promotional activity more in line with last year, both from a frequency of pricing promotions as well as a depth of pricing promotions. And so that's what our forecast. That's what is embedded in our forecast."

That is being driven by the inflation. Of the inflation we called out, roughly half of it is raw materials, and the other part of it being driven by transportation, wage pressures and supplies. But a significant pressure on our AUCs is occurring in Q4. 
And that's combined with the fact that on the pricing side, as Andrew said, we're planning to be generally consistent from a promotional strategy in Q4 compared to last year. So you add that up, so to speak, and that's what's driving our gross profit or gross margin rate down significantly in the quarter."

So when we think about the business on a 2-year basis in general, the growth that we've seen in stores has been phenomenal. And really, that started with the reopening trend from last year in the July, August, September time frame. And from there, we saw continued strength through the balance of the year. 
So in the third quarter versus 2 years ago, we saw traffic. We saw traffic up. We saw conversion up versus 2 years ago, and we saw transactions up significantly. 
And then to your question, we saw average dollar sale up meaningfully on a 2-year basis. And again, the driver within that is both UPTs and AUR, AUR through some of the pricing and promotional pieces that we were talking about earlier. 
But on the UPT side, it's really been driven by the continued move of our customers who purchased across multiple categories. And that has been something that we have been, frankly, driving for in terms of how we build our assortments. 
So we do a lot more cross-category collections now than we did further back in our history. We do a lot more cross-category merchandising both in stores and online. And we occasionally do cross-category promotions as well. 
And so the combination of all of those activities has driven us to see on a multiyear basis us go from about 55% of our customers purchasing multiple categories 2 years ago to now close to 60% of our customers purchasing across multiple categories. And that, obviously, has a great impact on the UPT and more importantly, on that average dollar sale."

In terms of the customer, so the great news there, Matt, is that what we were talking about at the end of last year, at the end of 2020 was that despite the fact that we had overall a very strong year, we actually had seen a decline in our customer file in 2020 really driven by the fact that our stores were closed for 90 days in the middle of the first half. And so while we saw a great performance in the back half of '20, we still came up short. 
The good news is that the first half of 2021 and Q3 have continued a strong trend of absolute customer growth so that we're now up. On a rolling 12-month basis, we're up low double digits to 2 years ago in addition. So that's in terms of the number of customers that we're seeing. And we're also continuing to see really very strong customer engagement metrics that are up from a spend standpoint than the high 20% versus 2 years ago. So very, very strong file. 
And within that, part of your question, we're seeing nice growth on a 2-year basis now across all of our categories from a customer standpoint. And as mentioned earlier, that percent of customers who are shopping across multiple categories is also up meaningfully. And as we've disclosed in the past, those multi-category customers spend over 3x more than a customer who purchases only one category. 
In a similar way, we're also seeing nice growth in our dual-channel customers. So low teens percent of our business now in dual-channel customers versus high single-digit percent of our customers dual channel 2 years ago. And those customers also spend order of magnitude 3x more than a single-channel customer. So nice performance there. 
Again, we gained -- what this is all telling us is that, obviously, we gained customers here during the pandemic. Some of that, obviously, through soaps and sanitizers. But as we're now lapping really that the extreme of those time trends in Q2 and Q3 of last year, we're seeing very nice retention rates. 
Our retention rate on customers is actually higher than it was pre-pandemic even on a much higher customer base. So that's great. As mentioned earlier, the engagement metrics continue to be very strong. 
And importantly, I think one of the things to also note is that the profile and performance of the new customers that we've gained inside of this time frame is very comparable to the performance of our prior customer file. So these are equally valuable customers that at this point, we believe it should be very valuable on a go-forward basis as well."

So we looked at the soap and sanitizer business together and really think about how that's performed during the pandemic relative to where it was prior to the pandemic. And as we've shared in the past, in 2019, for example, the soap and sanitizer business was right around 14% of our business, total business for the year. Last year, it got up to almost 20% of the business, obviously driven by really the pandemic buying that was occurring in Q2 and in Q3. 
And as we said at the beginning of this year, we expected it to moderate this year and probably stabilize somewhere in the mid- to low teens percent of the business. What I would say is that our year-to-date results and our Q3 results were all in line with that level of expectation in terms of where we expect it to shake out. 
And I think it's important to know that in the third quarter where I think there was a legitimate concern about would we be able to anniversary the tremendously high sales growth that we saw last year of mid-50s percent in the total business with soap and sanitizer driving a number that was in the north of 70% range in that time frame. 
The good news is that while we did see an expected year-over-year decline in soap and sanitizer in Q3, the growth that we were able to generate on a year-over-year basis in our body care business, our home fragrance business and our gifting and accessories businesses, we're almost able to fully offset that soap and sanitizer decline. And so again, on a longer-term trend, we do expect it to be up to where it was pre-pandemic, but it certainly won't be as high. I'm speaking about soap and sanitizer. Again won't be as high as it was in 2020 if that helps."

And the good news is after taking an understandable break on our real estate activity in 2020 out of an abundance of caution, as we've ramped up in 2021 to numbers that aren't quite where we were in '17, '18 and '19 in terms of a number of projects but still meaningfully higher than 2020, the good news is that the performance of those White Barn remodels or new stores continues to be very, very strong, in line with the level of performance that we were seeing prior to the pandemic. 
So where does that leave us? By the end of this year, we'll have about 1,000 of our stores in the White Barn remodel format. And ultimately, we would like all of our stores to be in that format. Really, the question will be of the venues, the mall venues that are at risk or vulnerable, how many of those do we do versus how many of those do we replace with different off-mall locations. 
So the second part of your question on the Q4 promo strategy, again, as mentioned earlier, we are planning activity that's in line with last year. And to your point, the last year promotional strategy was meaningfully different than our prior year strategy. 
That included on some of our try it to believe it days, which are our key promotional sharp price days on individual categories, the candle day being the biggest of those, as you mentioned. We took from historically being only 1 day deal generally on a big Saturday to last year, we were successful in spreading those out over multiple days. 
In addition, our Black Friday deal that historically has been a 1-day only deal, that also last year was spread and basically made that promotion over the whole Black Friday week. And so in both of those cases, both of those key price points, try to believe it days and that Black Friday deal, our intent is to be similar to last year and extend them over multiple days."

What's your sense for how the hand sanitizer market overall across the U.S. has performed? And can you compare that to your business just to help us maybe understand the trends within Bath & Body Works versus some of the trends more broadly speaking? 
And then secondly, I think you touched on some of the constraints last year in stores during the holiday season because there was no vaccine yet and some of that. But can you also talk about some of the constraints online last year? I mean last year, there's a lot of talk about shipping surcharges and difficulty fulfilling online orders because demand was so strong. What will that look like this year? How will that online business compare this year to last year?"

So on sanitizers, obviously, the market in 2020 saw an explosive growth. And I think as we've talked about on a prior call or 2, that included many, many people who historically have not been in the hand sanitizer business getting into the hand sanitizer business as a reaction to that tremendous increase in the market that was occurring driven by customer demand, obviously. 
So as we've come out of 2020 and through 2021, many of those players, those ancillary players that have gotten into the business, obviously, got out of the business and in some cases, had to go to deep price promotions in order to exit their positions. And so we are still very happy that we are in the hand sanitizer business. We're in it in a meaningfully and profitable way. 
It is up materially from where it was 2 years ago. As mentioned earlier, it's obviously down on a 1-year basis as we're lapping that explosive growth last year. But we view it as definitely a very attractive market to be part of on a go-forward basis as we do expect and frankly, are continuing to see that customer behavior is different now in 2021 than it was back in 2019 and prior. 
So again, a market that saw tremendous growth last year. I think the market is experiencing a decline this year. We won't have full year numbers on that until early in the new year. But certainly, from what we're able to gauge, that's what's happening. But we're very pleased with our business within that. 
So the second part of your question on capacity online. So yes, last year, certainly, we were constrained in multiple ways. So one way was the online business for Bath & Body Works was order of magnitude doubling year-over-year, and that certainly was not our plan as we entered the year in 2020. And while the team did a phenomenal job of procuring additional fulfillment capacity through the full year, the reality is we were really hand to mouth in terms of our ability to fulfill the business last year. 
And so while we were pleased with the overall business results, the lead times or the amount of time it was taking to ship products to our customers was longer than we would like it to be. Our shipping cutoff as we headed into holiday was earlier than we would have liked it to be. And in some cases, based on inventory levels, our online business wasn't able to participate in all the different promotions that we were running in stores. 
So I think the good news is this year, we're in much better shape in terms of having procured the appropriate amount of fulfillment capacity that will allow us to have shorter shipping windows, and I'm knocking on wood, hopefully, be able to extend our shipping cutoff pre-Christmas. Some of that will obviously depend on the macro environment and what our carriers are able to provide year-over-year. But that as well as our inventory levels, we're confident will leave us with much less constraints online this year versus last year."

But even as we look out to '22, any new categories, new opportunities that you see as kind of low-hanging fruit as we look out to next year and beyond?"

So the third quarter had those ticket increases in it already. So nothing that we're doing differently from a ticket standpoint, Q4 versus Q3. 
And then on your question on long term, as we talked about over the summer, our long-term outlook and our business plan associated with that, we talked about lots of things in terms of further expansion within our existing core categories as well as getting into adjacent categories. But my belief is that the lowest hanging fruit within that is still around key item opportunities to further expand out our assortment in the categories in which we already play. So examples of that are things like an additional form in candles. 
Today, we're very reliant on the one 3-wick and to a lesser extent, on a single-wick candle. So additional opportunity there. 
Within body care, opportunities around things like bar soap, things like [ Andy ] deodorants in the men's business, things like moisturizing body wash across the body care assortment. 
And then within soaps, we're also very reliant on our foaming soap and so further expansion of additional soap forms and sanitizer forms opportunities. So again, from a lowest hanging fruit within the categories that we're already very successful in opportunity to expand key items."

And to the second part of your question on semiannual sale. Semiannual sale last year, we did run one, but it was at significantly shallower discounts than we are historically. And the penetration within that semiannual sale driven by clearance merchandise and specifically bought for sale merchandise was down meaningfully over prior years and in 2021, which will be calendar 2022 for that Jan. sale, we are expecting a return to a more traditional approach to semiannual sale, both in terms of depth of offer and in terms of amount of clearance and bought for sale versus history."

Turning to our third quarter performance. We delivered strong results, and we could not have done so without the continued hard work and commitment of our associates and partners in stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, call centers, at our vendors and our offices. We'd like to express our deep appreciation for their ongoing dedication and efforts. 
We reported adjusted third quarter earnings from continuing operations of $0.92 per share compared to $0.83 per share last year. This result significantly exceeded our third quarter guidance for earnings per share between $0.55 and $0.60. The upside versus our guidance was driven by better-than-forecasted sales and a higher merchandise margin rate. 
We continued our strong momentum in the third quarter. Net sales were $1.681 billion, a decline of just 1% versus last year's exceptionally strong results and a 53% increase compared to 2019, which was consistent with the 2-year growth we delivered in the first half of the year. 
Performance was strong across all months of the quarter as we saw good customer response to our fall seasonal and Halloween merchandise. We also launched 2 new fragrances in the third quarter, Fairytale and Open Sky, both of which exceeded our expectations. 
We are satisfied with our inventory position as we head into holiday. While we are better positioned than most retailers due to our primarily domestic supply chain, we are not immune to challenges. We have proactively managed production and promotions throughout the third quarter and did not experience significant out of stocks. And we do expect our assortments to be full and abundant for holiday. We are partnering closely with our vendors to support production needs in order to continue to meet customer demand. 
In terms of our product offering and marketing stories, we invite you to watch a video showcasing our holiday assortment, which we posted to our website this morning. 
Inflationary pressures in raw materials, wages, supply chain and transportation costs negatively impacted our third quarter results and will put even more pressure on our fourth quarter as we described in the commentary, which we released yesterday evening. We will continue to proactively manage pricing and promotion with the goal of offsetting as much of this cost pressure as possible. 
We are forecasting fourth quarter sales and earnings per share growth over last year and significant growth versus 2019. Specifically, we expect fourth quarter earnings per share between $2.10 and $2.25 compared to earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.96 in 2020 and $1.41 in 2019. And we expect sales growth in the mid- to high single-digit percent range compared to last year. 
We are well positioned as we go into the important holiday season and fourth quarter. We have confidence in our merchandise assortments. And although it is very early, customers are responding positively, and quarter-to-date sales are in line with our expectations. 
Risks related to COVID persist. And we will continue to operate both of our channels in a safe manner for our customers and our associates. With continued smart and disciplined management of the business, I believe we can deliver a strong holiday and fourth quarter. 
Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Amie Preston."

Can you kind of just give us an update? Are we still thinking that this is a low 20s margin business? I mean, you're going to be above the mid-20s this year.

Thanks for the question, Ike. So yes, we've said pretty consistently on earnings calls and in investor meetings that we believe that an operating margin in the low, mid-20 range is appropriate for this business because we think it affords us the right balance of investing in our products, our customer experience, our capabilities while also generating a very high return on sales. 
And as we've also talked about, really the driver of the breadth of that range from low to mid is really going to come down to most likely how we're able to maintain the merchandise margin improvement that we've realized here over the last 18 months. And so I would say that our confidence on that from a promotional and pricing power standpoint remains high. 
And as we've seen in each of the first 3 quarters of this year, we've been able to keep promotion levels at or below where we were in 2020 and meaningfully below where we were in 2019. And again, that's a combination of all the different levers that we use in terms of more full-price selling, less clearance, fewer days of real power traffic driving promotions, higher prices when we do run promotions, selective, higher tickets and fewer shop-wide discounts. 
Really the wild card that's come into play, though, last quarter, Q3 and this coming quarter and forward is going to be around inflationary pressure. And so again, as you look at our margin improvement in Q3 relative to Q2, it was not as much as it was in the first half of the year. And that difference was really about those inflationary pressures. 
And again, those are in raw materials. They're in transportation and supplies and in wage rates. And we expect those costs, as we disclosed in our comments, to only go up further in the fourth quarter. So that really is, we believe, more of a short term, on a rolling 12 basis, probably Q3 of '21 through first half of '22, where we start to lap some of those costs. 
But as we look beyond that, again, it's going to come down to how much of that merchandise margin pricing power are we able to sustain. And again, as of right now, we're still very confident in our ability to do that. Did I address your question, Ike?"

On the ticketing front, as we started to get line of sight to what the inflationary pressures were becoming in the end of Q2 and into the back half of the year, we did make select ticket changes. So biggest example would be on our big 3-Wick candle business. We did take the ticket up by $1 there. We also selectively took some tickets up in our body care key forms as well as in some of our wallflower heaters. 
More importantly, though, because again, the majority of our sales actually come from everyday promotions, we've also -- based on our testing and our read and react capability, we have been gradually raising the level of promotion prices really across all of our categories here over the last 12 to 18 months. 
And that's frankly something that we do every day, that constant test, read, react and make changes to is something we've been doing for years, but honestly, even more important in a time frame like this where we are facing the inflationary pressures. So we continue to do that. We believe we've been successful in that. 
We have not seen negative customer reactions to this point in terms of those changes that we've made either to tickets or the promotional levels. And we'll continue to do more of that. 
I will say, as we move into the fourth quarter, the reality is that fourth quarter is a much more promotional time frame than the other 3 quarters of the year. We, as a business, rely much more on key promotional days that both drive volume, traffic and customer acquisition. 
And so while we will still use that read and react capability that I described, as we head into the fourth quarter, we are expecting a promotional activity more in line with last year, both from a frequency of pricing promotions as well as a depth of pricing promotions. And so that's what our forecast. That's what is embedded in our forecast."

Andrew, I wanted to ask about the sort of degree of magnitude that you're considering or contemplating for the fourth quarter gross margin. 
You talked about having the fourth quarter down compared to last year. If you could just help us understand order of magnitude? And your margins, as I said, have been really outperforming expectations this year. I'm wondering if you can just talk about the puts and takes around your gross margin forecast for the holiday season? And what could cause that gross margin or the overall operating margin in Q4 to come in a bit better than you're currently forecasting?"

So we are forecasting merchandise margin rate to be down significantly as compared to Q4 of last year. 
That is being driven by the inflation. Of the inflation we called out, roughly half of it is raw materials, and the other part of it being driven by transportation, wage pressures and supplies. But a significant pressure on our AUCs is occurring in Q4. 
And that's combined with the fact that on the pricing side, as Andrew said, we're planning to be generally consistent from a promotional strategy in Q4 compared to last year. So you add that up, so to speak, and that's what's driving our gross profit or gross margin rate down significantly and in the quarter."

So if we were able to be a little bit more aggressive in terms of pricing than that, that could totally result in some upside. And then the other piece would be if we're able to perform at the high or even higher range of our forecast. Obviously, some of the costs are more fixed in magnitude, and so we could get some leverage if we were able to overdeliver on the sales line versus our forecast."

So when we think about the business on a 2-year basis in general, the growth that we've seen in stores has been phenomenal. And really, that started with the reopening trend from last year in the July, August, September time frame. And from there, we saw continued strength through the balance of the year. 
So in the third quarter versus 2 years ago, we saw traffic. We saw traffic up. We saw conversion up versus 2 years ago, and we saw transactions up significantly. 
And then to your question, we saw average dollar sale up meaningfully on a 2-year basis. And again, the driver within that is both UPTs and AUR. AUR through some of the pricing and promotional pieces that we were talking about earlier. 
But on the UPT side, it's really been driven by the continued move of our customers to purchased across multiple categories. And that has been something that we have been, frankly, driving for in terms of how we build our assortments. 
So we do a lot more cross-category collections now than we did further back in our history. We do a lot more cross-category merchandising both in the stores and online. And we occasionally do cross-category promotions as well. 
And so the combination of all of those activities has driven us to see on a multiyear basis, us go from about 55% of our customers purchasing multiple categories 2 years ago to now close to 60% of our customers purchasing across multiple categories. And that, obviously, has a great impact on the UPT and more importantly, on that average dollar sale."

In terms of the customer, so the great news there, Matt, is that what we were talking about at the end of last year, at the end of 2020, was that despite the fact that we had overall a very strong year, we actually had seen a decline in our customer file in 2020 really driven by the fact that our stores were closed for 90 days in the middle of the first half. And so while we saw a great performance in the back half of '20, we still came up short. 
The good news is that the first half of 2021 and Q3 have continued a strong trend of absolute customer growth so that we're now up. On a rolling 12-month basis, we're up low double digits to 2 years ago in addition. So that's in terms of the number of customers that we're seeing. And we're also continuing to see really very strong customer engagement metrics that are up from a spend standpoint in the high 20% versus 2 years ago. So very, very strong file. 
And within that, to part of your question, we're seeing nice growth on a 2-year basis now across all of our categories from a customer standpoint. And as mentioned earlier, that percent of customers who are shopping across multiple categories is also up meaningfully. And as we've disclosed in the past, those multi-category customers spend over 3x more than a customer who purchases only one category. 
In a similar way, we're also seeing nice growth in our dual-channel customers. So low teens percent of our business now in dual-channel customers versus high single-digit percent of our customers dual channel 2 years ago. And those customers also spend order of magnitude 3x more than a single-channel customer. So nice performance there. 
Again, we gained -- what this is all telling us is that, obviously, we gained customers here during the pandemic. Some of that, obviously, through soaps and sanitizers. But as we're now lapping really that the extreme of those time frames in Q2 and Q3 of last year, we're seeing very nice retention rates. 
Our retention rate on customers is actually higher than it was pre-pandemic even on a much higher customer base. So that's great. As mentioned earlier, the engagement metrics continue to be very strong. 
And importantly, I think one of the things to also note is that the profile and performance of the new customers that we've gained inside of this time frame is very comparable to the performance of our prior customer file. So these are equally valuable customers that at this point, we believe it should be very valuable on a go-forward basis as well."

So we looked at the soap and sanitizer business together and really think about how that's performed during the pandemic relative to where it was prior to the pandemic. And as we've shared in the past, in 2019, for example, the soap and sanitizer business was right around 14% of our business, total business for the year. Last year, it got up to almost 20% of the business, obviously driven by, really, the pandemic buying that was occurring in Q2 and in Q3. 
And as we said at the beginning of this year, we expected it to moderate this year and probably stabilize somewhere in the mid- to low teens percent of the business. What I would say is that our year-to-date results and our Q3 results were all in line with that level of expectation in terms of where we expect it to shake out. 
And I think it's important to know that in the third quarter where I think there was legitimate concern about would we be able to anniversary the tremendously high sales growth that we saw last year of mid-50s percent in the total business with soap and sanitizer driving a number that was in the north of 70% range in that time frame. 
The good news is that while we did see an expected year-over-year decline in soap and sanitizer in Q3, the growth that we were able to generate on a year-over-year basis in our body care business, our home fragrance business and our gifting and accessories businesses, we're almost able to fully offset that soap and sanitizer decline. And so again, on a longer-term trend, we do expect it to be up to where it was pre-pandemic, but it certainly won't be as high. I'm speaking about soap and sanitizer. Again, won't be as high as it was in 2020. Hope that helps."

Prior to the pandemic, that was one of the major things we were talking about in the business. Again as we had, prior to the start of the pandemic, gotten about half of our fleet through a White Barn remodel as we call it, where we add that White Barn room to our existing real estate. 
And as we had talked about pretty extensively, the productivity increases that we see out of those stores, when we do that, of high teens to low 20% increases was something we continue to be very excited about. And the good news is after taking an understandable break on our real estate activity in 2020 out of an abundance of caution, as we've ramped up in 2021 to numbers that aren't quite where we were in '17, '18 and '19 in terms of a number of projects but still meaningfully higher than 2020, the good news is that the performance of those White Barn remodels or new stores continues to be very, very strong and on line -- in line with the level of performance that we were seeing prior to the pandemic. 
So where does that leave us? By the end of this year, we'll have about 1,000 of our stores in the White Barn remodel format. And ultimately, we would like all of our stores to be in that format. Really, the question will be of the venues, the mall venues that are at risk or vulnerable, how many of those do we do versus how many of those do we replace with different off-mall locations. 
So the second part of your question on the Q4 promo strategy, again, as mentioned earlier, we are planning activity that's in line with last year. And to your point, the last year promotional strategy was meaningfully different than our prior year strategy. 
That included on some of our try it to believe it days, which are our key promotional sharp price days on individual categories, the candle day being the biggest of those, as you mentioned. We took from historically being only 1 day deal generally on a big Saturday to last year, we were successful in spreading those out over multiple days. 
In addition, our Black Friday deal, that historically has been a 1-day only deal, that also last year we spread and basically made that promotion over the whole Black Friday week. And so in both of those cases, both of those key price points, try to believe it days and that Black Friday deal, our intent is to be similar to last year and extend them over multiple days."

What's your sense for how the hand sanitizer market overall across the U.S. has performed? And can you compare that to your business just to help us maybe understand the trends within Bath & Body Works versus some of the trends more broadly speaking? 
And then secondly, I think you touched on some of the constraints last year in stores during the holiday season because there was no vaccine yet and some of that. But can you also talk about some of the constraints online last year? I mean last year, there's a lot of talk about shipping surcharges and difficulty fulfilling online orders because demand was so strong. What will that look like this year? How will that online business compare this year to last year?"

So on sanitizers, obviously, the market in 2020 saw an explosive growth. And I think as we've talked about on a prior call or 2, that included many, many people who historically have not been in the hand sanitizer business getting into the hand sanitizer business as a reaction to that tremendous increase in the market that was occurring, driven by customer demand, obviously. 
So as we've come out of 2020 and through 2021, many of those players, those ancillary players that had gotten into the business, obviously, got out of the business and in some cases, had to go to deep price promotions in order to exit their positions. And so we are still very happy that we are in the hand sanitizer business. We're in it in a meaningfully and profitable way. 
It is up materially from where it was 2 years ago. As mentioned earlier, it's obviously down on a 1-year basis as we're lapping that explosive growth last year. But we view it as definitely a very attractive market to be part of on a go-forward basis as we do expect and frankly, are continuing to see that customer behavior is different now in 2021 than it was back in 2019 and prior. 
So again, a market that saw tremendous growth last year. I think the market is experiencing a decline this year. We won't have full year numbers on that until early in the new year. But certainly, from what we're able to gauge, that's what's happening. But we're very pleased with our business within that. 
So the second part of your question on capacity online. So yes, last year, certainly, we were constrained in multiple ways. So one way was the online business for Bath & Body Works was order of magnitude doubling year-over-year, and that certainly was not our plan as we entered the year in 2020. And while the team did a phenomenal job of procuring additional fulfillment capacity through the full year, the reality is we were really hand to mouth in terms of our ability to fulfill the business last year. 
And so while we were pleased with the overall business results, the lead times or the amount of time it was taking to ship products to our customers was longer than we would like it to be. Our shipping cutoff as we headed into holiday was earlier than we would have liked it to be. And in some cases, based on inventory levels, our online business wasn't able to participate in all the different promotions that we were running in stores. 
So I think the good news is this year, we're in much better shape in terms of having procured the appropriate amount of fulfillment capacity that will allow us to have shorter shipping windows, and I'm knocking on wood, hopefully, be able to extend our shipping cutoff pre-Christmas. Some of that will obviously depend on the macro environment and what our carriers are able to provide year-over-year. 
But that as well as our inventory levels, we're confident will leave us with much less constraints online this year versus last year."

But even as we look out to '22, any new categories, new opportunities that you see as kind of low-hanging fruit as we look out to next year and beyond?"

The ticket changes that we made as we started to get visibility into the inflationary pressures, as I talked about earlier, we really made as we moved into the back half of the year. So the third quarter had those ticket increases in it already. So nothing that we're doing differently from a ticket standpoint, Q4 versus Q3. 
And then on your question on long term, as we talked about over the summer, our long-term outlook and our business plan associated with that, we talked about lots of things in terms of further expansion within our existing core categories as well as getting into adjacent categories. But my belief is that the lowest hanging fruit within that is still around key item opportunities to further expand out our assortment in the categories in which we already play. So examples of that are things like an additional form in candles. 
Today, we're very reliant on the one 3-Wick and to a lesser extent, on a single-wick candle. So additional opportunity there. 
Within body care, opportunities around things like bar soap, things like antiperspirant deodorants in the men's business, things like moisturizing body wash across the body care assortment. 
And then within soaps, we're also very reliant on our foaming soap and so further expansion of additional soap forms and sanitizer forms opportunities. So again, from a lowest hanging fruit within the categories that we're already very successful in opportunity to expand in key items."

And to the second part of your question on semiannual sale. Semiannual sale last year, we did run one, but it was at significantly shallower discounts than we are historically.

Turning to our third quarter performance. We delivered strong results, and we could not have done so without the continued hard work and commitment of our associates and partners in stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, call centers, at our vendors and our offices. We'd like to express our deep appreciation for their ongoing dedication and efforts.
We reported adjusted third quarter earnings from continuing operations of $0.92 per share compared to $0.83 per share last year. This result significantly exceeded our third quarter guidance for earnings per share between $0.55 and $0.60. The upside versus our guidance was driven by better-than-forecasted sales and a higher merchandise margin rate.
We continued our strong momentum in the third quarter. Net sales were $1.681 billion, a decline of just 1% versus last year's exceptionally strong results and a 53% increase compared to 2019, which was consistent with the 2-year growth we delivered in the first half of the year.
Performance was strong across all months of the quarter as we saw good customer response to our fall seasonal and Halloween merchandise. We also launched 2 new fragrances in the third quarter, Fairytale and Open Sky, both of which exceeded our expectations.
We are satisfied with our inventory position as we head into holiday. While we are better positioned than most retailers due to our primarily domestic supply chain, we are not immune to challenges. We have proactively managed production and promotions throughout the third quarter and did not experience significant out of stocks. And we do expect our assortments to be full and abundant for holiday. We are partnering closely with our vendors to support production needs in order to continue to meet customer demand.
In terms of our product offering and marketing stories, we invite you to watch a video showcasing our holiday assortment, which we posted to our website this morning. 
Inflationary pressures in raw materials, wages, supply chain and transportation costs negatively impacted our third quarter results and will put even more pressure on our fourth quarter as we described in the commentary, which we released yesterday evening. We will continue to proactively manage pricing and promotion with the goal of offsetting as much of this cost pressure as possible.
We are forecasting fourth quarter sales and earnings per share growth over last year and significant growth versus 2019. Specifically, we expect fourth quarter earnings per share between $2.10 and $2.25 compared to earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.96 in 2020 and $1.41 in 2019. And we expect sales growth in the mid- to high single-digit percent range compared to last year.
We are well positioned as we go into the important holiday season and fourth quarter. We have confidence in our merchandise assortments. And although it is very early, customers are responding positively, and quarter-to-date sales are in line with our expectations.
Risks related to COVID persist. And we will continue to operate both of our channels in a safe manner for our customers and our associates. With continued smart and disciplined management of the business, I believe we can deliver a strong holiday and fourth quarter.
Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Amie Preston."

Can you kind of just give us an update? Are we still thinking that this is a low 20s margin business? I mean, you're going to be above the mid-20s this year.

Thanks for the question, Ike. So yes, we've said pretty consistently on earnings calls and in investor meetings that we believe that an operating margin in the low, mid-20 range is appropriate for this business because we think it affords us the right balance of investing in our products, our customer experience, our capabilities while also generating a very high return on sales.
And as we've also talked about, really the driver of the breadth of that range from low to mid is really going to come down to most likely how we're able to maintain the merchandise margin improvement that we've realized here over the last 18 months. And so I would say that our confidence on that from a promotional and pricing power standpoint remains high.
And as we've seen, each of the first 3 quarters of this year, we've been able to keep promotion levels at or below where we were in 2020 and meaningfully below where we were in 2019. And again, that's a combination of all the different levers that we use in terms of more full-price selling, less clearance, fewer days of real power traffic driving promotions, higher prices when we do run promotions, selective, higher tickets and fewer shop-wide discounts.
Really the wild card that's come into play, though, last quarter, Q3 and this coming quarter and forward is going to be around inflationary pressure. And so again, as you look at our margin improvement in Q3 relative to Q2, it was not as much as it was in the first half of the year. And that difference was really about those inflationary pressures.
And again, those are in raw materials. They're in transportation and supplies and in wage rates. And we expect those costs, as we disclosed in our comments, to only go up further in the fourth quarter. So that really is, we believe, more of a short term, on a rolling 12 basis, probably Q3 of '21 through first half of '22, where we start to lap some of those costs.
But as we look beyond that, again, it's going to come down to how much of that merchandise margin pricing power are we able to sustain. And again, as of right now, we're still very confident in our ability to do that. Did I address your question, Ike?"

Thanks, Lorraine. So again, as I kind of highlighted there in the prior answer, we have lots of different levers at our disposal around pricing and promotions, including ticket price increases and frequency of promotions and depth of promotions.
On the ticketing front, as we started to get line of sight to what the inflationary pressures were becoming in the end of Q2 and into the back half of the year, we did make select ticket changes. So biggest example would be on our big 3-Wick candle business. We did take the ticket up by $1 there. We also selectively took some tickets up in our body care key forms as well as in some of our wallflower heaters.
More importantly, though, because again, the majority of our sales actually come from everyday promotions, we've also -- based on our testing and our read and react capability, we have been gradually raising the level of promotion prices really across all of our categories here over the last 12 to 18 months.
And that's frankly something that we do every day, that constant test, read, react and make changes to is something we've been doing for years, but honestly, even more important in a time frame like this where we are facing the inflationary pressures. So we continue to do that. We believe we've been successful in that.
We have not seen negative customer reactions to this point in terms of those changes that we've made either to tickets or to promotional levels. And we'll continue to do more of that.
I will say, as we move into the fourth quarter, the reality is that fourth quarter is a much more promotional time frame than the other 3 quarters of the year. We, as a business, rely much more on key promotional days that both drive volume, traffic and customer acquisition.
And so while we will still use that read and react capability that I described, as we head into the fourth quarter, we are expecting a promotional activity more in line with last year, both from a frequency of pricing promotions as well as a depth of pricing promotions. And so that's what our forecast -- that's what is embedded in our forecast."

You talked about having the fourth quarter down compared to last year. If you could just help us understand order of magnitude? And your margins, as I said, have been really outperforming expectations this year. I'm wondering if you can just talk about the puts and takes around your gross margin forecast for the holiday season? And what could cause that gross margin or the overall operating margin in Q4 to come in a bit better than you're currently forecasting?"

So we are forecasting merchandise margin rate to be down significantly as compared to Q4 of last year.
That is being driven by the inflation. Of the inflation we called out, roughly half of it is raw material, and the other part of it being driven by transportation, wage pressures and supplies. But a significant pressure on our AUCs is occurring in Q4.
And that's combined with the fact that on the pricing side, as Andrew said, we're planning to be generally consistent from a promotional strategy in Q4 compared to last year. So you add that up, so to speak, and that's what's driving our gross profit or gross margin rate down significantly and -- in the quarter."

So if we were able to be little bit more aggressive in terms of pricing than that, that could potentially result in some upside.

So when we think about the business on a 2-year basis in general, the growth that we've seen in stores has been phenomenal.

So in the third quarter versus 2 years ago, we saw traffic -- we saw traffic up, we saw conversion up versus 2 years ago, and we saw transactions up significantly.
And then to your question, we saw average dollar sale up meaningfully on a 2-year basis. And again, the driver within that is both UPTs and AUR. AUR through some of the pricing and promotional pieces that we were talking about earlier. But on the UPT side, it's really been driven by the continued move of our customer to purchase across multiple categories. And that has been something that we have been, frankly, driving for in terms of how we build our assortments. So we do a lot more cross-category collections now than we did further back in our history. We do a lot more cross-category merchandising both in-stores and online. And we occasionally do cross-category promotions as well. 
And so the combination of all of those activities has driven us to see on a multiyear basis, us go from about 55% of our customers purchasing multiple categories 2 years ago to now close to 60% of our customers purchasing across multiple categories. And that, obviously, has a great impact on the UPT and more importantly, on that average dollar sale."

In terms of the customer, so the great news there, Matt, is that what we were talking about at the end of last year, at the end of 2020, was that despite the fact that we had overall a very strong year, we actually had seen a decline in our customer file in 2020 really driven by the fact that our stores were closed for 90 days in the middle of the first half. And so while we saw a great performance in the back half of '20, we still came up short.
The good news is that the first half of 2021 and Q3 have continued a strong trend of absolute customer growth so that we're now up. On a rolling 12-month basis, we're up low double digits to 2 years ago in addition. So that's in terms of the number of customers that we're seeing. And we're also continuing to see really very strong customer engagement metrics that are up from a spend standpoint in the high 20% versus 2 years ago. So very, very strong file.
And within that, a part of your question, we're seeing nice growth on a 2-year basis now across all of our categories from a customer standpoint. And as mentioned earlier, that percent of customers who are shopping across multiple categories is also up meaningfully. And as we've disclosed in the past, those multi-category customers spend over 3x more than a customer who purchases only one category.
In a similar way, we're also seeing nice growth in our dual-channel customers. So low teens percent of our business now in dual-channel customers versus high single-digit percent of our customers dual channel 2 years ago. And those customers also spend order of magnitude 3x more than a single-channel customer. So nice performance there.
Again, we gained -- what this is all telling us is that, obviously, we gained customers here during the pandemic. Some of that, obviously, through soaps and sanitizers. But as we're now lapping really that the extreme of those time frames in Q2 and Q3 of last year, we're seeing very nice retention rates. Our retention rate on customers is actually higher than it was pre-pandemic even on a much higher customer base. So that's great.
As mentioned earlier, the engagement metrics continue to be very strong. And importantly, I think one of the things to also note is that the profile and performance of the new customers that we've gained inside of this time frame is very comparable to the performance of our prior customer file. So these are equally valuable customers that at this point, we believe it should be very valuable on a go-forward basis as well."

So we looked at the soap and sanitizer business together and really think about how that's performed during the pandemic relative to where it was prior to the pandemic. And as we've shared in the past, in 2019, for example, the soap and sanitizer business was right around 14% of our business, total business for the year. Last year, it got up to almost 20% of the business, obviously driven by, really, the pandemic buying that was occurring in Q2 and in Q3.
And as we said at the beginning of this year, we expected it to moderate this year and probably stabilize somewhere in the mid- to low teens percent of the business. What I would say is that our year-to-date results and our Q3 results were all in line with that level of expectation in terms of where we expect it to shake out.
And I think it's important to know that in the third quarter where I think there was legitimate concern about would we be able to anniversary the tremendously high sales growth that we saw last year of mid-50s percent in the total business with soap and sanitizer driving a number that was in the north of 70% range in that time frame.
The good news is that while we did see an expected year-over-year decline in soap and sanitizer in Q3, the growth that we were able to generate on a year-over-year basis in our body care business, our home fragrance business and our gifting and accessories businesses, we're almost able to fully offset that soap and sanitizer decline. And so again, on a longer-term trend, we do expect it to be up to where it was pre-pandemic, but it certainly won't be as high. I'm speaking about soaps and sanitizers. Again, it won't be as high as it was in 2020. Hope that helps."

Again as we had, prior to the start of the pandemic, gotten about half of our fleet through a White Barn remodel as we call it, where we add that White Barn room to our existing real estate.
And as we talked about pretty extensively, the productivity increases that we see out of those stores, when we do that, of high teens to low 20% increases was something we continue to be very excited about. And the good news is after taking an understandable break on our real estate activity in 2020 out of an abundance of caution, as we've ramped up in 2021 to numbers that aren't quite where we were in '17, '18 and '19 in terms of a number of projects, but still meaningfully higher than 2020. The good news is that the performance of those White Barn remodels or new stores continues to be very, very strong and on line -- in line with the level of performance that we were seeing prior to the pandemic. So where does that leave us? By the end of this year, we'll have about 1,000 of our stores in the White Barn remodel format. And ultimately, we would like all of our stores to be in that format. Really, the question will be of the venues -- the mall venues that are at risk or vulnerable, how many of those do we do versus how many of those do we replace with different off-mall locations.
So the second part of your question on the Q4 promo strategy. Again, as mentioned earlier, we are planning activity that's in line with last year. And to your point, the last year promotional strategy was meaningfully different than our prior year strategy. That included on some of our try it to believe it days, which are our key promotional sharp price days on individual categories, the candle day being the biggest of those, as you mentioned. We took from historically being only 1 day deal generally on a big Saturday to last year, we were successful in spreading those out over multiple days.
In addition, our Black Friday deal, that historically has been a 1-day only deal, that also last year we spread and basically made that promotion over the whole Black Friday week. And so in both of those cases, both of those key price points, try to believe it days and that Black Friday deal, our intent is to be similar to last year and extend them over multiple days."

What's your sense for how the hand sanitizer market overall across U.S. has performed? And can you compare that to your business just to help us maybe understand the trends within Bath & Body Works versus some of the trends more broadly speaking?
And then secondly, I think you touched on some of the constraints last year in-stores during the holiday season because there was no vaccine yet and some of that. But can you also talk about some of the constraints online last year? I mean last year, there's a lot of talk about shipping surcharges and difficulty fulfilling online orders because demand was so strong. What will that look like this year? How will that online business compare this year to last year?"

So on sanitizers, obviously, the market in 2020 saw an explosive growth. And I think as we've talked about on a prior call or 2, that included many, many people who historically have not been in the hand sanitizer business getting into the hand sanitizer business as a reaction to that tremendous increase in the market that was occurring, driven by customer demand, obviously.
So as we've come out of 2020 and through 2021, many of those players, those ancillary players that had gotten into the business, obviously, got out of the business and in some cases, had to go to deep price promotions in order to exit their positions. And so we are still very happy that we are in the hand sanitizer business. We're in it in a meaningfully and profitable way.
It is up materially from where it was 2 years ago. As mentioned earlier, it's obviously down on a 1-year basis as we're lapping that explosive growth last year. But we view it as definitely a very attractive market to be part of on a go-forward basis as we do expect and frankly, are continuing to see that customer behavior is different now in 2021 than it was back in 2019 and prior.
So again, a market that saw tremendous growth last year. I think the market is experiencing a decline this year. We won't have full year numbers on that until early in the new year. But certainly, from what we're able to gauge, that's what's happening. But we're very pleased with our business within that.
So the second part of your question on capacity online. So yes, last year, certainly, we were constrained in multiple ways. So one way was the online business for Bath & Body Works was order of magnitude doubling year-over-year, and that certainly was not our plan as we entered the year in 2020. And while the team did a phenomenal job of procuring additional fulfillment capacity through the full year, the reality is we were really hand to mouth in terms of our ability to fulfill the business last year.
And so while we were pleased with the overall business results, the lead times or the amount of time it was taking to ship products to our customers was longer than we would like it to be. Our shipping cutoff as we headed into holiday was earlier than we would have liked it to be. And in some cases, based on inventory levels, our online business wasn't able to participate in all the different promotions that we were running in stores.
So I think the good news is, this year, we're in much better shape in terms of having procured the appropriate amount of fulfillment capacity that will allow us to have shorter shipping windows, and I'm knocking on wood, hopefully, be able to extend our shipping cutoff pre-Christmas. Some of that will obviously depend on the macro environment and what our carriers are able to provide year-over-year.
But that as well as our inventory levels, we're confident will leave us with much less constraints online this year versus last year."

Short term, were there ticket changes that were taken for the fourth quarter this holiday season that had not taken effect in 3Q? So just curious if you've made any changes recently.
Then just longer term, I'm just kind of curious, Andrew, what do you look at as the lowest-hanging fruit as you think about that mid- to high single-digit top line growth over the next several years? But even as we look out to '22, any new categories, new opportunities that you see as kind of low-hanging fruit as we look out to next year and beyond?"

So on the first part of your question, Q4 ticket differences versus Q3, I think the short answer to that would be no.

So on the first part of your question, Q4 ticket differences versus Q3, I think the short answer to that would be no. The ticket changes that we made as we started to get visibility into the inflationary pressures, as I talked about earlier, we really made as we moved into the back half of the year. So the third quarter had those ticket increases in it already. So nothing that we're doing differently from a ticket standpoint, Q4 versus Q3.
And then on your question on long term, as we talked about over the summer, our long-term outlook and our business plan associated with that, we talked about lots of things in terms of further expansion within our existing core categories as well as getting into adjacent categories. But my belief is that the lowest hanging fruit within that is still around key item opportunities to further expand out our assortment in the categories in which we already play. So examples of that are things like an additional form in candles.
Today, we're very reliant on the one 3-Wick and to a lesser extent, on a single-wick candle. So additional opportunity there.
Within body care, opportunities around things like bar soap, things like antiperspirant deodorants in the men's business, things like moisturizing body wash across the body care assortment. And then within soaps, we're also very reliant on our foaming soap and so further expansion of additional soap forms and sanitizer forms opportunities. So again, from a lowest hanging fruit within the categories that we're already very successful in opportunity to expand key items."

And to the second part of your question on semiannual sale. Semiannual sale last year, we did run one, but it was at significantly shallower discounts than we are historically. And the penetration within that semiannual sale driven by clearance merchandise and specifically bought for sale merchandise was down meaningfully over prior years and in 2021, which will be calendar 2022 for that Jan sale, we are expecting a return to a more traditional approach to semiannual sale, both in terms of depth of offer and in terms of amount of clearance and bought for sale versus history."
