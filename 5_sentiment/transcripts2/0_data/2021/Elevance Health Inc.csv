Despite a year challenge by COVID-19 and significant economic uncertainty we delivered strong growth across all of our businesses. This morning, Anthem reported fou",1595,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Despite a year challenge by COVID-19 and significant economic uncertainty we delivered strong growth across all of our businesses. This morning, Anthem reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share of $2.19 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.54. For the full year, Anthem reported GAAP earnings per share of $17.98 and adjusted earnings per share of $22.48. Our full year results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19 treatment costs and more normal utilization patterns in the second half of the year. Consistent with our expectations, fourth quarter utilization was above baseline, reflecting higher costs attributable to the recent surge of COVID-19 cases, coupled with the return of non-COVID-19 care utilization. 
I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished in 2020 and the strength and resiliency shown by our enterprise amidst the global pandemic. We met our financial commitments, delivered strong growth, and we stepped up as a business and through the commitment and compassion of our associates to support our members partners and communities when they needed us most to address the new increasing in urgent needs. Our growth in 2020 was powered by strategic investments we've made in recent years to streamline and simplify our business and enhance the member and customer experience. 
The membership trends during the year exceeded expectations on all fronts. Medical enrollment finished the year strong at 42.9 million members, representing growth of 1.9 million members over the prior year. We're pleased that our commercial business has continued to grow, even in this challenging economic environment. In addition to the AmeriBen acquisition, growth has been fueled by strong customer retention and a steady pipeline of new account sales. In fact, sales in our large group risk business have outpaced lapses in 14 over the last 16 months, reflecting the market-leading performance of our new virtual strategies and tools as well as the benefit of our innovative products such as Total Health, Total You and further integration of our pharmacy offerings from IngenioRx. 
Total commercial membership was flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in our risk-based group business, offset by in-group change in our fee-based business as a result of the economic environment. Our risk-based business has been incredibly resilient as we've deepened talent, enhanced our products and improved sales execution across our markets. In addition, sales of our large group specialty dental and vision products outperformed 2019 results, demonstrating that employers value the affordability and simplicity of Anthem integrated medical and specialty offerings. It's clear, the actions we've taken to focus on the consumer and their unique needs are garnering a strong market response. 
Medicaid membership grew by roughly 1.6 million consumers during the year and nearly 300,000 lives in the fourth quarter, marked by strong organic growth, aided by the pause on reverifications and 2 strategic acquisitions in Nebraska and Missouri. Medicare Advantage membership ended the year up nearly 18% compared to 2019, continuing our meaningful growth in senior business. Our essential extra suite of benefit options are resonating with seniors as we saw greater than 300% increase in the selection of benefits such as personal home helper services, transportation benefits and access to personal home safety devices. We're pleased with our continued growth in this important segment for Anthem and the demonstrated resilience of our diversified portfolio. 
Our AEP performance was in line with expectations, and we expect another year of double-digit growth, once again outperforming the industry average growth rate. Over the past year, Anthem stepped up as a trusted health partner to support our stakeholders as they navigated the pandemic. We adapted and accelerated our digital innovations, enhanced our focus on community health, transformed many of our products and solutions and simplified our processes in the context of COVID-19. We recognize our critical role in ensuring safe access to care and COVID-19 vaccinations and have launched a nationwide partnership with Lyft to support universal access to vaccines. We are leveraging Anthem's local market strength, provider relationships and data assets in combination with this on-demand transportation network to serve at-risk communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Our goal is to provide 60 million free rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income, uninsured and at-risk communities. 
Further, we recently launched a new online C19 vaccine tracker to provide personalized vaccination insights for Anthem members. This web-based dashboard aggregates vaccine-related data from public and private sources to give consumers a real-time view of vaccine distribution progress and help to inform our members when they might be eligible to receive the vaccine. We recognize the increased social and health needs of our members and communities during this pandemic. With each of our Medicaid states, we're performing detailed community needs assessments to create localized solutions with our partners to support issues with housing, job training and free Internet for underserved children. And our Medicare members are provided access to [ farm-based ] social workers to help coordinate local resources and services to support their needs around food and security, transportation and more. 
For members with complex conditions such as cancer, receiving care has become even more difficult during this pandemic. In response, we've launched Anthem's Concierge Cancer Care Program. From diagnosis to recovery, members received personalized 24/7 guidance and support through LiveHealth Online and remote monitoring technology with access to top-tier cancer facilities across the country. [indiscernible] program has more than tripled since its launch in 2020 and is now available to nearly 900,000 members. 
Throughout the course of this past year, our deeply committed associates have stepped up and shown great compassion and care to those we serve and to one another. With more than 100,000 volunteer hours logged in our local communities through in-person and virtual giving, our associates have embodied our values and culture, reflecting the fabric of who we are. 
As we move into 2021, we will continue to modernize our business to drive growth. Efforts to transform our business are not new, and in fact, our focus was sharpened and investments accelerated in light of the pandemic. Today, we are continuing to consolidate our systems, automate and streamline processes and embed digital and AI across the enterprise to simplify and improve the customer experience and deepen engagement with all those we serve. We recognize the power of digital technologies to reach more of our stakeholders, particularly as part of our community health efforts. Sydney Health is personalizing care for consumers, helping to bridge gaps in care and improve outcomes for underserved populations. In fact, Sydney Health recently received several awards, including Corporate Insights, Gold Medal for Virtual Care, recognizing our ability to give members more options in how they engage with care providers, whether it be via chat, e-mail, phone or video. We're excited to be introducing the first-of-its-kind digital nutrition assistant. Through the use of AI, our Sydney Nutrition app will be able to automatically recognize food and log meals in real time, providing users with personalized information and progress on nutrition goals. This integrated tool is currently available to Anthem associates and will be available more broadly later this year to provide our members with a fully connected health and wellness experience. We know consumers are experiencing health care more digitally. So we focused on creating greater access to care via telehealth, particularly in the behavioral health space, who usage has gone up from single-digit pre-pandemic percentage levels to as much as 60% of all visits, and that level has stayed consistent over the past 4 months. 
Our AI-based care finder is now live for all segments of our business and differentiates Anthem with a fully integrated approach using predictive tools and AI to help guide members to the right care at the right time and place for them, which can mean via text phone video in person or chat. Additionally, through our AI-based predictive service and chat functionality, we were able to redirect 5 million member calls last year to on-demand digital channels to provide members with information they needed quickly and efficiently. 
Today, we're delivering on consumer demands for simplicity and affordability, and we're helping to restore hope while making positive and sustainable change for our local communities. Grounded by our mission and driven by our purpose to improve the health of humanity, we move into 2021 with a bold agenda as we continue to grow and transform our business and fundamentally improve the health care experience for those we serve. 
Our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of greater than $24.50 reflects challenges unforeseen when we reported third quarter results. Specifically, adjusted net income guidance reflects the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which includes a 1-year increase in Medicare physician rates as well as other COVID-19-related impacts on the Medicare business. All in, we estimate these items equate to a $0.50 to $0.70 net negative headwind. Importantly, these factors are transient and should diminish as we move into 2022. 
Looking ahead, we are poised to deliver membership growth of nearly 1.5 million members at the midpoint, driven predominantly by our risk-based businesses. Our outlook reflects our ability to deliver solid enrollment growth despite the uncertainties in 2021. We remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term 12% to 15% earnings growth and look forward to our March 3 Virtual Investor Day. We will provide a more detailed look into our strategy, including the transformative digital and community health initiatives that are driving real growth across our business. 
And now I'll turn it over to John Gallina for a detailed look at our performance numbers. John?"

Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.54, down 35% year-over-year, driven primarily by costs related to the COVI",1304,"Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail stated, we are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial results. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.54, down 35% year-over-year, driven primarily by costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken to support our members. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $22.48, representing growth of 16% over 2019. Total operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $31.5 billion, an increase of more than 16% over the prior year quarter, reflecting solid growth in Medicaid and Medicare. For the full year, we ended 2020 serving 42.9 million members, including growth of 300,000 lives during the fourth quarter. Medicaid membership was up more than 11x the decline in our commercial risk-based business. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of membership growth, further demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business. For the full year, operating revenue grew over 17%. 
The fourth quarter medical loss ratio was 88.9%, a decrease of 10 basis points over the prior year quarter. COVID-related costs accelerated during the quarter above expectations, however, this was offset by non-COVID utilization coming in lower than expectations. Taken together, overall utilization was above baseline, albeit slightly better than expected. 
The SG&A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 13.7%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year quarter, due primarily to increased spending to support growth, including efforts taken to modernize our business and become a more agile organization as well as the return of the health insurer fee in 2020. On a HIF-adjusted basis, our SG&A ratio decreased 30 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by double-digit growth in operating revenue. Full year 2020 operating cash flow was $10.7 billion or 2.3x net income. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $3.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to changes in our net working capital and enrollment growth in our Government businesses. Our operating cash flow in the fourth quarter benefited by a number of payments that were originally expected to be received in 2021. These early receipts, along with other items that benefited 2020 cash flow, including payment deferrals allowed under the CARES Act, will reverse in 2021 and negatively impact our 2021 operating cash flow metrics. 
We ended 2020 with a strong balance sheet as the debt-to-cap ratio was at 38.7%, consistent with our target range. Days-in-claims payable was 43.4 days, an increase of 2.3 days sequentially and 5.4 days versus the prior year, along with the growth in medical claims payable of 28% compared to an increase in premium revenue of approximately 11%. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares at a weighted average price of $305.66. In total, we repurchased $2.7 billion of stock in 2020 or 9.4 million shares. As a reminder, our original guidance contemplated share repurchase of $1.5 billion. After reinstating share repurchases in the second quarter, we accelerated the pace of share buyback in the second half of the year in response to market conditions. 
Turning to our 2021 outlook, our current guidance reflects our latest assumptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our guidance includes new items that were unknown at the time of our third quarter call, including the passing of the Consolidated Appropriations Act in late December and the corresponding 1-year increase in Medicare physician payment rates and other COVID-related impacts on our Medicare business. In addition, the significant decline in non-COVID utilization in our Medicare business during the fourth quarter will have an impact on our risk revenue by more than we had anticipated. All in, these items resulted in a net negative headwind of $0.50 to $0.70 per share relative to the outlook we shared on our third quarter call. Like 2020, 2021 presents its own set of unique challenges that we believe to be transient. Our core business and underlying fundamentals remain strong. Absent these new and unique circumstances, we remain confident that our long-term earnings growth target of 12% to 15% is both credible and sustainable. 
Turning to our 2021 guidance metrics. Total medical membership is expected to reach 44.4 million members at the midpoint, which reflects growth across our key business segments. In the Commercial business, we project our risk-based enrollment will end the year between 4.5 million to 4.6 million members in our fee-based business [ during ] the year between 25.5 million and 25.7 million members. 
In our Medicaid business, we expect to end the year with approximately 10 million to 10.2 million lives, reflecting organic growth in our existing markets and the expectation that the reverification process may remain on hold through the end of the year. In addition, our guidance also includes growth for North Carolina, which is expected to go live later this year. 
In Medicare Advantage, we're projecting double-digit growth at the midpoint as we expect continued measured growth over the balance of 2021. Medicare supplement is expected to end the year between 950,000 and 1 million members, and our FEP business is expected to be flat to slightly down at 1.6 million members. 
With IngenioRx now firmly embedded in our baseline, we expect 2021 operating revenue to be approximately $135.1 billion, representing growth of 13.5% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points, an increase of 120 basis points at the midpoint from 2019, which is the most recent year in which the health insurer fee did not apply. The increase is largely driven by a mix of business more heavily skewed to Medicaid and Medicare and the impact of COVID, including the recently announced increase in Medicare physician rates. 
The SG&A expense ratio is expected to be 10.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points, primarily due to growth in operating revenue, in addition to the permanent appeal of the health insurer fee and the benefit of modernization efforts, including systems consolidation and broader process automation. 
Looking below the line, we expect investment income to be $940 million and interest expense of $785 million. The tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 22%, with the decrease primarily driven by the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee. Full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $5.7 billion. As a reminder, operating cash flow in 2020 was heavily impacted by COVID-19 pandemic as well as certain other receipts that were accelerated into 2020. Absent the pull-through of those cash receipts, our 2021 operating cash flow would be roughly 1.1 to 1.2x net income. Our long-term capital deployment targets are unchanged as we progress down this path of becoming the most innovative, valuable and inclusive partner in the health care ecosystem with the continued focus of delivering sustainable long-term shareholder returns. 
In terms of capital deployment, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by nearly 19% to $1.13 per share, bringing our dividend yield to roughly 1.4% and continuing our trend of annual dividend increases. We expect full year share repurchase of at least $1.6 billion [ and ] our weighted average share count to end the year in the range of 246 million to 248 million shares outstanding. 
As Gail mentioned, this past year presented its own unique set of challenges. And while much has changed, it is clear that we are still in the depths of a global pandemic. We remain committed to our mission of improving the lives and communities which we serve, and we will continue to do our part in 2021 to meet the needs of our associates, members, customers and health care providers as we persevere through this pandemic together.

I appreciate the question and the opportunity to clarify the $0.50 to $0.70 change in our expectations. As you mentioned, with the appropriations bill and the extension of the Federal Health and agency, we now have a disconnect between some of the cost and [indiscernible]. We completely agree with your approach to the Medicare 3.75% fee schedule rate increase as well as your sequestration. The Medicare rate increase is for 12 months. The sequestration is only for 3 months as an offset, but there's a third component as well, and that's the 20% bump in the inpatient DRG is going to be extended for the full year as well as part of the federal health emergency. So when you take the 3 of those combined, that actually accounts for about 2/3 of the $0.50 to $0.70 differential that you're asking about. 
The other 1/3 really relates to the fact that the non-COVID utilization in the fourth quarter was lower than we had anticipated. And with the non-core utilization being lower than anticipated, we are unable to accurately capture all of the HCC codes to reflect our appropriate risk scores in our Medicare business. And so once you factor that in, that's about the other 1/3. So you take those out and you'd -- you'll come down to the -- say, the 25 10 that you had been modeling to the 24 50 at the midpoint. 
And then in terms of your question associated with the 2022 jump-off point, while it is premature to give 2022 guidance, we do believe that many of these issues are transient, and we are very comfortable affirming the 12% to 15% long-term sustainable growth rate on a 25 10 starting point. We always have the issue with COVID and risk revenues and things could linger, and we will clearly be on top of that throughout the year. But as an outset, we're very comfortable with the 25 10 jump-off point. Thank you for the question."

And as you indicated, there is a lot of variability and assumptions. The most vulnerable populations, which include Medicare Advantage members, et cetera, our expectation is by the end of the first quarter, that they will achieve a vaccination level appropriate. We're really looking at having somewhere in the neighborhood of about 60% of Americans vaccinated for the year. 
Medicare, we expect to be a bit higher. The commercial population and the Medicaid population, we wouldn't expect the vaccines to be rolled out and completed until the end of the summer, maybe even a little bit longer with commercial population being close to the average for America for the year and then Medicaid being a little bit less. So to the extent of the rollout and the efficacy of the vaccine very clearly could have an impact on the financial results for the year. As COVID costs go down, then we do expect non-COVID to increase. So it's certainly not a one-for-one, but there's clearly a lot of dynamics associated with that modeling. And if the vaccine is either faster or slower, it will have an impact in one direction or another. Hopefully, that helps."

We entered a partnership with Lyft to provide 60 million free rides. Our sense is that the senior population, obviously, then the rollout is going to have first access to that. And then as each of the states make their determinations and supply becomes available, we'll be side by side with our partners to ensure that, that we can be as efficient in helping as possible. So again, everything John said, I think we are trying to model in this incredibly dynamic environment but remain optimistic and supportive of what's happening and want to be a good partner to our states and our customers.

In terms of the individual business and sort of as we see Q1 play out, we feel good about our strategy. We continue our thoughtful targeted approach and targeted growth approach in the individual business. We've expanded into about 115 counties in 2021. Our approach continues to be based upon a focus on best-in-class economics through value-based relationships, differentiated medical management. We really try to partner with key providers to enable excellence and quality and risk adjustment. And so that's been our grounding, and we continue with that strategy. 
Overall, this year, while we're experiencing growth, environmental, and I think you're alluding to this, there is more competition. Also, there does appear to be less overall new sales across the federal facilitated marketplace and state-based exchanges. It seems to be down a bit year-over-year. We believe this is due to a variety of different factors. We all know that in several states, there were special election periods throughout 2020, which certainly could have been a factor. Also, less overall government engagement, in fact, could change with the Biden administration just in terms of overall marketing and then less prospect engagement. We saw that just in light of the political environment and the economic climate. But all that said, as we look forward, we do remain optimistic regarding this business. The new administration certainly looks like they're going to promote and pop up -- and prop up, excuse me, the ACA business. We just heard this week that we'll likely see an extension to open enrollment or special enrollment periods throughout the year and then a possibility of more marketing and facilitated enrollment expenditures. So overall, I think we'll continue with our thoughtful approach. But with the new administration, I think there's an opportunity for further growth there."

Thank you, Ralph, for that question. And when you look at our MRR guidance, we certainly believe it's appropriate given the uncertainty around the timing and the efficacy of the vaccine rollout and the full year impact of COVID as well as those unexpected changes in Medicare physician rates and sequestration timing mismatch that I talked about earlier, have obviously all been incorporated in the 88%. 
But really looking at 2019 is the point of comparison since that was the last period that there was not a HIF, it's really -- it's a fairly simple roll forward from that perspective. You look at the mix of the business that we have today with far more Medicaid members, we actually have had exceedingly strong growth in our Medicare Advantage in the last few years, being in the upper teens on a couple of year basis and exceeding the rest of the industry. All of that obviously changes our business mix. And just on an apples-to-apples basis, mix is driving about 60 basis points of the increase in the 2021 [ MLR ] versus the 2019 [ MLR ]. 
And then when we look at the impacts of COVID, and there's a lot of things that go into COVID where there's certainly the cost of COVID, which is in the billions of dollars, there is non-COVID utilization impacts. And in terms of we believe that non-COVID utilization will be less than what a normal year would be in vacuum. And then, of course, you have the pricing actions that we've taken into account for that as well as reimbursements from regulatory entities that we believe are appropriate in the curve environment. When you take the net of all those, the impact of COVID is another 40 to 50 basis points on our [ MOR ] for 2021. And there's a multitude of other small items going in both directions that maybe comprise the last 10 basis points. But it's really it's those 2 items, it's mix and COVID. Thank you for the question."

Yes, in terms of the COVID cost, I think really, probably your question is what type of COVID costs are included in our guidance. And as I said, there's many factors and variables, and so we've spent considerable time analyzing and modeling potential impacts. A few of the peers, A.J. in particular, has asked what happens if the vaccine rollout is different than soon. Well, I'll tell you of all the modeling assumptions we have, the timing and efficacy of the vaccine is one of the assumptions that has the greatest amount of variability associated with it. But anyway, all in, we're estimating that we have about a $600 million COVID headwind inherent in our 2021 guidance. And as I said, COVID cost when you include testing treatment, vaccine administration, all the other things, such as the Medicare fee schedules, the sequestration, the various waves, it's several billions of dollars. But offsetting that is non-COVID utilization less than a normal year, the pricing actions that we've taken and regulatory reimbursements. And we've been modeling all that. It's coming out for about -- [ all ] about $600 million. And you really think about that, think about our 24 50 and then you add $600 million to that, that puts us really at the high end or slightly above the high end of our 12% to 15% growth rate range that we've talked about on a sustainable basis. So again, we do believe that a lot of these issues are transient. And there'll probably be some lingering effects into 2022, but we feel very good about the underlying core business fundamentals that we have in the company. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Gail."

And I think that we're past the transition, and now we're into full integration of that business with our other opportunities. 
If you think about it, IngenioRx, one of the areas this year, we had some nice sales and some little good throughput and integration with our commercial business. But it was impacted somewhat by the jumbo accounts really not going out to market this past year. So we would expect as we sell through '21, that there's continuing an ongoing opportunities to integrate IngenioRx with our commercial footprint. And that's 1 up our biggest opportunities still. We still see a lot of runway for us to increase the penetration, particularly in our middle-sized and large accounts with integrated pharmacy benefit offerings. We did see some nice wins in 2021 on stand-alone business, which were really, really happy with. And we think that, that's a big opportunity that's to continue. But the impact on large accounts this year for just what's happening in the economy, I think, is sort of depressed sales activity and movement, but we had very strong retention across both our commercial and our Ingenio book. So overall, we feel Ingenio is tracking very much in line to our expectations and really pleased with the performance of the business to date."

First, on reverification, we originally, I think, shared with you our thoughts on where this year would come out. Our a",437,"Yes. Thanks for the question. In terms of the sort of understanding inside of our guidance on the 2 issues, reverification and testing. First, on reverification, we originally, I think, shared with you our thoughts on where this year would come out. Our assumption was that the public health emergency would end in the first quarter. That's what we knew at the time. But we also felt that Medicaid reverifications would probably really begin in the summer. So that was embedded in our thinking. 
The other thing I think it's important to know is, right now, we're assuming based on the letter to governors that recently came out that the verifications will be on hold for all of 2021. But in our -- even in our original assumptions, we never assumed that there would be cliff events, and I think that's also an important assumption as you think about the progression of enrollment over the course of the year, that while states were trying to understand their data and managing this, that given just the challenging conditions within each of these states that, that would happen over time in the back half of the year. So again, as we think about this year, we're expecting no reverification -- really reverification to be on pause for the full year given sort of the initial guidance that's been given to governors. 
In terms of your second question, the policy issue on testing, we agree that testing is probably one of the most critical parts of controlling the spread of COVID, and we've been strongly supportive of wide availability of testing offerings. And it is unprecedented in terms of the situation, trying to understand the additional support for all types of testing and expanding that capacity and also finding it, quite frankly, new reliable, rapid and inexpensive ways to do this. If you think about our industry, health plan benefits have always traditionally covered medical tests as appropriate to diagnose and treat individuals that were ordered by a physician. This is consistent with the long-held insurance practices or contracts and quite frankly, federal guidance. And so as we think about workplace testing, examples of that, that have happened over certainly drug testing or other traditional ways employers have paid for that outside of the health benefit. And then similarly, public health surveillance testing has traditionally been paid for by states and local health departments. So those are -- I mean, as we think about that, we follow that consistent approach to testing and also give you a sense of what we did on reverifications. So thank you for that question."

But just maybe going back conceptually, I think one of the biggest concerns investors have is the risk that as COVID subsides, there's a bolus of deferred utilization and/or that utilization might be at higher acuity as if health conditions have progressed and worsened because of deferred care. So when we think -- and the line of business where that impact seems to be -- the deferred impact seems to be most significant throughout 2020, it seems to be the Medicare business where seniors have stayed away as much as they are able to. 
So as we think about your sort of house view in 2021, how are you thinking about non-COVID utilization, whether there is really pent-up demand, not just getting back to normal and whether that acuity is higher? And is that view particularly any different for commercial, Medicare or Medicaid?"

And as you can imagine, when I discussed earlier the extensive modeling that we've done, there's a lot of different thought processes around that. But conceptually, yes, we do believe that there is pent-up demand in the system. And we do believe that there is a chance that there could be higher acuity associated with when folks get care, and that's probably most pronounced in the Medicare line of business. So really, the question is not if those will happen because we do believe those will happen, the question is to what extent and how significant. And then you also have things like emergency room volume, we believe, will remain low in that the way that people access care will continue to change a bit in the future as it has in the past. To the extent that COVID stays high and then we expect non-COVID utilization, whether it's normal utilization, pent-up demand or anything else, to actually be below normal. To the extent that COVID subsides in the vaccine is extremely successful, we do expect that to go up. There's really clearly a natural hedge in there. I have talked in response to other questions about what the net impact is. And we really don't want to talk about specifically how much we have for each of those buckets because they're so fungible and interchangeable and they do hedge and offset each other.

And just to give all the listeners a little bit of frame of reference in terms of when I answer it. In terms of some of the Medicaid callbacks, et cetera, we had experienced about $100 million in the first 6 months of the year, had about $300 million worth in the third quarter. And during the third quarter call, I was asked what do you think the full year is going to be? And I said, probably, we expect it to be a little bit more than $0.5 billion, [ moving ] just over $100 million in the fourth quarter. Well, it turned out that it was more than that in the fourth quarter. It was almost $250 million in the fourth quarter and to make almost $650 million for the year. I think it's very important note that even with that $650 million clawbacks, with all the various corridor and collar and other rate protections that existed within that block of business, that Medicaid still into 2020 within target margin ranges. 
In terms of the impacts for the future, we have about half of our Medicaid states are repriced on January 1. We are very comfortable with the actuarial credibility of those rates thus far and believe that we will continue to work with our state partners in terms of the challenges that they're facing and respectful of their budget issues but to still receive rates that are actuarially sound and actuarially solid for 2021. And then there are rate protections, as I said, between collars, corridors, rebates, whatever you want to call them. They all have the same aspect to try to better align cost and revenue within the same time frame in the same period. So we're actually very bullish about our ability here in Medicaid. 
And then in terms of the flu season, yes, the ""typical flu season or influenza season"" is much less than anticipated. We've factored that in. I've talked about non-COVID utilization being less than normal in total for the year. That is part of the calculus. So we're actually thrilled with a lot of things that we did even we took steps to ensure that our members had access to the flu vaccine, to our fall-through campaign. 
You may not know this, but Anthem partnered with over 100 community-based organizations across our markets, and we stood up 500 pop-up and drive-through clinics and underserved neighborhoods to promote and support higher immunization rates. And we believe some of our efforts helped contribute to the lower-than-normal flu incidents. And as I said, that's all factored into the non-COVID utilization comments that I made earlier.

It's a variety of relationships that we have, and we are moving to increase to much",547,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. We've shared this publicly a few times. We're north of 60% in some type of, I will call, upside, downside risk. So what does that mean? It's a variety of relationships that we have, and we are moving to increase to much more capitated full risk arrangements, particularly in our government business. At this stage, a lot of them are gain shares, although we do have a component of that 60% in full risk. Our strategy is to continue to build upon that. And we believe that having 1 in 8 patients in our markets that are Anthem patients across our book of business provides us a real foothold in those marketplaces. And we've been working with our care providers to improve that. We started with a program was really based on primary care capitation and working with them on this share to get them more involved. So our strategy does revolve around primary care, and we're going to continue to build on that. We have 180 accountable care organizations. 23% of those are roughly operating under shared risk arrangements as well. 
And then if you think about other innovation programs, we've got about 69% of our medical spend tied to performance-based contracts as well. So as you can see, this for us is evolving. It's something that we've been working on for a number of years. We've had The infrastructure in place to do it, and now we're increasing and enhancing the amount of full risk that our care providers are taking with us. And we actually expect that to accelerate because of the pandemic. We see increased interest across our businesses and physicians working with us, and we find plenty of access in our markets. I mean I think that's a question that's been asked before. Is there enough capacity in our markets? And we've seen many of our physicians very willing to move along the continuum with us. It's a journey, probably a few years still until we get to where we want to be. But ultimately, we've made progress every year, and it's a core part of our strategy. 
The other area that I just want to touch on is telehealth, which is another part of our strategy, not tied necessarily to behavioral health -- or not tied necessarily to risk-based payments, but we also see telehealth, behavioral health in particular, a growing part of our strategy. I shared, more than 60% of our visits in behavioral are done via telehealth. We think that's a great access. And we also think bringing in, quite frankly, not just physical health on the medical side, but behavioral health into these arrangements. And our pharmacy actually completes the circle for us and then some of the capabilities within our diversified business group around palleted care and the work that they're doing to make sure that we are think better positioned with data to help manage these relationships is another area that we've been investing very heavily in. So thanks for the question. It's a core part of our strategy. We're on a journey. We still have some work to do, but I think we've made really good progress and are going continue to move down the risk corridors. Thank you."

I'll begin, and then I'm going to ask Felicia to share some comments around our Medicaid partnerships. You hit really on the 3 key areas that we're partnering with our Blue -- other Blue plans on and even there's a couple of others. 
First, in terms of Ingenio, as you know, Blue Cross of Idaho was one of our first commercial partners in that space, and we just added their Medicare Advantage business on January 1. We continue to work across Ingenio in addition to several other relationships that we've had with other Blues. It's a longer-term sales process because, as you know, most of those contracts are 3- to 5-year contracts. So it takes some time. And we really, until this year, were not in a position, I think, with the transition and other things we're doing to take on most of those kind of arrangements. So we've actually been very balanced in pacing the relationships that we've had there. But we actually do think there's a really good opportunity for us to continue to build and expand. 
An area that you didn't talk about specifically was the relationship we have in the group Medicare business. We've got some partnership there also with other groups that we think will help us to expand our combined footprint. And we've been working with our Blue partners on that because we think we offer obviously some capabilities in that space, and we can work with them on their commercial business to convert that to Group Medicare, and we've had some wins this year in that area as well. 
The last area is the diversified business group. And Beacon's a great example. I mean, that asset that we've purchased and brought on to the Anthem family last year, we see as a very big opportunity. They obviously have been a large footprint even before integrating with Anthem. They work with a number of Blue partners. We consider that an opportunity to integrate our whole health strategy, and we see our Blue peer is also very interested in expanding there. In addition, on the Diversified Business Group, we've seen meaningful opportunities to expand CareMore and Aspire. Those are 2 other companies that have worked with Blue partners. And then we're in a joint venture on our integrated health consumer capabilities, which we've talked about in terms of Total Health, Total You and some of the other work that we're doing because those also offer opportunities. 
So as you can see, a lot of different things are happening. These are generally several year sales. So I won't say that it's going to happen overnight, but we've seen a real increase in the external business that we've had in working with our Blue partners. Medicaid is the space that we started our partnerships with and have expanded that into Medicare and the duals. I'm going to ask Felicia maybe to comment on that because that's probably been our longest-standing relationships with our Blue partners."

We've now added Nebraska and Missouri, both [ brands ] and is healthy Blue. The opportunity that we have is that we're really a natural partner to our Blue plans. and see this is an opportunity for us to continue to leverage the breadth and scope of Anthem's deep knowledge around Medicaid execution and being able to continue to grow that membership as we go forward. 
When you take a look at where we are today, the great opportunity extends not from Medicaid, but also to Medicare. We were able to leverage our partnerships, for example, that we had in Louisiana to move forward with the D-SNP offering, and we're doing the same thing with our partnership in North Carolina as well. So the future of our alliances and partnerships is strong. I think this is an opportunity for us to demonstrate the value that we bring across the board to our Blue partners, and we'll continue to enhance that as we go forward. 
Gail also mentioned GRS and our opportunities there, and we were able to actually partner with Independence Blue Cross for [ 1/1/21 ] in terms of our partnership with them going forward. So between Medicaid and Medicaid, the opportunity continues to be robust, and we will continue to grow this business as we move forward."

And they really, again, have been more consistent with the plans that we discussed at our Investor Day a couple of years ago. We continue to have systems migration strategies, looking very hard to eliminate nonvalue-added workflows and really enhancing our digital capabilities. 
Also, at the end of the third quarter of last year, we had some business optimization charges, and you're starting to see some of the benefits of that already come through the P&L. So all in, we feel very good about that. We clearly have seen significant revenue growth as well, and our revenue growth has far exceeded our growth in SG&A expenses, which serves to lower the SG&A ratio. 
So as you know, we're anticipating a lot of growth in Medicaid. Medicaid carries a lower SG&A ratio than the company does in general in terms of mix and weighted average. So a lot of moving parts and a lot of factors. But we're very confident with that 10.8% and believe that it's very much delivering on the promises that we laid out a couple of years at Investor Day.

Diversified Business Group is an extremely important part of our long-term strategy and our long-term growth aspirations. It is not yet large enough to be considered a separate reporting segment under SEC reporting guidelines. So there's only so much information that we can provide on a detailed basis. 
But in 2021, we do expect to see some nice growth on a -- specifically on a percentage basis out of Diversified Business Group. The aim is proactively managing capacity as volume returns, and we continue to monitor volumes as utilization demand normalizes. Beacon has initially experienced a reduction in utilization and then rebounded significantly throughout the year. Once Beacon and once the vaccine stabilizes the COVID issue, we expect Beacon to really be a meaningful growth driver in that area here for the future. 
And our program integrity area is also -- and the [ SI ] is also within DBG. And that's been impacted a little bit here in 2020 with lower claims volume, and we expect that to kick back up in 2021. So there are both opportunities for DBG to further penetrate Anthem membership and do things appropriate to help bend the cost curve within Anthem and then sell that externally. Gail just talked a minute ago about some of the opportunities that we have in DBG and penetrating more and more of the Blues. So we're very bullish about DBG's long-term aspirations and helping drive the overall growth of Anthem for the future."

But as John said, similar to other health services business, COVID did have an impact on our ability to in-house assessments, and some of the utilization certainly was up in the Beacon behavioral health business.

Just to reiterate what Gail said, we're really pleased with how we landed in 2020 and how the team performed. Overall, with all the headwinds we talked about in 2020, we actually saw the commercial book grow sequentially year-over-year. So that was great. And while we did see furloughs in our book of business in less risky segments being a factor, as Gail just alluded to, the execution was outstanding from the team. Our sales exceeded our lapses for this quarter again and for 9 of the last 12 months. That was great to see. 
And on the local group business side, we actually grew our fully insured and self-funded business in the quarter. So that really played out well. What you alluded to is what our headwind has been throughout the year, and that's really the in-group change dynamics that occurred in the larger size accounts. And that's really going to be the story for 2021. 
As it relates to our execution and how we're starting off the year in 2021, we still feel very good. We feel very good about our portfolio. But again, depending on the economy and how in-group change plays out, especially upmarket, as you alluded to, will be a big factor as we head into 2021. If that changes and the economy improves quicker than we think, then that would be a positive, obviously. But overall, we're taking a more conservative view of that in light of where the economy is today. And I'd say that, that would overall lend itself to about flattish overall membership growth in the commercial business."

Despite a year challenge by COVID-19 and significant economic uncertainty, we delivered strong growth across all of our businesses. This morning, Anthem reported fo",1594,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Despite a year challenge by COVID-19 and significant economic uncertainty, we delivered strong growth across all of our businesses. This morning, Anthem reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share of $2.19 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.54. For the full year, Anthem reported GAAP earnings per share of $17.98 and adjusted earnings per share of $22.48.
Our full year results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19 treatment costs and more normal utilization patterns in the second half of the year. Consistent with our expectations, fourth quarter utilization was above baseline, reflecting higher costs attributable to the recent surge of COVID-19 cases, coupled with the return of non-COVID-19 care utilization. 
I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished in 2020 and the strength and resiliency shown by our enterprise amidst the global pandemic. We met our financial commitments, delivered strong growth. And we stepped up as a business and through the commitment and compassion of our associates to support our members, partners and communities when they needed us most to address the new increasing and urgent needs. Our growth in 2020 was powered by strategic investments we've made in recent years to streamline and simplify our business and enhance the member and customer experience.
Membership trends during the year exceeded expectations on all fronts. Medical enrollment finished the year strong at 42.9 million members, representing growth of 1.9 million members over the prior year. We're pleased that our commercial business has continued to grow even in this challenging economic environment.
In addition to the AmeriBen acquisition, growth has been fueled by strong customer retention and a steady pipeline of new account sales. In fact, sales in our large group risk business have outpaced lapses in 14 of the last 16 months, reflecting the market-leading performance of our new virtual strategies and tools as well as the benefit of our innovative products such as Total Health, Total You and further integration of our pharmacy offerings from IngenioRx. 
Total commercial membership was flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in our risk-based group business offset by in-group change in our fee-based business as a result of the economic environment. Our risk-based business has been incredibly resilient as we've deepened talent, enhanced our products and improved sales execution across our markets. In addition, sales of our large group specialty dental and vision products outperformed 2019 results, demonstrating that employers value the affordability and simplicity of Anthem's integrated medical and specialty offerings. It's clear the actions we've taken to focus on the consumer and their unique needs are garnering a strong market response. 
Medicaid membership grew by roughly 1.6 million consumers during the year and nearly 300,000 lives in the fourth quarter, marked by strong organic growth aided by the pause on reverifications and 2 strategic acquisitions in Nebraska and Missouri.
Medicare Advantage membership ended the year up nearly 18% compared to 2019, continuing our meaningful growth in senior business. Our essential extra suite of benefit options are resonating with seniors as we saw a greater than 300% increase in the selection of benefits such as personal home helper services, transportation benefits and access to personal home safety devices. We're pleased with our continued growth in this important segment for Anthem and the demonstrated resilience of our diversified portfolio. 
Our AEP performance is in line with expectations. And we expect another year of double-digit growth, once again outperforming the industry average growth rate.
Over the past year, Anthem stepped up as a trusted health partner to support our stakeholders as they navigated the pandemic. We adapted and accelerated our digital innovations, enhanced our focus on community health, transformed many of our products and solutions and simplified our processes in the context of COVID-19. We recognize our critical role in ensuring safe access to care and COVID-19 vaccinations and have launched a nationwide partnership with Lyft to support universal access to vaccines. We are leveraging Anthem's local market strength, provider relationships and data assets in combination with this on-demand transportation network to serve at-risk communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Our goal is to provide 60 million free rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income, uninsured and at-risk communities.
Further, we recently launched a new online C19 vaccine tracker to provide personalized vaccination insights for Anthem members. This web-based dashboard aggregates vaccine-related data from public and private sources to give consumers a real-time view of vaccine distribution progress and help to inform our members when they might be eligible to receive the vaccine.
We recognize the increased social and health needs of our members and communities during this pandemic. With each of our Medicaid states, we're performing detailed community needs assessments to create localized solutions with our partners to support issues with housing, job training and free Internet for underserved children. And our Medicare members are provided access to phone-based social workers to help coordinate local resources and services to support their needs around food and security, transportation and more.
For members with complex conditions such as cancer, receiving care has become even more difficult during this pandemic. In response, we've launched Anthem's Concierge Cancer Care program. From diagnosis to recovery, members receive personalized 24/7 guidance and support through LiveHealth Online and remote monitoring technology with access to top-tier cancer facilities across the country. The resuming program has more than tripled since its launch in 2020 and is now available to nearly 900,000 members.
Throughout the course of this past year, our deeply committed associates have stepped up and shown great compassion and care to those we serve and to one another. With more than 100,000 volunteer hours logged in our local communities through in-person and virtual giving, our associates have embodied our values and culture, reflecting the fabric of who we are.
As we move into 2021, we will continue to modernize our business to drive growth. Efforts to transform our business are not new. And in fact, our focus was sharpened and investments accelerated in light of the pandemic. Today, we are continuing to consolidate our systems, automate and streamline processes and embed digital and AI across the enterprise to simplify and improve the customer experience and deepen engagement with all those we serve.
We recognize the power of digital technologies to reach more of our stakeholders particularly as part of our community health efforts. Sydney Health is personalizing care for consumers, helping to bridge gaps in care and improve outcomes for underserved populations. In fact, Sydney Health recently received several awards, including Corporate Insight's gold medal for virtual care, recognizing our ability to give members more options in how they engage with care providers, whether it be via chat, e-mail, phone or video.
We're excited to be introducing the first-of-its-kind digital nutrition assistant. Through the use of AI, our Sydney nutrition app will be able to automatically recognize food and log meals in real time, providing users with personalized information and progress on nutrition goals. This integrated tool is currently available to Anthem associates and will be available more broadly later this year to provide our members with a fully connected health and wellness experience.
We know consumers are experiencing health care more digitally. So we focused on creating greater access to care via telehealth particularly in the behavioral health space, where usage has gone up from single-digit, pre-pandemic percentage levels to as much as 60% of all visits. And that level has stayed consistent over the past 4 months.
Our AI-based care finder is now live for all segments of our business and differentiates Anthem with a fully integrated approach using predictive tools and AI to help guide members to the right care at the right time and place for them, which can mean via text, phone, video, in person or chat. Additionally, through our AI-based predictive service and chat functionality, we were able to redirect 5 million member calls last year to on-demand digital channels to provide members with information they needed quickly and efficiently.
Today, we're delivering on consumer demands for simplicity and affordability. And we're helping to restore hope while making positive and sustainable change for our local communities. Grounded by our mission and driven by our purpose to improve the health of humanity, we move into 2021 with a bold agenda as we continue to grow and transform our business and fundamentally improve the health care experience for those we serve.
Our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of greater than $24.50 reflects challenges unforeseen when we reported third quarter results. Specifically, adjusted net income guidance reflects the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which includes a 1-year increase in Medicare physician rates as well as other COVID-19-related impacts on the Medicare business. All in, we estimate these items equate to a $0.50 to $0.70 net negative headwind. Importantly, these factors are transient and should diminish as we move into 2022.
Looking ahead, we are poised to deliver membership growth of nearly 1.5 million members at the midpoint driven predominantly by our risk-based businesses. Our outlook reflects our ability to deliver solid enrollment growth despite the uncertainties in 2021. We remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term 12% to 15% earnings growth and look forward to our March 3 Virtual Investor Day. We will provide a more detailed look into our strategy, including the transformative digital and community health initiatives that are driving real growth across our business.
And now I'll turn it over to John Gallina for a detailed look at our performance numbers. John?"

As Gail stated, we are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial results. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.54, down 35% year-over-year driven primarily by costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken to support our members. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $22.48, representing growth of 16% over 2019. Total operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $31.5 billion, an increase of more than 16% over the prior year quarter, reflecting solid growth in Medicaid and Medicare. For the full year, we ended 2020 serving 42.9 million members, including growth of 300,000 lives during the fourth quarter. Medicaid membership was up more than 11x the decline in our commercial risk-based business. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of membership growth, further demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business. For the full year, operating revenue grew over 17%.
The fourth quarter medical loss ratio was 88.9%, a decrease of 10 basis points over the prior year quarter. COVID-related costs accelerated during the quarter above expectations. However, this was offset by non-COVID utilization coming in lower than expectations. Taken together, overall utilization was above baseline albeit slightly better than expected.
The SG&A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 13.7%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year quarter due primarily to increased spending to support growth, including efforts taken to modernize our business and become a more agile organization as well as the return of the health insurer fee in 2020. On a HIF-adjusted basis, our SG&A ratio decreased 30 basis points compared to the prior year quarter primarily driven by double-digit growth in operating revenue.
Full year 2020 operating cash flow was $10.7 billion or 2.3x net income. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $3.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to changes in our net working capital and enrollment growth in our Government businesses. Our operating cash flow in the fourth quarter benefited by a number of payments that were originally expected to be received in 2021. These early receipts along with other items that benefited 2020 cash flow, including payment deferrals allowed under the CARES Act, will reverse in 2021 and negatively impact our 2021 operating cash flow metrics.
We ended 2020 with a strong balance sheet as the debt-to-cap ratio was at 38.7%, consistent with our target range. Days in claims payable was 43.4 days, an increase of 2.3 days sequentially and 5.4 days versus the prior year along with the growth in medical claims payable of 28% compared to an increase in premium revenue of approximately 11%.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares at a weighted average price of $305.66. In total, we repurchased $2.7 billion of stock in 2020 or 9.4 million shares. As a reminder, our original guidance contemplated share repurchase of $1.5 billion. After reinstating share repurchases in the second quarter, we accelerated the pace of share buyback in the second half of the year in response to market conditions.
Turning to our 2021 outlook. Our current guidance reflects our latest assumptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our guidance includes new items that were unknown at the time of our third quarter call, including the passing of the Consolidated Appropriations Act in late December and the corresponding 1-year increase in Medicare physician payment rates and other COVID-related impacts on our Medicare business. In addition, the significant decline in non-COVID utilization in our Medicare business during the fourth quarter will have an impact on our risk revenue by more than we had anticipated. All in, these items resulted in a net negative headwind of $0.50 to $0.70 per share relative to the outlook we shared on our third quarter call.
Like 2020, 2021 presents its own set of unique challenges that we believe to be transient. Our core business and underlying fundamentals remain strong. Absent these new and unique circumstances, we remain confident that our long-term earnings growth target of 12% to 15% is both credible and sustainable.
Turning to our 2021 guidance metrics. Total medical membership is expected to reach 44.4 million members at the midpoint, which reflects growth across our key business segments. In the Commercial business, we project our risk-based enrollment will end the year between 4.5 million to 4.6 million members. And our fee-based business will end the year between 25.5 million and 25.7 million members.
In our Medicaid business, we expect to end the year with approximately 10 million to 10.2 million lives, reflecting organic growth in our existing markets and the expectation that the reverification process may remain on hold through the end of the year. In addition, our guidance also includes growth for North Carolina, which is expected to go live later this year.
In Medicare Advantage, we're projecting double-digit growth at the midpoint as we expect continued measured growth over the balance of 2021. Medicare supplement is expected to end the year between 950,000 and 1 million members. And our FEP business is expected to be flat to slightly down at 1.6 million members.
With IngenioRx now firmly embedded in our baseline, we expect 2021 operating revenue to be approximately $135.1 billion, representing growth of 13.5% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points, an increase of 120 basis points at the midpoint from 2019, which is the most recent year in which the health insurer fee did not apply. The increase is largely driven by a mix of business more heavily skewed to Medicaid and Medicare and the impact of COVID, including the recently announced increase in Medicare physician rates.
The SG&A expense ratio is expected to be 10.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points primarily due to growth in operating revenue, in addition to the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee and the benefit of modernization efforts, including systems consolidation and broader process automation.
Looking below the line, we expect investment income to be $940 million and interest expense of $785 million. The tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 22%, with the decrease primarily driven by the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee.
Full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $5.7 billion. As a reminder, operating cash flow in 2020 was heavily impacted by COVID-19 pandemic as well as certain other receipts that were accelerated into 2020. Absent the pull-through of those cash receipts, our 2021 operating cash flow would be roughly 1.1 to 1.2x net income. Our long-term capital deployment targets are unchanged as we progress down this path of becoming the most innovative, valuable and inclusive partner in the health care ecosystem with the continued focus of delivering sustainable long-term shareholder returns.
In terms of capital deployment, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by nearly 19% to $1.13 per share, bringing our dividend yield to roughly 1.4% and continuing our trend of annual dividend increases. We expect full year share repurchase of at least $1.6 billion and our weighted average share count to end the year in the range of 246 million to 248 million shares outstanding.
As Gail mentioned, this past year presented its own unique set of challenges. And while much has changed, it is clear that we are still in the depths of a global pandemic. We remain committed to our mission of improving the lives and communities which we serve. And we will continue to do our part in 2021 to meet the needs of our associates, members, customers and health care providers as we persevere through this pandemic together.

I appreciate the question and the opportunity to clarify the $0.50 to $0.70 change in our expectations. As you mentioned, with the appropriations bill and the extension of the federal health emergency, we now have a disconnect between some of the costs and reimbursements.
We completely agree with your approach to the Medicare 3.75% fee schedule rate increase as well as your sequestration. The Medicare rate increase is for 12 months. The sequestration is only for 3 months as an offset. But there's a third component as well and that's the 20% bump in the inpatient DRG is going to be extended for the full year as well as part of the federal health emergency. So when you take the 3 of those combined, that actually accounts for about 2/3 of the $0.50 to $0.70 differential that you're asking about.
The other 1/3 really relates to the fact that the non-COVID utilization in the fourth quarter was lower than we had anticipated. And with the non-COVID utilization being lower than anticipated, we are unable to accurately capture all of the HCC codes to reflect our appropriate risk scores in our Medicare business. And so once you factor that in, that's about the other 1/3. So you take those out and you'd -- you'll come down to the, say, the $25.10 that you had been modeling to the $24.50 at the midpoint. 
And then in terms of your question associated with the 2022 jump-off point, while it is premature to give 2022 guidance, we do believe that many of these issues are transient. And we are very comfortable affirming the 12% to 15% long-term sustainable growth rate on a $25.10 starting point. We always have the issue with COVID and risk revenues and things could linger. And we will clearly be on top of that throughout the year. But as an outset, we're very comfortable with the $25.10 jump-off point. Thank you for the question."

Conceptually, when you think about your '21 guidance, how have you pegged that thinking?

And as you indicated, there is a lot of variability and assumptions. The most vulnerable populations, which include Medicare Advantage members, et cetera, our expectation is by the end of the first quarter that they will achieve a vaccination level appropriate. We're really looking at having somewhere in the neighborhood of about 60% of Americans vaccinated for the year. Medicare, we expect to be a bit higher. The commercial population and the Medicaid population, we wouldn't expect the vaccines to be rolled out and completed until the end of the summer, maybe even a little bit longer with the commercial population being close to the average for America for the year and then Medicaid being a little bit less.
So to the extent of the rollout and the efficacy of the vaccine very clearly could have an impact on the financial results for the year. As COVID cost go down, then we do expect non-COVID utilization to increase. So it's certainly not a one-for-one but there's clearly a lot of dynamics associated with that modeling. And if the vaccine is either faster or slower, it will have an impact in one direction or another. Hopefully, that helps."

We've added a number of new tools in terms of the -- our trackers and our online tools to ensure that people know where vaccines are available.
We're going to work with our states closely. We entered a partnership with Lyft to provide 60 million free rides. Our sense is that the senior population obviously in the rollout is going to have first access to that. And then as each of the states make their determinations and supply becomes available, we'll be side by side with our partners to ensure that, that we can be as efficient in helping as possible.
So again, everything John said, I think we are trying to model in this incredibly dynamic environment but remain optimistic and supportive of what's happening and want to be a good partner to our states and our customers. So thank you for the question."

In terms of the individual business and sort of as we see Q1 play out, we feel good about our strategy. We continue our thoughtful targeted approach and targeted growth approach in the individual business. We've expanded into a about 115 counties in 2021. Our approach continues to be based upon a focus on best-in-class economics through value-based relationships, differentiated medical management. We really try to partner with key providers to enable excellence in quality and risk adjustment. And so that's been our grounding and we continue with that strategy.
Overall, this year, while we experience growth environmentally, and I think you're alluding to this, there is more competition. Also, there does appear to be less overall new sales across the federal facilitated marketplace and state-based exchanges. It seems to be down a bit year-over-year. We believe this is due to a variety of different factors. We all know that in several states, there were special election periods throughout 2020, which certainly could have been a factor. Also, less overall government engagement, in fact, could change with the Biden administration just in terms of overall marketing. And then less prospect engagement, we saw that just in light of the political environment and the economic climate.
But all that said, as we look forward, we do remain optimistic regarding this business. The new administration certainly looks like they're going to promote and pop up -- and prop up, excuse me, the ACA business. We just heard this week that we'll likely see an extension to open enrollment or special enrollment periods throughout the year and then a possibility of more marketing and facilitated enrollment expenditures.
So overall, I think we'll continue with our thoughtful approach. But with the new administration, I think there's an opportunity for further growth there."

Thank you, Ralph, for that question. And when you look at our MLR guidance, we certainly believe it's appropriate given the uncertainty around the timing and the efficacy of the vaccine rollout and the full year impact of COVID as well as those unexpected changes in Medicare physician rates and sequestration timing mismatch that I talked about earlier have obviously all been incorporated in the 88%.
But really looking at 2019 is the point of comparison since that was the last period that there was not a HIF. It's really -- it's a fairly simple roll forward from that perspective. You look at the mix of the business that we have today with far more Medicaid members. We actually have had exceedingly strong growth in our Medicare Advantage in the last few years being in the upper-teens on a couple of year basis and exceeding the rest of the industry. All of that obviously changes our business mix. And just on an apples-to-apples basis, mix is driving about 60 basis points of the increase in the 2021 MLR versus the 2019 MLR. 
And then when we look at the impacts of COVID -- and there's a lot of things that go into COVID, where there's certainly the cost of COVID, which is in the billions of dollars. There is non-COVID utilization impacts. And in terms of we believe that non-COVID utilization will be less than what a normal year would be in vacuum, then of course, you have the pricing actions that we've taken into account for that as well as reimbursements from regulatory entities that we believe are appropriate in the COVID environment.
When you take the net of all those, the impact of COVID is another 40 to 50 basis points on our MLR for 2021. And there's a multitude of other small items going in both directions that maybe comprise the last 10 basis points. But it's really -- it's those 2 items. It's mix and COVID. Thank you for the question."

Yes, in terms of the COVID cost, I think really probably your question is what type of COVID costs are included in our guidance. And as I said, there's many factors and variables. And so we've spent considerable time analyzing and modeling potential impacts. A few of the peers, A.J. in particular, has asked me what happens if the vaccine rollout is different than soon. Well, I'll tell you of all the modeling assumptions we have, the timing and efficacy of the vaccine is one of the assumptions that has the greatest amount of variability associated with it.
But anyway, all in, we're estimating that we have about a $600 million COVID headwind inherent in our 2021 guidance. And as I said, COVID cost when you include testing treatment, vaccine administration, all the other things such as the Medicare fee schedules, the sequestration, the various waves, it's several billions of dollars. But offsetting that is non-COVID utilization less than a normal year, the pricing actions that we've taken and regulatory reimbursements. And we've been modeling all that. It's coming out to about -- well, about $600 million. And you really think about that. Think about our $24.50 and then you add $600 million to that, that puts us really at the high end or slightly above the high end of our 12% to 15% growth rate range that we've talked about on a sustainable basis.
So again, we do believe that a lot of these issues are transient. And there'll probably be some lingering effects into 2022. But we feel very good about the underlying core business fundamentals that we have as a company.
With that, I'll turn it over to Gail."

And I think that we're past the transition and now we're into full integration of that business with our other opportunities.
If you think about it, IngenioRx, one of the areas this year, we had some nice sales and some really good throughput and integration with our commercial business. But it was impacted somewhat by the jumbo accounts really not going out to market this past year. So we would expect as we sell through '21 that there's continuing and ongoing opportunities to integrate IngenioRx with our commercial footprint. And that's one of our biggest opportunities still. We still see a lot of runway for us to increase the penetration particularly in our middle-sized and large accounts with integrated pharmacy benefit offerings.
We did see some nice wins in 2021 on stand-alone business, which we're really, really happy with. And we think that that's a big opportunity that's to continue. The impact on large accounts this year for just what's happening in the economy, I think, is sort of depressed sales activity and movement. But we had very strong retention across both our commercial and our Ingenio book.
So overall, we feel Ingenio is tracking very much in line to our expectations and really pleased with the performance of the business to date."

In terms of the sort of understanding inside of our guidance on the 2 issues, reverification and testing. First on reverification, we originally, I think, shared with you our thoughts on where this year would come out. Our assumption was that the public health emergency would end in the first quarter. That's what we knew at the time. But we also felt that Medicaid reverifications would probably really begin in the summer. So that was embedded in our thinking.
The other thing, I think, is important to know is right now, we're assuming based on the letter to governors that recently came out that reverifications will be on hold for all of 2021. But in our -- even in our original assumptions, we never assumed that there would be cliff events. And I think that's also an important assumption as you think about the progression of enrollment over the course of the year, that while states were trying to understand their data and managing this, that given just the challenging conditions within each of these states that, that would happen over time in the back half of the year. So again, as we think about this year, we're expecting no reverification -- really, reverification to be on pause for the full year given sort of the initial guidance that's been given to governors.
In terms of your second question, the policy issue on testing, we agree that testing is probably one of the most critical parts of controlling the spread of COVID. And we've been strongly supportive of wide availability of testing offerings. And then it is unprecedented in terms of the situation, trying to understand the additional support for all types of testing and expanding that capacity and also finding it quite frankly, new reliable, rapid and inexpensive ways to do this.
If you think about our industry, health plan benefits have always traditionally covered medical tests as appropriate to diagnose and treat individuals that were ordered by a physician. This is consistent with the long-held insurance practices or contracts and quite frankly, federal guidance. And so as we think about workplace testing, examples of that, that have happened over certainly drug testing or other traditional ways, employers have paid for that outside of the health benefit. And then similarly, public health surveillance testing has traditionally been paid for by states and local health departments. So those are -- I mean as we think about that, we follow that consistent approach to testing and also give you a sense of what we did on reverifications. So thank you for that question."

But just maybe going back conceptually, I think one of the biggest concerns investors have is the risk that as COVID subsides, there's a bolus of deferred utilization and/or that utilization might be at higher acuity as if health conditions have progressed and worsened because of deferred care.
So when we think -- and the line of business where that impact seems to be -- the deferred impact seems to be most significant throughout 2020, it seems to be the Medicare business where seniors have stayed away as much as they are able to.
So as we think about your sort of house view in 2021, how are you thinking about non-COVID utilization, whether there is really pent-up demand, not just getting back to normal and whether that acuity is higher? And is that view particularly any different for commercial, Medicare or Medicaid?"

And as you can imagine, when I discussed earlier the extensive modeling that we've done, there's a lot of different thought processes around that. But conceptually, yes, we do believe that there is pent-up demand in the system. And we do believe that there is a chance that there could be higher acuity associated with when folks get care and that's probably most pronounced in the Medicare line of business. So really, the question is not if those will happen because we do believe those will happen. The question is to what extent and how significant.
And then you also have things like emergency room volume, we believe, will remain low in that the way that people access care will continue to change a bit in the future as it has in the past. To the extent that COVID stays high and then we expect non-COVID utilization, whether it's normal utilization, pent-up demand or anything else to actually be below normal. To the extent that COVID subsides and the vaccine is extremely successful, we do expect that to go up. There's really clearly a natural hedge in there. I have talked in response to other questions about what the net impact is. And we really don't want to talk about specifically how much we have for each of those buckets because they're so fungible and interchangeable and they do hedge and offset each other.

And just to give all the listeners a little bit of frame of reference in terms of when I answer it. In terms of some of the Medicaid callbacks, et cetera, we had experienced about $100 million in the first 6 months of the year, had about $300 million worth in the third quarter. And during the third quarter call, I was asked what do you think the full year is going to be? And I said, probably we expect it to be a little bit more than $0.5 billion, meaning just over $100 million in the fourth quarter.
Well, it turned out that it was more than that in the fourth quarter. It was almost $250 million in the fourth quarter and to make almost $650 million for the year. I think it's very important to note that even with that $650 million clawbacks, with all the various corridor and collar and other rate protections that existed within that block of business, that Medicaid's still into 2020 within target margin ranges.
In terms of the impacts for the future, we have about half of our Medicaid states are repriced on January 1. We are very comfortable with the actuarial credibility of those rates thus far and believe that we will continue to work with our state partners in terms of the challenges that they're facing and respectful of their budget issues but to still receive rates that are actuarially sound and actuarially solid for 2021.
And then there are rate protections, as I said, between collars, corridors, rebates, whatever you want to call them. They all have the same aspect to try to better align cost and revenue within the same time frame in the same period. So we're actually very bullish about our ability here in Medicaid.
And then in terms of the flu season, yes, the ""typical"" flu season or influenza season is much less than anticipated. We've factored that in. I've talked about non-COVID utilization being less than normal in total for the year. That is part of the calculus. So we're actually thrilled with a lot of things that we did even. We took steps to ensure that our members had access to the flu vaccine, to our fall-through campaign.
You may not know this but Anthem partnered with over 100 community-based organizations across our markets. And we stood up 500 pop-up and drive-through clinics in underserved neighborhoods to promote and support higher immunization rates. And we believe some of our efforts helped contribute to the lower-than-normal flu incidents. And as I said, that's all factored into the non-COVID utilization comments that I made earlier.

At this stage, a lot of them are gain shares, although we do have a component of that 60% in full risk.
Our strategy is to continue to build upon that. And we believe that having 1 in 8 patients in our markets that are Anthem patients across our book of business provides us a real foothold in those marketplaces. And we've been working with our care providers to improve that. We started with a program.

So as you can see, this for us is evolving. It's something that we've been working on for a number of years. We've had the infrastructure in place to do it. And now we're increasing and enhancing the amount of full risk that our care providers are taking with us. And we actually expect that to accelerate because of the pandemic. We see increased interest across our businesses and physicians working with us. And we find plenty of access in our markets. I mean I think that's a question that's been asked before. Is there enough capacity in our markets? And we've seen many of our physicians very willing to move along the continuum with us. It's a journey probably a few years still until we get to where we want to be. But ultimately, we've made progress every year and it's a core part of our strategy.
The other area that I just want to touch on is telehealth, which is another part of our strategy not tied necessarily to behavioral health -- or not tied necessarily to risk-based payments. But we also see telehealth, behavioral health in particular, a growing part of our strategy. I shared, more than 60% of our visits in behavioral are done via telehealth. We think that's a great access. And we also think bringing in quite frankly, not just physical health on the medical side but behavioral health into these arrangements. And our pharmacy actually completes the circle for us. And then some of the capabilities within our diversified business group around palliative care and the work that they're doing to make sure that we are better positioned with data to help manage these relationships is another area that we've been investing very heavily in.
So thanks for the question. It's a core part of our strategy. We're on a journey. We still have some work to do but I think we've made really good progress and are going continue to move down the risk corridors. Thank you."

I'll begin and then I'm going to ask Felicia to share some comments around our Medicaid partnerships. You hit really on the 3 key areas that we're partnering with our Blue -- other Blue plans on and even there's a couple of others.
First, in terms of Ingenio. As you know, Blue Cross of Idaho was one of our first commercial partners in that space. And we just added their Medicare Advantage business on January 1. We continue to work across Ingenio in addition to several other relationships that we've had with other Blues.
It's a longer-term sales process because, as you know, most of those contracts are 3- to 5-year contracts so it takes some time. And we really, until this year, we're not in a position, I think, with the transition and other things we're doing to take on most of those kind of arrangements. So we've actually been very balanced in pacing the relationships that we've had there. But we actually do think there's a really good opportunity for us to continue to build and expand.
An area that you didn't talk about specifically was the relationship we have in the group Medicare business. We've got some partnership there also with other groups that we think will help us to expand our combined footprint. And we've been working with our Blue partners on that because we think we offer obviously some capabilities in that space. And we can work with them on their commercial business to convert that to Group Medicare. And we've had some wins this year in that area as well.
The last area is the Diversified Business Group and Beacon's a great example. I mean that asset that we've purchased and brought on to the Anthem family last year, we see as a very big opportunity. They obviously have been a large footprint even before integrating with Anthem. They work with a number of Blue partners. We consider that an opportunity to integrate our whole health strategy and we see our Blue peer is also very interested in expanding there.
In addition, on the Diversified Business Group, we've seen meaningful opportunities to expand CareMore and Aspire. Those are 2 other companies that have worked with Blue partners. And then we're in a joint venture on our integrated health consumer capabilities, which we've talked about in terms of Total Health, Total You and some of the other work that we're doing because those also offer opportunities.
So as you can see, a lot of different things are happening. These are generally several year sales. So I won't say that it's going to happen overnight. But we've seen a real increase in the external business that we've had in working with our Blue partners.
Medicaid is the space that we started our partnerships with and have expanded that into Medicare and the duals. I'm going to ask Felicia maybe to comment on that because that's probably been our longest-standing relationships with our Blue partners."

We've now added Nebraska and Missouri, both branded as healthy Blue. The opportunity that we have is that we're really a natural partner to our Blue plans and see this as an opportunity for us to continue to leverage the breadth and scope of Anthem's deep knowledge around Medicaid execution and being able to continue to grow that membership as we go forward.
When you take a look at where we are today, the great opportunity extends not from Medicaid but also to Medicare. We were able to leverage our partnerships, for example, that we had in Louisiana to move forward with the D-SNP offering. And we're doing the same thing with our partnership in North Carolina as well.
So the future of our alliances and partnerships is strong. I think this is an opportunity for us to demonstrate the value that we bring across the board to our Blue partners. And we'll continue to enhance that as we go forward. 
Gail also mentioned GRS and our opportunities there. And we were able to actually partner with Independence Blue Cross for [ 1/1/21 ] in terms of our partnership with them going forward. So between Medicaid and Medicaid, the opportunity continues to be robust. And we will continue to grow this business as we move forward."

And they really, again, have been more consistent with the plans that we discussed at our Investor Day a couple of years ago. We continue to have systems migration strategies, looking very hard to eliminate nonvalue-added workflows and really enhancing our digital capabilities.
Also, at the end of the third quarter of last year, we had some business optimization charges. And you're starting to see some of the benefits of that already come through the P&L. So all in, we feel very good about that. We clearly have seen significant revenue growth as well. And our revenue growth has far exceeded our growth in SG&A expenses, which serves to lower the SG&A ratio.
So as you know, we're anticipating a lot of growth in Medicaid. Medicaid carries a lower SG&A ratio than the company does in general in terms of mix and weighted average. So a lot of moving parts and a lot of factors. But we're very confident with our 10.8% and believe that it's very much delivering on the promises that we laid out a couple of years at that Investor Day. So thank you for the question."

Diversified Business Group is an extremely important part of our long-term strategy and our long-term growth aspirations. It is not yet large enough to be considered a separate reporting segment under SEC reporting guidelines. So there's only so much information that we can provide on a detailed basis.
But in 2021, we do expect to see some nice growth on a -- specifically on a percentage basis out of Diversified Business Group. The aim is proactively managing capacity as volume returns. And we continue to monitor volumes as utilization demand normalizes. Beacon has initially experienced a reduction in utilization and then rebounded significantly throughout the year. Once Beacon and once the vaccine stabilizes the COVID issue, we expect Beacon to really be a meaningful growth driver in that area here for the future. And our program integrity area is also -- I mean the SIU is also within DBG. And that's been impacted a little bit here in 2020 with lower claims volume and we expect that to kick back up in 2021.
So there are both opportunities for DBG to further penetrate Anthem membership and do things appropriate to help bend the cost curve within Anthem and then sell that externally. Gail just talked a minute ago about some of the opportunities that we have in DBG and penetrating more and more of the Blues. So we're very bullish about DBG's long-term aspirations and helping drive the overall growth of Anthem for the future."

But as John said, similar to other health services business, COVID did have an impact on our ability to doe in-house assessments. And some of the utilization certainly was up in the Beacon behavioral health business. But overall, we're still very positive about the long-term growth projections of our Diversified Business Group.

Just to reiterate what Gail said, we're really pleased with how we landed in 2020 and how the team performed. Overall, with all the headwinds we talked about in 2020, we actually saw the commercial book grow sequentially year-over-year. So that was great. And while we did see furloughs in our book of business in less risky segments being a factor, as Gail just alluded to, the execution was outstanding from the team. Our sales exceeded our lapses for this quarter again and for 9 of the last 12 months. So that was great to see.
And on the local group business side, we actually grew our fully insured and self-funded business in the quarter. So that really played out well.
What you alluded to is what our headwind has been throughout the year. And that's really the in-group change dynamics that occurred in the larger size accounts. And that's really going to be the story for 2021.
As it relates to our execution and how we're starting off the year in 2021, we still feel very good. We feel very good about our portfolio. But again, depending on the economy and how in-group change plays out especially upmarket as you alluded to, will be a big factor as we head into 2021. If that changes and the economy improves quicker than we think, then that would be a positive obviously. But overall, we're taking a more conservative view of that in light of where the economy is today. And I'd say that, that would overall lend itself to about flattish overall membership growth in the commercial business."

I will now turn the call over to Gail."

Despite a year challenge by COVID-19 and significant economic uncertainty, we delivered strong growth across all of our businesses. This morning, Anthem reported fo",1594,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Despite a year challenge by COVID-19 and significant economic uncertainty, we delivered strong growth across all of our businesses. This morning, Anthem reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share of $2.19 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.54. For the full year, Anthem reported GAAP earnings per share of $17.98 and adjusted earnings per share of $22.48.
Our full year results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19 treatment costs and more normal utilization patterns in the second half of the year. Consistent with our expectations, fourth quarter utilization was above baseline, reflecting higher costs attributable to the recent surge of COVID-19 cases, coupled with the return of non-COVID-19 care utilization. 
I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished in 2020 and the strength and resiliency shown by our enterprise amidst the global pandemic. We met our financial commitments, delivered strong growth. And we stepped up as a business and through the commitment and compassion of our associates to support our members, partners and communities when they needed us most to address the new increasing and urgent needs. Our growth in 2020 was powered by strategic investments we've made in recent years to streamline and simplify our business and enhance the member and customer experience.
Membership trends during the year exceeded expectations on all fronts. Medical enrollment finished the year strong at 42.9 million members, representing growth of 1.9 million members over the prior year. We're pleased that our commercial business has continued to grow even in this challenging economic environment.
In addition to the AmeriBen acquisition, growth has been fueled by strong customer retention and a steady pipeline of new account sales. In fact, sales in our large group risk business have outpaced lapses in 14 of the last 16 months, reflecting the market-leading performance of our new virtual strategies and tools as well as the benefit of our innovative products such as Total Health, Total You and further integration of our pharmacy offerings from IngenioRx. 
Total commercial membership was flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in our risk-based group business offset by in-group change in our fee-based business as a result of the economic environment. Our risk-based business has been incredibly resilient as we've deepened talent, enhanced our products and improved sales execution across our markets. In addition, sales of our large group specialty dental and vision products outperformed 2019 results, demonstrating that employers value the affordability and simplicity of Anthem's integrated medical and specialty offerings. It's clear the actions we've taken to focus on the consumer and their unique needs are garnering a strong market response. 
Medicaid membership grew by roughly 1.6 million consumers during the year and nearly 300,000 lives in the fourth quarter, marked by strong organic growth aided by the pause on reverifications and 2 strategic acquisitions in Nebraska and Missouri.
Medicare Advantage membership ended the year up nearly 18% compared to 2019, continuing our meaningful growth in senior business. Our essential extra suite of benefit options are resonating with seniors as we saw a greater than 300% increase in the selection of benefits such as personal home helper services, transportation benefits and access to personal home safety devices. We're pleased with our continued growth in this important segment for Anthem and the demonstrated resilience of our diversified portfolio. 
Our AEP performance is in line with expectations. And we expect another year of double-digit growth, once again outperforming the industry average growth rate.
Over the past year, Anthem stepped up as a trusted health partner to support our stakeholders as they navigated the pandemic. We adapted and accelerated our digital innovations, enhanced our focus on community health, transformed many of our products and solutions and simplified our processes in the context of COVID-19. We recognize our critical role in ensuring safe access to care and COVID-19 vaccinations and have launched a nationwide partnership with Lyft to support universal access to vaccines. We are leveraging Anthem's local market strength, provider relationships and data assets in combination with this on-demand transportation network to serve at-risk communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Our goal is to provide 60 million free rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income, uninsured and at-risk communities.
Further, we recently launched a new online C19 vaccine tracker to provide personalized vaccination insights for Anthem members. This web-based dashboard aggregates vaccine-related data from public and private sources to give consumers a real-time view of vaccine distribution progress and help to inform our members when they might be eligible to receive the vaccine.
We recognize the increased social and health needs of our members and communities during this pandemic. With each of our Medicaid states, we're performing detailed community needs assessments to create localized solutions with our partners to support issues with housing, job training and free Internet for underserved children. And our Medicare members are provided access to phone-based social workers to help coordinate local resources and services to support their needs around food and security, transportation and more.
For members with complex conditions such as cancer, receiving care has become even more difficult during this pandemic. In response, we've launched Anthem's Concierge Cancer Care program. From diagnosis to recovery, members receive personalized 24/7 guidance and support through LiveHealth Online and remote monitoring technology with access to top-tier cancer facilities across the country. The resuming program has more than tripled since its launch in 2020 and is now available to nearly 900,000 members.
Throughout the course of this past year, our deeply committed associates have stepped up and shown great compassion and care to those we serve and to one another. With more than 100,000 volunteer hours logged in our local communities through in-person and virtual giving, our associates have embodied our values and culture, reflecting the fabric of who we are.
As we move into 2021, we will continue to modernize our business to drive growth. Efforts to transform our business are not new. And in fact, our focus was sharpened and investments accelerated in light of the pandemic. Today, we are continuing to consolidate our systems, automate and streamline processes and embed digital and AI across the enterprise to simplify and improve the customer experience and deepen engagement with all those we serve.
We recognize the power of digital technologies to reach more of our stakeholders particularly as part of our community health efforts. Sydney Health is personalizing care for consumers, helping to bridge gaps in care and improve outcomes for underserved populations. In fact, Sydney Health recently received several awards, including Corporate Insight's gold medal for virtual care, recognizing our ability to give members more options in how they engage with care providers, whether it be via chat, e-mail, phone or video.
We're excited to be introducing the first-of-its-kind digital nutrition assistant. Through the use of AI, our Sydney nutrition app will be able to automatically recognize food and log meals in real time, providing users with personalized information and progress on nutrition goals. This integrated tool is currently available to Anthem associates and will be available more broadly later this year to provide our members with a fully connected health and wellness experience.
We know consumers are experiencing health care more digitally. So we focused on creating greater access to care via telehealth particularly in the behavioral health space, where usage has gone up from single-digit, pre-pandemic percentage levels to as much as 60% of all visits. And that level has stayed consistent over the past 4 months.
Our AI-based care finder is now live for all segments of our business and differentiates Anthem with a fully integrated approach using predictive tools and AI to help guide members to the right care at the right time and place for them, which can mean via text, phone, video, in person or chat. Additionally, through our AI-based predictive service and chat functionality, we were able to redirect 5 million member calls last year to on-demand digital channels to provide members with information they needed quickly and efficiently.
Today, we're delivering on consumer demands for simplicity and affordability. And we're helping to restore hope while making positive and sustainable change for our local communities. Grounded by our mission and driven by our purpose to improve the health of humanity, we move into 2021 with a bold agenda as we continue to grow and transform our business and fundamentally improve the health care experience for those we serve.
Our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of greater than $24.50 reflects challenges unforeseen when we reported third quarter results. Specifically, adjusted net income guidance reflects the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which includes a 1-year increase in Medicare physician rates as well as other COVID-19-related impacts on the Medicare business. All in, we estimate these items equate to a $0.50 to $0.70 net negative headwind. Importantly, these factors are transient and should diminish as we move into 2022.
Looking ahead, we are poised to deliver membership growth of nearly 1.5 million members at the midpoint driven predominantly by our risk-based businesses. Our outlook reflects our ability to deliver solid enrollment growth despite the uncertainties in 2021. We remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term 12% to 15% earnings growth and look forward to our March 3 Virtual Investor Day. We will provide a more detailed look into our strategy, including the transformative digital and community health initiatives that are driving real growth across our business.
And now I'll turn it over to John Gallina for a detailed look at our performance numbers. John?"

As Gail stated, we are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial results. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.54, down 35% year-over-year driven primarily by costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken to support our members. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $22.48, representing growth of 16% over 2019. Total operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $31.5 billion, an increase of more than 16% over the prior year quarter, reflecting solid growth in Medicaid and Medicare. For the full year, we ended 2020 serving 42.9 million members, including growth of 300,000 lives during the fourth quarter. Medicaid membership was up more than 11x the decline in our commercial risk-based business. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of membership growth, further demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business. For the full year, operating revenue grew over 17%.
The fourth quarter medical loss ratio was 88.9%, a decrease of 10 basis points over the prior year quarter. COVID-related costs accelerated during the quarter above expectations. However, this was offset by non-COVID utilization coming in lower than expectations. Taken together, overall utilization was above baseline albeit slightly better than expected.
The SG&A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 13.7%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year quarter due primarily to increased spending to support growth, including efforts taken to modernize our business and become a more agile organization as well as the return of the health insurer fee in 2020. On a HIF-adjusted basis, our SG&A ratio decreased 30 basis points compared to the prior year quarter primarily driven by double-digit growth in operating revenue.
Full year 2020 operating cash flow was $10.7 billion or 2.3x net income. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $3.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to changes in our net working capital and enrollment growth in our Government businesses. Our operating cash flow in the fourth quarter benefited by a number of payments that were originally expected to be received in 2021. These early receipts along with other items that benefited 2020 cash flow, including payment deferrals allowed under the CARES Act, will reverse in 2021 and negatively impact our 2021 operating cash flow metrics.
We ended 2020 with a strong balance sheet as the debt-to-cap ratio was at 38.7%, consistent with our target range. Days in claims payable was 43.4 days, an increase of 2.3 days sequentially and 5.4 days versus the prior year along with the growth in medical claims payable of 28% compared to an increase in premium revenue of approximately 11%.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares at a weighted average price of $305.66. In total, we repurchased $2.7 billion of stock in 2020 or 9.4 million shares. As a reminder, our original guidance contemplated share repurchase of $1.5 billion. After reinstating share repurchases in the second quarter, we accelerated the pace of share buyback in the second half of the year in response to market conditions.
Turning to our 2021 outlook. Our current guidance reflects our latest assumptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our guidance includes new items that were unknown at the time of our third quarter call, including the passing of the Consolidated Appropriations Act in late December and the corresponding 1-year increase in Medicare physician payment rates and other COVID-related impacts on our Medicare business. In addition, the significant decline in non-COVID utilization in our Medicare business during the fourth quarter will have an impact on our risk revenue by more than we had anticipated. All in, these items resulted in a net negative headwind of $0.50 to $0.70 per share relative to the outlook we shared on our third quarter call.
Like 2020, 2021 presents its own set of unique challenges that we believe to be transient. Our core business and underlying fundamentals remain strong. Absent these new and unique circumstances, we remain confident that our long-term earnings growth target of 12% to 15% is both credible and sustainable.
Turning to our 2021 guidance metrics. Total medical membership is expected to reach 44.4 million members at the midpoint, which reflects growth across our key business segments. In the Commercial business, we project our risk-based enrollment will end the year between 4.5 million to 4.6 million members. And our fee-based business will end the year between 25.5 million and 25.7 million members.
In our Medicaid business, we expect to end the year with approximately 10 million to 10.2 million lives, reflecting organic growth in our existing markets and the expectation that the reverification process may remain on hold through the end of the year. In addition, our guidance also includes growth for North Carolina, which is expected to go live later this year.
In Medicare Advantage, we're projecting double-digit growth at the midpoint as we expect continued measured growth over the balance of 2021. Medicare supplement is expected to end the year between 950,000 and 1 million members. And our FEP business is expected to be flat to slightly down at 1.6 million members.
With IngenioRx now firmly embedded in our baseline, we expect 2021 operating revenue to be approximately $135.1 billion, representing growth of 13.5% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points, an increase of 120 basis points at the midpoint from 2019, which is the most recent year in which the health insurer fee did not apply. The increase is largely driven by a mix of business more heavily skewed to Medicaid and Medicare and the impact of COVID, including the recently announced increase in Medicare physician rates.
The SG&A expense ratio is expected to be 10.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points primarily due to growth in operating revenue, in addition to the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee and the benefit of modernization efforts, including systems consolidation and broader process automation.
Looking below the line, we expect investment income to be $940 million and interest expense of $785 million. The tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 22%, with the decrease primarily driven by the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee.
Full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $5.7 billion. As a reminder, operating cash flow in 2020 was heavily impacted by COVID-19 pandemic as well as certain other receipts that were accelerated into 2020. Absent the pull-through of those cash receipts, our 2021 operating cash flow would be roughly 1.1 to 1.2x net income. Our long-term capital deployment targets are unchanged as we progress down this path of becoming the most innovative, valuable and inclusive partner in the health care ecosystem with the continued focus of delivering sustainable long-term shareholder returns.
In terms of capital deployment, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by nearly 19% to $1.13 per share, bringing our dividend yield to roughly 1.4% and continuing our trend of annual dividend increases. We expect full year share repurchase of at least $1.6 billion and our weighted average share count to end the year in the range of 246 million to 248 million shares outstanding.
As Gail mentioned, this past year presented its own unique set of challenges. And while much has changed, it is clear that we are still in the depths of a global pandemic. We remain committed to our mission of improving the lives and communities which we serve. And we will continue to do our part in 2021 to meet the needs of our associates, members, customers and health care providers as we persevere through this pandemic together.

I appreciate the question and the opportunity to clarify the $0.50 to $0.70 change in our expectations. As you mentioned, with the appropriations bill and the extension of the federal health emergency, we now have a disconnect between some of the costs and reimbursements.
We completely agree with your approach to the Medicare 3.75% fee schedule rate increase as well as your sequestration. The Medicare rate increase is for 12 months. The sequestration is only for 3 months as an offset. But there's a third component as well and that's the 20% bump in the inpatient DRG is going to be extended for the full year as well as part of the federal health emergency. So when you take the 3 of those combined, that actually accounts for about 2/3 of the $0.50 to $0.70 differential that you're asking about.
The other 1/3 really relates to the fact that the non-COVID utilization in the fourth quarter was lower than we had anticipated. And with the non-COVID utilization being lower than anticipated, we are unable to accurately capture all of the HCC codes to reflect our appropriate risk scores in our Medicare business. And so once you factor that in, that's about the other 1/3. So you take those out and you'd -- you'll come down to the, say, the $25.10 that you had been modeling to the $24.50 at the midpoint. 
And then in terms of your question associated with the 2022 jump-off point, while it is premature to give 2022 guidance, we do believe that many of these issues are transient. And we are very comfortable affirming the 12% to 15% long-term sustainable growth rate on a $25.10 starting point. We always have the issue with COVID and risk revenues and things could linger. And we will clearly be on top of that throughout the year. But as an outset, we're very comfortable with the $25.10 jump-off point. Thank you for the question."

And as you indicated, there is a lot of variability and assumptions. The most vulnerable populations, which include Medicare Advantage members, et cetera, our expectation is by the end of the first quarter that they will achieve a vaccination level appropriate. We're really looking at having somewhere in the neighborhood of about 60% of Americans vaccinated for the year. Medicare, we expect to be a bit higher. The commercial population and the Medicaid population, we wouldn't expect the vaccines to be rolled out and completed until the end of the summer, maybe even a little bit longer with the commercial population being close to the average for America for the year and then Medicaid being a little bit less.
So to the extent of the rollout and the efficacy of the vaccine very clearly could have an impact on the financial results for the year. As COVID cost go down, then we do expect non-COVID utilization to increase. So it's certainly not a one-for-one but there's clearly a lot of dynamics associated with that modeling. And if the vaccine is either faster or slower, it will have an impact in one direction or another. Hopefully, that helps."

We're going to work with our states closely. We entered a partnership with Lyft to provide 60 million free rides. Our sense is that the senior population obviously in the rollout is going to have first access to that. And then as each of the states make their determinations and supply becomes available, we'll be side by side with our partners to ensure that, that we can be as efficient in helping as possible.
So again, everything John said, I think we are trying to model in this incredibly dynamic environment but remain optimistic and supportive of what's happening and want to be a good partner to our states and our customers. So thank you for the question."

Our approach continues to be based upon a focus on best-in-class economics through value-based relationships, differentiated medical management. We really try to partner with key providers to enable excellence in quality and risk adjustment. And so that's been our grounding and we continue with that strategy.
Overall, this year, while we experience growth environmentally, and I think you're alluding to this, there is more competition. Also, there does appear to be less overall new sales across the federal facilitated marketplace and state-based exchanges. It seems to be down a bit year-over-year. We believe this is due to a variety of different factors. We all know that in several states, there were special election periods throughout 2020, which certainly could have been a factor. Also, less overall government engagement, in fact, could change with the Biden administration just in terms of overall marketing. And then less prospect engagement, we saw that just in light of the political environment and the economic climate.
But all that said, as we look forward, we do remain optimistic regarding this business. The new administration certainly looks like they're going to promote and pop up -- and prop up, excuse me, the ACA business. We just heard this week that we'll likely see an extension to open enrollment or special enrollment periods throughout the year and then a possibility of more marketing and facilitated enrollment expenditures.
So overall, I think we'll continue with our thoughtful approach. But with the new administration, I think there's an opportunity for further growth there."

Thank you, Ralph, for that question. And when you look at our MLR guidance, we certainly believe it's appropriate given the uncertainty around the timing and the efficacy of the vaccine rollout and the full year impact of COVID as well as those unexpected changes in Medicare physician rates and sequestration timing mismatch that I talked about earlier have obviously all been incorporated in the 88%.
But really looking at 2019 is the point of comparison since that was the last period that there was not a HIF. It's really -- it's a fairly simple roll forward from that perspective. You look at the mix of the business that we have today with far more Medicaid members. We actually have had exceedingly strong growth in our Medicare Advantage in the last few years being in the upper-teens on a couple of year basis and exceeding the rest of the industry. All of that obviously changes our business mix. And just on an apples-to-apples basis, mix is driving about 60 basis points of the increase in the 2021 MLR versus the 2019 MLR. 
And then when we look at the impacts of COVID -- and there's a lot of things that go into COVID, where there's certainly the cost of COVID, which is in the billions of dollars. There is non-COVID utilization impacts. And in terms of we believe that non-COVID utilization will be less than what a normal year would be in vacuum, then of course, you have the pricing actions that we've taken into account for that as well as reimbursements from regulatory entities that we believe are appropriate in the COVID environment.
When you take the net of all those, the impact of COVID is another 40 to 50 basis points on our MLR for 2021. And there's a multitude of other small items going in both directions that maybe comprise the last 10 basis points. But it's really -- it's those 2 items. It's mix and COVID. Thank you for the question."

Yes, in terms of the COVID cost, I think really probably your question is what type of COVID costs are included in our guidance. And as I said, there's many factors and variables. And so we've spent considerable time analyzing and modeling potential impacts. A few of the peers, A.J. in particular, has asked me what happens if the vaccine rollout is different than soon. Well, I'll tell you of all the modeling assumptions we have, the timing and efficacy of the vaccine is one of the assumptions that has the greatest amount of variability associated with it.
But anyway, all in, we're estimating that we have about a $600 million COVID headwind inherent in our 2021 guidance. And as I said, COVID cost when you include testing treatment, vaccine administration, all the other things such as the Medicare fee schedules, the sequestration, the various waves, it's several billions of dollars. But offsetting that is non-COVID utilization less than a normal year, the pricing actions that we've taken and regulatory reimbursements. And we've been modeling all that. It's coming out to about -- well, about $600 million. And you really think about that. Think about our $24.50 and then you add $600 million to that, that puts us really at the high end or slightly above the high end of our 12% to 15% growth rate range that we've talked about on a sustainable basis.
So again, we do believe that a lot of these issues are transient. And there'll probably be some lingering effects into 2022. But we feel very good about the underlying core business fundamentals that we have as a company.
With that, I'll turn it over to Gail."

And I think that we're past the transition and now we're into full integration of that business with our other opportunities.
If you think about it, IngenioRx, one of the areas this year, we had some nice sales and some really good throughput and integration with our commercial business. But it was impacted somewhat by the jumbo accounts really not going out to market this past year. So we would expect as we sell through '21 that there's continuing and ongoing opportunities to integrate IngenioRx with our commercial footprint. And that's one of our biggest opportunities still. We still see a lot of runway for us to increase the penetration particularly in our middle-sized and large accounts with integrated pharmacy benefit offerings.
We did see some nice wins in 2021 on stand-alone business, which we're really, really happy with. And we think that that's a big opportunity that's to continue. The impact on large accounts this year for just what's happening in the economy, I think, is sort of depressed sales activity and movement. But we had very strong retention across both our commercial and our Ingenio book.
So overall, we feel Ingenio is tracking very much in line to our expectations and really pleased with the performance of the business to date."

And then second, how you're thinking about testing costs. It sounds like you're including some testing costs in there.

In terms of the sort of understanding inside of our guidance on the 2 issues, reverification and testing. First on reverification, we originally, I think, shared with you our thoughts on where this year would come out. Our assumption was that the public health emergency would end in the first quarter. That's what we knew at the time. But we also felt that Medicaid reverifications would probably really begin in the summer. So that was embedded in our thinking.
The other thing, I think, is important to know is right now, we're assuming based on the letter to governors that recently came out that reverifications will be on hold for all of 2021. But in our -- even in our original assumptions, we never assumed that there would be cliff events. And I think that's also an important assumption as you think about the progression of enrollment over the course of the year, that while states were trying to understand their data and managing this, that given just the challenging conditions within each of these states that, that would happen over time in the back half of the year. So again, as we think about this year, we're expecting no reverification -- really, reverification to be on pause for the full year given sort of the initial guidance that's been given to governors.
In terms of your second question, the policy issue on testing, we agree that testing is probably one of the most critical parts of controlling the spread of COVID. And we've been strongly supportive of wide availability of testing offerings. And then it is unprecedented in terms of the situation, trying to understand the additional support for all types of testing and expanding that capacity and also finding it quite frankly, new reliable, rapid and inexpensive ways to do this.
If you think about our industry, health plan benefits have always traditionally covered medical tests as appropriate to diagnose and treat individuals that were ordered by a physician. This is consistent with the long-held insurance practices or contracts and quite frankly, federal guidance. And so as we think about workplace testing, examples of that, that have happened over certainly drug testing or other traditional ways, employers have paid for that outside of the health benefit. And then similarly, public health surveillance testing has traditionally been paid for by states and local health departments. So those are -- I mean as we think about that, we follow that consistent approach to testing and also give you a sense of what we did on reverifications. So thank you for that question."

But just maybe going back conceptually, I think one of the biggest concerns investors have is the risk that as COVID subsides, there's a bolus of deferred utilization and/or that utilization might be at higher acuity as if health conditions have progressed and worsened because of deferred care.
So when we think -- and the line of business where that impact seems to be -- the deferred impact seems to be most significant throughout 2020, it seems to be the Medicare business where seniors have stayed away as much as they are able to.
So as we think about your sort of house view in 2021, how are you thinking about non-COVID utilization, whether there is really pent-up demand, not just getting back to normal and whether that acuity is higher? And is that view particularly any different for commercial, Medicare or Medicaid?"

And as you can imagine, when I discussed earlier the extensive modeling that we've done, there's a lot of different thought processes around that. But conceptually, yes, we do believe that there is pent-up demand in the system. And we do believe that there is a chance that there could be higher acuity associated with when folks get care and that's probably most pronounced in the Medicare line of business. So really, the question is not if those will happen because we do believe those will happen. The question is to what extent and how significant.
And then you also have things like emergency room volume, we believe, will remain low in that the way that people access care will continue to change a bit in the future as it has in the past. To the extent that COVID stays high and then we expect non-COVID utilization, whether it's normal utilization, pent-up demand or anything else to actually be below normal. To the extent that COVID subsides and the vaccine is extremely successful, we do expect that to go up. There's really clearly a natural hedge in there. I have talked in response to other questions about what the net impact is. And we really don't want to talk about specifically how much we have for each of those buckets because they're so fungible and interchangeable and they do hedge and offset each other.
But the premise of your question, we completely agree with.

And just to give all the listeners a little bit of frame of reference in terms of when I answer it. In terms of some of the Medicaid callbacks, et cetera, we had experienced about $100 million in the first 6 months of the year, had about $300 million worth in the third quarter. And during the third quarter call, I was asked what do you think the full year is going to be? And I said, probably we expect it to be a little bit more than $0.5 billion, meaning just over $100 million in the fourth quarter.
Well, it turned out that it was more than that in the fourth quarter. It was almost $250 million in the fourth quarter and to make almost $650 million for the year. I think it's very important to note that even with that $650 million clawbacks, with all the various corridor and collar and other rate protections that existed within that block of business, that Medicaid's still into 2020 within target margin ranges.
In terms of the impacts for the future, we have about half of our Medicaid states are repriced on January 1. We are very comfortable with the actuarial credibility of those rates thus far and believe that we will continue to work with our state partners in terms of the challenges that they're facing and respectful of their budget issues but to still receive rates that are actuarially sound and actuarially solid for 2021.
And then there are rate protections, as I said, between collars, corridors, rebates, whatever you want to call them. They all have the same aspect to try to better align cost and revenue within the same time frame in the same period. So we're actually very bullish about our ability here in Medicaid.
And then in terms of the flu season, yes, the ""typical"" flu season or influenza season is much less than anticipated. We've factored that in. I've talked about non-COVID utilization being less than normal in total for the year. That is part of the calculus. So we're actually thrilled with a lot of things that we did even. We took steps to ensure that our members had access to the flu vaccine, to our fall-through campaign.
You may not know this but Anthem partnered with over 100 community-based organizations across our markets. And we stood up 500 pop-up and drive-through clinics in underserved neighborhoods to promote and support higher immunization rates. And we believe some of our efforts helped contribute to the lower-than-normal flu incidents. And as I said, that's all factored into the non-COVID utilization comments that I made earlier.

So what does that mean? It's a variety of relationships that we have. And we are moving to increase to much more capitated full risk arrangements particularly in our government business. At this stage, a lot of them are gain shares, although we do have a component of that 60% in full risk.
Our strategy is to continue to build upon that. And we believe that having 1 in 8 patients in our markets that are Anthem patients across our book of business provides us a real foothold in those marketplaces. And we've been working with our care providers to improve that. We started with a program. It was really based on primary care capitation and working with them on their share to get them more involved.
So our strategy does revolve around primary care. And we're going to continue to build on that. We have 180 accountable care organizations. 23% of those are roughly operating under shared risk arrangements as well. And then if you think about other innovation programs, we've got about 69% of our medical spend tied to performance-based contracts as well.
So as you can see, this for us is evolving. It's something that we've been working on for a number of years. We've had the infrastructure in place to do it. And now we're increasing and enhancing the amount of full risk that our care providers are taking with us. And we actually expect that to accelerate because of the pandemic. We see increased interest across our businesses and physicians working with us. And we find plenty of access in our markets. I mean I think that's a question that's been asked before. Is there enough capacity in our markets? And we've seen many of our physicians very willing to move along the continuum with us. It's a journey probably a few years still until we get to where we want to be. But ultimately, we've made progress every year and it's a core part of our strategy.
The other area that I just want to touch on is telehealth, which is another part of our strategy not tied necessarily to behavioral health -- or not tied necessarily to risk-based payments. But we also see telehealth, behavioral health in particular, a growing part of our strategy. I shared, more than 60% of our visits in behavioral are done via telehealth. We think that's a great access. And we also think bringing in quite frankly, not just physical health on the medical side but behavioral health into these arrangements. And our pharmacy actually completes the circle for us. And then some of the capabilities within our diversified business group around palliative care and the work that they're doing to make sure that we are better positioned with data to help manage these relationships is another area that we've been investing very heavily in.
So thanks for the question. It's a core part of our strategy. We're on a journey. We still have some work to do but I think we've made really good progress and are going continue to move down the risk corridors. Thank you."

I'll begin and then I'm going to ask Felicia to share some comments around our Medicaid partnerships. You hit really on the 3 key areas that we're partnering with our Blue -- other Blue plans on and even there's a couple of others.
First, in terms of Ingenio. As you know, Blue Cross of Idaho was one of our first commercial partners in that space. And we just added their Medicare Advantage business on January 1. We continue to work across Ingenio in addition to several other relationships that we've had with other Blues.
It's a longer-term sales process because, as you know, most of those contracts are 3- to 5-year contracts so it takes some time. And we really, until this year, we're not in a position, I think, with the transition and other things we're doing to take on most of those kind of arrangements. So we've actually been very balanced in pacing the relationships that we've had there. But we actually do think there's a really good opportunity for us to continue to build and expand.
An area that you didn't talk about specifically was the relationship we have in the group Medicare business. We've got some partnership there also with other groups that we think will help us to expand our combined footprint. And we've been working with our Blue partners on that because we think we offer obviously some capabilities in that space. And we can work with them on their commercial business to convert that to Group Medicare. And we've had some wins this year in that area as well.
The last area is the Diversified Business Group and Beacon's a great example. I mean that asset that we've purchased and brought on to the Anthem family last year, we see as a very big opportunity. They obviously have been a large footprint even before integrating with Anthem. They work with a number of Blue partners. We consider that an opportunity to integrate our whole health strategy and we see our Blue peer is also very interested in expanding there.
In addition, on the Diversified Business Group, we've seen meaningful opportunities to expand CareMore and Aspire. Those are 2 other companies that have worked with Blue partners. And then we're in a joint venture on our integrated health consumer capabilities, which we've talked about in terms of Total Health, Total You and some of the other work that we're doing because those also offer opportunities.
So as you can see, a lot of different things are happening. These are generally several year sales. So I won't say that it's going to happen overnight. But we've seen a real increase in the external business that we've had in working with our Blue partners.
Medicaid is the space that we started our partnerships with and have expanded that into Medicare and the duals. I'm going to ask Felicia maybe to comment on that because that's probably been our longest-standing relationships with our Blue partners."

We've now added Nebraska and Missouri, both branded as healthy Blue. The opportunity that we have is that we're really a natural partner to our Blue plans and see this as an opportunity for us to continue to leverage the breadth and scope of Anthem's deep knowledge around Medicaid execution and being able to continue to grow that membership as we go forward.
When you take a look at where we are today, the great opportunity extends not from Medicaid but also to Medicare. We were able to leverage our partnerships, for example, that we had in Louisiana to move forward with the D-SNP offering. And we're doing the same thing with our partnership in North Carolina as well.
So the future of our alliances and partnerships is strong. I think this is an opportunity for us to demonstrate the value that we bring across the board to our Blue partners. And we'll continue to enhance that as we go forward. 
Gail also mentioned GRS and our opportunities there. And we were able to actually partner with Independence Blue Cross for [ 1/1/21 ] in terms of our partnership with them going forward. So between Medicaid and Medicaid, the opportunity continues to be robust. And we will continue to grow this business as we move forward."

And they really, again, have been more consistent with the plans that we discussed at our Investor Day a couple of years ago. We continue to have systems migration strategies, looking very hard to eliminate nonvalue-added workflows and really enhancing our digital capabilities.
Also, at the end of the third quarter of last year, we had some business optimization charges. And you're starting to see some of the benefits of that already come through the P&L. So all in, we feel very good about that. We clearly have seen significant revenue growth as well. And our revenue growth has far exceeded our growth in SG&A expenses, which serves to lower the SG&A ratio.
So as you know, we're anticipating a lot of growth in Medicaid. Medicaid carries a lower SG&A ratio than the company does in general in terms of mix and weighted average. So a lot of moving parts and a lot of factors. But we're very confident with our 10.8% and believe that it's very much delivering on the promises that we laid out a couple of years at that Investor Day. So thank you for the question."

Diversified Business Group is an extremely important part of our long-term strategy and our long-term growth aspirations. It is not yet large enough to be considered a separate reporting segment under SEC reporting guidelines. So there's only so much information that we can provide on a detailed basis.
But in 2021, we do expect to see some nice growth on a -- specifically on a percentage basis out of Diversified Business Group. The aim is proactively managing capacity as volume returns. And we continue to monitor volumes as utilization demand normalizes. Beacon has initially experienced a reduction in utilization and then rebounded significantly throughout the year. Once Beacon and once the vaccine stabilizes the COVID issue, we expect Beacon to really be a meaningful growth driver in that area here for the future. And our program integrity area is also -- I mean the SIU is also within DBG. And that's been impacted a little bit here in 2020 with lower claims volume and we expect that to kick back up in 2021.
So there are both opportunities for DBG to further penetrate Anthem membership and do things appropriate to help bend the cost curve within Anthem and then sell that externally. Gail just talked a minute ago about some of the opportunities that we have in DBG and penetrating more and more of the Blues. So we're very bullish about DBG's long-term aspirations and helping drive the overall growth of Anthem for the future."

But as John said, similar to other health services business, COVID did have an impact on our ability to doe in-house assessments. And some of the utilization certainly was up in the Beacon behavioral health business. But overall, we're still very positive about the long-term growth projections of our Diversified Business Group.

Just to reiterate what Gail said, we're really pleased with how we landed in 2020 and how the team performed. Overall, with all the headwinds we talked about in 2020, we actually saw the commercial book grow sequentially year-over-year. So that was great. And while we did see furloughs in our book of business in less risky segments being a factor, as Gail just alluded to, the execution was outstanding from the team. Our sales exceeded our lapses for this quarter again and for 9 of the last 12 months. So that was great to see.
And on the local group business side, we actually grew our fully insured and self-funded business in the quarter. So that really played out well.
What you alluded to is what our headwind has been throughout the year. And that's really the in-group change dynamics that occurred in the larger size accounts. And that's really going to be the story for 2021.
As it relates to our execution and how we're starting off the year in 2021, we still feel very good. We feel very good about our portfolio. But again, depending on the economy and how in-group change plays out especially upmarket as you alluded to, will be a big factor as we head into 2021. If that changes and the economy improves quicker than we think, then that would be a positive obviously. But overall, we're taking a more conservative view of that in light of where the economy is today. And I'd say that, that would overall lend itself to about flattish overall membership growth in the commercial business."

Despite a year challenge by COVID-19 and significant economic uncertainty, we delivered strong growth across all of our businesses.

For the full year, Anthem reported GAAP earnings per share of $17.98 and adjusted earnings per share of $22.48.
Our full year results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19 treatment costs and more normal utilization patterns in the second half of the year. Consistent with our expectations, fourth quarter utilization was above baseline, reflecting higher costs attributable to the recent surge of COVID-19 cases, coupled with the return of non-COVID-19 care utilization. 
I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished in 2020 and the strength and resiliency shown by our enterprise amidst the global pandemic. We met our financial commitments, delivered strong growth. And we stepped up as a business and through the commitment and compassion of our associates to support our members, partners and communities when they needed us most to address the new increasing and urgent needs. Our growth in 2020 was powered by strategic investments we've made in recent years to streamline and simplify our business and enhance the member and customer experience.
Membership trends during the year exceeded expectations on all fronts. Medical enrollment finished the year strong at 42.9 million members, representing growth of 1.9 million members over the prior year. We're pleased that our commercial business has continued to grow even in this challenging economic environment.
In addition to the AmeriBen acquisition, growth has been fueled by strong customer retention and a steady pipeline of new account sales. In fact, sales in our large group risk business have outpaced lapses in 14 of the last 16 months, reflecting the market-leading performance of our new virtual strategies and tools as well as the benefit of our innovative products such as Total Health, Total You and further integration of our pharmacy offerings from IngenioRx. 
Total commercial membership was flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in our risk-based group business offset by in-group change in our fee-based business as a result of the economic environment. Our risk-based business has been incredibly resilient as we've deepened talent, enhanced our products and improved sales execution across our markets. In addition, sales of our large group specialty dental and vision products outperformed 2019 results, demonstrating that employers value the affordability and simplicity of Anthem's integrated medical and specialty offerings. It's clear the actions we've taken to focus on the consumer and their unique needs are garnering a strong market response. 
Medicaid membership grew by roughly 1.6 million consumers during the year and nearly 300,000 lives in the fourth quarter, marked by strong organic growth aided by the pause on reverifications and 2 strategic acquisitions in Nebraska and Missouri.
Medicare Advantage membership ended the year up nearly 18% compared to 2019, continuing our meaningful growth in senior business. Our essential extra suite of benefit options are resonating with seniors as we saw a greater than 300% increase in the selection of benefits such as personal home helper services, transportation benefits and access to personal home safety devices. We're pleased with our continued growth in this important segment for Anthem and the demonstrated resilience of our diversified portfolio. 
Our AEP performance is in line with expectations. And we expect another year of double-digit growth, once again outperforming the industry average growth rate.
Over the past year, Anthem stepped up as a trusted health partner to support our stakeholders as they navigated the pandemic. We adapted and accelerated our digital innovations, enhanced our focus on community health, transformed many of our products and solutions and simplified our processes in the context of COVID-19. We recognize our critical role in ensuring safe access to care and COVID-19 vaccinations and have launched a nationwide partnership with Lyft to support universal access to vaccines. We are leveraging Anthem's local market strength, provider relationships and data assets in combination with this on-demand transportation network to serve at-risk communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Our goal is to provide 60 million free rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income, uninsured and at-risk communities.
Further, we recently launched a new online C19 vaccine tracker to provide personalized vaccination insights for Anthem members. This web-based dashboard aggregates vaccine-related data from public and private sources to give consumers a real-time view of vaccine distribution progress and help to inform our members when they might be eligible to receive the vaccine.
We recognize the increased social and health needs of our members and communities during this pandemic. With each of our Medicaid states, we're performing detailed community needs assessments to create localized solutions with our partners to support issues with housing, job training and free Internet for underserved children. And our Medicare members are provided access to phone-based social workers to help coordinate local resources and services to support their needs around food and security, transportation and more.
For members with complex conditions such as cancer, receiving care has become even more difficult during this pandemic. In response, we've launched Anthem's Concierge Cancer Care program. From diagnosis to recovery, members receive personalized 24/7 guidance and support through LiveHealth Online and remote monitoring technology with access to top-tier cancer facilities across the country. The resuming program has more than tripled since its launch in 2020 and is now available to nearly 900,000 members.
Throughout the course of this past year, our deeply committed associates have stepped up and shown great compassion and care to those we serve and to one another. With more than 100,000 volunteer hours logged in our local communities through in-person and virtual giving, our associates have embodied our values and culture, reflecting the fabric of who we are.
As we move into 2021, we will continue to modernize our business to drive growth. Efforts to transform our business are not new. And in fact, our focus was sharpened and investments accelerated in light of the pandemic. Today, we are continuing to consolidate our systems, automate and streamline processes and embed digital and AI across the enterprise to simplify and improve the customer experience and deepen engagement with all those we serve.
We recognize the power of digital technologies to reach more of our stakeholders particularly as part of our community health efforts. Sydney Health is personalizing care for consumers, helping to bridge gaps in care and improve outcomes for underserved populations. In fact, Sydney Health recently received several awards, including Corporate Insight's gold medal for virtual care, recognizing our ability to give members more options in how they engage with care providers, whether it be via chat, e-mail, phone or video.
We're excited to be introducing the first-of-its-kind digital nutrition assistant. Through the use of AI, our Sydney nutrition app will be able to automatically recognize food and log meals in real time, providing users with personalized information and progress on nutrition goals. This integrated tool is currently available to Anthem associates and will be available more broadly later this year to provide our members with a fully connected health and wellness experience.
We know consumers are experiencing health care more digitally. So we focused on creating greater access to care via telehealth particularly in the behavioral health space, where usage has gone up from single-digit, pre-pandemic percentage levels to as much as 60% of all visits. And that level has stayed consistent over the past 4 months.
Our AI-based care finder is now live for all segments of our business and differentiates Anthem with a fully integrated approach using predictive tools and AI to help guide members to the right care at the right time and place for them, which can mean via text, phone, video, in person or chat. Additionally, through our AI-based predictive service and chat functionality, we were able to redirect 5 million member calls last year to on-demand digital channels to provide members with information they needed quickly and efficiently.
Today, we're delivering on consumer demands for simplicity and affordability. And we're helping to restore hope while making positive and sustainable change for our local communities. Grounded by our mission and driven by our purpose to improve the health of humanity, we move into 2021 with a bold agenda as we continue to grow and transform our business and fundamentally improve the health care experience for those we serve.
Our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of greater than $24.50 reflects challenges unforeseen when we reported third quarter results. Specifically, adjusted net income guidance reflects the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which includes a 1-year increase in Medicare physician rates as well as other COVID-19-related impacts on the Medicare business. All in, we estimate these items equate to a $0.50 to $0.70 net negative headwind. Importantly, these factors are transient and should diminish as we move into 2022.
Looking ahead, we are poised to deliver membership growth of nearly 1.5 million members at the midpoint driven predominantly by our risk-based businesses. Our outlook reflects our ability to deliver solid enrollment growth despite the uncertainties in 2021. We remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term 12% to 15% earnings growth and look forward to our March 3 Virtual Investor Day. We will provide a more detailed look into our strategy, including the transformative digital and community health initiatives that are driving real growth across our business.
And now I'll turn it over to John Gallina for a detailed look at our performance numbers. John?"

As Gail stated, we are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial results. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.54, down 35% year-over-year driven primarily by costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken to support our members. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $22.48, representing growth of 16% over 2019. Total operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $31.5 billion, an increase of more than 16% over the prior year quarter, reflecting solid growth in Medicaid and Medicare. For the full year, we ended 2020 serving 42.9 million members, including growth of 300,000 lives during the fourth quarter. Medicaid membership was up more than 11x the decline in our commercial risk-based business. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of membership growth, further demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business. For the full year, operating revenue grew over 17%.
The fourth quarter medical loss ratio was 88.9%, a decrease of 10 basis points over the prior year quarter. COVID-related costs accelerated during the quarter above expectations. However, this was offset by non-COVID utilization coming in lower than expectations. Taken together, overall utilization was above baseline albeit slightly better than expected.
The SG&A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 13.7%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year quarter due primarily to increased spending to support growth, including efforts taken to modernize our business and become a more agile organization as well as the return of the health insurer fee in 2020. On a HIF-adjusted basis, our SG&A ratio decreased 30 basis points compared to the prior year quarter primarily driven by double-digit growth in operating revenue.
Full year 2020 operating cash flow was $10.7 billion or 2.3x net income. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $3.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to changes in our net working capital and enrollment growth in our Government businesses. Our operating cash flow in the fourth quarter benefited by a number of payments that were originally expected to be received in 2021. These early receipts along with other items that benefited 2020 cash flow, including payment deferrals allowed under the CARES Act, will reverse in 2021 and negatively impact our 2021 operating cash flow metrics.
We ended 2020 with a strong balance sheet as the debt-to-cap ratio was at 38.7%, consistent with our target range. Days in claims payable was 43.4 days, an increase of 2.3 days sequentially and 5.4 days versus the prior year along with the growth in medical claims payable of 28% compared to an increase in premium revenue of approximately 11%.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares at a weighted average price of $305.66. In total, we repurchased $2.7 billion of stock in 2020 or 9.4 million shares. As a reminder, our original guidance contemplated share repurchase of $1.5 billion. After reinstating share repurchases in the second quarter, we accelerated the pace of share buyback in the second half of the year in response to market conditions.
Turning to our 2021 outlook. Our current guidance reflects our latest assumptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our guidance includes new items that were unknown at the time of our third quarter call, including the passing of the Consolidated Appropriations Act in late December and the corresponding 1-year increase in Medicare physician payment rates and other COVID-related impacts on our Medicare business. In addition, the significant decline in non-COVID utilization in our Medicare business during the fourth quarter will have an impact on our risk revenue by more than we had anticipated. All in, these items resulted in a net negative headwind of $0.50 to $0.70 per share relative to the outlook we shared on our third quarter call.
Like 2020, 2021 presents its own set of unique challenges that we believe to be transient. Our core business and underlying fundamentals remain strong. Absent these new and unique circumstances, we remain confident that our long-term earnings growth target of 12% to 15% is both credible and sustainable.
Turning to our 2021 guidance metrics. Total medical membership is expected to reach 44.4 million members at the midpoint, which reflects growth across our key business segments. In the Commercial business, we project our risk-based enrollment will end the year between 4.5 million to 4.6 million members. And our fee-based business will end the year between 25.5 million and 25.7 million members.
In our Medicaid business, we expect to end the year with approximately 10 million to 10.2 million lives, reflecting organic growth in our existing markets and the expectation that the reverification process may remain on hold through the end of the year. In addition, our guidance also includes growth for North Carolina, which is expected to go live later this year.
In Medicare Advantage, we're projecting double-digit growth at the midpoint as we expect continued measured growth over the balance of 2021. Medicare supplement is expected to end the year between 950,000 and 1 million members. And our FEP business is expected to be flat to slightly down at 1.6 million members.
With IngenioRx now firmly embedded in our baseline, we expect 2021 operating revenue to be approximately $135.1 billion, representing growth of 13.5% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points, an increase of 120 basis points at the midpoint from 2019, which is the most recent year in which the health insurer fee did not apply. The increase is largely driven by a mix of business more heavily skewed to Medicaid and Medicare and the impact of COVID, including the recently announced increase in Medicare physician rates.
The SG&A expense ratio is expected to be 10.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points primarily due to growth in operating revenue, in addition to the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee and the benefit of modernization efforts, including systems consolidation and broader process automation.
Looking below the line, we expect investment income to be $940 million and interest expense of $785 million. The tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 22%, with the decrease primarily driven by the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee.
Full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $5.7 billion. As a reminder, operating cash flow in 2020 was heavily impacted by COVID-19 pandemic as well as certain other receipts that were accelerated into 2020. Absent the pull-through of those cash receipts, our 2021 operating cash flow would be roughly 1.1 to 1.2x net income. Our long-term capital deployment targets are unchanged as we progress down this path of becoming the most innovative, valuable and inclusive partner in the health care ecosystem with the continued focus of delivering sustainable long-term shareholder returns.
In terms of capital deployment, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by nearly 19% to $1.13 per share, bringing our dividend yield to roughly 1.4% and continuing our trend of annual dividend increases. We expect full year share repurchase of at least $1.6 billion and our weighted average share count to end the year in the range of 246 million to 248 million shares outstanding.
As Gail mentioned, this past year presented its own unique set of challenges. And while much has changed, it is clear that we are still in the depths of a global pandemic. We remain committed to our mission of improving the lives and communities which we serve. And we will continue to do our part in 2021 to meet the needs of our associates, members, customers and health care providers as we persevere through this pandemic together.

I appreciate the question and the opportunity to clarify the $0.50 to $0.70 change in our expectations. As you mentioned, with the appropriations bill and the extension of the federal health emergency, we now have a disconnect between some of the costs and reimbursements.
We completely agree with your approach to the Medicare 3.75% fee schedule rate increase as well as your sequestration. The Medicare rate increase is for 12 months. The sequestration is only for 3 months as an offset. But there's a third component as well and that's the 20% bump in the inpatient DRG is going to be extended for the full year as well as part of the federal health emergency. So when you take the 3 of those combined, that actually accounts for about 2/3 of the $0.50 to $0.70 differential that you're asking about.
The other 1/3 really relates to the fact that the non-COVID utilization in the fourth quarter was lower than we had anticipated. And with the non-COVID utilization being lower than anticipated, we are unable to accurately capture all of the HCC codes to reflect our appropriate risk scores in our Medicare business. And so once you factor that in, that's about the other 1/3. So you take those out and you'd -- you'll come down to the, say, the $25.10 that you had been modeling to the $24.50 at the midpoint. 
And then in terms of your question associated with the 2022 jump-off point, while it is premature to give 2022 guidance, we do believe that many of these issues are transient. And we are very comfortable affirming the 12% to 15% long-term sustainable growth rate on a $25.10 starting point. We always have the issue with COVID and risk revenues and things could linger. And we will clearly be on top of that throughout the year. But as an outset, we're very comfortable with the $25.10 jump-off point. Thank you for the question."

And as you indicated, there is a lot of variability and assumptions. The most vulnerable populations, which include Medicare Advantage members, et cetera, our expectation is by the end of the first quarter that they will achieve a vaccination level appropriate. We're really looking at having somewhere in the neighborhood of about 60% of Americans vaccinated for the year. Medicare, we expect to be a bit higher. The commercial population and the Medicaid population, we wouldn't expect the vaccines to be rolled out and completed until the end of the summer, maybe even a little bit longer with the commercial population being close to the average for America for the year and then Medicaid being a little bit less.
So to the extent of the rollout and the efficacy of the vaccine very clearly could have an impact on the financial results for the year. As COVID cost go down, then we do expect non-COVID utilization to increase. So it's certainly not a one-for-one but there's clearly a lot of dynamics associated with that modeling. And if the vaccine is either faster or slower, it will have an impact in one direction or another. Hopefully, that helps."

We're going to work with our states closely. We entered a partnership with Lyft to provide 60 million free rides. Our sense is that the senior population obviously in the rollout is going to have first access to that. And then as each of the states make their determinations and supply becomes available, we'll be side by side with our partners to ensure that, that we can be as efficient in helping as possible.
So again, everything John said, I think we are trying to model in this incredibly dynamic environment but remain optimistic and supportive of what's happening and want to be a good partner to our states and our customers. So thank you for the question."

Our approach continues to be based upon a focus on best-in-class economics through value-based relationships, differentiated medical management. We really try to partner with key providers to enable excellence in quality and risk adjustment. And so that's been our grounding and we continue with that strategy.
Overall, this year, while we experience growth environmentally, and I think you're alluding to this, there is more competition. Also, there does appear to be less overall new sales across the federal facilitated marketplace and state-based exchanges. It seems to be down a bit year-over-year. We believe this is due to a variety of different factors. We all know that in several states, there were special election periods throughout 2020, which certainly could have been a factor. Also, less overall government engagement, in fact, could change with the Biden administration just in terms of overall marketing. And then less prospect engagement, we saw that just in light of the political environment and the economic climate.
But all that said, as we look forward, we do remain optimistic regarding this business. The new administration certainly looks like they're going to promote and pop up -- and prop up, excuse me, the ACA business. We just heard this week that we'll likely see an extension to open enrollment or special enrollment periods throughout the year and then a possibility of more marketing and facilitated enrollment expenditures.
So overall, I think we'll continue with our thoughtful approach. But with the new administration, I think there's an opportunity for further growth there."

Thank you, Ralph, for that question. And when you look at our MLR guidance, we certainly believe it's appropriate given the uncertainty around the timing and the efficacy of the vaccine rollout and the full year impact of COVID as well as those unexpected changes in Medicare physician rates and sequestration timing mismatch that I talked about earlier have obviously all been incorporated in the 88%.
But really looking at 2019 is the point of comparison since that was the last period that there was not a HIF. It's really -- it's a fairly simple roll forward from that perspective. You look at the mix of the business that we have today with far more Medicaid members. We actually have had exceedingly strong growth in our Medicare Advantage in the last few years being in the upper-teens on a couple of year basis and exceeding the rest of the industry. All of that obviously changes our business mix. And just on an apples-to-apples basis, mix is driving about 60 basis points of the increase in the 2021 MLR versus the 2019 MLR. 
And then when we look at the impacts of COVID -- and there's a lot of things that go into COVID, where there's certainly the cost of COVID, which is in the billions of dollars. There is non-COVID utilization impacts. And in terms of we believe that non-COVID utilization will be less than what a normal year would be in vacuum, then of course, you have the pricing actions that we've taken into account for that as well as reimbursements from regulatory entities that we believe are appropriate in the COVID environment.
When you take the net of all those, the impact of COVID is another 40 to 50 basis points on our MLR for 2021. And there's a multitude of other small items going in both directions that maybe comprise the last 10 basis points. But it's really -- it's those 2 items. It's mix and COVID. Thank you for the question."

Yes, in terms of the COVID cost, I think really probably your question is what type of COVID costs are included in our guidance. And as I said, there's many factors and variables. And so we've spent considerable time analyzing and modeling potential impacts. A few of the peers, A.J. in particular, has asked me what happens if the vaccine rollout is different than soon. Well, I'll tell you of all the modeling assumptions we have, the timing and efficacy of the vaccine is one of the assumptions that has the greatest amount of variability associated with it.
But anyway, all in, we're estimating that we have about a $600 million COVID headwind inherent in our 2021 guidance. And as I said, COVID cost when you include testing treatment, vaccine administration, all the other things such as the Medicare fee schedules, the sequestration, the various waves, it's several billions of dollars. But offsetting that is non-COVID utilization less than a normal year, the pricing actions that we've taken and regulatory reimbursements. And we've been modeling all that. It's coming out to about -- well, about $600 million. And you really think about that. Think about our $24.50 and then you add $600 million to that, that puts us really at the high end or slightly above the high end of our 12% to 15% growth rate range that we've talked about on a sustainable basis.
So again, we do believe that a lot of these issues are transient. And there'll probably be some lingering effects into 2022. But we feel very good about the underlying core business fundamentals that we have as a company.
With that, I'll turn it over to Gail."

And I think that we're past the transition and now we're into full integration of that business with our other opportunities.
If you think about it, IngenioRx, one of the areas this year, we had some nice sales and some really good throughput and integration with our commercial business. But it was impacted somewhat by the jumbo accounts really not going out to market this past year. So we would expect as we sell through '21 that there's continuing and ongoing opportunities to integrate IngenioRx with our commercial footprint. And that's one of our biggest opportunities still. We still see a lot of runway for us to increase the penetration particularly in our middle-sized and large accounts with integrated pharmacy benefit offerings.
We did see some nice wins in 2021 on stand-alone business, which we're really, really happy with. And we think that that's a big opportunity that's to continue. The impact on large accounts this year for just what's happening in the economy, I think, is sort of depressed sales activity and movement. But we had very strong retention across both our commercial and our Ingenio book.
So overall, we feel Ingenio is tracking very much in line to our expectations and really pleased with the performance of the business to date."

In terms of the sort of understanding inside of our guidance on the 2 issues, reverification and testing. First on reverification, we originally, I think, shared with you our thoughts on where this year would come out. Our assumption was that the public health emergency would end in the first quarter. That's what we knew at the time. But we also felt that Medicaid reverifications would probably really begin in the summer. So that was embedded in our thinking.
The other thing, I think, is important to know is right now, we're assuming based on the letter to governors that recently came out that reverifications will be on hold for all of 2021. But in our -- even in our original assumptions, we never assumed that there would be cliff events. And I think that's also an important assumption as you think about the progression of enrollment over the course of the year, that while states were trying to understand their data and managing this, that given just the challenging conditions within each of these states that, that would happen over time in the back half of the year. So again, as we think about this year, we're expecting no reverification -- really, reverification to be on pause for the full year given sort of the initial guidance that's been given to governors.
In terms of your second question, the policy issue on testing, we agree that testing is probably one of the most critical parts of controlling the spread of COVID. And we've been strongly supportive of wide availability of testing offerings. And then it is unprecedented in terms of the situation, trying to understand the additional support for all types of testing and expanding that capacity and also finding it quite frankly, new reliable, rapid and inexpensive ways to do this.
If you think about our industry, health plan benefits have always traditionally covered medical tests as appropriate to diagnose and treat individuals that were ordered by a physician. This is consistent with the long-held insurance practices or contracts and quite frankly, federal guidance. And so as we think about workplace testing, examples of that, that have happened over certainly drug testing or other traditional ways, employers have paid for that outside of the health benefit. And then similarly, public health surveillance testing has traditionally been paid for by states and local health departments. So those are -- I mean as we think about that, we follow that consistent approach to testing and also give you a sense of what we did on reverifications. So thank you for that question."

But just maybe going back conceptually, I think one of the biggest concerns investors have is the risk that as COVID subsides, there's a bolus of deferred utilization and/or that utilization might be at higher acuity as if health conditions have progressed and worsened because of deferred care.
So when we think -- and the line of business where that impact seems to be -- the deferred impact seems to be most significant throughout 2020, it seems to be the Medicare business where seniors have stayed away as much as they are able to.
So as we think about your sort of house view in 2021, how are you thinking about non-COVID utilization, whether there is really pent-up demand, not just getting back to normal and whether that acuity is higher? And is that view particularly any different for commercial, Medicare or Medicaid?"

And as you can imagine, when I discussed earlier the extensive modeling that we've done, there's a lot of different thought processes around that. But conceptually, yes, we do believe that there is pent-up demand in the system. And we do believe that there is a chance that there could be higher acuity associated with when folks get care and that's probably most pronounced in the Medicare line of business. So really, the question is not if those will happen because we do believe those will happen. The question is to what extent and how significant.
And then you also have things like emergency room volume, we believe, will remain low in that the way that people access care will continue to change a bit in the future as it has in the past. To the extent that COVID stays high and then we expect non-COVID utilization, whether it's normal utilization, pent-up demand or anything else to actually be below normal. To the extent that COVID subsides and the vaccine is extremely successful, we do expect that to go up. There's really clearly a natural hedge in there. I have talked in response to other questions about what the net impact is. And we really don't want to talk about specifically how much we have for each of those buckets because they're so fungible and interchangeable and they do hedge and offset each other.

We're assessing access to care and how all of that is happening across each of our businesses.

And just to give all the listeners a little bit of frame of reference in terms of when I answer it. In terms of some of the Medicaid callbacks, et cetera, we had experienced about $100 million in the first 6 months of the year, had about $300 million worth in the third quarter. And during the third quarter call, I was asked what do you think the full year is going to be? And I said, probably we expect it to be a little bit more than $0.5 billion, meaning just over $100 million in the fourth quarter.
Well, it turned out that it was more than that in the fourth quarter. It was almost $250 million in the fourth quarter and to make almost $650 million for the year. I think it's very important to note that even with that $650 million clawbacks, with all the various corridor and collar and other rate protections that existed within that block of business, that Medicaid's still into 2020 within target margin ranges.
In terms of the impacts for the future, we have about half of our Medicaid states are repriced on January 1. We are very comfortable with the actuarial credibility of those rates thus far and believe that we will continue to work with our state partners in terms of the challenges that they're facing and respectful of their budget issues but to still receive rates that are actuarially sound and actuarially solid for 2021.
And then there are rate protections, as I said, between collars, corridors, rebates, whatever you want to call them. They all have the same aspect to try to better align cost and revenue within the same time frame in the same period. So we're actually very bullish about our ability here in Medicaid.
And then in terms of the flu season, yes, the ""typical"" flu season or influenza season is much less than anticipated. We've factored that in. I've talked about non-COVID utilization being less than normal in total for the year. That is part of the calculus. So we're actually thrilled with a lot of things that we did even. We took steps to ensure that our members had access to the flu vaccine, to our fall-through campaign.
You may not know this but Anthem partnered with over 100 community-based organizations across our markets. And we stood up 500 pop-up and drive-through clinics in underserved neighborhoods to promote and support higher immunization rates. And we believe some of our efforts helped contribute to the lower-than-normal flu incidents. And as I said, that's all factored into the non-COVID utilization comments that I made earlier.

So what does that mean? It's a variety of relationships that we have. And we are moving to increase to much more capitated full risk arrangements particularly in our government business. At this stage, a lot of them are gain shares, although we do have a component of that 60% in full risk.
Our strategy is to continue to build upon that. And we believe that having 1 in 8 patients in our markets that are Anthem patients across our book of business provides us a real foothold in those marketplaces. And we've been working with our care providers to improve that. We started with a program. It was really based on primary care capitation and working with them on their share to get them more involved.
So our strategy does revolve around primary care. And we're going to continue to build on that. We have 180 accountable care organizations. 23% of those are roughly operating under shared risk arrangements as well. And then if you think about other innovation programs, we've got about 69% of our medical spend tied to performance-based contracts as well.
So as you can see, this for us is evolving. It's something that we've been working on for a number of years. We've had the infrastructure in place to do it. And now we're increasing and enhancing the amount of full risk that our care providers are taking with us. And we actually expect that to accelerate because of the pandemic. We see increased interest across our businesses and physicians working with us. And we find plenty of access in our markets. I mean I think that's a question that's been asked before. Is there enough capacity in our markets? And we've seen many of our physicians very willing to move along the continuum with us. It's a journey probably a few years still until we get to where we want to be. But ultimately, we've made progress every year and it's a core part of our strategy.
The other area that I just want to touch on is telehealth, which is another part of our strategy not tied necessarily to behavioral health -- or not tied necessarily to risk-based payments. But we also see telehealth, behavioral health in particular, a growing part of our strategy. I shared, more than 60% of our visits in behavioral are done via telehealth. We think that's a great access. And we also think bringing in quite frankly, not just physical health on the medical side but behavioral health into these arrangements. And our pharmacy actually completes the circle for us. And then some of the capabilities within our diversified business group around palliative care and the work that they're doing to make sure that we are better positioned with data to help manage these relationships is another area that we've been investing very heavily in.
So thanks for the question. It's a core part of our strategy. We're on a journey. We still have some work to do but I think we've made really good progress and are going continue to move down the risk corridors. Thank you."

I'll begin and then I'm going to ask Felicia to share some comments around our Medicaid partnerships. You hit really on the 3 key areas that we're partnering with our Blue -- other Blue plans on and even there's a couple of others.
First, in terms of Ingenio. As you know, Blue Cross of Idaho was one of our first commercial partners in that space. And we just added their Medicare Advantage business on January 1. We continue to work across Ingenio in addition to several other relationships that we've had with other Blues.
It's a longer-term sales process because, as you know, most of those contracts are 3- to 5-year contracts so it takes some time. And we really, until this year, we're not in a position, I think, with the transition and other things we're doing to take on most of those kind of arrangements. So we've actually been very balanced in pacing the relationships that we've had there. But we actually do think there's a really good opportunity for us to continue to build and expand.
An area that you didn't talk about specifically was the relationship we have in the group Medicare business. We've got some partnership there also with other groups that we think will help us to expand our combined footprint. And we've been working with our Blue partners on that because we think we offer obviously some capabilities in that space. And we can work with them on their commercial business to convert that to Group Medicare. And we've had some wins this year in that area as well.
The last area is the Diversified Business Group and Beacon's a great example. I mean that asset that we've purchased and brought on to the Anthem family last year, we see as a very big opportunity. They obviously have been a large footprint even before integrating with Anthem. They work with a number of Blue partners. We consider that an opportunity to integrate our whole health strategy and we see our Blue peer is also very interested in expanding there.
In addition, on the Diversified Business Group, we've seen meaningful opportunities to expand CareMore and Aspire. Those are 2 other companies that have worked with Blue partners. And then we're in a joint venture on our integrated health consumer capabilities, which we've talked about in terms of Total Health, Total You and some of the other work that we're doing because those also offer opportunities.
So as you can see, a lot of different things are happening. These are generally several year sales. So I won't say that it's going to happen overnight. But we've seen a real increase in the external business that we've had in working with our Blue partners.
Medicaid is the space that we started our partnerships with and have expanded that into Medicare and the duals. I'm going to ask Felicia maybe to comment on that because that's probably been our longest-standing relationships with our Blue partners."

We've now added Nebraska and Missouri, both branded as healthy Blue. The opportunity that we have is that we're really a natural partner to our Blue plans and see this as an opportunity for us to continue to leverage the breadth and scope of Anthem's deep knowledge around Medicaid execution and being able to continue to grow that membership as we go forward.
When you take a look at where we are today, the great opportunity extends not from Medicaid but also to Medicare. We were able to leverage our partnerships, for example, that we had in Louisiana to move forward with the D-SNP offering. And we're doing the same thing with our partnership in North Carolina as well.
So the future of our alliances and partnerships is strong. I think this is an opportunity for us to demonstrate the value that we bring across the board to our Blue partners. And we'll continue to enhance that as we go forward. 
Gail also mentioned GRS and our opportunities there. And we were able to actually partner with Independence Blue Cross for [ 1/1/21 ] in terms of our partnership with them going forward. So between Medicaid and Medicaid, the opportunity continues to be robust. And we will continue to grow this business as we move forward."

And they really, again, have been more consistent with the plans that we discussed at our Investor Day a couple of years ago. We continue to have systems migration strategies, looking very hard to eliminate nonvalue-added workflows and really enhancing our digital capabilities.
Also, at the end of the third quarter of last year, we had some business optimization charges. And you're starting to see some of the benefits of that already come through the P&L. So all in, we feel very good about that. We clearly have seen significant revenue growth as well. And our revenue growth has far exceeded our growth in SG&A expenses, which serves to lower the SG&A ratio.
So as you know, we're anticipating a lot of growth in Medicaid. Medicaid carries a lower SG&A ratio than the company does in general in terms of mix and weighted average. So a lot of moving parts and a lot of factors. But we're very confident with our 10.8% and believe that it's very much delivering on the promises that we laid out a couple of years at that Investor Day. So thank you for the question."

Diversified Business Group is an extremely important part of our long-term strategy and our long-term growth aspirations. It is not yet large enough to be considered a separate reporting segment under SEC reporting guidelines. So there's only so much information that we can provide on a detailed basis.
But in 2021, we do expect to see some nice growth on a -- specifically on a percentage basis out of Diversified Business Group. The aim is proactively managing capacity as volume returns. And we continue to monitor volumes as utilization demand normalizes. Beacon has initially experienced a reduction in utilization and then rebounded significantly throughout the year. Once Beacon and once the vaccine stabilizes the COVID issue, we expect Beacon to really be a meaningful growth driver in that area here for the future. And our program integrity area is also -- I mean the SIU is also within DBG. And that's been impacted a little bit here in 2020 with lower claims volume and we expect that to kick back up in 2021.
So there are both opportunities for DBG to further penetrate Anthem membership and do things appropriate to help bend the cost curve within Anthem and then sell that externally. Gail just talked a minute ago about some of the opportunities that we have in DBG and penetrating more and more of the Blues. So we're very bullish about DBG's long-term aspirations and helping drive the overall growth of Anthem for the future."

And we're starting to see some of that already inside of the Anthem numbers, where both CareMore and Beacon particularly this year have really supported Anthem's growth.
But as John said, similar to other health services business, COVID did have an impact on our ability to doe in-house assessments. And some of the utilization certainly was up in the Beacon behavioral health business. But overall, we're still very positive about the long-term growth projections of our Diversified Business Group.

Just to reiterate what Gail said, we're really pleased with how we landed in 2020 and how the team performed. Overall, with all the headwinds we talked about in 2020, we actually saw the commercial book grow sequentially year-over-year. So that was great. And while we did see furloughs in our book of business in less risky segments being a factor, as Gail just alluded to, the execution was outstanding from the team. Our sales exceeded our lapses for this quarter again and for 9 of the last 12 months. So that was great to see.
And on the local group business side, we actually grew our fully insured and self-funded business in the quarter. So that really played out well.
What you alluded to is what our headwind has been throughout the year. And that's really the in-group change dynamics that occurred in the larger size accounts. And that's really going to be the story for 2021.
As it relates to our execution and how we're starting off the year in 2021, we still feel very good. We feel very good about our portfolio. But again, depending on the economy and how in-group change plays out especially upmarket as you alluded to, will be a big factor as we head into 2021. If that changes and the economy improves quicker than we think, then that would be a positive obviously. But overall, we're taking a more conservative view of that in light of where the economy is today. And I'd say that, that would overall lend itself to about flattish overall membership growth in the commercial business."

From a group perspective, group membership came in well. I would say that as we mentioned before, there were some delayed decisions from employers with respect to Group Retiree business for 2021.

This morning, we reported first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01, reflecting growing momentum in our business despite the challenges of the environment. When we came together for this call a year ago, we're only just beginning to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications for health care. Over these last 12 months, I'm incredibly proud of how we've led during a period characterized by uncertainty. From day 1, we partnered with local, state and federal officials to ensure our members were prepared with the resources and support they need to navigate through the pandemic. 
In 2020, our associates logged more than 110,000 volunteer hours and more than 17,000 hours so far in 2021, addressing critical issues in their local communities such as food and security and social isolation. Our efforts have recently shifted from a focus on treatment and testing to vaccinations. We recognize that we play a critical role in the fight against the pandemic and ensuring safe and equitable access to vaccines in our communities. 
Through our multichannel approach, we've been able to reach nearly 2/3 of our members with information regarding where, when and how they can access COVID-19 vaccines in their own communities, including coordinating in-home vaccinations for our homebound members, while covering vaccine administration costs for our commercial members with no out-of-pocket cost sharing. In addition, clinicians at our CareMore and HealthSun clinics have helped thousands of our most vulnerable seniors get vaccinated. I'm incredibly grateful to our associates who have adapted seamlessly and worked diligently through the pandemic to support our consumers. 
Our focus on health starts with our own associates, and we're committed to empowering them to live a healthy lifestyle. For those who received the vaccine, we're offering a choice of a onetime credit towards their own health care premiums or a donation on their behalf to the Anthem Cares Fund, which provides financial support to Anthem associates in need. 
As a company that has been grounded in our local communities for more than 75 years, we have an unwavering commitment to positively influence not only the health of our consumers but the health of the communities in which we live and work. 
Membership growth in the first quarter clearly reflects the balance and resilience of our core business with strong growth in our Government Business led by Medicaid. With eligibility reverifications on hold across the country, our organic growth remains robust. Medicare Advantage membership also tracked in line with our expectations, growing [ 15% ] year-over-year through the first quarter. We're honored to have been selected to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in Ohio, a state where Anthem currently holds the leading commercial and Medicare Advantage market share positions. With the launch of this contract, Anthem will serve consumers across all products in the state of Ohio, further underscoring our ability to be a lifetime trusted health partner. 
Commercial enrollment grew sequentially to start the year, outperforming expectations, with growth led by our risk-based business. As expected, commercial membership decreased slightly year-over-year driven by in-group attrition in our group fee-based business. In spite of many national account prospects electing to delay decisions until 2022, we had one of our strongest selling seasons in the past 5 years. Sales exceeded lapses in our large group fully-insured business for the sixth consecutive quarter and for 10 of the past 11. Our success speaks to the strength of our sales team, the value of our innovative solutions and our commitment to being a valued partner to our customers. 
Given our solid overall performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to greater than $25.10 from greater than $24.50, putting us on track to achieve our long-term 12% to 15% annual adjusted EPS growth target, even as we continue to dedicate resources to combating the pandemic. 
Looking ahead, our digital solutions will continue to drive growth. And we are fundamentally changing how we leverage technology to deliver the exceptional experiences that consumers expect from us and to help address health disparities and improve outcomes by sharing insight with care providers. We now have close to 10 million people engaged on our digital channels with access to a wide array of virtual care specialties and resources to help them lead healthy lives. 
One of our digital solutions, Anthem's Concierge Care program, aims to solve distinct problems for our customers. Our suite of programs universally offer seamless experience for members facing chronic or complex conditions, connecting them with their entire care team on a single centralized platform and allowing them to seek support in real time when it's right for them. 
Today, our Concierge Care programs are available to just under 1 million members with line of sight into tripling enrollment over the next few years. This program integrates remote patient monitoring that shares real-time data with care providers at all times. 
We have also partnered with connected device manufacturers to leverage their capabilities to expand remote care options that allow patients and their clinicians to conduct virtual office visits, culminating and personalized experiences for our members, better outcomes and improved affordability. Our deep roots in our communities and our partnership with local care providers enable us to scale these initiatives in real time. with a focus on collaborating across the continuum of care, while ensuring our care provider partners have access to best-in-class digital tools and capabilities to help them deliver better outcomes. 
Predictive AI and real-time access to data, coupled with a growing focus on value-based arrangements with care providers, is enabling us to improve access to high-quality, affordable health care and facilitate better consumer and physician decision-making. The integration of these capabilities is what will enable us to deliver on our commitment to drive commercial medical cost trend down towards CPI by 2025, a goal we shared with you at our Investor Day last month. 
Earlier this year, we launched the nation's largest high-performance network in partnership with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. The Blue High Performance network is guiding members towards providers who are aligned with our goal of driving greater affordability and improved outcomes. The benefits are compelling with average savings of 11% and up to 20% in certain markets. Through AI and machine learning, we're also providing members with access to personalized health information to help them make informed health care decisions. When searching for providers, most digital tools automatically default to recommending providers based solely on location. Anthem's smart provider finder on our Sydney Health app gives consumers greater control of their care by taking into account the factors that matter most such as condition-specific needs, affordability and quality. We're intensely focused on enhancing our capabilities aimed at addressing the needs of people with chronic and complex conditions. 
Our pending acquisition of myNEXUS combines the power of digital and advanced analytics to expertly manage and coordinate home-based health care. Anthem has been a customer of myNEXUS since 2017, with more than 830,000 of our individual and group retiree Medicare Advantage members currently managed by myNEXUS. We have seen firsthand the positive contributions myNEXUS has had on our members' quality of life, and we look forward to expanding this impact across even more of our members. Equally important, this acquisition provides Anthem with another pathway to managing a greater portion of the overall health care dollar, a key strategic pillar of our Diversified Business Group that will allow us to create end-to-end seamless experiences from post-acute care to home health with pathways to services like AIM, Aspire and Beacon. 
As we continue to focus on addressing the social drivers of health, Anthem is introducing new programs and partnerships to positively impact community health. Beginning this year, Beacon is launching an innovative program designed to address the basic needs of an employer's workforce through on-site resource coordinators focused on things like housing, food, transportation and other core resources. Through this program, Beacon will help employers identify and remove obstacles to creating a safer and more productive work environment for their employees. The need for this type of solution will only increase as employers transition their workforce back into the workplace. And we look forward to scaling this offering across our markets in the future after going live with a major national retailer in the second quarter. 
As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we stand ready to adapt and carry forward our momentum. Anthem's benefit business is among the most balanced and resilient in the sector, and we have ample opportunity to unlock our full potential by scaling best-in-class health care services businesses to serve Anthem's members as well as other health care plans externally. Should the pandemic come to an end sooner and the economy recover faster, our Commercial business will be well positioned to accelerate its growth. Should the pandemic persist, our Medicaid business will likely continue to grow at an accelerated pace. Regardless of the outcome, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to our consumers, care partners and shareholders. 
I'll now turn the floor over to John to discuss our financial performance in more detail. John?"

As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01, growth of over 8% year-over-year. Our firs",1098,"Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01, growth of over 8% year-over-year. Our first quarter results reflect the execution of our enterprise strategy while continuing to navigate through the pandemic. We ended the quarter with medical membership totaling 43.5 million members, an increase of 1.4 million lives or 3.3% year-over-year despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our risk-based membership grew by 1.8 million members over the prior year quarter, driven primarily by organic growth in Medicaid, aided by the suspension of reverifications. 
In addition, our Medicare Advantage membership grew by 197,000 lives or 15% year-over-year, in line with our expectations and on track to achieve low double-digit growth for the full year. This growth was partially offset by negative in-group change within our commercial fee-based business, which was to be expected given the economic challenges presented by the pandemic. 
From a membership reporting perspective, please note that we have changed our presentation to delineate commercial risk-based and fee-based membership and included a table looking back to the first quarter of 2020 in our press release for modeling purposes. 
Our overall growth in membership, despite challenging economic backdrop, reflects the resilience and value of our core benefits businesses as our significant presence in both commercial and Medicaid continue to complement one another well. 
First quarter operating revenue of $32.1 billion increased 9% over the prior year quarter or approximately 11% when excluding the impact of the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare and growth in our pharmacy product revenue. 
The medical loss ratio for the first quarter was 85.6%, an increase of 140 basis points over the first quarter of 2020, driven by costs associated with COVID-19 and including testing and vaccine administration costs and to a lesser extent, the permanent repeal of the HIF. Adjusted for the HIF, our first quarter MOR would have decreased by 10 basis points. 
Relative to our expectations, the cost of COVID-related care developed favorably, driven by an earlier and sharper decline in COVID hospitalizations than we had anticipated. This was partially offset by a faster recovery in non-COVID cost, in part due to the accelerated rollout of the vaccine as well as the impact of an extra calendar day in the first quarter of 2020. Medical claims payable for 2020 dates of service or prior year reserve development also developed better than our expectations, but were entirely offset by reserve reestablishment. 
Our first quarter SG&A expense ratio came in at 12.2%, a decrease of 60 basis points relative to the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the effects of the HIF, our SG&A ratio would have increased by 60 basis points, driven by increased spending to support growth, including our ongoing efforts to become a digital-first enterprise, partially offset by the leverage against the growth in our operating revenue. 
The investments we are making today will be key to achieving greater operating efficiency over the long term and will enable us to achieve our 11% to 12% SG&A ratio target by 2025. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 41.6%, up from 38.7% at year-end 2020. The increase was due to debt raised in the quarter to fund our pending acquisitions and refinance an upcoming maturity. We continue to expect a debt-to-cap ratio to be slightly below 40% by the end of the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $316.06 for approximately $447 million, representing slightly more than 25% of our full year guidance. At this point, we continue to believe that our initial guidance of $1.6 billion in share repurchase remains appropriate for the full year. 
We maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves in light of the pandemic and its associated uncertainties. And as a result, days in claims payable increased by 3.5 days sequentially, ending the first quarter at 46.9 days, which is up 5 days year-over-year. Medical claims payable increased nearly 25% year-over-year compared with premium growth of approximately 9%. 
Finally, our operating cash flow during the first quarter was $2.5 billion or 1.5x net income, better than expected and yet another indication of our strong quality of earnings. Note that operating cash flow as a percentage of net income will drop later in the year as we make payments on the multi-district litigation settlement and satisfy certain MLR collar payments. 
Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. And as a result, we have raised our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share by $0.60 from greater than $24.50 to greater than $25.10. The raise in our guidance reflects both the upside from strong core performance in the first quarter and the approximate $0.30 benefit associated with the extension of the sequestration holiday through the end of the year, partially offset by higher vaccine administration costs and the ongoing uncertainty around the pandemic. 
Our full year outlook continues to embed net costs associated with COVID in the order of $600 million. Despite this headwind, we are pleased to be on track to deliver growth in adjusted earnings per share inside our long-term annual target range of 12% to 15%. While our core businesses performed well during the quarter, we remain cognizant of the risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic, notably the potential for a prolonged fourth wave, new COVID variants, pent-up demand for health care services and the potential for higher acuity episodes of care associated with the deferral of procedures throughout the pandemic. Our updated guidance contemplates all of these factors, and we are pleased to pass through much of the upside in the first quarter despite a cautious but prudent approach the forecasting the balance of this year. With much of our guidance raise reflecting the first quarter outperformance, we now expect between 52% and 54% of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to occur in the first half of the year. Given a faster rollout of the vaccine, we expect non-COVID utilization to rebound sooner, and we now expect to absorb higher COVID vaccination administration costs during the second quarter. As a result, we are currently modeling our second quarter MLR to be near the midpoint of our full year outlook of 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions."

I'm sure you know that as reserves are released, some of the items impact MLR rebates and collars, risk corridor calculations and refunding mechanisms with some of our contractual provisions. But most importantly, we believe that we have reestablished the reserves due to the uncertainty associated with COVID.

Thanks for that question. In terms of the exchanges, we are pleased about the extended open enrollment and feel that while we're in the midst of it now, we feel that there will be some solid membership growth in the individual exchanges. 
In addition, though, to your second part of the question, how does that affect reverification. I think at this stage, it's very hard for us to see our assumption as that reverification remains on hold through all of 2021. We do have a balanced portfolio. We've shared that a number of times, and the mix serves as a natural hedge for us. But as we look at the growth inside of our Medicaid business, we've not really seen a significant amount of individuals coming from the commercial market into Medicaid at this stage. Some of that just may still be the timing and people are still on their employer plans, et cetera. But at this stage, we haven't seen a significant growth in Medicaid. It's been predominantly through reverifications. 
The other thing I just want to note is that we don't really see a cliff event in 2022 as we work with our states even as reverification will go away in 2022. We see that as much more of a gradual approach as our states think about continuing to keep people on the Medicaid roles. So thanks very much for the question, and we'll go to the next question."

I think that there's a lot in there and not just specifically to your question on hospitals. First and foremost, our focus is on really implementing value-based care and ensuring that our care providers really are in the driver's seat of right place, appropriate place of service, et cetera. 
As I think about your specific question, however, we are looking to work with our hospital providers as well as our outpatient facilities to ensure that patients are in the right place of care with what's happened in the pandemic. Clearly, our patients were more concerned about being in the hospital settings. That allowed us to enable that we supported outpatient care in outpatient settings more specifically. And so we have implemented those policies. We had them in place before. So this isn't new, but I think it's accelerated with the pandemic as patients have become much more comfortable in those settings as well as the access has been greater for individuals. 
So in terms of the overall model, our focus again is on affordability, trying to drive affordability, make sure that it's appropriate care at the right place and right setting that's been specific, and it ties very much to our value-based model where we work closely with our local physicians. So it's not just Anthem doing this through UM programs. It's really part of embedded in our value-based programs with physicians. So thank you very much for the question."

As I shared in my opening remarks, we launched the high-performance network in conjunction with other Blues. And just to give a little bit of background on how it works. It really launched just beginning in January of 2021. So it's a fairly new offering across the system. And it's available right now in 55 MSAs. So most of those, about half of those, roughly half are in Anthem service areas right now. But we comprise about 56% of the U.S. population. And it's something we're going to continue to grow every year. So I think that's important. 
The cost savings are significant. I gave you a range of savings anywhere from around 11% to up to 20%. Our goal in this, I guess, strategy -- network strategy is focused on leveraging already deep provider relationships and to scale and simplify it and also focus on the high-performing providers that we know based on our deep data across the country. So what we're seeing, in our first offering, we had a number of customers select us. Over 350,000, I think, total members had access to it. And our first entry, again, is about 10% to 15% of those who have access to it are picking the high-performance network. We expect that to grow. Again, this is a new offering in January. But it's flexible enough to allow our local markets in partnership with other Blues to continue to build and develop that.

I want to start with your sort of underlying question, which is investments in the care delivery system. As you know, our strategy, first and foremost, is to partner with primary care physicians in our local markets, and I've shared that on a number of times on these calls. 
Part of that, again, is 1 in 8 patients already carrying Anthem [ idea ]. We feel that, that model really enables us to work closely with them and that we can drive differentiated managed care performance by using the data, and we've been investing in AI and virtual care to ensure that we can make -- help them make better decisions. 
With that said, though, I think what's under, I think, valued and under understood, not understood well in terms of our investments that we are participating in the value created through our value-based relationships, so where we can keep our members healthier. And I think specific examples of where we participate in that value creation and invest is our examples of CareMore and HealthSun and recently, our announced acquisition of MMM. 
And another area that where we've deployed capital, which I shared areas that enable and create new payment models, and those are the ones that can address the more complex conditions. And again, examples there would be myNEXUS, Aspire and Beacon, where we're leveraging that, first and foremost, across our Anthem membership to create value, both for DBG as well as Anthem and driving down overall cost of care, but also to sell externally. So it's a bit of a double strategy there, and I think helps support how we're using our capital to drive better returns, both for our customers as well as Anthem internally. 
And then we shared at Investor Day a number of investments that we're making in digital to create the health care platform. Some of those are around consumer tools. Sydney, we've continued to advance where we are with Sydney Care. We're also investing in our Health OS model. All of that's wrapped around artificial intelligence to really drive much better decision-making. 
And the last area that I just want to share is we recently announced a collaboration that's part of our broader innovation collaboration that allows us to partner with stakeholders across the health system called Hydrogen. Our goal there is to really support virtual care, driving down costs and trend towards CPI, which we've shared, giving consumers access to basic health care needs. And this is again another -- a virtual care opportunity, whether it's via video phone, text or chat, looking for efficiency and quality. The partnerships with K Health, it enables us to provide access to virtual care. So that's an example of innovation where we're investing as part of the overall health care ecosystem. 
So again, a lot of examples there, trying to give you a sense of both from how we're investing in the health care delivery system and participating in the value that we create there as well as in our virtual tools. So thanks very much for that question. Hopefully, we got to all the components of it."

In terms of the claims versus the visibility, we obviously track that very, very closely. We're evaluating pre-serve, preauthorization information on a daily basis. Certainly understand that we're looking at the types of care that are deferred versus those that are not deferred and trying to assess that associated with the core underlying businesses. 
It's still a bit too early to have a noticeable shift in non-COVID utilization. As I said, we continue to closely monitor our markets as vaccination rates increase. 
And in terms of geographic, there's probably not a big disparity at this point associated with lines of business. The senior population has been vaccinated sooner. And so we are seeing a significant decline in COVID inpatient associated with seniors, which means that the non-COVID can rebound a bit faster. We believe that we've totally factored that in. 
People were still able to largely get care in 2020 after the stay-at-home mandates were eased. So the giant backlog, we don't think is quite there the same way. And there are natural systems capacities as well. 
And maybe just to focus on your reserves question at the end, we believe our reserves are very prudently stated and that they are associated with a lot of the unknowns and uncertainties associated with COVID as opposed to the other part of your question. So thank you for that. And hopefully, that addresses all of your questions."

On Medicare, maybe just to be very forthright about the Medicare business, finished the first quarter slightly below our target margin ranges, but largely for all the reasons that we've already identified. The elevated COVID cost, mostly in January, impacted the senior population. The reduction of the risk revenue did suppress 2020 utilization, which we've talked about in the last call is certainly impacting. And as you know, we have the continued payment of the 20% DRG bump and the 3.75% Medicare fee schedule increases impacting that line of business. But those COVID factors are all transient.

One of the things I think that's important to keep in mind that our first quarter 2020 results were somewhat elevated or artificially elevated because we relaxed the refill too soon provision as part of the pandemic.

We're focused on improving the way we do business with our distribution partners. We have a new broker portal that offers distribution partners a simplified digital platform to enable them to sell seamlessly. And we're standardizing our clinical and well-being solutions and preset packages, make it easier for our employers to understand and purchase a suite of products most relevant to new needs. 
So I give those examples just to show you that our digital capabilities and digital investments are impacting every aspect of the company in every aspect of the business. And that's with also doing all our system consolidation work that we've been focused on here for the last several years. 
In terms of the spending, obviously, we did accelerate some spending here in the first quarter, but we will be spending on this throughout the year. The SG&A ratio will go down a little bit in the latter half of the year as our revenue accelerates, specifically when we go live with North Carolina Medicaid with some of the continued growth that we expect in core Medicaid with the special enrollment for ACA, all businesses that will drive the top line accordingly.

It's really creating this digital-first experience where access to basic care needs can occur via, as Gail said earlier, text, chat and videos with a physician.

Plus, we're also investing heavily in virtual care. So again, that goes back to my earlier comments around us participating in the value creation of that, all surrounded by the use of the data that we've had locked for a long time, so ability to be predictive with AI. So I'm excited about the business transformation that digital drives across all of our businesses, and I think that's really the core. 
To put a sort of a final point on how we think about the investments, as John said, our goal is, again, this is to drive growth in our business. And we are committed to the -- this is our way to get to the long-term 11% to 12% administrative expense ratio that, again, we shared at Investor Day.

Because you guys beat and then you raised by the beat, but then it seemed like half of the raise was due to sequestration. You didn't change your view on the COVID headwind, so that doesn't seem to be an offset to the numbers. And then you said that the core business was performing better than expected. So just trying to reconcile all of that. I guess maybe could you just elaborate a little bit more when you say the core business came in better than expected driving the raise. What exactly is coming in better than expected? And if it's coming in better than expected, why isn't that leading to a larger raise through the rest of the year?"

First quarter results of $7.01 were about $0.60 out of the consensus estimates. And as you pointed out, the sequestration extension adds another $0.30 of upside. And then with all that, we also have the fourth wave of COVID has been more prolonged than anticipated. And also just a month or so ago, we found that we were required to increase the vaccine administration rates from $28 a dose to $48 a dose. All in with the -- with that core performance, we feel very comfortable delivering the upside back to the shareholders and raising guidance up to $25.10. 
In terms of core performance, core performance is a lot of things. It's a growth. We've seen great core performance and better-than-expected in Commercial, in Medicaid, in Ingenio, in Diversified Business Group all doing very, very well. And we've seen growth in all those areas. The medical cost, as we look at the costs that have been incurred plus the expectation of pent-up demand, we feel good about that in the SG&A efficiencies on a run rate basis after we pull out some of the investment spending. So we're really very bullish about how well positioned we are and what the future holds. So we've raised guidance accordingly. But thank you for the question."

Let me clarify a little bit about what the innovative model that we're building. One of the things that we've learned, both with our own employees, quite frankly, and the work that we've done in the community, is that the social drivers obviously have a huge impact on people's health. And that has always been embedded in the core of Anthem strategy. The specific program that Beacon is working on is with a large national employer basically who is a retailer to help support all of those efforts within their own employee population. That's, I think, an innovative product offering. I would think of it that way as a way to connect all of these issues that affect employees. We've had them at Anthem. We actually built into our own employee benefit program this year with something we call a health essentials program to help support people. And what we learned during the pandemic is that the needs, particularly the behavioral health needs, the needs of social services, access with caregivers, all of those things really weigh heavily on employers and impact their productivity and their ability to, quite frankly, come to work and be their full self, especially in an environment like this. So we saw that need, built this innovative product. It does include on-site resource coordinators to help with housing, food and transportation. This is a product we think, again, very innovative. No one else has it in the market that we believe will resonate very much with our -- particularly our large national accounts. It's something we've done in our government programs. I think what's not well understood for a lot of individuals is that the issues that affect that we put in -- the programs that we put into place in our government programs affect individuals consumers in our commercial markets as well. And so we're taking what we've learned from those markets and hope to scale it across all of our markets. 
So again, a great question. We think it's a really innovative approach. And we think it's a great opportunity to offer a different solution for employers as they bring their employees back into the physical workplace. So thanks very much for the question."

I think myNEXUS is really a great example of a fit within Anthem and our strategy that we shared with you at Investor Day around managing integrated and multi care services. And again, our strategy has always been around whole person care providing that expertise. And this one, myNEXUS, in particular, offers an extensive network of home providers, including 9 of the 10 top national providers and high quality. So again, those are really important components of it. As we look at the in-home visitation authorization and time to care all those things, what was great about myNEXUS is that we had worked with them extensively, and we saw the value. So this is a great example of driving value inside of our own population. 
Today, it is predominantly Medicare Advantage members. But we do see opportunities to obviously offer this to other health plans because we think it's a highly valued service. And I'll ask Felicia maybe to comment on the opportunities that are across our broader book of business because, again, we do think that the model works quite well, and we've seen nice returns.

This morning, we reported first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01, reflecting growing momentum in our business despite the challenges of the environment. When we came together for this call a year ago, we're only just beginning to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications for health care. Over these last 12 months, I'm incredibly proud of how we've led during a period characterized by uncertainty. From day 1, we partnered with local, state and federal officials to ensure our members were prepared with the resources and support they need to navigate through the pandemic.  
In 2020, our associates logged more than 110,000 volunteer hours and more than 17,000 hours so far in 2021, addressing critical issues in their local communities such as food and security and social isolation. Our efforts have recently shifted from a focus on treatment and testing to vaccinations. We recognize that we play a critical role in the fight against the pandemic and in ensuring safe and equitable access to vaccines in our communities.  
Through our multichannel approach, we've been able to reach nearly 2/3 of our members with information regarding where, when and how they can access COVID-19 vaccines in their own communities, including coordinating in-home vaccinations for our homebound members, while covering vaccine administration costs for our commercial members with no out-of-pocket cost sharing. In addition, clinicians at our CareMore and HealthSun clinics have helped thousands of our most vulnerable seniors get vaccinated. I'm incredibly grateful to our associates who have adapted seamlessly and worked diligently through the pandemic to support our consumers.  
Our focus on health starts with our own associates, and we're committed to empowering them to live a healthy lifestyle. For those who received the vaccine, we're offering a choice of a onetime credit towards their own health care premiums or a donation on their behalf to the Anthem Cares Fund, which provides financial support to Anthem associates in need.  
As a company that has been grounded in our local communities for more than 75 years, we have an unwavering commitment to positively influence not only the health of our consumers but the health of the communities in which we live and work.  
Membership growth in the first quarter clearly reflects the balance and resilience of our core business, with strong growth in our Government Business led by Medicaid. With eligibility reverifications on hold across the country, our organic growth remains robust. Medicare Advantage membership also tracked in line with our expectations, growing 15% year-over-year through the first quarter. We're honored to have been selected to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in Ohio, a state where Anthem currently holds the leading Commercial and Medicare Advantage market share positions. With the launch of this contract, Anthem will serve consumers across all products in the state of Ohio, further underscoring our ability to be a lifetime trusted health partner.  
Commercial enrollment grew sequentially to start the year, outperforming expectations, with growth led by our risk-based business. As expected, Commercial membership decreased slightly year-over-year driven by in-group attrition in our group fee-based business. In spite of many national account prospects electing to delay decisions until 2022, we had one of our strongest selling seasons in the past 5 years. Sales exceeded lapses in our large group fully insured business for the sixth consecutive quarter and for 10 of the past 11. Our success speaks to the strength of our sales team, the value of our innovative solutions and our commitment to being a valued partner to our customers.  
Given our solid overall performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to greater than $25.10 from greater than $24.50, putting us on track to achieve our long-term 12% to 15% annual adjusted EPS growth target, even as we continue to dedicate resources to combating the pandemic.  
Looking ahead, our digital solutions will continue to drive growth. And we are fundamentally changing how we leverage technology to deliver the exceptional experiences that consumers expect from us and to help address health disparities and improve outcomes by sharing insight with care providers. We now have close to 10 million people engaged on our digital channels, with access to a wide array of virtual care specialties and resources to help them lead healthy lives.  
One of our digital solutions, Anthem's Concierge Care program, aims to solve distinct problems for our customers. Our suite of programs universally offer seamless experience for members facing chronic or complex conditions, connecting them with their entire care team on a single centralized platform and allowing them to seek support in real time when it's right for them.  
Today, our Concierge Care programs are available to just under 1 million members, with line of sight into tripling enrollment over the next few years. This program integrates remote patient monitoring that shares real-time data with care providers at all times.  
We have also partnered with connected device manufacturers to leverage their capabilities to expand remote care options that allow patients and their clinicians to conduct virtual office visits, culminating personalized experiences for our members, better outcomes and improved affordability. Our deep roots in our communities and our partnership with local care providers enable us to scale these initiatives in real time, with a focus on collaborating across the continuum of care, while ensuring our care provider partners have access to best-in-class digital tools and capabilities to help them deliver better outcomes.  
Predictive AI and real-time access to data, coupled with a growing focus on value-based arrangements with care providers, is enabling us to improve access to high-quality, affordable health care and facilitate better consumer and physician decision-making. The integration of these capabilities is what will enable us to deliver on our commitment to drive commercial medical cost trend down towards CPI by 2025, a goal we shared with you at our Investor Day last month.  
Earlier this year, we launched the nation's largest high-performance network in partnership with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. The Blue High Performance Network is guiding members towards providers who are aligned with our goal of driving greater affordability and improved outcomes. The benefits are compelling with average savings of 11% and up to 20% in certain markets. Through AI and machine learning, we're also providing members with access to personalized health information to help them make informed health care decisions. When searching for providers, most digital tools automatically default to recommending providers based solely on location. Anthem's smart provider finder on our Sydney Health app gives consumers greater control of their care by taking into account the factors that matter most such as condition-specific needs, affordability and quality. We're intensely focused on enhancing our capabilities aimed at addressing the needs of people with chronic and complex conditions.  
Our pending acquisition of myNEXUS combines the power of digital and advanced analytics to expertly manage and coordinate home-based health care. Anthem has been a customer of myNEXUS since 2017, with more than 830,000 of our individual and group retiree Medicare Advantage members currently managed by myNEXUS. We have seen firsthand the positive contributions myNEXUS has had on our members' quality of life, and we look forward to expanding this impact across even more of our members. Equally important, this acquisition provides Anthem with another pathway to managing a greater portion of the overall health care dollar, a key strategic pillar of our Diversified Business Group that will allow us to create end-to-end seamless experiences from post-acute care to home health with pathways to services like AIM, Aspire and Beacon.  
As we continue to focus on addressing the social drivers of health, Anthem is introducing new programs and partnerships to positively impact community health. Beginning this year, Beacon is launching an innovative program designed to address the basic needs of an employer's workforce through on-site resource coordinators focused on things like housing, food, transportation and other core resources. Through this program, Beacon will help employers identify and remove obstacles to creating a safer and more productive work environment for their employees. The need for this type of solution will only increase as employers transition their workforce back into the workplace. And we look forward to scaling this offering across our markets in the future after going live with a major national retailer in the second quarter.  
As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we stand ready to adapt and carry forward our momentum. Anthem's benefit business is among the most balanced and resilient in the sector, and we have ample opportunity to unlock our full potential by scaling best-in-class health care services businesses to serve Anthem's members as well as other health care plans externally. Should the pandemic come to an end sooner and the economy recover faster, our Commercial business will be well positioned to accelerate its growth. Should the pandemic persist, our Medicaid business will likely continue to grow at an accelerated pace. Regardless of the outcome, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to our consumers, care partners and shareholders.  
I'll now turn the floor over to John to discuss our financial performance in more detail. John?"

As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01, growth of over 8% year-over-year. Our firs",1098,"Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01, growth of over 8% year-over-year. Our first quarter results reflect the execution of our enterprise strategy while continuing to navigate through the pandemic. We ended the quarter with medical membership totaling 43.5 million members, an increase of 1.4 million lives or 3.3% year-over-year despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our risk-based membership grew by 1.8 million members over the prior year quarter, driven primarily by organic growth in Medicaid, aided by the suspension of reverifications.  
In addition, our Medicare Advantage membership grew by 197,000 lives or 15% year-over-year, in line with our expectations and on track to achieve low double-digit growth for the full year. This growth was partially offset by negative in-group change within our Commercial fee-based business, which was to be expected given the economic challenges presented by the pandemic.  
From a membership reporting perspective, please note that we have changed our presentation to delineate Commercial risk-based and fee-based membership and included a table looking back to the first quarter of 2020 in our press release for modeling purposes. Our overall growth in membership, despite the challenging economic backdrop, reflects the resilience and value of our core benefits businesses as our significant presence in both Commercial and Medicaid continue to complement one another well.  
First quarter operating revenue of $32.1 billion increased 9% over the prior year quarter or approximately 11% when excluding the impact of the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare and growth in our pharmacy product revenue.  
The medical loss ratio for the first quarter was 85.6%, an increase of 140 basis points over the first quarter of 2020, driven by costs associated with COVID-19, including testing and vaccine administration costs and, to a lesser extent, the permanent repeal of the HIF. Adjusted for the HIF, our first quarter MLR would have decreased by 10 basis points.  
Relative to our expectations, the cost of COVID-related care developed favorably, driven by an earlier and sharper decline in COVID hospitalizations than we had anticipated. This was partially offset by a faster recovery in non-COVID cost, in part due to the accelerated rollout of the vaccine as well as the impact of an extra calendar day in the first quarter of 2020. Medical claims payable for 2020 dates of service or prior year reserve development also developed better than our expectations, but were entirely offset by reserve reestablishment.  
Our first quarter SG&A expense ratio came in at 12.2%, a decrease of 60 basis points relative to the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the effects of the HIF, our SG&A ratio would have increased by 60 basis points, driven by increased spending to support growth, including our ongoing efforts to become a digital-first enterprise, partially offset by the leverage against the growth in our operating revenue.  
The investments we are making today will be key to achieving greater operating efficiency over the long term and will enable us to achieve our 11% to 12% SG&A ratio target by 2025.  
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 41.6%, up from 38.7% at year-end 2020. The increase was due to debt raised in the quarter to fund our pending acquisitions and refinance an upcoming maturity. We continue to expect a debt-to-cap ratio to be slightly below 40% by the end of the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $316.06 for approximately $447 million, representing slightly more than 25% of our full year guidance. At this point, we continue to believe that our initial guidance of $1.6 billion in share repurchase remains appropriate for the full year.  
We maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves in light of the pandemic and its associated uncertainties. And as a result, days in claims payable increased by 3.5 days sequentially, ending the first quarter at 46.9 days, which is up 5 days year-over-year. Medical claims payable increased nearly 25% year-over-year compared with premium growth of approximately 9%.  
Finally, our operating cash flow during the first quarter was $2.5 billion or 1.5x net income, better than expected and yet another indication of our strong quality of earnings. Note that operating cash flow as a percentage of net income will drop later in the year as we make payments on the multi-district litigation settlement and satisfy certain MLR collar payments.  
Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. And as a result, we have raised our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share by $0.60, from greater than $24.50 to greater than $25.10. The raise in our guidance reflects both the upside from strong core performance in the first quarter and the approximate $0.30 benefit associated with the extension of the sequestration holiday through the end of the year, partially offset by higher vaccine administration costs and the ongoing uncertainty around the pandemic.  
Our full year outlook continues to embed net costs associated with COVID in the order of $600 million. Despite this headwind, we are pleased to be on track to deliver growth in adjusted earnings per share inside our long-term annual target range of 12% to 15%. While our core businesses performed well during the quarter, we remain cognizant of the risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic, notably the potential for a prolonged fourth wave, new COVID variants, pent-up demand for health care services and the potential for higher acuity episodes of care associated with the deferral of procedures throughout the pandemic. 
Our updated guidance contemplates all of these factors, and we are pleased to pass through much of the upside in the first quarter despite a cautious but prudent approach to forecasting the balance of this year. With much of our guidance raise reflecting the first quarter outperformance, we now expect between 52% and 54% of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to occur in the first half of the year. Given a faster rollout of the vaccine, we expect non-COVID utilization to rebound sooner, and we now expect to absorb higher COVID vaccination administration costs during the second quarter. As a result, we are currently modeling our second quarter MLR to be near the midpoint of our full year outlook of 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points.  
And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions."

I'm sure you know that as reserves are released, some of the items impact MLR rebates and collars, risk corridor calculations and the funding mechanisms with some of our contractual provisions. But most importantly, we believe that we have reestablished the reserves due to the uncertainty associated with COVID.  
And consistent with maybe your question, I will affirm that we believe that there is no net benefit to the first quarter associated with the PYD that was going through the statements this quarter. With that..."

Thanks for that question. In terms of the exchanges, we are pleased about the extended open enrollment and feel that while we're in the midst of it now, we feel that there will be some solid membership growth in the individual exchanges.  
In addition though to your second part of the question, how does that affect reverification? I think at this stage, it's very hard for us to see our assumption as that reverification remains on hold through all of 2021. We do have a balanced portfolio. We've shared that a number of times, and the mix serves as a natural hedge for us. But as we look at the growth inside of our Medicaid business, we've not really seen a significant amount of individuals coming from the commercial market into Medicaid at this stage. Some of that just may still be the timing and people are still on their employer plans, et cetera. But at this stage, we haven't seen a significant growth in Medicaid. It's been predominantly through reverifications.  
The other thing I just want to note is that we don't really see a cliff event in 2022 as we work with our states even as reverification will go away in 2022. We see that as much more of a gradual approach as our states think about continuing to keep people on the Medicaid rules. So thanks very much for the question."

First and foremost, our focus is on really implementing value-based care and ensuring that our care providers really are in the driver's seat of right place, appropriate place of service, et cetera.  
As I think about your specific question, however, we are looking to work with our hospital providers as well as our outpatient facilities to ensure that patients are in the right place of care with what's happened in the pandemic. Clearly, our patients were more concerned about being in the hospital setting. That allowed us to enable that we supported outpatient care and outpatient settings more specifically. And so we have implemented those policies. We had them in place before. So this isn't new, but I think it's accelerated with the pandemic as patients have become much more comfortable in those settings as well as the access has been greater for individuals.  
So in terms of the overall model, our focus again is on affordability, trying to drive affordability, make sure that it's appropriate care at the right place and right setting that's been specific, and it ties very much to our value-based model where we work closely with our local physicians. So it's not just Anthem doing this through UM programs. It's really part of -- embedded in our value-based programs with physicians. So thank you very much for the question."

As I shared in my opening remarks, we launched the high-performance network in conjunction with other Blues. And just to give a little bit of background on how it works. It really launched just beginning in January of 2021. So it's a fairly new offering across the system. And it's available right now in 55 MSAs. So most of those, about half of those, roughly half are in Anthem service areas right now. But we comprise about 56% of the U.S. population. And it's something we're going to continue to grow every year. So I think that's important.  
The cost savings are significant. I gave you a range of savings anywhere from around 11% to up to 20%. Our goal in this, I guess, strategy, network strategy is focused on leveraging already deep provider relationships and to scale and simplify it and also focus on the high-performing providers that we know based on our deep data across the country. So what we're seeing, in our first offering, we had a number of customers select us. Over 350,000, I think, total members had access to it. And our first entry, again, is about 10% to 15% of those who have access to it are picking the high-performance network. We expect that to grow. 
Again, this is a new offering in January. But it's flexible enough to allow our local markets in partnership with other Blues to continue to build and develop that. So again, this is based off of our deep knowledge and deep information that we have around networks and our partnership with other Blues. So thank you very much for the question."

I want to start with your sort of underlying question, which is investments in the care delivery system. As you know, our strategy, first and foremost, is to partner with primary care physicians in our local markets, and I've shared that on a number of times in these calls. 
Part of that, again, is 1 in 8 patients already carrying an Anthem idea. We feel that, that model really enables us to work closely with them and that we can drive differentiated managed care performance by using the data, and we've been investing in AI and virtual care to ensure that we can make -- help them make better decisions. 
With that said though, I think what's under, I think, valued and under-understood, not understood well in terms of our investments that we are participating in the value created through our value-based relationships, so where we can keep our members healthier. And I think specific examples of where we participate in that value creation and invest is our examples of CareMore and HealthSun and recently, our announced acquisition of MMM. 
And another area that where we've deployed capital which I shared, areas that enable and create new payment models, and those are the ones that can address the more complex conditions. And again, examples there would be myNEXUS, Aspire and Beacon, where we're leveraging that, first and foremost, across our Anthem membership to create value, both for DBG as well as Anthem in driving down overall cost of care, but also to sell externally. So it's a bit of a double strategy there, and I think helps support how we're using our capital to drive better returns, both for our customers as well as Anthem internally. 
And then we shared at Investor Day a number of investments that we're making in digital to create the health care platform. Some of those are around consumer tools. Sydney, we've continued to advance where we are with Sydney Care. We're also investing in our HealthOS model. All of that's wrapped around artificial intelligence to really drive much better decision-making. 
And the last area that I just want to share is we recently announced a collaboration that's part of our broader innovation collaboration that allows us to partner with stakeholders across the health system called Hydrogen. Our goal there is to really support virtual care, driving down costs and trend towards CPI, which we've shared, giving consumers access to basic health care needs. And this is again another -- a virtual care opportunity, whether it's via video phone, text or chat, looking for efficiency and quality. The partnerships with K Health, it enables us to provide access to virtual care. So that's an example of innovation where we're investing as part of the overall health care ecosystem. 
So again, a lot of examples there, trying to give you a sense of both from how we're investing in the health care delivery system and participating in the value that we create there as well as in our virtual tools. So thanks very much for that question. Hopefully, we got to all the components of it."

Certainly understand that we're looking at the types of care that are deferred versus those that are not deferred and trying to assess that associated with the core underlying businesses. 
It's still a bit too early to have a noticeable shift in non-COVID utilization. As I said, we continue to closely monitor our markets as vaccination rates increase. 
And in terms of geographic, there's probably not a big disparity at this point associated with lines of business. The senior population has been vaccinated sooner. And so we are seeing a significant decline in COVID inpatient associated with seniors, which means that the non-COVID can rebound a bit faster. We believe that we've totally factored that in. 
People were still able to largely get care in 2020 after the stay-at-home mandates were eased. So the giant backlog, we don't think is quite there the same way. And there are natural systems capacities as well.

On Medicare, maybe just to be very forthright about the Medicare business, finished the first quarter slightly below our target margin ranges, but largely for all the reasons that we've already identified. The elevated COVID cost, mostly in January, impacted the senior population. The reduction of the risk revenue did suppress 2020 utilization, which we've talked about in the last call is certainly impacting.

First of all, from an execution perspective, as Gail noted, our sales continue to exceed our lapses. And what was really nice to see this year in the quarter, again, is our fully insured growth. Our local group business grew nicely sequentially. If you were to sort of say what was a bit of a headwind, our growth could have been more, if not for the economic impacts again associated with COVID and the in-group change dynamics that really continue and most specifically affect our fee-based business.

So as you think about that overall, that's -- those are really the key drivers. I think Ingenio has really hit its stride in terms of our business. 
One of the things I think that's important to keep in mind that our first quarter 2020 results were somewhat elevated or artificially elevated because we relaxed the refill too soon provision as part of the pandemic. And the pandemic was intensifying here, as everyone knows. So we -- that resulted in a pull forward of earnings from the second quarter into the first of '20.

We are seeing some of our states like Maine and Connecticut have some of the highest vaccination rates, where Arkansas and Texas appear to be a bit lower. And there's really not a big material difference in utilization levels between those markets. 
I think part of it has to do with the comment that I made earlier in the Q&A session that folks were able to get access to care in 2020 when a lot of the stay-at-home rules were relaxed. So at this point in time, we are taking a very cautious approach, certainly monitoring all of the variables.

I'll start out by answering the beginning of your question, then turn it over to Pete to talk a little bit more about K Health and that aspect of your question. But as you noted, we continue to invest in new digital and mobile capabilities to drive greater automation and enhance our customer experience, really a lot of the consumer-facing tools. 
We're focused on improving the way we do business with our distribution partners. We have a new broker portal that offers distribution partners a simplified digital platform to enable them to sell seamlessly. And we're standardizing our clinical and well-being solutions and the preset packages, make it easier for our employers to understand and purchase a suite of products most relevant to their needs. 
So I give those examples just to show you that our digital capabilities and digital investments are impacting every aspect of the company in every aspect of the business. And that's with also doing all our system consolidation work that we've been focused on here for the last several years. 
In terms of the spending, obviously, we did accelerate some spending here in the first quarter, but we will be spending on this throughout the year. The SG&A ratio will go down a little bit in the latter half of the year as our revenue accelerates, specifically when we go live with North Carolina Medicaid with some of the continued growth that we expect in core Medicaid with the special enrollment for ACA, all businesses that will drive the top line accordingly. But there's still a lot of spending left to be done in order to achieve our goals and expectations.

Specifically, as it relates to this partnership, it builds upon all this. It's helping us offer direct-to-consumer, direct-to-employer and direct-to-insurer product options that really enable Anthem as the front door to health care. It's really creating this digital-first experience where access to basic care needs can occur via, as Gail said earlier, text, chat and videos with a physician. And if more acute care needs or in-person care is needed, it really helps facilitate or triage care to the right care at the right place at the right time. And so yes, this is just another great example of a partnership that helps bring greater efficiency and a better consumer experience to our members."

And I guess I wanted to address that directly because I think that this is really our investments, our long-term investments to drive growth in a business model transformation. And quite frankly, I think we're excited about all of them. But fundamentally, what we shared at Investor Day, the digital platform for health, which is going to transform how we work and what we do, both at the consumer level as well as at the level of our care providers with our HealthOS operating platform. Plus, we're also investing heavily in virtual care. So again, that goes back to my earlier comments around us participating in the value creation of that, all surrounded by the use of the data that we've had locked for a long time, so ability to be predicted with AI. So I'm excited about the business transformation that digital drives across all of our businesses, and I think that's really the core. 
To put a sort of a final point on how we think about the investments, as John said, our goal is, again, this is to drive growth in our business. And we are committed to the -- this is our way to get to the long-term 11% to 12% administrative expense ratio that, again, we shared at Investor Day. 
So thanks again for the question. There's a lot of initiatives embedded inside of that. But I think fundamentally, it's about a business model transformation and a digital platform for health."

And also just a month or so ago, we found out that we're required to increase the vaccine administration rates from $28 a dose to $48 a dose. All in with the -- with that core performance, we feel very comfortable delivering the upside back to the shareholders and raising guidance up to $25.10. 
In terms of core performance, core performance is a lot of things. It's a growth. We've seen great core performance and better than expected in Commercial, in Medicaid, in Ingenio, in Diversified Business Group all doing very, very well. And we've seen growth in all those areas. The medical cost, as we look at the costs that have been incurred plus the expectation of pent-up demand, we feel good about that in the SG&A efficiencies on a run rate basis after we pull out some of the investment spending.

Let me clarify a little bit about what the innovative model that we're building. One of the things that we've learned, both with our own employees, quite frankly, and the work that we've done in the community, is that the social drivers obviously have a huge impact on people's health. And that has always been embedded in the core of Anthem strategy. The specific program that Beacon is working on is with a large national employer basically who is a retailer to help support all of those efforts within their own employee population. That's, I think, an innovative product offering. I would think of it that way as a way to connect all of these issues that affect employees. We've had them at Anthem. 
We actually built into our own employee benefit program this year with something we call a health essentials program to help support people. And what we learned during the pandemic is that the needs, particularly the behavioral health needs; the needs of social services, access with caregivers, all of those things really weigh heavily on employers and impact their productivity and their ability to, quite frankly, come to work and be their full self, especially in an environment like this. So we saw that need, built this innovative product. It does include on-site resource coordinators to help with housing, food and transportation. 
This is a product we think, again, very innovative. No one else has it in the market that we believe will resonate very much with our -- particularly our large national accounts. It's something we've done in our government programs. I think what's not well understood for a lot of individuals is that the issues that affect that we put in -- the programs that we put into place in our government programs affect individuals consumers in our commercial markets as well. And so we're taking what we've learned from those markets and hope to scale it across all of our markets. 
So again, a great question. We think it's a really innovative approach. And we think it's a great opportunity to offer a different solution for employers as they bring their employees back into the physical workplace. So thanks very much for the question."

Duals in our D-SNP population will be continued areas of focus for us as we go forward. So this is an example of an opportunity for us to leverage this internally, but also across the Blue partnerships that we have in government business, in Medicare as well as Medicaid. So thank you very much for that question."

This morning, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, ahead of our expectations despite ongoing uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver on our commitments to our stakeholders while making considerable progress against our long-term strategy to transform our organization from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. This transformation is fueled by the continued expansion of our digital platform, which improves connections across the health care system while leveraging the industry's largest data sets to drive actionable insights in pursuit of better health. 
In the second quarter, Anthem produced strong membership growth, won significant new contracts in our Government business and continue to integrate and expand our digital platform. On the membership front, we ended the second quarter with 44.3 million members, up 1.9 million or 4.4% year-over-year and 820,000 new members since the end of the first quarter, reflecting the strategic acquisition of Puerto Rico's leading Medicare Advantage organization, MMM, as well as strong organic growth in our core benefits businesses. 
MMM is the largest Medicare Advantage plan in Puerto Rico and operates the only 4.5 star rated plan in the territory and is also the second-largest Medicaid health plan. Through its integrated care delivery model, MMM has established a strong track record of delivering quality care for seniors and dual eligibles with complex and chronic needs. 
Medicare Advantage remains a key area of focus for our organization, and we continue to see an immense opportunity to grow and optimize this business. Just last week, we were awarded a major contract to serve the retirees of the City of New York in partnership with Emblem Health in what was one of the largest public procurements for group Medicare in the last decade. This opportunity builds on our more than 50-year relationship serving New York City's workers, retirees and their families and will significantly increase Anthem's group Medicare Advantage business as well as our Medicare Advantage market share in New York. We're honored to have been selected to make a material difference in the lives of New Yorkers who worked hard to serve the city. 
In addition to MMM, we also closed on the acquisition of myNEXUS during the second quarter, advancing our strategy to grow and deepen Anthem's capabilities in Medicare Advantage. myNEXUS is a digitally enabled organization that optimizes home health for more than 2 million Medicare Advantage members across 20 states, including more than 900,000 existing Anthem Medicare Advantage members. myNEXUS improves outcomes by facilitating timely, personalized care for our members in the comfort of their homes, leading to improved continuity of care and reduced hospital admissions, readmissions and ER visits. In addition to supporting future growth in Medicare Advantage, myNEXUS furthers our diversified business group strategy to deliver on its risk contracts through the expansion of home-based care. 
Our Medicaid business is also performing very well and continues to build upon our deep local alliances and investments in population health, digital tools and local solutions to help address the social drivers of health in our communities. We extended our strong RFP track record in the quarter, securing an award to continue serving consumers in the state of Nevada. This follows our recent award in Ohio. These wins build on the momentum we have coming off a fantastic start to the launch of North Carolina, which went live at the beginning of this month. 
Our Healthy Blue plan has already become the largest Medicaid managed care plan by membership in North Carolina and the leading choice for consumers. Of beneficiaries who chose their plan, nearly 50% selected Healthy Blue, underscoring the power of our alliance partnerships and the Blue brand. 
In our Commercial business, together with IngenioRx, we continue to innovate while demonstrating the power of true integration. By deploying machine learning and automation across our comprehensive ecosystem of medical, pharmacy, lab and social drivers of health data, Anthem and IngenioRx are improving outcomes. Across these businesses, we're leveraging our proprietary predictive modeling algorithm to apply rich and analytic solutions that allow us to tailor our integrated medical and pharmacy offerings to each member population. This enables us to deliver the right solutions to improve health based on individualized needs. We extend this customized approach to our Specialty products, which we are increasingly selling in bundles through Anthem's Whole Health Connection, a differentiator in the marketplace. 
This traction gives us confidence in the long-term targets we articulated for our Commercial business at our recent Analyst Day, including narrowing the profit gap between our fee and risk-based Commercial business by serving more of our fee-based members in more ways. The success we are seeing in our core business validates our commitment to continue to invest in building our digital platform for health. The essence of the platform is that what we own matters less than what we can connect, and we are seeing great success in making connections through consumer- and provider-facing tools. While we are still in the early innings, our efforts to simplify the health care experience while creating a more connected and powerful platform are clearly resonating with consumers, providers and employers. 
For example, over 30% of members registered for Sydney Health are actively using the platform. In the second quarter, we continue to expand access to Sydney across multiple Medicaid markets and saw a fivefold increase in engagement compared to our legacy digital tools for Medicaid. In the Commercial markets, 32 national accounts have purchased Sydney Preferred for its superior end-to-end experience and enhance functionality, like our fine care feature, which provides members seeking surgical treatments, a personalized omnichannel experience, including price transparency, tailored physician and facility recommendations and access to telephonic health coaches to guide them through the process. 
Digital is also playing a key role in deepening our value-based care penetration and provider enablement by improving connectivity and realtime access to meaningful actionable data. We continue to invest in building enhanced data connections to enable deeper collaboration at scale via our HealthOS provider platform. HealthOS connects siloed health data in disparate technologies to drive deeper insights and reduce costs and complexity. More than 100,000 value-based care physicians and 13,000 value-based care coordinators are connected to HealthOS today. This connection allows technology partners and providers to plug into HealthOS and gain data-driven insights as part of their existing workflow. 
In May, we announced a new partnership with Epic that will allow secure bidirectional exchange of health information, paving the way to better leverage data-driven insights into care decisions. Epic is a significant enabler of many of our efforts to improve our HEDIS and STAR scores. We have nearly 150 provider systems on our glide path through the end of 2022 and are in discussions with other health care information companies for similar partnerships. 
All of these efforts align to Anthem's purpose to improve the health of humanity. Our community health strategy supports our purpose by addressing the health-related social needs of our associates, members and communities through data and evidence-based interventions that promote health equity. Our commitment to living this purpose has earned recognition that I'm particularly proud of. For example, Anthem was recently named one of the top 100 U.S. companies supporting healthy communities and families by Just Capital, the leading platform for measuring and improving corporate performance in the stakeholder economy. We are the leader in our industry, ranking #1 among health care providers and #14 overall on the list. In addition, Points of Light, the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service, recently recognized Anthem as 1 of the 50 most community-minded companies in America for 2021. 
As we reflect on our achievements this quarter and our broader mission, we're cognizant that fundamentally improving the health of humanity takes partnerships, align incentives and connections across people, care providers, researchers, data scientists, communities and others dedicated to improving health. Anthem is making these connections through our digital platform for health while following the data and embracing our unique assets to drive positive change in ways that only Anthem can. We have deep local roots in our communities and the industry's largest data sets, both of which position us uniquely well to deliver against our mission. 
I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. John?"
160077,701419954,2348572,"Anthem, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2021",2021-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Elevance Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results that included GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, another strong quarter in which we delivered on ou",1338,"Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results that included GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, another strong quarter in which we delivered on our financial commitments while reinvesting in each of our businesses, all while navigating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
Second quarter results again underscore the balance and resilience of our enterprise. We ended the quarter with 44.3 million members, growth of 1.9 million lives year-over-year or 4.4%, including growth of 820,000 in the second quarter alone. Excluding the acquisition of MMM, we grew organically by 232,000 members in the quarter, driven by growth in our Medicaid and Commercial fully insured businesses partially offset by continued in-group attrition in our large group and national fee-based accounts, in line with our expectations and prior guidance. 
Second quarter operating revenue of $33.3 billion grew 14% over the prior year quarter. On a HIF-adjusted basis, our top line grew nearly 16% with no impact from MMM, which closed at the end of the quarter. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare associated with strong membership growth in addition to rate increases to cover cost inflation. Pharmacy product revenue also contributed to our top line growth as IngenioRx grew affiliated and unaffiliated revenue with a value proposition that continues to resonate in the marketplace. 
The medical loss ratio for the second quarter was 86.8%, an increase of 890 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in non-COVID utilization from depressed levels a year ago and, to a lesser extent, the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Relative to our expectations, total medical costs were favorable, driven by non-COVID costs developing favorably, partially offset by somewhat higher-than-expected cost for COVID-related care. Please note that while total benefit costs were favorable to our expectations, total cost ended the quarter slightly above our estimate of a normalized level. 
Our second quarter SG&A expense ratio came in at 11.5%, a decrease of 240 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the effect of the repeal of the HIF, our SG&A ratio decreased 110 basis points, driven by leverage on strong revenue growth, partially offset by ongoing investments in support of our growth and our evolution to become a digital-first enterprise. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40.9%, down sequentially from 41.6% in the first quarter. The decrease was due to the early repayment of debt at par originally scheduled to mature in August of this year and an increase in equity driven by our strong bottom line performance in the quarter. We continue to expect our debt-to-capital ratio to end the year slightly below 40%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $380.59 for $480 million. We have now repurchased close to 60% of our full year outlook of $1.6 billion, which is still an appropriate figure for modeling purposes. We maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves through the second quarter, ending the period with 48.1 days in claims payable, an increase of 1.2 days compared with the first quarter and 2.1 days year-over-year. MMM and myNEXUS, both of which closed during the quarter, increased our June 30 claims payable balances with minimal impact on the average day of claims, resulting in the DCP calculation increasing by 1.6 days. Excluding these acquisitions, days in claims payable was largely consistent with the last quarter, decreasing by just 0.4 days. 
Given the continued uncertainty associated with COVID, we continue to take a prudent posture in establishing reserves. And as a result, our second quarter earnings did not benefit from the favorable prior-period development. Operating cash flow was $1.7 billion or 0.9x net income in the second quarter. The year-on-year decline was driven by the deferral of normal tax payments out of the second quarter of last year into the back half as was permitted by the IRS. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow was $4.2 billion or 1.2x net income. Given our solid performance in the first half, we are increasing our guidance for full year operating cash flow to greater than $5.8 billion. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is depressed this year due to the timing of certain payments as well as the settlement of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield multi-district litigation scheduled for the fourth quarter. 
Turning to our earnings outlook for the year. We are raising our guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.50 from the greater than $25.10, which squarely puts us at the midpoint of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%. There are a number of moving pieces associated with our revised guidance, which includes a portion of the upside we generated in the second quarter. The underlying fundamentals of our core business remains strong, evidenced by our first half results. 
Given strong year-to-date performance on medical costs, we now expect our full year medical loss ratio to end in the lower half of our full year guidance of 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Given accelerated reinvestment in our business in the first half of the year and start-up costs for new contracts in the back half, we now expect full year SG&A ratio to end the year in the upper half of our prior guidance range of 10.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
We have also increased our outlook for investment income for the year given strong performance in our alternative investment portfolio in the first 2 quarters, which we have not carried forward in our guidance. The outperformance in this nonoperating line item is more than entirely offset by a higher effective tax rate in our full year guidance. In the context of our upwardly revised guidance, we now expect to absorb earnings dilution in the second half associated with the start-up cost for the award of the City of New York Group Medicare Advantage contract and our entry into the Ohio Medicaid program, both of which will go live in 2022. We have also taken a slightly more cautious view of the back half of the year in light of new COVID variants coupled with a slowing vaccination rate, a combination that could result in the potential for higher COVID-related costs. Our guidance also includes a partial year of MMM and myNEXUS, both of which are expected to contribute much more meaningfully to our financial results in 2022 and beyond. 
As noted in our press release, we now expect to generate approximately $137 billion of operating revenue in 2021 and to end the year with 44.8 million to 45.3 million members. Finally, while it is premature to comment quantitatively on 2022, we want to remind you that group Medicare Advantage contracts and large Medicaid wins are generally dilutive in the first full year of operations. We have a strong line of sight towards a compelling ROI on our recent new business wins. And over the 7-year term of our new group Medicare Advantage contract with the City of New York, our expected returns are well in excess of our cost of capital. Additionally, with these 2 wins, our percent of membership and revenues from our Government business division will become an even larger percentage of our totals. 
In closing, we were pleased to deliver another quarter of solid growth while reinvesting in our enterprise. We continue to grow inward in our services businesses and outward in all of our segments, each of which remains well positioned for growth. Our mix continues to evolve towards our strategic areas of focus: Medicare Advantage in the Government business, in addition to our service segments. We have entered the second half with strong underlying fundamentals, solid momentum and a prudently positioned balance sheet. 
And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions."

So in terms of the utilization of the second quarter, the overall utilization was slightly above normalized levels, but slightly less than our expectation. So in total for the company, we exceeded baseline, albeit that we were better than what we had projected. When you really think about it on a line of business by line of business basis, Medicaid had the highest level of deferred utilization. And then certainly, they had some COVID costs, and so Medicaid was below baseline. 
Commercial was slightly above baseline all-in. And Medicare Advantage was actually slightly above baseline all-in once you take into account all the other issues associated with the the risk score revenues and the additional payments that we're still making on the 3.75% rate increases that existed. So all very much consistent with what we thought 90 days ago, just a little bit better. 
And as you look at July, we really don't provide mid-quarter guidance per se, but we're obviously monitoring our preop and precertification data.

I'll start first on the City of New York and then ask Felicia to share some of her insights on the Medicaid business in particular. Thanks again for the question because, first, we're really honored to have been awarded the contract with the City of New York and continue serving these members in the state as we execute on our strategy. This is really, I think, a great proof point for Anthem that we shared with everyone at our Investor Day about our goal to get deeper in each of the sites we serve. This contract gives us that opportunity in a very important state. And it also, I think, is a proof point for our goal to convert our existing clients to group Medicare Advantage. So 2, 2 really strong, I think, proof points for the strategy that we've been talking about over the last several years. 
I think a little bit of background would be helpful on the City of New York. We have served them for more than 50 years. And we've actually been their medical management vendor over the past 5 years. So if you think about that, it's really given us a really good, strong understanding of the members and their health needs. So it was really, for us, a great opportunity to provide them sort of the strategic offering in group MA. 
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that generally, these contracts are dilutive in the first full year of operations. The back half of the year, we're going to incur start-up costs and with no offsetting revenues. So as we get ready to go live in January of '22, and we're absorbing that in the guidance that we've given you. And as we've noted in the past, contracts of the size tend to be dilutive as the members transition to group MA. I think the good news is, obviously, as the medical management vendor, we have some insight into these members, but we also need to collect the data to reflect the member's acuity and risk scores and ramp-up other medical management initiatives, particularly our value-based care provider relationships and obviously, working with our partner, Emblem. 
In terms of overall membership, at this time, it's a little bit early to call, but we believe it will be over 200,000 lives. There's going to be some variability in that because there is a choice and open enrollment to buy up and do different things. But we think, clearly, it will be over the 200,000 lives. And as we think about 2022, the guidance and what that means, we'll share that later in this year. We're a little early and ahead of that. We'll address that at the end of the year. But again, I'll just close on this section that as a 7-year contract, we think that it's really positive for us overall, and it really gives us breadth and depth in the market. And beginning in '23, we expect it to have a positive impact to our earnings and a really strong and compelling ROI. 
So with that, I'm going to ask Felicia to address the second part of your question, I guess, which was about Medicaid and a reverification."

When you take a look at it all in, the increase is certainly predominantly due to the continued suspension of reverifications. And we had a couple of small tuck-in acquisitions in our Florida market as well. As you know, our guidance assumes that reverifications remain on hold through the end of 2021. And with the renewed public health emergency from the Biden administration on yesterday, we still feel very good about that time line.

I think a couple of things there embedded in that. We are, as I shared with you in the opening comments, particularly around our HealthOS platform, we're really building an integrated platform where we can drive data. So I'll address virtual care in a minute, but I think it's all connected. We're starting with really our deep data insights, and we're connecting that with our care provider network, trying to give them the best information across every point in time. And then we're using that to enable our value-based care provider. So I think the core of what we're sharing is that virtual is a component of it, and you saw not only virtual but also at-home care. We believe that our ability to get to the commitment we made at Investor Day around getting our trend to CPI is really about the, I guess, I'd say the combination of all of these things. So starting again with enabling our value-based providers, providing data at real time and connecting that to consumers through our Sydney platform. So we accelerated a lot of those initiatives over the past year, particularly in the second quarter. You heard the proof point that we just shared about our Medicaid because we think there's opportunities there as well to accelerate the engagement of our consumers. But fundamentally, this is really about getting our value-based payment and our providers enabled with the data so that they can make the right decisions, take greater risk. And we do see that as a critical element of getting to CPI, trend at CPI over the next several years. So I think they all come together. And again, virtual care is just part of, I think, the continuum of care, including at-home care that we're offering our providers as part of the mix of how they best serve patients where they need to be at the right time. So thanks for the question. I think it's a core element of our strategy. But it's quite comprehensive. It's not only about the digital platform. It's really about value-based care. It's about connecting of care providers with consumers and then enabling the providers to actually get more involved and take more risk along the way and feel confident that they can manage those patients. So thanks again."

As you saw in the print, we have good year-to-date growth over 100,000 members year-to-date. Our sales again exceeded our lapses in our local market business. Really strong performance on the fully insured side, where we saw sequential growth in the individual small and local large group business. So that was very good in terms of what we can control and execute against. 
As it relates to your question on the economy, yes, I mean, that's where we continue to see a headwind, on our fee-based business and in group changes that continue to put some pressure on us. We are beginning to see things open up a bit. The pipe had been light in the fee-based business over the last year. But we are beginning to see that pipe open up as it relates to Q3 and Q4 and then headed into 2022. We have some good visibility as it relates to 2022 on the national side of our business. So we are feeling good about where that stands right now in terms of the growth headed into 2022. It's still a little bit early. We're sort of at the middle to the end of that selling season. But I do feel strongly that based upon the execution of our team, the tools and capabilities we're using, our engagement with the broker community, our focus on affordability that as the economy continues to improve, you will begin to see that membership come back in the back half of the year into 2022."

Really a ton of uncertainty associated with this environment. And we have to record reserves consistent with the actuarial standards, and we need to ensure that our methodologies and calculations are very consistent and as I said, that they meet generally accepted accounting principles. Having said that, there's a lot of uncertainties and a lot of unknowns that have existed each and every quarter, each and every month during this entire pandemic. And so we've tried to be extremely prudent and conservative in our approach. And I would expect to have that to continue until there's a little bit more line of sight into the future. I would say that over time, and over time is a long period of time, it could be a few years. But over time, I would expect our DCPs to go back down. 
Now there's a lot of other things that impact our days in claims payable as well. We've talked a lot about our investment in digital. But that investment in digital also includes better auto adjudication rates, cleaner claim submissions from providers to us. And as that is done better and better and faster and faster, that automatically would reduce the days in claims payable without impacting the income statement by $0.01. It would just be better throughput. And actually, the improvement would be our administrative cost structure could go down simultaneously. So there's a lot of variables with DCP. And I would really carry out every one to say do not just look at a number and then think that there's a P&L impact because you also have rate collars and corridors that impact it, et cetera, et cetera.

So in the second quarter, we saw that the inpatient was still below baseline. ER utilization is still short of baseline. However, doctors' visits and outpatient were a bit above. And part of that was at our encouragement. We're trying to encourage our members to seek health care when they need it, do checkups their and their annual visits and various things like that. And as you know, more often that the senior is going to see the docs, the better opportunity there is for us to collect data and information on them to help maximize the risk score revenues. So part of our strategy was consistent with that to ensure that our members actually sought and got the care they needed, and we're seeing that. So yes, we did see outpatient and doctors visits above baseline for the quarter. And we're actually pretty happy about that because we think that's a good thing in the long term. So hopefully, that helps."

And we are selling that value proposition into the marketplace. We're beginning to see that really resonate. As I alluded to before in talking about our national business, which, again, we're about in the seventh inning of that selling season, those are the themes that we're selling through, and we're really seeing it resonate. We're seeing new account wins come through. And then importantly and what I'm really encouraged by is our existing employer accounts are also growing and for the reasons that we stated that we were really being sensitized to these issues around COVID and need for advocacy, affordability and focus on issues like behavioral health. In addition to that, you had mentioned digital and some of the things that we previously talked about that and the digitization of our business. And yes, that is also a focus. Again, going back to what Gail said earlier, about really leveraging digital in a much greater way, both as it relates to navigating our product portfolio, but then importantly, as it relates to our members and our providers and having data in the hands of providers at the point of care is really an important point that is also resonating and something that we're trying to sell to."

So everything that you mentioned, whether or not -- what are vaccination rates looking like, the population in terms of who's receiving vaccine, the upticks in potential variants, non-COVID electives, core utilization, et cetera, all that is being taken into consideration. If you look at some of our public filings, like in the individual business, you will see that we are pricing in for these COVID impacts.

So you think about 2 million lives served, 900,000 inside of Anthem, we've deployed it pretty extensively, but there is more opportunity. We're working through our integration plans. Clearly, as we grow and some of the new opportunities, we see this as a critical opportunity for us to get care in the home and also have a digital integration. So I think that's really important. But also it's part of our diversified business group strategy to sell to others, our Blue strategy and other clients that we work with extensively. So I see it both the opportunity to grow inside of Anthem, and that's something we know them well. We really like the capabilities. Obviously, we use 900,000 -- we have them against 900,000 members. So we see more opportunity there across our businesses, including our duals. And then secondarily, we think there's a really significant opportunity to grow that business outside of Anthem as well. So this one hits kind of both parts of our strategy. 
In terms of our cost of care, going to the home, virtual value-based care, all of those are critical elements of our cost of care strategy.

This morning, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, ahead of our expectations despite ongoing uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver on our commitments to our stakeholders while making considerable progress against our long-term strategy to transform our organization from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. This transformation is fueled by the continued expansion of our digital platform, which improves connections across the health care system while leveraging the industry's largest data sets to drive actionable insights in pursuit of better health. 
In the second quarter, Anthem produced strong membership growth, won significant new contracts in our Government business and continue to integrate and expand our digital platform. On the membership front, we ended the second quarter with 44.3 million members, up 1.9 million or 4.4% year-over-year and 820,000 new members since the end of the first quarter, reflecting the strategic acquisition of Puerto Rico's leading Medicare Advantage organization, MMM, as well as strong organic growth in our core benefits businesses. 
MMM is the largest Medicare Advantage plan in Puerto Rico and operates the only 4.5 star rated plan in the territory and is also the second-largest Medicaid health plan. Through its integrated care delivery model, MMM has established a strong track record of delivering quality care for seniors and dual eligibles with complex and chronic needs. 
Medicare Advantage remains a key area of focus for our organization, and we continue to see an immense opportunity to grow and optimize this business. Just last week, we were awarded a major contract to serve the retirees of the City of New York in partnership with Emblem Health in what was one of the largest public procurements for group Medicare in the last decade. This opportunity builds on our more than 50-year relationship serving New York City's workers, retirees and their families and will significantly increase Anthem's group Medicare Advantage business as well as our Medicare Advantage market share in New York. We're honored to have been selected to make a material difference in the lives of New Yorkers who worked hard to serve the city. 
In addition to MMM, we also closed on the acquisition of myNEXUS during the second quarter, advancing our strategy to grow and deepen Anthem's capabilities in Medicare Advantage. myNEXUS is a digitally enabled organization that optimizes home health for more than 2 million Medicare Advantage members across 20 states, including more than 900,000 existing Anthem Medicare Advantage members. myNEXUS improves outcomes by facilitating timely, personalized care for our members in the comfort of their homes, leading to improved continuity of care and reduced hospital admissions, readmissions and ER visits. In addition to supporting future growth in Medicare Advantage, myNEXUS furthers our diversified business group strategy to deliver on its risk contracts through the expansion of home-based care. 
Our Medicaid business is also performing very well and continues to build upon our deep local alliances and investments in population health, digital tools and local solutions to help address the social drivers of health in our communities. We extended our strong RFP track record in the quarter, securing an award to continue serving consumers in the state of Nevada. This follows our recent award in Ohio. These wins build on the momentum we have coming off a fantastic start to the launch of North Carolina, which went live at the beginning of this month. 
Our Healthy Blue plan has already become the largest Medicaid managed care plan by membership in North Carolina and the leading choice for consumers. Of beneficiaries who chose their plan, nearly 50% selected Healthy Blue, underscoring the power of our alliance partnerships and the Blue brand. 
In our Commercial business, together with IngenioRx, we continue to innovate while demonstrating the power of true integration. By deploying machine learning and automation across our comprehensive ecosystem of medical, pharmacy, lab and social drivers of health data, Anthem and IngenioRx are improving outcomes. Across these businesses, we're leveraging our proprietary predictive modeling algorithm to apply rich and analytic solutions that allow us to tailor our integrated medical and pharmacy offerings to each member population. This enables us to deliver the right solutions to improve health based on individualized needs. We extend this customized approach to our Specialty products, which we are increasingly selling in bundles through Anthem's Whole Health Connection, a differentiator in the marketplace. 
This traction gives us confidence in the long-term targets we articulated for our Commercial business at our recent Analyst Day, including narrowing the profit gap between our fee and risk-based Commercial business by serving more of our fee-based members in more ways. The success we are seeing in our core business validates our commitment to continue to invest in building our digital platform for health. The essence of the platform is that what we own matters less than what we can connect, and we are seeing great success in making connections through consumer- and provider-facing tools. While we are still in the early innings, our efforts to simplify the health care experience while creating a more connected and powerful platform are clearly resonating with consumers, providers and employers. 
For example, over 30% of members registered for Sydney Health are actively using the platform. In the second quarter, we continue to expand access to Sydney across multiple Medicaid markets and saw a fivefold increase in engagement compared to our legacy digital tools for Medicaid. In the Commercial markets, 32 national accounts have purchased Sydney Preferred for its superior end-to-end experience and enhance functionality, like our fine care feature, which provides members seeking surgical treatments, a personalized omnichannel experience, including price transparency, tailored physician and facility recommendations and access to telephonic health coaches to guide them through the process. 
Digital is also playing a key role in deepening our value-based care penetration and provider enablement by improving connectivity and realtime access to meaningful actionable data. We continue to invest in building enhanced data connections to enable deeper collaboration at scale via our HealthOS provider platform. HealthOS connects siloed health data in disparate technologies to drive deeper insights and reduce costs and complexity. More than 100,000 value-based care physicians and 13,000 value-based care coordinators are connected to HealthOS today. This connection allows technology partners and providers to plug into HealthOS and gain data-driven insights as part of their existing workflow. 
In May, we announced a new partnership with Epic that will allow secure bidirectional exchange of health information, paving the way to better leverage data-driven insights into care decisions. Epic is a significant enabler of many of our efforts to improve our HEDIS and STAR scores. We have nearly 150 provider systems on our glide path through the end of 2022 and are in discussions with other health care information companies for similar partnerships. 
All of these efforts align to Anthem's purpose to improve the health of humanity. Our community health strategy supports our purpose by addressing the health-related social needs of our associates, members and communities through data and evidence-based interventions that promote health equity. Our commitment to living this purpose has earned recognition that I'm particularly proud of. For example, Anthem was recently named one of the top 100 U.S. companies supporting healthy communities and families by Just Capital, the leading platform for measuring and improving corporate performance in the stakeholder economy. We are the leader in our industry, ranking #1 among health care providers and #14 overall on the list. In addition, Points of Light, the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service, recently recognized Anthem as 1 of the 50 most community-minded companies in America for 2021. 
As we reflect on our achievements this quarter and our broader mission, we're cognizant that fundamentally improving the health of humanity takes partnerships, align incentives and connections across people, care providers, researchers, data scientists, communities and others dedicated to improving health. Anthem is making these connections through our digital platform for health while following the data and embracing our unique assets to drive positive change in ways that only Anthem can. We have deep local roots in our communities and the industry's largest data sets, both of which position us uniquely well to deliver against our mission. 
I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. John?"
160077,701419954,2348574,"Anthem, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2021",2021-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Elevance Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results that included GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, another strong quarter in which we delivered on ou",1338,"Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results that included GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, another strong quarter in which we delivered on our financial commitments while reinvesting in each of our businesses, all while navigating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
Second quarter results again underscore the balance and resilience of our enterprise. We ended the quarter with 44.3 million members, growth of 1.9 million lives year-over-year or 4.4%, including growth of 820,000 in the second quarter alone. Excluding the acquisition of MMM, we grew organically by 232,000 members in the quarter, driven by growth in our Medicaid and Commercial fully insured businesses partially offset by continued in-group attrition in our large group and national fee-based accounts, in line with our expectations and prior guidance. 
Second quarter operating revenue of $33.3 billion grew 14% over the prior year quarter. On a HIF-adjusted basis, our top line grew nearly 16% with no impact from MMM, which closed at the end of the quarter. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare associated with strong membership growth in addition to rate increases to cover cost inflation. Pharmacy product revenue also contributed to our top line growth as IngenioRx grew affiliated and unaffiliated revenue with a value proposition that continues to resonate in the marketplace. 
The medical loss ratio for the second quarter was 86.8%, an increase of 890 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in non-COVID utilization from depressed levels a year ago and, to a lesser extent, the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Relative to our expectations, total medical costs were favorable, driven by non-COVID costs developing favorably, partially offset by somewhat higher-than-expected cost for COVID-related care. Please note that while total benefit costs were favorable to our expectations, total cost ended the quarter slightly above our estimate of a normalized level. 
Our second quarter SG&A expense ratio came in at 11.5%, a decrease of 240 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the effect of the repeal of the HIF, our SG&A ratio decreased 110 basis points, driven by leverage on strong revenue growth, partially offset by ongoing investments in support of our growth and our evolution to become a digital-first enterprise. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40.9%, down sequentially from 41.6% in the first quarter. The decrease was due to the early repayment of debt at par originally scheduled to mature in August of this year and an increase in equity driven by our strong bottom line performance in the quarter. We continue to expect our debt-to-capital ratio to end the year slightly below 40%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $380.59 for $480 million. We have now repurchased close to 60% of our full year outlook of $1.6 billion, which is still an appropriate figure for modeling purposes. We maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves through the second quarter, ending the period with 48.1 days in claims payable, an increase of 1.2 days compared with the first quarter and 2.1 days year-over-year. MMM and myNEXUS, both of which closed during the quarter, increased our June 30 claims payable balances with minimal impact on the average day of claims, resulting in the DCP calculation increasing by 1.6 days. Excluding these acquisitions, days in claims payable was largely consistent with the last quarter, decreasing by just 0.4 days. 
Given the continued uncertainty associated with COVID, we continue to take a prudent posture in establishing reserves. And as a result, our second quarter earnings did not benefit from the favorable prior-period development. Operating cash flow was $1.7 billion or 0.9x net income in the second quarter. The year-on-year decline was driven by the deferral of normal tax payments out of the second quarter of last year into the back half as was permitted by the IRS. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow was $4.2 billion or 1.2x net income. Given our solid performance in the first half, we are increasing our guidance for full year operating cash flow to greater than $5.8 billion. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is depressed this year due to the timing of certain payments as well as the settlement of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield multi-district litigation scheduled for the fourth quarter. 
Turning to our earnings outlook for the year. We are raising our guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.50 from the greater than $25.10, which squarely puts us at the midpoint of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%. There are a number of moving pieces associated with our revised guidance, which includes a portion of the upside we generated in the second quarter. The underlying fundamentals of our core business remains strong, evidenced by our first half results. 
Given strong year-to-date performance on medical costs, we now expect our full year medical loss ratio to end in the lower half of our full year guidance of 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Given accelerated reinvestment in our business in the first half of the year and start-up costs for new contracts in the back half, we now expect full year SG&A ratio to end the year in the upper half of our prior guidance range of 10.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
We have also increased our outlook for investment income for the year given strong performance in our alternative investment portfolio in the first 2 quarters, which we have not carried forward in our guidance. The outperformance in this nonoperating line item is more than entirely offset by a higher effective tax rate in our full year guidance. In the context of our upwardly revised guidance, we now expect to absorb earnings dilution in the second half associated with the start-up cost for the award of the City of New York Group Medicare Advantage contract and our entry into the Ohio Medicaid program, both of which will go live in 2022. We have also taken a slightly more cautious view of the back half of the year in light of new COVID variants coupled with a slowing vaccination rate, a combination that could result in the potential for higher COVID-related costs. Our guidance also includes a partial year of MMM and myNEXUS, both of which are expected to contribute much more meaningfully to our financial results in 2022 and beyond. 
As noted in our press release, we now expect to generate approximately $137 billion of operating revenue in 2021 and to end the year with 44.8 million to 45.3 million members. Finally, while it is premature to comment quantitatively on 2022, we want to remind you that group Medicare Advantage contracts and large Medicaid wins are generally dilutive in the first full year of operations. We have a strong line of sight towards a compelling ROI on our recent new business wins. And over the 7-year term of our new group Medicare Advantage contract with the City of New York, our expected returns are well in excess of our cost of capital. Additionally, with these 2 wins, our percent of membership and revenues from our Government business division will become an even larger percentage of our totals. 
In closing, we were pleased to deliver another quarter of solid growth while reinvesting in our enterprise. We continue to grow inward in our services businesses and outward in all of our segments, each of which remains well positioned for growth. Our mix continues to evolve towards our strategic areas of focus: Medicare Advantage in the Government business, in addition to our service segments. We have entered the second half with strong underlying fundamentals, solid momentum and a prudently positioned balance sheet. 
And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions."

So in terms of the utilization of the second quarter, the overall utilization was slightly above normalized levels, but slightly less than our expectation. So in total for the company, we exceeded baseline, albeit that we were better than what we had projected. When you really think about it on a line of business by line of business basis, Medicaid had the highest level of deferred utilization. And then certainly, they had some COVID costs, and so Medicaid was below baseline. 
Commercial was slightly above baseline all-in. And Medicare Advantage was actually slightly above baseline all-in once you take into account all the other issues associated with the the risk score revenues and the additional payments that we're still making on the 3.75% rate increases that existed. So all very much consistent with what we thought 90 days ago, just a little bit better. 
And as you look at July, we really don't provide mid-quarter guidance per se, but we're obviously monitoring our preop and precertification data. And as a reminder,  as I just said in the prepared comments, we do expect both the third quarter and the fourth quarter to be above baseline each quarter for the rest of the year.

I'll start first on the City of New York and then ask Felicia to share some of her insights on the Medicaid business in particular. Thanks again for the question because, first, we're really honored to have been awarded the contract with the City of New York and continue serving these members in the state as we execute on our strategy. This is really, I think, a great proof point for Anthem that we shared with everyone at our Investor Day about our goal to get deeper in each of the sites we serve. This contract gives us that opportunity in a very important state. And it also, I think, is a proof point for our goal to convert our existing clients to group Medicare Advantage. So 2, 2 really strong, I think, proof points for the strategy that we've been talking about over the last several years. 
I think a little bit of background would be helpful on the City of New York. We have served them for more than 50 years. And we've actually been their medical management vendor over the past 5 years. So if you think about that, it's really given us a really good, strong understanding of the members and their health needs. So it was really, for us, a great opportunity to provide them sort of the strategic offering in group MA. 
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that generally, these contracts are dilutive in the first full year of operations. The back half of the year, we're going to incur start-up costs and with no offsetting revenues. So as we get ready to go live in January of '22, and we're absorbing that in the guidance that we've given you. And as we've noted in the past, contracts of the size tend to be dilutive as the members transition to group MA. I think the good news is, obviously, as the medical management vendor, we have some insight into these members, but we also need to collect the data to reflect the member's acuity and risk scores and ramp-up other medical management initiatives, particularly our value-based care provider relationships and obviously, working with our partner, Emblem. 
In terms of overall membership, at this time, it's a little bit early to call, but we believe it will be over 200,000 lives. There's going to be some variability in that because there is a choice and open enrollment to buy up and do different things. But we think, clearly, it will be over the 200,000 lives. And as we think about 2022, the guidance and what that means, we'll share that later in this year. We're a little early and ahead of that. We'll address that at the end of the year. But again, I'll just close on this section that as a 7-year contract, we think that it's really positive for us overall, and it really gives us breadth and depth in the market. And beginning in '23, we expect it to have a positive impact to our earnings and a really strong and compelling ROI. 
So with that, I'm going to ask Felicia to address the second part of your question, I guess, which was about Medicaid and a reverification."

When you take a look at it all in, the increase is certainly predominantly due to the continued suspension of reverifications. And we had a couple of small tuck-in acquisitions in our Florida market as well. As you know, our guidance assumes that reverifications remain on hold through the end of 2021. And with the renewed public health emergency from the Biden administration on yesterday, we still feel very good about that time line. With that said, we continue to work very closely with our state partners and our members, helping them understand reverifications, what it means. And we're going to continue to stay close to that as we look to the end of the year. Thank you."

I think a couple of things there embedded in that. We are, as I shared with you in the opening comments, particularly around our HealthOS platform, we're really building an integrated platform where we can drive data. So I'll address virtual care in a minute, but I think it's all connected. We're starting with really our deep data insights, and we're connecting that with our care provider network, trying to give them the best information across every point in time. And then we're using that to enable our value-based care provider. So I think the core of what we're sharing is that virtual is a component of it, and you saw not only virtual but also at-home care. We believe that our ability to get to the commitment we made at Investor Day around getting our trend to CPI is really about the, I guess, I'd say the combination of all of these things. So starting again with enabling our value-based providers, providing data at real time and connecting that to consumers through our Sydney platform. So we accelerated a lot of those initiatives over the past year, particularly in the second quarter. You heard the proof point that we just shared about our Medicaid because we think there's opportunities there as well to accelerate the engagement of our consumers. But fundamentally, this is really about getting our value-based payment and our providers enabled with the data so that they can make the right decisions, take greater risk. And we do see that as a critical element of getting to CPI, trend at CPI over the next several years. So I think they all come together. And again, virtual care is just part of, I think, the continuum of care, including at-home care that we're offering our providers as part of the mix of how they best serve patients where they need to be at the right time. So thanks for the question. I think it's a core element of our strategy. But it's quite comprehensive. It's not only about the digital platform. It's really about value-based care. It's about connecting of care providers with consumers and then enabling the providers to actually get more involved and take more risk along the way and feel confident that they can manage those patients. So thanks again."

And again, as you suggested, the teams haven't really fundamentally changed. First of all, I do want to now a proud I am of the team in terms of our performance and execution. As you saw in the print, we have good year-to-date growth over 100,000 members year-to-date. Our sales again exceeded our lapses in our local market business. Really strong performance on the fully insured side, where we saw sequential growth in the individual small and local large group business. So that was very good in terms of what we can control and execute against. 
As it relates to your question on the economy, yes, I mean, that's where we continue to see a headwind, on our fee-based business and in group changes that continue to put some pressure on us. We are beginning to see things open up a bit. The pipe had been light in the fee-based business over the last year. But we are beginning to see that pipe open up as it relates to Q3 and Q4 and then headed into 2022. We have some good visibility as it relates to 2022 on the national side of our business. So we are feeling good about where that stands right now in terms of the growth headed into 2022. It's still a little bit early. We're sort of at the middle to the end of that selling season. But I do feel strongly that based upon the execution of our team, the tools and capabilities we're using, our engagement with the broker community, our focus on affordability that as the economy continues to improve, you will begin to see that membership come back in the back half of the year into 2022."

And I completely agree with the very first comment you made. It's premature to talk about 2022 at this point in time. However, related to the specificity, our new guidance is $25.50, which does reflect that $0.40 raise. And we're really very, very happy with the core operating performance of the company really improving throughout the quarter and throughout the year. 
I think what I could say, though, without providing any specifics for 2022 is that the core fundamentals of our business do remain solid. We're very confident in our ability to deliver 12% to 15% annual EPS growth over the long term. However, having said that, there will be dilution in -- for these big contracts in 2022. It's too early to actually declare that. As Gail said, we still don't even know the exact number of members that we have in the City of New York, and we need to do a lot more work on that. And so as we get closer to 2022, we'll be in a position to provide additional clarity on our expectations. 
The only other comment I will make is that we are incurring various start-up cost and set up in cost here in the second half of '21, and we have already included that cost structure in our thought process and in our guidance for the year. But thank you for the question."

I'll start with the first question, and then I think Gail would like to address the [indiscernible] But in terms of the days in claims payable, it was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, as you said, up either 7 or 10 days, depending on your starting point. Really a ton of uncertainty associated with this environment. And we have to record reserves consistent with the actuarial standards, and we need to ensure that our methodologies and calculations are very consistent and as I said, that they meet generally accepted accounting principles. Having said that, there's a lot of uncertainties and a lot of unknowns that have existed each and every quarter, each and every month during this entire pandemic. And so we've tried to be extremely prudent and conservative in our approach. And I would expect to have that to continue until there's a little bit more line of sight into the future. I would say that over time, and over time is a long period of time, it could be a few years. But over time, I would expect our DCPs to go back down. 
Now there's a lot of other things that impact our days in claims payable as well. We've talked a lot about our investment in digital. But that investment in digital also includes better auto adjudication rates, cleaner claim submissions from providers to us. And as that is done better and better and faster and faster, that automatically would reduce the days in claims payable without impacting the income statement by $0.01. It would just be better throughput. And actually, the improvement would be our administrative cost structure could go down simultaneously. So there's a lot of variables with DCP. And I would really carry out every one to say do not just look at a number and then think that there's a P&L impact because you also have rate collars and corridors that impact it, et cetera, et cetera. But really, the short answer to your question is, yes, we do expect it to go down over time as we get a little bit more clarity into the current environment. But thank you for the question."

And then associated with the City of New York start-up costs, the Ohio start-up cost, we're really not going to go through a specificity of dollars at this point in time.

What's the limiting factor there? And can you maybe quantify for us what would be the impact on medical cost?"

Partial year results for MMM, when you look at it in our consolidated numbers, certainly weighed down by financing costs, integration costs. Also Puerto Rico has a higher tax rate on average than than the rest of the U.S. And so all those things have been taken into consideration. And really, there's not a lot of accretion associated with that for 2021. It's really -- we expect it to to be much more meaningful in terms of its contribution in 2022. So as I had stated in the prior question, there's a lot of moving parts for the back half of '21 and a lot of integration and implementation cost. They've all been factored into our 25 50 guidance already. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gail."

In terms of your question on myNEXUS, thank you. myNEXUS as I shared is really one of the critical elements of our strategy, both inside of Anthem and outside of Anthem. So you think about 2 million lives served, 900,000 inside of Anthem, we've deployed it pretty extensively, but there is more opportunity. We're working through our integration plans. Clearly, as we grow and some of the new opportunities, we see this as a critical opportunity for us to get care in the home and also have a digital integration. So I think that's really important. But also it's part of our diversified business group strategy to sell to others, our Blue strategy and other clients that we work with extensively. So I see it both the opportunity to grow inside of Anthem, and that's something we know them well. We really like the capabilities. Obviously, we use 900,000 -- we have them against 900,000 members. So we see more opportunity there across our businesses, including our duals. And then secondarily, we think there's a really significant opportunity to grow that business outside of Anthem as well. So this one hits kind of both parts of our strategy. 
In terms of our cost of care, going to the home, virtual value-based care, all of those are critical elements of our cost of care strategy. And so again, having a strong in-home offering, I think, is a really important part, particularly for the senior population. So we see this as having an important part of that piece of it. So thanks for the question. I think it's for us an important building block and an important piece of our overall strategy."

And so we see the capabilities there is really strong and also aligned again with the data that we shared Health West platform. So part of the partnership is not just to do a contracting relationship, but it truly is to with integrate our data, our systems connected to our consumer-facing capabilities and then have the capabilities that we've built, whether it's myNEXUS or other things, help support them in hitting their overall cost goal. So I think it's an important piece and component of our value-based strategy.

This morning, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, ahead of our expectations despite ongoing uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver on our commitments to our stakeholders while making considerable progress against our long-term strategy to transform our organization from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. This transformation is fueled by the continued expansion of our digital platform, which improves connections across the health care system while leveraging the industry's largest data sets to drive actionable insights in pursuit of better health.
In the second quarter, Anthem produced strong membership growth, won significant new contracts in our Government Business and continued to integrate and expand our digital platform. On the membership front, we ended the second quarter with 44.3 million members, up 1.9 million or 4.4% year-over-year; and 820,000 new members since the end of the first quarter, reflecting the strategic acquisition of Puerto Rico's leading Medicare Advantage organization, MMM, as well as strong organic growth in our core benefits businesses.
MMM is the largest Medicare Advantage plan in Puerto Rico and operates the only 4.5 star-rated plan in the territory and is also the second-largest Medicaid health plan. Through its integrated care delivery model, MMM has established a strong track record of delivering quality care for seniors and dual eligibles with complex and chronic needs.
Medicare Advantage remains a key area of focus for our organization, and we continue to see an immense opportunity to grow and optimize this business. Just last week, we were awarded a major contract to serve the retirees of the City of New York in partnership with Emblem Health in what was one of the largest public procurements for group Medicare in the last decade.
This opportunity builds on our more than 50-year relationship serving New York City's workers, retirees and their families and will significantly increase Anthem's group Medicare Advantage business as well as our Medicare Advantage market share in New York. We're honored to have been selected to make a material difference in the lives of New Yorkers who worked hard to serve the city.
In addition to MMM, we also closed on the acquisition of myNEXUS during the second quarter, advancing our strategy to grow and deepen Anthem's capabilities in Medicare Advantage. myNEXUS is a digitally enabled organization that optimizes home health for more than 2 million Medicare Advantage members across 20 states, including more than 900,000 existing Anthem Medicare Advantage members.
myNEXUS improves outcomes by facilitating timely, personalized care for our members in the comfort of their homes, leading to improved continuity of care and reduced hospital admissions, readmissions and ER visits. In addition to supporting future growth in Medicare Advantage, myNEXUS furthers our diversified business group strategy to deliver on its risk contracts through the expansion of home-based care.
Our Medicaid business is also performing very well and continues to build upon our deep local alliances and investments in population health, digital tools and local solutions to help address the social drivers of health in our communities. We extended our strong RFP track record in the quarter, securing an award to continue serving consumers in the state of Nevada. This follows our recent award in Ohio. These wins build on the momentum we have coming off a fantastic start to the launch of North Carolina, which went live at the beginning of this month.
Our Healthy Blue plan has already become the largest Medicaid managed care plan by membership in North Carolina and the leading choice for consumers. Of beneficiaries who chose their plan, nearly 50% selected Healthy Blue, underscoring the power of our alliance partnerships and the Blue brand.
In our Commercial business, together with IngenioRx, we continue to innovate while demonstrating the power of true integration. By deploying machine learning and automation across our comprehensive ecosystem of medical, pharmacy, lab and social drivers of health data, Anthem and IngenioRx are improving outcomes.
Across these businesses, we're leveraging our proprietary predictive modeling algorithm to apply rich and analytic solutions that allow us to tailor our integrated medical and pharmacy offerings to each member population. This enables us to deliver the right solutions to improve health based on individualized needs. We extend this customized approach to our Specialty products, which we are increasingly selling in bundles through Anthem's Whole Health Connection, a differentiator in the marketplace. 
This traction gives us confidence in the long-term targets we articulated for our Commercial business at our recent Analyst Day, including narrowing the profit gap between our fee- and risk-based Commercial business by serving more of our fee-based members in more ways. The success we are seeing in our core business validates our commitment to continue to invest in building our digital platform for health.
The essence of the platform is that what we own matters less than what we can connect, and we are seeing great success in making connections through consumer- and provider-facing tools. While we are still in the early innings, our efforts to simplify the health care experience while creating a more connected and powerful platform are clearly resonating with consumers, providers and employers.
For example, over 30% of members registered for Sydney Health are actively using the platform. In the second quarter, we continue to expand access to Sydney across multiple Medicaid markets and saw a fivefold increase in engagement compared to our legacy digital tools for Medicaid.
In the Commercial markets, 32 national accounts have purchased Sydney, preferred for its superior end-to-end experience and enhanced functionality, like our Find Care feature, which provides members seeking surgical treatments a personalized omnichannel experience, including price transparency, tailored physician and facility recommendations and access to telephonic health coaches to guide them through the process.
Digital is also playing a key role in deepening our value-based care penetration and provider enablement by improving connectivity and real-time access to meaningful actionable data. We continue to invest in building enhanced data connections to enable deeper collaboration at scale via our Health OS provider platform.
Health OS connects siloed health data in disparate technologies to drive deeper insights and reduce costs and complexity. More than 100,000 value-based care physicians and 13,000 value-based care coordinators are connected to Health OS today. This connection allows technology partners and providers to plug into Health OS and gain data-driven insights as part of their existing workflow.
In May, we announced a new partnership with Epic that will allow secure, bidirectional exchange of health information, paving the way to better leverage data-driven insights into care decisions. Epic is a significant enabler of many of our efforts to improve our HEDIS and Star scores. We have nearly 150 provider systems on our glide path through the end of 2022 and are in discussions with other health care information companies for similar partnerships.
All of these efforts align to Anthem's purpose, to improve the health of humanity. Our community health strategy supports our purpose by addressing the health-related social needs of our associates, members and communities through data and evidence-based interventions that promote health equity. Our commitment to living this purpose has earned recognition that I'm particularly proud of.
For example, Anthem was recently named one of the top 100 U.S. companies supporting healthy communities and families by JUST Capital, the leading platform for measuring and improving corporate performance in the stakeholder economy. We are the leader in our industry, ranking #1 among health care providers and #14 overall on the list. In addition, Points of Light, the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service, recently recognized Anthem as 1 of the 50 most community-minded companies in America for 2021.
As we reflect on our achievements this quarter and our broader mission, we're cognizant that fundamentally improving the health of humanity takes partnerships, aligned incentives and connections across people, care providers, researchers, data scientists, communities and others dedicated to improving health. Anthem is making these connections through our digital platform for health while following the data and embracing our unique assets to drive positive change in ways that only Anthem can. We have deep local roots in our communities and the industry's largest data sets, both of which position us uniquely well to deliver against our mission.
I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. John?"
160077,701419954,2348718,"Anthem, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2021",2021-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Elevance Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results that included GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, another strong quarter in which we delivered on ou",1338,"Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results that included GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, another strong quarter in which we delivered on our financial commitments while reinvesting in each of our businesses, all while navigating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Second quarter results again underscore the balance and resilience of our enterprise. We ended the quarter with 44.3 million members, growth of 1.9 million lives year-over-year or 4.4%, including growth of 820,000 in the second quarter alone. Excluding the acquisition of MMM, we grew organically by 232,000 members in the quarter driven by growth in our Medicaid and Commercial fully insured businesses, partially offset by continued in-group attrition in our large group and national fee-based accounts, in line with our expectations and prior guidance.
Second quarter operating revenue of $33.3 billion grew 14% over the prior year quarter. On a HIF-adjusted basis, our top line grew nearly 16% with no impact from MMM, which closed at the end of the quarter. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare associated with strong membership growth in addition to rate increases to cover cost inflation. Pharmacy product revenue also contributed to our top line growth as IngenioRx grew affiliated and unaffiliated revenue with a value proposition that continues to resonate in the marketplace.
The medical loss ratio for the second quarter was 86.8%, an increase of 890 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in non-COVID utilization from depressed levels a year ago and, to a lesser extent, the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Relative to our expectations, total medical costs were favorable, driven by non-COVID costs developing favorably, partially offset by somewhat higher-than-expected cost for COVID-related care. Please note that while total benefit costs were favorable to our expectations, total cost ended the quarter slightly above our estimate of a normalized level.
Our second quarter SG&A expense ratio came in at 11.5%, a decrease of 240 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the effect of the repeal of the HIF, our SG&A ratio decreased 110 basis points, driven by leverage on strong revenue growth, partially offset by ongoing investments in support of our growth and our evolution to become a digital-first enterprise. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40.9%, down sequentially from 41.6% in the first quarter. The decrease was due to the early repayment of debt at par originally scheduled to mature in August of this year and an increase in equity driven by our strong bottom line performance in the quarter. We continue to expect our debt-to-capital ratio to end the year slightly below 40%.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $380.59 for $480 million. We have now repurchased close to 60% of our full year outlook of $1.6 billion, which is still an appropriate figure for modeling purposes.
We maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves through the second quarter, ending the period with 48.1 days in claims payable, an increase of 1.2 days compared with the first quarter and 2.1 days year-over-year. MMM and myNEXUS, both of which closed during the quarter, increased our June 30 claims payable balances with minimal impact on the average day of claims, resulting in the DCP calculation increasing by 1.6 days. Excluding these acquisitions, days in claims payable was largely consistent with the last quarter, decreasing by just 0.4 days.
Given the continued uncertainty associated with COVID, we continue to take a prudent posture in establishing reserves. And as a result, our second quarter earnings did not benefit from the favorable prior-period development.
Operating cash flow was $1.7 billion or 0.9x net income in the second quarter. The year-on-year decline was driven by the deferral of normal tax payments out of the second quarter of last year into the back half as was permitted by the IRS. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow was $4.2 billion or 1.2x net income.
Given our solid performance in the first half, we are increasing our guidance for full year operating cash flow to greater than $5.8 billion. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is depressed this year due to the timing of certain payments as well as the settlement of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield multi-district litigation scheduled for the fourth quarter.
Turning to our earnings outlook for the year. We are raising our guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.50 from the greater than $25.10, which squarely puts us at the midpoint of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%.
There are a number of moving pieces associated with our revised guidance, which includes a portion of the upside we generated in the second quarter. The underlying fundamentals of our core business remains strong, evidenced by our first half results.
Given strong year-to-date performance on medical costs, we now expect our full year medical loss ratio to end in the lower half of our full year guidance of 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Given accelerated reinvestment in our business in the first half of the year and start-up costs for new contracts in the back half, we now expect full year SG&A ratio to end the year in the upper half of our prior guidance range of 10.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points.
We have also increased our outlook for investment income for the year given strong performance in our alternative investment portfolio in the first 2 quarters, which we have not carried forward in our guidance. The outperformance in this nonoperating line item is more than entirely offset by a higher effective tax rate in our full year guidance.
In the context of our upwardly revised guidance, we now expect to absorb earnings dilution in the second half associated with the start-up cost for the award of the City of New York group Medicare Advantage contract and our entry into the Ohio Medicaid program, both of which will go live in 2022.
We have also taken a slightly more cautious view of the back half of the year in light of new COVID variants, coupled with a slowing vaccination rate, a combination that could result in the potential for higher COVID-related costs.
Our guidance also includes a partial year of MMM and myNEXUS, both of which are expected to contribute much more meaningfully to our financial results in 2022 and beyond. As noted in our press release, we now expect to generate approximately $137 billion of operating revenue in 2021 and to end the year with 44.8 million to 45.3 million members.
Finally, while it is premature to comment quantitatively on 2022, we want to remind you that group Medicare Advantage contracts and large Medicaid wins are generally dilutive in the first full year of operations. We have a strong line of sight towards a compelling ROI on our recent new business wins. And over the 7-year term of our new group Medicare Advantage contract with the City of New York, our expected returns are well in excess of our cost of capital. Additionally, with these 2 wins, our percent of membership and revenues from our Government Business division will become an even larger percentage of our totals.
In closing, we were pleased to deliver another quarter of solid growth while reinvesting in our enterprise. We continue to grow inward in our services businesses and outward in all of our segments, each of which remains well positioned for growth. Our mix continues to evolve towards our strategic areas of focus: Medicare Advantage in the Government Business, in addition to our service segments. We have entered the second half with strong underlying fundamentals, solid momentum and a prudently positioned balance sheet.
And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions."

So in terms of the utilization of the second quarter, the overall utilization was slightly above normalized levels but slightly less than our expectation. So in total for the company, we exceeded baseline, albeit that we were better than what we had projected.
When you really think about it on a line of business by line of business basis, Medicaid had the highest level of deferred utilization. And then certainly, they had some COVID costs. And so Medicaid was below baseline.
Commercial was slightly above baseline all-in. And Medicare Advantage was actually slightly above baseline all-in once you take into account all the other issues associated with the risk score revenues and the additional payments that we're still making on the 3.75% rate increases that existed. So all very much consistent with what we thought 90 days ago, just a little bit better.
And as you look at July, we really don't provide mid-quarter guidance, per se. But we're obviously monitoring our pre-auth and precertification data.

And then you talked about this big Medicare Advantage contract from the City of New York. Would be helpful to know -- I was just looking on the Internet. It looks like it might be a couple of hundred thousand members. Is that a ballpark estimate there for 2022 on what you might pick up?"

Well, thanks for the questions, Justin. We'll try to tick them off. I'll start first on the City of New York and then ask Felicia to share some of her insights on the Medicaid business in particular.
Thanks again for the question because, first, we're really honored to have been awarded the contract with the City of New York and continue serving these members in the state as we execute on our strategy. This is really, I think, a great proof point for Anthem that we shared with everyone at our Investor Day about our goal to get deeper in each of the sites we serve. This contract gives us that opportunity in a very important state. And it also, I think, is a proof point for our goal to convert our existing clients to group Medicare Advantage. So 2 really strong, I think, proof points for the strategy that we've been talking about over the last several years.
I think a little bit of background would be helpful on the City of New York. We have served them for more than 50 years. And we've actually been their medical management vendor over the past 5 years. So if you think about that, it's really given us a really good, strong understanding of the members and their health needs. So it was really, for us, a great opportunity to provide them sort of the strategic offering in group MA.
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that generally, these contracts are dilutive in the first full year of operations. The back half of the year, we're going to incur start-up costs and with no offsetting revenues. So as we get ready to go live in January of '22 and -- we're absorbing that in the guidance that we've given you. And as we've noted in the past, contracts of this size tend to be dilutive as the members transition to group MA.
I think the good news is, obviously, as the medical management vendor, we have some insight into these members. But we also need to collect the data to reflect the member's acuity and risk scores and ramp up other medical management initiatives, particularly our value-based care provider relationships and obviously working with our partner, Emblem.
In terms of overall membership, at this time, it's a little bit early to call, but we believe it will be over 200,000 lives. There's going to be some variability in that because there is a choice and open enrollment to buy up and do different things. But we think, clearly, it will be over the 200,000 lives. And as we think about 2022, the guidance and what that means, we'll share that later in this year. We're a little early and ahead of that. We'll address that at the end of the year.
But again, I'll just close on this section that as a 7-year contract, we think that it's really positive for us overall. And it really gives us breadth and depth in the market. And beginning in '23, we expect it to have a positive impact to our earnings and a really strong and compelling ROI.
So with that, I'm going to ask Felicia to address the second part of your question, I guess, which was about Medicaid and a reverification."

That was up 582,000 when you include MMM. So just in terms of our organic growth, 267,000 increase in terms of our Medicaid membership compared to the first quarter of 2021. 
When you take a look at it all-in, the increase is certainly predominantly due to the continued suspension of reverifications. And we had a couple of small tuck-in acquisitions in our Florida market as well. As you know, our guidance assumes that reverifications remain on hold through the end of 2021. And with the renewed public health emergency from the Biden administration on yesterday, we still feel very good about that time line.
With that said, we continue to work very closely with our state partners and our members, helping them understand reverifications, what it means. And we're going to continue to stay close to that as we look to the end of the year. Thank you."

And so we obviously want to maintain a prudent, if not cautious, posture with respect to our guidance. 
So in that context, we believe that the net headwind of $600 million is still appropriate, with the majority of that in the back half of the year. And that's an all-in type of an estimate. That includes the impact on our risk scores, the additional fee schedules, the COVID cost, the increase in vaccination, administrative cost all-in.

I think a couple of things there embedded in that. We are -- as I shared with you in the opening comments, particularly around our Health OS platform, we're really building an integrated platform where we can drive data. So I'll address virtual care in a minute, but I think it's all connected.
We're starting with really our deep data insights. And we're connecting that with our care provider network, trying to give them the best information across every point in time. And then we're using that to enable our value-based care provider.
So I think the core of what we're sharing is that virtual is a component of it. And you saw not only virtual but also at-home care. We believe that our ability to get to the commitment we made at Investor Day around getting our trend to CPI is really about the -- I guess I'd say the combination of all of these things. So starting again with enabling our value-based providers, providing data at real time and connecting that to consumers through our Sydney platform.
So we accelerated a lot of those initiatives over the past year, particularly in the second quarter. You heard the proof point that we just shared about our Medicaid because we think there's opportunities there as well to accelerate the engagement of our consumers. But fundamentally, this is really about getting our value-based payment and our providers enabled with the data so that they can make the right decisions, take greater risk. And we do see that as a critical element of getting to CPI, trend at CPI over the next several years.
So I think they all come together. And again, virtual care is just part of, I think, the continuum of care, including at-home care that we're offering our providers as part of the mix of how they best serve patients where they need to be at the right time.
So thanks for the question. I think it's a core element of our strategy. But it's quite comprehensive. It's not only about the digital platform. It's really about value-based care. It's about connecting of care providers with consumers and then enabling the providers to actually get more involved and take more risk along the way and feel confident that they can manage those patients. So thanks again."

First of all, I do want to note how proud I am of the team in terms of our performance and execution. As you saw in the print, we have good year-to-date growth over 100,000 members year-to-date. Our sales again exceeded our lapses in our local market business. Really strong performance on the fully insured side, where we saw sequential growth in the individual small and local large group business. So that was very good in terms of what we can control and execute against. 
As it relates to your question on the economy, yes, I mean, that's where we continue to see a headwind, on our fee-based business and in group changes that continue to put some pressure on us. We are beginning to see things open up a bit. The pipe had been light in the fee-based business over the last year. But we are beginning to see that pipe open up as it relates to Q3 and Q4 and then headed into 2022.
We have some good visibility as it relates to 2022 on the national side of our business. So we are feeling good about where that stands right now. In terms of the growth headed into 2022, it's still a little bit early. We're sort of at the middle to the end of that selling season. But I do feel strongly that based upon the execution of our team, the tools and capabilities we're using, our engagement with the broker community, our focus on affordability that as the economy continues to improve, you will begin to see that membership come back in the back half of the year into 2022."

But in terms of the days in claims payable, it was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, as you said, up either 7 or 10 days, depending on your starting point.
Really a ton of uncertainty associated with this environment. And we have to record reserves consistent with the actuarial standards. And we need to ensure that our methodologies and calculations are very consistent and, as I said, that they meet generally accepted accounting principles.
Having said that, there's a lot of uncertainties and a lot of unknowns that have existed each and every quarter, each and every month during this entire pandemic. And so we've tried to be extremely prudent and conservative in our approach. And I would expect to have that to continue until there's a little bit more line of sight into the future. I would say that over time -- and over time is a long period of time. It could be a few years. But over time, I would expect our DCPs to go back down.
Now there's a lot of other things that impact our days in claims payable as well. We've talked a lot about our investment in digital. But that investment in digital also includes better auto adjudication rates, cleaner claim submissions from providers to us. And as that is done better and better and faster and faster, that automatically would reduce the days in claims payable without impacting the income statement by $0.01. It would just be better throughput. And actually, the improvement would be our administrative cost structure could go down simultaneously.
So there's a lot of variables with DCP. And I would really carry out every one to say do not just look at a number and then think that there's a P&L impact because you also have rate collars and corridors that impact it, et cetera, et cetera.

And then going back to Scott's question. It sounds like you don't want to really sort of quantify the dilution for '22, but it sounds like there's start-up cost this year. So can you help at all in terms of the magnitude of that in terms of what you're absorbing this year for start-up costs around those contracts?"

Our total costs for the second quarter were better than our expectations. Simultaneously, our total costs for the second quarter were above baseline or a normalized level given the absence of COVID. So maybe that's where the clarification is necessary. So we're above baseline for the quarter but better than overall expectations. And that's one of the reasons our medical loss ratio is at the very low end of the guidance range as well.
And then associated with the City of New York start-up cost, the Ohio start-up cost, we're really not going to go through a specificity of dollars at this point in time. As you say, there's a lot of moving parts in our 2021 guidance. We do have -- we closed on MMM and myNEXUS, which certainly includes from financing cost, deal cost and integration cost on -- for those entities, we have the start-up cost for New York GRS as well as Ohio. We've taken all of that into consideration. And it's all been thought through in terms of our $25.50 guidance. So thank you for the question."

This includes home visits and telehealth, really meeting members where they are and how they feel most comfortable engaging with their care providers.

And part of that was at our encouragement. We're trying to encourage our members to seek health care when they need it, obtain their checkups and their annual visits and various things like that.
And as you know, more often that the seniors go in to see the docs, the better opportunity there is for us to collect data and information on them to help maximize the risk score revenues. So part of our strategy was consistent with that to ensure that our members actually sought and got the care they needed. And we're seeing that.

And with a greater focus on behavioral health and the needs associated with behavioral health and the importance of being able to navigate the system and the complexity of the system and what we talk about around advocacy has really become critically important. 
And we are selling that value proposition into the marketplace. We're beginning to see that really resonate. As I alluded to before in talking about our national business, which, again, we're about in the seventh inning of that selling season, those are the themes that we're selling through. And we're really seeing it resonate. We're seeing new account wins come through. And then importantly and what I'm really encouraged by is our existing employer accounts are also growing and for the reasons that we stated, that we were really being sensitized to these issues around COVID and need for advocacy, affordability and focus on issues like behavioral health.
In addition to that, you had mentioned digital and some of the things that we had previously talked about that and the digitization of our business. And yes, that is also a focus. Again, looking back to what Gail said earlier about really leveraging digital in a much greater way, both as it relates to navigating our product portfolio but then, importantly, as it relates to our members and our providers and having data in the hands of providers at the point of care is really an important point that is also resonating and something that we're trying to sell to."

So everything that you mentioned, whether or not -- what are vaccination rates looking like, the population in terms of who's receiving vaccine, the upticks in potential variants, non-COVID electives, core utilization, et cetera, all that is being taken into consideration. If you look at some of our public filings, like in the individual business, you will see that we are pricing in for these COVID impacts.
I would say there's variation by geography and there's variation by product line. So there is complexity to it, but I think we're being very prudent. And again, we're going to price the forward trend and be disciplined about pricing going forward."

Clearly, as we grow and some of the new opportunities, we see this as a critical opportunity for us to get care in the home and also have a digital integration. So I think that's really important. 
But also it's part of our diversified business group strategy to sell to others, our Blue strategy and other clients that we work with extensively. So I see it both the opportunity to grow inside of Anthem. And that's something -- we know them well. We really like the capabilities. Obviously, we use 900,000 -- we have them against 900,000 members. So we see more opportunity there across our businesses, including our duals. And then secondarily, we think there's a really significant opportunity to grow that business outside of Anthem as well. So this one hits kind of both parts of our strategy.
In terms of our cost of care, going to the home, virtual value-based care, all of those are critical elements of our cost of care strategy. And so again, having a strong in-home offering, I think, is a really important part, particularly for the senior population. So we see this as having an important part of that piece of it.

These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail."

We're pleased to talk with you about another strong quarter. This morning, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.13 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, ahead of expectations despite another surge in COVID that created challenges throughout the country. 
Once again, Anthem continues to deliver on stakeholder commitments, accelerate growth in every core benefits business and made considerable progress towards our long-term strategy to transform from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. Addressing the whole person is essential to becoming a trusted lifetime partner in health. Responding to the pandemic has allowed us to instill new agility and innovation into the business, particularly around solutions for physical health, pharmacy, behavioral and social needs with an emphasis on maternal health, access to nutritious foods and health disparities. Ultimately, we believe we're only as healthy as the communities we live in and recognize our important role in ensuring everyone has an opportunity to be and stay healthy. 
As the health care paradigm shift, we're accelerating work to simplify members' and clients' everyday experiences and meet their evolving needs through a personalized experience. Moreover, there's abundant opportunity to modernize further and reinforce our position, leveraging our technology, predictive analytics and innovative products and services to bring an enhanced experience only Anthem can offer. We expect whole person health care, powered by digital technologies, to help us achieve our goal of driving commercial medical cost trend down towards the rate of CPI by 2025. Currently, we're exploring more ways to drive differentiated value across medical and pharmacy. 
Our insight-driven approach is fueling new programs that drive better cost and quality outcomes for our members, including in the areas of behavioral health and autoimmune disease. Additionally, we recently launched a new offering to test the full suite of our capabilities in the form of a virtual primary care first product, which we expect to demonstrate meaningful reductions in overall cost of care, and greater member satisfaction. We are already selling virtual-first risk-based commercial plans in certain markets across each of Anthem's 14 Blue states for the 2022 plan year, featuring simplified plan designs, 24/7 service and leveraging our high-performing networks that enable affordable price points. We've also seen strong interest in these capabilities from our fee-based clients, and we'll be embedding virtual primary care with several large fee-based clients throughout 2022. 
At the same time, innovative product offerings like Sydney preferred, which allows employers to customize a digital-first health care experience for their employees, are gaining considerable momentum. To date, more than 50 national accounts have signed up for Sydney preferred, representing nearly 900,000 commercial members. 
To help accelerate our digital platform, we've elevated Rajiv Bernanke to President of Digital Platform. Rajiv will drive the commercialization of our digital capabilities for consumers and care providers as we reimagine the health ecosystem. He will share notable third quarter highlights and business-driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021, starting with our Medicaid business, which is performing well. Our 
HealthyBlue plan, in partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, has quickly become the largest Medicaid-managed care plan by membership in North Carolina and the leading choice for consumers. Its success, coupled with the ongoing suspension of eligibility redetermination, drove Anthem's total Medicaid membership above 10 million at quarter end, exceeding our internal expectations. Our commitment to members and their communities has never been stronger, and we continue to develop innovative solutions to meet their unique holistic health needs. 
As a result, our focus on reducing health disparities and inequities remains vital to the value Anthem offers state partners. This is reflected in our momentum, along with our 100% RFP win rate year-to-date. Looking further ahead, Anthem will launch another new statewide Medicaid-managed care contract in Ohio in the summer of 2022. 
After earning the city of New York's group Medicare Advantage contract last quarter, we added several new group MA customers in the third quarter for January 1, 2022, start date and have a growing pipeline of new prospects. As part of our strategy to deepen our Medicare Advantage market penetration, we remain focused on converting commercial age out to MA relationships, and preparing for a flawless January launch of our group Medicare Advantage plan for New York City's retirees. 
Customized solutions at scale underpin our approach to individual Medicare Advantage benefits for 2022. Many of our MA plans will allow customers to choose what's best for them from a menu of innovative whole health benefit. For example, in some areas, the program will include a Kroger grocery cart; generous over-the-counter benefits; and up to 60 hours of in-home support to assist with light housekeeping, [ Aaron ] and companionship. We expect these and other benefit enhancements to help drive another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership next year. 
Medicare Star ratings continue to be a focus area across Anthem. And the ratings released 2 weeks ago show we've made solid progress. We're particularly proud, HealthSun received a 5-star rating for the fifth consecutive year, the only Medicare Advantage health plan in Florida to accomplish such an achievement. 
For the 2023 payment year, we anticipate approximately 73% of members and plans that CMS rated as 4-plus stars, up from 58% on a comparable basis a year ago. That figure will move even higher with the City of New York's group Medicare Advantage contract launch next year. 
At the same time, investments in provider partnerships are accelerating Anthem's evolution toward high-quality value-based care. This is necessary to drive improved outcomes and cost of care across all of our benefits businesses and is critical in Medicare Advantage, where it impacts reimbursement through Star ratings. This year, more than 60% of our Medicare Advantage spending will be in risk-sharing arrangements. Based on our current contract, we expect that to increase to more than 70% in 2022, with approximately 30% of Medicare Advantage spending in fully capitated risk arrangements. Investments in our primary care partnerships, in particular, will support members and drive growth through the expansion of value-based care, leading to an even larger proportion of our members in 4-plus Star contracts over time. 
We recognize there's still more work to do, and we'll continue our efforts to raise customer satisfaction by aligning incentives with care providers to improve quality and medication adherence, while simultaneously enhancing our member experience, accelerating our use of data and analytics and leveraging IngenioRx as our pharmacy benefit manager. 
Lastly, a few highlights of the strong growth we see in our commercial business. We're nearing the end of the most robust national account selling season in Anthem's history. Volume of RFPs was down, but average size was up considerably, and we won a disproportionate share of new business and expanded services with our existing clients. IngenioRx is also showing exciting growth with a more than fivefold increase in new sales at this point in the selling season compared to the relatively depressed base a year ago, when that pandemic weighed heavily on employer decision-making. 
The consistent theme across all of our businesses is that each continues to produce strong organic growth. This drove medical enrollment to more than 45 million U.S. consumers, strengthening Anthem's position as the largest health insurer in America by membership. I'm pleased with the progress we're making towards delivering our strategy and want to share 2 recent leadership changes to accelerate our efforts. 
Pete Haytaian will lead our Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx, both of which are critical components of our growth strategy. Pete has an impressive track record of growth and innovation in his previous roles leading Anthem's commercial and government businesses. With Pete's transition, we're confident our Commercial & Specialty Business division will maintain its strong momentum under leadership of Morgan Kendrick, who's driven market-leading growth across critical lines of our Commercial business, including national accounts, and most recently, as President of Anthem's Commercial West market, our largest region. 
The breadth and depth of our collective leadership ensures we stand ready to deliver on our promises to stakeholders across all areas of our business and will guide Anthem the long-term sustainable growth. It's a privilege to work alongside such a strong group of leaders committed to advancing our purpose and mission. 
In summary, our actions and the focus and discipline we've brought to the business have positioned Anthem for the next several years of growth. Our strategy to extend our role from a partner in health benefit to a lifetime trusted partner in health is resonating in the marketplace as evidenced by our growth. Our response to COVID brings a new level of agility and speed to the business, along with more opportunities to reach consumers and care providers than ever before. And we continue to simplify and personalize our member relationships with relevant benefits and enhanced innovative experiences, where and when they want. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results in more detail."

As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, an increase of approximately 62% year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all of our businesses. Th",1272,"Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, an increase of approximately 62% year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all of our businesses. This growth was a result of focused execution against our strategic priorities despite a challenging backdrop created by another surge in COVID. 
Our third quarter results once again demonstrate the balance and resilience of our core benefit businesses and the strong growth momentum we are producing across the board. We ended the quarter with 45.1 million members, growth of 2.4 million lives year-over-year, or 5.7%, including growth of 730,000 during the quarter, led by the successful launch of our HealthyBlue Medicaid plan in North Carolina. 
In addition to the 426,000 members gained in that state, we produced incremental organic growth of nearly 380,000 members during the quarter, driven by strong growth in our Medicaid and Commercial risk-based businesses. This growth was partially offset by continued in-group attrition in our group fee-based business, consistent with our expectations. 
Operating revenue in the third quarter was $35.5 billion, an increase of 16% versus prior year quarter and nearly 18% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The increase was driven by higher premium revenue associated with strong membership growth in our Medicaid, Medicare and Commercial risk businesses as well as rate increases to cover cost trends and ongoing momentum in our diversified service businesses, including IngenioRx. 
The benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 87.7%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Excluding the impact of the HIF, our medical loss ratio would have decreased by approximately 50 basis points, driven by unfavorable rate adjustments in our Medicaid business in the third quarter of 2020. All in, the cost of care was above what we would consider to be normalized or baseline levels in the third quarter of this year, driven by higher COVID costs in the month of August and September, but medical costs were, nonetheless, better than we had expected for the quarter overall, with lower non-COVID utilization, helping absorb the higher-than-expected COVID-related costs. 
Our third quarter SG&A ratio was 11.1%, a decrease of 620 basis points from the 17.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the charges we took last year related to business optimization and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association litigation settlement. Excluding charges from the base year and the impact of the repeal of the health insurance tax, our SG&A ratio would have decreased by approximately 130 basis points, driven by leverage associated with growth in operating revenue, partially offset by higher spending to support our growth and our transition to becoming a digital enterprise for health. Operating cash flow during the quarter was $2.5 billion or 1.7x net income. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9%, down approximately 100 basis points from the 39.9% as of the end of the second quarter. The decrease was driven by growth in shareholders' equity associated with our earnings in the quarter and a reduction in commercial paper outstanding. We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves given the ongoing uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and lengthening and cycle times that we have seen since the pandemic began. 
We ended the third quarter with 46.8 days in claims payable, a decrease of 1.3 days compared to the second quarter and an increase of 5.7 days as compared to the prior year quarter. The timing of our acquisition of MMM inflated days and claims payable in the second quarter and drove the sequential change. Excluding timing and related impacts associated with the acquisition, our days in claims payable would have increased by 0.2 days sequentially. 
Given strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.85 from greater than $25.50, putting us at the high end of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%. Please note that this guidance continues to reflect the total COVID and non-COVID costs combined exceeding baseline in every month of the fourth quarter and assumes a similar overall net headwind from COVID for the year relative to our prior guidance. 
Given significant outperformance in the third quarter on our investment income line, we have increased our full year outlook for investment income by $100 million to approximately $1.2 billion, which is $260 million above our initial outlook of $940 million. Much of the outperformance in this area stems from stellar results in our alternative investment portfolio year-to-date that we would not expect to recur. Accordingly, we believe that there is at least $200 million of nonrecurring upside in the investment income line that should be removed when assessing the appropriate base for earnings growth for 2022, equating to approximately $0.65 of earnings per share in 2021 and implying a baseline for growth entering 2022 of $25.20. 
Most importantly, our businesses are performing well, with strong growth momentum that we expect will carry into 2022. Although we will not provide specific guidance for next year on this call, I would now like to shift focus to the tailwinds and headwinds that we are considering into next year. 
Starting with the tailwinds. Recall that our 2021 guidance continues to embed a significant net headwind related to the effects of COVID. While it is too early to declare how much of the overall net headwind we will be able to earn back in 2022, we do believe that we will recover a portion of it, resulting in a year-over-year tailwind. Based on our strong competitive positioning, we expect another year of double-digit membership growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership. We also expect strong growth in our Commercial membership, aided by what is shaping up to be the strongest national account selling season in the history of the company. 
We expect accretion from the annualization of earnings of our acquisitions of MMM and myNEXUS. And we expect an EPS lift from our share repurchase program, which was opportunistic during recent periods of volatility in our stock price. Our tailwinds will be weighed against known headwinds, and these include: the dilution associated with the first year of operations of our new group Medicare Advantage contract serving New York City's retirees, which we continue to expect will launch on January 1; as well as dilution related to the start-up and launch of our new Medicaid contract in Ohio, which we expect to begin on July 1, 2022; in addition, the resumption of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations assuming a return to a more normal operating environment; and finally, the nonrecurrence of the upside in the investment income line this year that I had described earlier. 
Based on what we know today, we believe our tailwinds will largely offset our headwinds, enabling us to reaffirm our commitment to growth in adjusted earnings per share of at least 12% in 2022, after adjusting for the portion of investment income that we have identified as nonrecurring. We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call when we will discuss our 2022 outlook in more detail. 
In closing, we continue to execute against our strategic growth priorities and are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong growth and continued reinvestment in our business, all while maintaining a solid balance sheet, given the ongoing uncertainties associated with the pandemic. 
And with that, operator, please open the line to questions."

The New York group retiree business are still going through their enrollment process. So we don't have the absolute exact number of lives lined up at this point in time. And so there's some variability there. But you're correct, we do have some pretty good line of sight on most of the rest of them.

And you take that off of our updated guidance, and we believe the appropriate jump-off point for 2022 growth is $25.20. So I appreciate the opportunity to clarify that. 
Associated with the various lines of business, the Commercial profitability is still very, very good. However, Commercial, had the surge of COVID in August and September, was really more significantly pronounced within the Commercial line of business than it was in the other 2 lines of business. We took the opportunity to reserve prudently within the commercial line for that spike and to build commercial reserves as a result of what we're seeing at that point in time. Fortunately, non-COVID came in much lower in September across all lines of business, which allowed our quarter to come out in a really, really good place. 
Medicare was very much consistent with expectations. Medicaid was actually a little bit better than expectations for the quarter. And just as a reminder, we had guided to be above baseline costs, for COVID and non-COVID combined, for each of the 3 months in the third quarter, and we were. We were just ended up being better than our expectations. So -- but the commercial issue was really had to do with the spike in August associated with COVID. Thank you for the question."

And I do want to thank Gail and the team for putting me in this position. I do think I'm in a unique position having on Government and Commercial to have a perspective on this. And I think working collectively as an enterprise, we can do very well in penetrating the Anthem portfolio to a much greater degree. 
But as it relates to your question on Ingenio and growth in Ingenio, we work very closely with the Commercial business. And as we talked about before, the greatest opportunity for us is penetrating the self-funded business. I'd say that activity for us has really picked up this year relative to last year. we're seeing really nice success, Lance, down market on the smaller side of the business and the middle market. So we're definitely seeing more activity there, and we're also seeing a lot more wins from that perspective. 
And as we've talked about, that's really the sweet spot from a financial and profitability perspective for us. So it's a really good position for us to be in. 
On the larger end of the market with some of the jumbo accounts, we are also seeing activity pick up as it relates to pharmacy. But it is a competitive space, and we see the power of incumbency being a little more significant and a factor there. 
So heading into 2022, as it relates to Ingenio, we feel really good about our growth trajectory and our performance. And net membership growth will be improved relative to what we've seen in 2021. 
As it relates to the Diversified Business Group and our strategies, and then I'll also talk strategically about Ingenio a bit, I'm really excited about where we are. I mean if you think about where the puck is going in health care, you think about the significance of specialty pharmacy. You heard Gail talk earlier about virtual and the opportunities for virtual even in pharmacy, there's tremendous opportunity for that business to continue to grow. We're at the beginning of the evolution of, I think, that pharmacy business, and there's a great opportunity there for us and to penetrate the Anthem business. 
And then as it relates to the DBG portfolio, if you think about the verticals that we talked about at Investor Day and the opportunity there, a tremendous opportunity. So you think about behavioral health and the opportunities there, with Beacon as a leading asset in the space, and we think there's tremendous opportunity to grow that business and diversify that business. 
When you think about site of care and redirection, it becomes hugely important as it relates to the Commercial business and cost of care. And you think about assets like AIM and myNEXUS, a recent transaction where we're seeing tremendous success. 
And then you think about managing the chronically ill and the great assets we have there around CareMore and Aspire, I would say this, Lance, that my -- and I've only been on the job for about 1.5 weeks, so I don't want to be too presumptuous here. But the opportunity to penetrate Anthem is very significant across our entire portfolio, Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial. But I also think there's tremendous external opportunity. So I look forward to leading this and working with my colleague, Felicia and Morgan, on growing the business together."

We also think our Diversified Business capabilities are going to be incredibly important in some of our digital platform capabilities that we've also offered to other Blues. So I can't really comment on where we are in terms of that litigation because it's not finally settled yet, but we feel that there's a significant amount of opportunities for us even outside of the settlement to work with Blue partners across the country. Thanks for the question."

We've had, as you indicated, noted, nice growth on the risk-based business across the segment. Individual, as you've noted, it's benefited from a long extending special enrollment period. So we've seen month-over-month growth there. 
Also, when you look at our large group, small group business, we've seen month-over-month growth in sales exceeding lapses. And notably, our large group business has performed quite well. In fact, 23 of the last 25 quarters, our sales have exceeded lapses. 
Looking forward into the new year, clearly, it's a competitive geography and a competitive market when you look at individual in ACA. It's one of those that I would characterize as rational nonetheless. And 1 that we've -- not inconsistent with our strategies in the past, we take a very disciplined approach. We look at this market by market, county by county. 
And in fact, as we expand next year, for 2022, we're going to be in 83% of the counties that we can serve. That's up from 71% from the prior year. And this is most notably done by leveraging our unique provider partnerships, leveraging the scale and density we have in our geographies to provide value for the market. Again, the strategy is not a shortsighted one, and we're confident the pricing is appropriate on our modeling of our forward trends. So thank you again for the question."

I think it's actually a really important one as we think about the next generation of where products are going to go. One of the things that's happened is the pandemic has really highlighted the need for these virtual care services. 
We shared with you quite some time ago, our JV with hydrogen Health. And we've been in the market actually working closely with our partners to deliver those services, particularly best-in-class, urgent care, primary care using chat and text. And what we're talking about now is, I'll call it the next generation of virtual primary care. We've gotten some experience in our early entree with virtual care over the last year. And now we're continuing to evolve that. 
So we did launch, as I shared in my remarks, this virtual-first services. think what's interesting and unique about this is they're integrated with our high-performance network, and that's really important. And we're seeing a lot of traction in our high-performance network. And I know we've shared previously, our high-performance network has anywhere from 12% to 15% cost structure differential. And as you think about virtual primary care added to that, we expect those to sort of be the starting point of what we can gain traction on. So I'm really encouraged by this initial launch. We're going to continue to, I think, innovate and evolve from that. 
In terms of where we're doing it, we are working in our Blue state. We're in most of our markets right now. We have offerings, not in every county, but we're going to continue to expand that as we certainly learn about it, look at the alignment lot of this does, as I said, rely on our high-performing networks and our ability to use both virtual care as well as our high-performing networks. 
And just to give you a sense of what it is, I mean we're looking at the offerings to cover virtual visits with a zero co-pay simplified plan designs, 24/7 service to leverage the network. Value-based contracts are at the core of this to drive that cost structure differential. And again, we would expect at least 15% below traditional products. But again, that's a starting point, and we're going to gain experience with this. 
And there's been a lot of interest. We've seen a significant amount of interest. We've offered it first in our fully insured risk-based business and, now our national fee accounts are interested in embedding this in their offerings. And as you heard, I think from my opening comments and then what Morgan said, we've had one of our strongest ever national account selling seasons. And again, I do credit the innovation we're bringing around digital to the success we're having there and just a fundamentally strong differentiated cost structure really driven by high-performance networks. So thanks for the question. We are -- we're excited and optimistic about how we think that this can drive future trend and future opportunities for our clients. So again, more to come on this, but you'll be hearing a lot more about it in the coming months as we gain more traction with our employers."

And then on the Medicaid side of the house, you did mention redeterminations as a headwind, but we certainly note for you and across the board, that seems to be a population that's not just vaccine hesitant, but utilization hesitant, and the MLRs look really strong there.

We expect all of our businesses to grow, and the individual is no different. 
In terms of the Medicaid and the redeterminations, the headwind that we referenced really has to do with Medicaid membership, but this is my opportunity to again talk about the balance and resilience of our membership and our catcher's mit. And we may be able to turn that he went into a tailwind depending on where those folks go. We do believe that once redeterminations start, that we will be able to maintain a significant amount of that membership within an Anthem product. 
We offer a product for every American in every situation, young, old, rich, poor, sick, healthy, we have a product for all of them. And right now, there's a significant number of members within our Medicaid plans. And after redetermination occurs, Medicaid may shrink a little bit. But that means that there's really some significant growth opportunities in other lines of business. So I didn't spike it out specifically because we think it's a driver, and we could actually turn a headwind into a tailwind. So thank you for the question."

So as it relates to some of the services from mild, moderate to acute mental health, treatment for family support, crisis prevention, opioid abuse, SMI, EAP programs, a broad portfolio, which really will serve, I think, Anthem really well. 
The other thing I'll say, and this was very important to us and really worked out from a strategic perspective, but the pandemic obviously really accentuated the need for behavioral health. We experienced 3x more people reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression in this period, 2.5x more people reporting suicidal ideation. And with opioid abuse, there was a very significant increase. And so that plays really well across our portfolio. 
We obviously have a broad portfolio across Medicare, Medicaid and commercial. The integration process is going really well between the parties. We actually, as it relates to penetrating the Anthem business, have embraced a lot of the clinical programs and expertise of Beacon as we integrate. 
We also, in my old life, on the commercial side, worked on new product offerings, a product called Behavioral Health Advantage, which is being deployed in 2022. And then obviously, as it relates to our Government program business, working very closely with Felicia and the Government team and the Medicare team on a post-acute care product. And this is just the beginning. I think there'll continue to be tremendous opportunities around behavioral. 
One of the areas that I'm very focused on is also virtual and the importance of virtual. We've seen an exponential increase in virtual services as it relates to Beacon, and penetrating our portfolio in that regard will become very important going forward. I appreciate the question."

The Delta variant is still out there, and we want to be very respectful for it as well as any other new variants that may or may not exist.

And as I stated, we have products and all those things, and we expect to keep and maintain our fair share. So we feel very good about our opportunity and our ability to keep the membership within the Anthem family over the course of the next year. 
And then as it relates to the Medicaid pricing, we learned a lot a few years ago in terms of working with the states being very proactive and ensuring that we're having actually justified rates. And we'll certainly continue to do that. It's very early in the rating season, but we're comfortable with what we're seeing to date in building our financial plan with prudent assumptions that we believe are well supported. And the states are very -- say we're having some very productive conversations with the states as well about ensuring that we get actuarially justified rates throughout the future. 
The only other thing I'll say about the Medicaid is there are a lot of financial measures that are in place now that far more than used to be in place in terms of collars, corridors and things like that, that really help maintain the profitability and maintain the stability of that marketplace. So really need to look at Medicaid over a long period of time. Thank you, Kevin."

A couple of things. I think you hit on many of the core drivers. First and foremost, as we've said, because of the density that we have in our markets, we believe that investing in partnerships makes the most sense because we believe we can drive better membership, better stars ratings. And with 1 in 8 patients being an Anthem member, the density of working with those providers provides us a good return. 
And also remember, we can participate in the profit stream there by embedding some of our DBG assets, our other assets around IngenioRx. And so it's not that we're walking away from participating in those profit streams, we actually think we have a much more capitally efficient use by investing, partnering and then pulling through the other assets that we have invested in. And so that's the core of our strategy, and it's worked really well, and we're continuing to accelerate that strategy. 
And as I shared, we expect to have 70% in value-based arrangements, 30% in [ full-capitated ] arrangements. It's a big driver for our Medicare Advantage business. But quite frankly, all of our benefits businesses are going to have an opportunity there. 
In terms of other areas that we're investing in, we've said that we really want to transform ourselves. And part of that transformation is building this digital platform for health. The opportunities are inside of Anthem as well as with our Blue partners, and we see again, opportunities to commercialize that. That's going to be over the next several years. One of the reasons I elevated Rajiv Bernacki, who has been leading this area, is to really explore those opportunities. Again, we've been doing that inside of Anthem, but we think there's an opportunity with our partners to do more areas around Sydney, for example, Sydney Health, which is gaining great traction; our Health OS, which we think could be a broader opportunity for the health ecosystem. We've done quite a bit of investment in Stars and HEDIS quality improvement in AI and analytics, digital therapeutics. So there's a broad range of things around the digital capabilities and ecosystem we're building. 
But in terms of the value, again, we look at the most efficient way to deploy our capital, where we have our strengths, which is the density in the markets we serve and how it fills, I think, our strategy and then how we pull through Ingenio, DBG and other services, which really are not -- those are still immature in the sense that we haven't pulled them through to the potential that they have and excited about Pete's leadership there given his understanding of both Commercial and the Government business and the opportunities that exist. So thanks for the question. Again, we think it's a really strong future growth opportunity for us."

They are not going to be material drivers of their own. But what they do is that they represent the ability for us to continue to penetrate that pipeline that we have with our Commercial customers. 
So as you know, our strategy has always been to be able to penetrate the inherent commercial pipeline that we have so that we're able to keep members Blue for life. 
And what we've done in terms of that third quarter is to have a very robust pipeline that gives us some very nice sized group, certainly much smaller than anything you've seen around City of New York or anything else, but they are not going to be material drivers and fit, I would say, very closely with what we consider the sweet spot when we look at the opportunities to grow MA going forward. 
We still consider this a very strategic asset for us and being able to grow that business as we go forward. Once again, we are very poised to deliver on the launch of the City of New York business for 1/1/'22 and are certainly pleased with the opportunity to be able to continue to support New York retirees who have been customers for Empire for a long period of time.

Clearly, across all labor markets, people are seeing pressure on the ability to get employment levels up to where they need to, and then there is some pressure. 
In terms of our negotiated contracts, we do those over a 3-year cycle, and we're also very focused again on value-based payments. So I think the big opportunity is to move away from individual unit cost increases, which has been the historical, I guess, trend in the industry to really bundling value-based payment, paying for episodes and procedures, and that's really where we've been. 
So at this stage, what I'd say is, look, we're always in a dynamic environment in terms of our negotiation, but we feel we've factored that into how we're looking at the forward view of everything that's going on. And we do see the biggest opportunity is not just only managing unit costs but really managing value in part of the value-based payment, because there's a much better alignment of taking -- doing the right services at the right time, and that's our view.

We're pleased to talk with you about another strong quarter. 
This morning, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.13 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, ahead of expectations, despite another surge in COVID that created challenges throughout the country.  
Once again, Anthem continues to deliver on stakeholder commitments, accelerate growth in every core benefits business and made considerable progress towards our long-term strategy to transform from a health benefit company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. 
Addressing the whole person is essential to becoming a trusted lifetime partner in health. Responding to the pandemic has allowed us to instill new agility and innovation into the business, particularly around solutions for physical health, pharmacy, behavioral and social needs, with an emphasis on maternal health, access to nutritious foods and health disparities. Ultimately, we believe we're only as healthy as the communities we live in and recognize our important role in ensuring everyone has an opportunity to be and stay healthy.  
As the health care paradigm shifts, we're accelerating work to simplify members' and clients' everyday experiences and meet their evolving needs through a personalized experience. Moreover, there's abundant opportunity to modernize further and reinforce our position, leveraging our technology, predictive analytics and innovative products and services to bring an enhanced experience only Anthem can offer. 
We expect whole person health care, powered by digital technologies, to help us achieve our goal of driving commercial medical cost trend down towards the rate of CPI by 2025. Currently, we're exploring more ways to drive differentiated value across medical and pharmacy.  
Our insight-driven approach is fueling new programs that drive better cost and quality outcomes for our members, including in the areas of behavioral health and autoimmune disease. 
Additionally, we recently launched a new offering to test the full suite of our capabilities in the form of a virtual primary care first product, which we expect to demonstrate meaningful reductions in overall cost of care and greater member satisfaction. 
We are already selling virtual-first risk-based commercial plans in certain markets across each of Anthem's 14 Blue states for the 2022 plan year, featuring simplified plan designs, 24/7 service and leveraging our high-performing networks that enable affordable price points. 
We've also seen strong interest in these capabilities from our fee-based clients, and we'll be embedding virtual primary care with several large fee-based clients throughout 2022. 
At the same time, innovative product offerings like Sydney Preferred, which allows employers to customize a digital-first health care experience for their employees, are gaining considerable momentum. To date, more than 50 national accounts have signed up for Sydney Preferred, representing nearly 900,000 commercial members.  
To help accelerate our digital platform, we've elevated Rajeev Ronanki to President of Digital Platform. Rajeev will drive the commercialization of our digital capabilities for consumers and care providers as we reimagine the health ecosystem. 
We will share notable third quarter highlights and business-driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021 starting with our Medicaid business, which is performing well. Our Healthy Blue plan, in partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, has quickly become the largest Medicaid-managed care plan by membership in North Carolina and the leading choice for consumers. 
Its success, coupled with the ongoing suspension of eligibility redetermination, drove Anthem's total Medicaid membership above 10 million at quarter end, exceeding our internal expectations. Our commitment to members and their communities has never been stronger, and we continue to develop innovative solutions to meet their unique holistic health needs.  
As a result, our focus on reducing health disparities and inequities remains vital to the value Anthem offers state partners. This is reflected in our momentum, along with our 100% RFP win rate year-to-date. Looking further ahead, Anthem will launch another new statewide Medicaid-managed care contract in Ohio in the summer of 2022.  
After earning the city of New York's group Medicare Advantage contract last quarter, we added several new group MA customers in the third quarter for January 1, 2022, start date and have a growing pipeline of new prospects. As part of our strategy to deepen our Medicare Advantage market penetration, we remain focused on converting commercial age out to MA relationships and preparing for a flawless January launch of our group Medicare Advantage plan for New York City's retirees.  
Customized solutions at scale underpin our approach to individual Medicare Advantage benefits for 2022. Many of our MA plans will allow customers to choose what's best for them from a menu of innovative whole health benefit. For example, in some areas, the program will include a Kroger grocery cart; generous over-the-counter benefits; and up to 60 hours of in-home support to assist with light housekeeping, errands and companionship. We expect these and other benefit enhancements to help drive another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership next year.  
Medicare Star Ratings continue to be a focused area across Anthem, and the ratings released 2 weeks ago show we've made solid progress. We're particularly proud, HealthSun received a 5-star rating for the fifth consecutive year, the only Medicare Advantage health plan in Florida to accomplish such an achievement.  
For the 2023 payment year, we anticipate approximately 73% of members and plans that CMS rated as 4-plus stars, up from 58% on a comparable basis a year ago. That figure will move even higher with the city of New York's group Medicare Advantage contract launch next year.  
At the same time, investments in provider partnerships are accelerating Anthem's evolution toward high-quality value-based care. This is necessary to drive improved outcomes and cost of care across all of our benefits businesses and is critical in Medicare Advantage, where it impacts reimbursement through STAR ratings. 
This year, more than 60% of our Medicare Advantage spending will be in risk-sharing arrangements. Based on our current contract, we expect that to increase to more than 70% in 2022, with approximately 30% of Medicare Advantage spending in fully capitated risk arrangements. 
Investments in our primary care partnerships, in particular, will support members and drive growth through the expansion of value-based care, leading to an even larger proportion of our members in 4-plus star contracts over time.  
We recognize there's still more work to do, and we'll continue our efforts to raise customer satisfaction by aligning incentives with care providers to improve quality and medication adherence, while simultaneously enhancing our member experience, accelerating our use of data and analytics and leveraging IngenioRx as our pharmacy benefit manager.  
Lastly, a few highlights of the strong growth we see in our commercial business. We're nearing the end of the most robust national account selling season in Anthem's history. Volume of RFPs was down, but average size was up considerably, and we won a disproportionate share of new business and expanded services with our existing clients. 
IngenioRx is also showing exciting growth with a more than fivefold increase in new sales at this point in the selling season compared to the relatively depressed base a year ago when the pandemic weighed heavily on employer decision-making.  
The consistent theme across all of our businesses is that each continues to produce strong organic growth. This drove medical enrollment to more than 45 million U.S. consumers, strengthening Anthem's position as the largest health insurer in America by membership. 
I'm pleased with the progress we're making towards delivering our strategy and want to share 2 recent leadership changes to accelerate our efforts. Pete Haytaian will lead our Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx, both of which are critical components of our growth strategy. Pete has an impressive track record of growth and innovation in his previous roles leading Anthem's Commercial and Government businesses. With Pete's transition, we're confident our Commercial & Specialty Business division will maintain its strong momentum under leadership of Morgan Kendrick, who's driven market-leading growth across critical lines of our Commercial business, including national accounts and, most recently, as President of Anthem's Commercial West market, our largest region.  
The breadth and depth of our collective leadership ensures we stand ready to deliver on our promises to stakeholders across all areas of our business and will guide Anthem to long-term sustainable growth. It's a privilege to work alongside such a strong group of leaders committed to advancing our purpose and mission.  
In summary, our actions and the focus and discipline we've brought to the business have positioned Anthem for the next several years of growth. Our strategy to extend our role from a partner in health benefit to a lifetime trusted partner in health is resonating in the marketplace as evidenced by our growth. 
Our response to COVID brings a new level of agility and speed to the business, along with more opportunities to reach consumers and care providers than ever before, and we continue to simplify and personalize our member relationships with relevant benefits and enhanced innovative experiences where and when they want.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results in more detail."
160077,701419955,2408067,"Anthem, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Elevance Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, an increase of approximately 62% year-over-year driven by strong growth across all of our businesses. T",1272,"Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. 
As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, an increase of approximately 62% year-over-year driven by strong growth across all of our businesses. This growth was a result of focused execution against our strategic priorities, despite a challenging backdrop created by another surge in COVID.  
Our third quarter results once again demonstrate the balance and resilience of our core benefit businesses and the strong growth momentum we are producing across the board. 
We ended the quarter with 45.1 million members, growth of 2.4 million lives year-over-year, or 5.7%, including growth of 730,000 during the quarter, led by the successful launch of our HealthyBlue Medicaid plan in North Carolina.  
In addition to the 426,000 members gained in that state, we produced incremental organic growth of nearly 380,000 members during the quarter driven by strong growth in our Medicaid and commercial risk-based businesses. This growth was partially offset by continued in-group attrition in our group fee-based business, consistent with our expectations.  
Operating revenue in the third quarter was $35.5 billion, an increase of 16% versus prior year quarter and nearly 18% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The increase was driven by higher premium revenue associated with strong membership growth in our Medicaid, Medicare and commercial risk businesses as well as rate increases to cover cost trends and ongoing momentum in our diversified service businesses, including IngenioRx.  
The benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 87.7%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior year quarter driven by the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Excluding the impact of the HIF, our medical loss ratio would have decreased by approximately 50 basis points driven by unfavorable rate adjustments in our Medicaid business in the third quarter of 2020. 
All in, the cost of care was above what we would consider to be normalized or baseline levels in the third quarter of this year driven by higher COVID cost in the month of August and September, but medical costs were nonetheless better than we had expected for the quarter overall, with lower non-COVID utilization helping absorb the higher-than-expected COVID-related cost.  
Our third quarter SG&A ratio was 11.1%, a decrease of 620 basis points from the 17.3% in the prior year quarter primarily due to the charges we took last year related to business optimization and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association litigation settlement. 
Excluding charges from the base year and the impact of the repeal of the health insurance tax, our SG&A ratio would have decreased by approximately 130 basis points driven by leverage associated with growth in operating revenue, partially offset by higher spending to support our growth and our transition to becoming a digital enterprise for health.  
Operating cash flow during the quarter was $2.5 billion or 1.7x net income.  
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9%, down approximately 100 basis points from the 39.9% as of the end of the second quarter. The decrease was driven by growth in shareholders' equity associated with our earnings in the quarter and a reduction in commercial paper outstanding. 
We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves given the ongoing uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and lengthening and cycle times that we have seen since the pandemic began.  
We ended the third quarter with 46.8 days in claims payable, a decrease of 1.3 days compared to the second quarter and an increase of 5.7 days as compared to the prior year quarter. 
The timing of our acquisition of MMM inflated days in claims payable in the second quarter and drove the sequential change. Excluding timing and related impacts associated with the acquisition, our days in claims payable would have increased by 0.2 days sequentially.  
Given strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.85 from greater than $25.50, putting us at the high end of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%. 
Please note that this guidance continues to reflect the total COVID and non-COVID costs combined exceeding baseline in every month of the fourth quarter and assumes a similar overall net headwind from COVID for the year relative to our prior guidance.  
Given significant outperformance in the third quarter on our investment income line, we have increased our full year outlook for investment income by $100 million to approximately $1.2 billion, which is $260 million above our initial outlook of $940 million. 
Much of the outperformance in this area stems from stellar results in our alternative investment portfolio year-to-date that we would not expect to recur. Accordingly, we believe that there is at least $200 million of nonrecurring upside in the investment income line that should be removed when assessing the appropriate base for earnings growth for 2022, equating to approximately $0.65 of earnings per share in 2021 and implying a baseline for growth entering 2022 of $25.20.  
Most importantly, our businesses are performing well with strong growth momentum that we expect will carry into 2022. Although we will not provide specific guidance for next year on this call, I would now like to shift focus to the tailwinds and headwinds that we are considering into next year.  
Starting with the tailwinds. Recall that our 2021 guidance continues to embed a significant net headwind related to the effects of COVID. While it is too early to declare how much of the overall net headwind we will be able to earn back in 2022, we do believe that we will recover a portion of it, resulting in a year-over-year tailwind. 
Based on our strong competitive positioning, we expect another year of double-digit membership growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership. We also expect strong growth in our Commercial membership, aided by what is shaping up to be the strongest national account selling season in the history of the company.  
We expect accretion from the annualization of earnings of our acquisitions of MMM and myNEXUS. And we expect an EPS lift from our share repurchase program, which was opportunistic during recent periods of volatility in our stock price. 
Our tailwinds will be weighed against known headwinds, and these include: the dilution associated with the first year of operations of our new group Medicare Advantage contract serving New York City's retirees, which we continue to expect will launch on January 1; as well as dilution related to the start-up and launch of our new Medicaid contract in Ohio, which we expect to begin on July 1, 2022; in addition, the resumption of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations assuming a return to a more normal operating environment; and finally, the nonrecurrence of the upside in the investment income line this year that I had described earlier.  
Based on what we know today, we believe our tailwinds will largely offset our headwinds, enabling us to reaffirm our commitment to growth in adjusted earnings per share of at least 12% in 2022 after adjusting for the portion of investment income that we have identified as nonrecurring. 
We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call when we will discuss our 2022 outlook in more detail.  
In closing, we continue to execute against our strategic growth priorities and are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong growth and continued reinvestment in our business, all while maintaining a solid balance sheet given the ongoing uncertainties associated with the pandemic.  
And with that, operator, please open the line to questions."

Associated with the various lines of business, the Commercial profitability is still very, very good. However, Commercial had the surge of COVID in August and September, was really more significantly pronounced within the Commercial line of business than it was in the other 2 lines of business. We took the opportunity to reserve prudently within the Commercial line for that spike and to build Commercial reserves as a result of what we're seeing at that point in time. Fortunately, non-COVID came in much lower in September across all lines of business, which allowed our quarter to come out in a really, really good place.
Medicare was very much consistent with expectations. Medicaid was actually a little bit better than expectations for the quarter. And just as a reminder, we had guided to be above baseline cost for COVID and non-COVID combined for each of the 3 months in the third quarter, and we were. We were just ended up being better than our expectations. So -- but the Commercial issue was really had to do with the spike in August associated with COVID. Thank you for the question."

And I do want to thank Gail and the team for putting me in this position. I do think I'm in a unique position having run Government and Commercial to have a perspective on this. And I think working collectively as an enterprise, we can do very well in penetrating the Anthem portfolio to a much greater degree.  
But as it relates to your question on Ingenio and growth in Ingenio, we work very closely with the Commercial business. And as we've talked about before, the greatest opportunity for us is penetrating the self-funded business. 
I'd say that activity for us has really picked up this year relative to last year. We're seeing really nice success, Lance, down market on the smaller side of the business and the middle market. So we're definitely seeing more activity there, and we're also seeing a lot more wins from that perspective.  
And as we've talked about, that's really a sweet spot from a financial and profitability perspective for us, so it's a really good position for us to be in.  
On the larger end of the market with some of the jumbo accounts, we are also seeing activity pick up as it relates to pharmacy, but it is a competitive space, and we see the power of incumbency being a little more significant and a factor there.  
So heading into 2022, as it relates to Ingenio, we feel really good about our growth trajectory and our performance, and net membership growth will be improved relative to what we've seen in 2021.  
As it relates to the Diversified Business Group and our strategies, and then I'll also talk strategically about Ingenio a bit, I'm really excited about where we are. I mean, if you think about where the puck is going in health care, you think about the significance of specialty pharmacy, you heard Gail talk earlier about virtual and the opportunities for virtual even in pharmacy, there's tremendous opportunity for that business to continue to grow. We're at the beginning of the evolution of, I think, that pharmacy business, and there's a great opportunity there for us and to penetrate the Anthem business.  
And then as it relates to the DBG portfolio, if you think about the verticals that we talked about at Investor Day and the opportunity there, a tremendous opportunity. So you think about behavioral health and the opportunities there with Beacon as a leading asset in the space, and we think there's tremendous opportunity to grow that business and diversify that business.  
When you think about site of care and redirection, it becomes hugely important as it relates to the Commercial business and cost of care. And you think about assets like AIM and myNEXUS, a recent transaction where we're seeing tremendous success. And then you think about managing the chronically ill and the great assets we have there around CareMore and Aspire, I would say this, Lance, that my -- and I've only been on the job for about 1.5 weeks, so I don't want to be too presumptuous here. 
But the opportunity to penetrate Anthem is very significant across our entire portfolio, Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial. But I also think there's tremendous external opportunity. So I look forward to leading this and working with my colleague, Felicia and Morgan, on growing the business together."

There was a lot there, and when you talk about your comments about the reductions in the large group business, that's certainly in line with our expectations. We were expecting reduction on our fee-based business.  
We've had, as you indicated, noted, nice growth on the risk-based business across the segment. Individual, as you've noted, has benefited from a long extending special enrollment period, so we've seen month-over-month growth there. 
Also when you look at our large group, small group business, we've seen month-over-month growth in sales exceeding lapses. And notably, our large group business has performed quite well. In fact, 23 of the last 25 quarters, our sales have exceeded lapses.  
Looking forward into the new year, clearly, it's a competitive geography and a competitive market when you look at individual in ACA. It's one of those that I would characterize as just rational nonetheless and one that we've -- not inconsistent with our strategies in the past. 
We take a very disciplined approach. We look at this market by market, county by county. And in fact, as we expand next year for 2022, we're going to be in 83% of the counties that we can serve. That's up from 71% from the prior year. 
And this is most notably done by leveraging our unique provider partnerships, leveraging the scale and density we have in our geographies to provide value for the market. Again, the strategy is not a shortsighted one, and we're confident the pricing is appropriate on our modeling of our forward trends. So thank you again for the question."

I think it's actually a really important one as we think about the next generation of where products are going to go. One of the things that's happened is the pandemic has really highlighted the need for these virtual care services.  
We shared with you quite some time ago our JV with Hydrogen Health, and we've been in the market actually working closely with our partners to deliver those services, particularly best-in-class urgent care, primary care using chat and text. 
And what we're talking about now is, I'll call it, the next generation of virtual primary care. We've gotten some experience on our early entree with virtual care over the last year. And now we're continuing to evolve that. So we did launch, as I shared in my remarks, this virtual-first services. 
I think what's interesting and unique about this is they're integrated with our high-performance network, and that's really important. And we're seeing a lot of traction in our high-performance network. 
And I know we've shared previously, our high-performance network has anywhere from 12% to 15% cost structure differential. And as you think about virtual primary care added to that, we expect those to sort of be the starting point of what we can gain traction on. So I'm really encouraged by this initial launch. We're going to continue to, I think, innovate and evolve from that.  
In terms of where we're doing it, we are working in our Blue states. We're in -- most of our markets right now, we have offerings, not in every county, but we're going to continue to expand that as we certainly learn about it, look at the alignment. A lot of this does, as I said, rely on our high-performing networks and our ability to use both virtual care as well as our high-performing networks.  
And just to give you a sense of what it is, I mean, we're looking at the offering to cover virtual visits with a zero co-pay simplified plan design, 24/7 service to leverage the network. Value-based contracts are at the core of this to drive that cost structure differential. And again, we would expect at least 15% below traditional products. But again, that's a starting point, and we're going to gain experience with this.  
And there's been a lot of interest. We've seen a significant amount of interest. We've offered it first in our fully insured risk-based business. And now our national fee accounts are interested in embedding this in their offerings. 
And as you heard I think from my opening comments and then what Morgan said, we've had one of our strongest ever national account selling seasons. And again, I do credit the innovation we're bringing around digital to the success we're having there and just a fundamentally strong differentiated cost structure really driven by high-performance networks. 
So thanks for the question. We are excited and optimistic about how we think that this can drive future trend and future opportunities for our clients. So again, more to come on this, but you'll be hearing a lot more about it in the coming months as we gain more traction with our employers. So thanks for the question."

And then on the Medicaid side of the house, you did mention redeterminations as a headwind. But we certainly note for you and across the board, that seems to be a population that's not just vaccine hesitant, but utilization hesitant, and the MLRs look really strong there. 
So I was thinking there could be headwind, not just on redetermination, but on margin as well. So just wanted some color on those 2 things."

With the special enrollment period and the exchanges, we have talked about the fact that exchanges are a nice strategy for us. We're being very, very prudent in terms of our approach. We're going from having, I think, just a little bit over 70% of our counties covered to just over 80% of our counties covered next year. 
And we do expect some nice membership growth associated with the individual. But I would say that is all captured in just our core underlying growth and the fundamentals of the business performing extremely well. We expect all of our businesses to grow, and individual is no different.  
In terms of the Medicaid and the redeterminations, the headwind that we referenced really has to do with Medicaid membership, but this is my opportunity to again talk about the balance and resilience of our membership and our catcher's mit. 
And we may be able to turn that headwind into a tailwind depending on where those folks go. We do believe that once redeterminations start that we will be able to maintain a significant amount of that membership within an Anthem product. 
We offer a product for every American in every situation. Young, old, rich, poor, sick, healthy, we have a product for all of them. And right now, there's a significant number of members within our Medicaid plans. 
And after redetermination occurs, Medicaid may shrink a little bit, but that means that there's really some significant growth opportunities in other lines of business. 
So I didn't spike it out specifically because we think it's a driver, and we could actually turn a headwind into a tailwind. So thank you for the question."

So as it relates to some of the services from mild, moderate to acute mental health, treatment for family support, crisis prevention, opioid abuse, SMI, EAP programs, it's a broad portfolio, which really will serve, I think, Anthem really well. 
The other thing I'll say, and this was very important to us and really worked out from a strategic perspective, but the pandemic obviously really accentuated the need for behavioral health. We experienced 3x more people reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression in this period, 2.5x more people reporting suicidal ideation. And with opioid abuse, there was a very significant increase. And so that plays really well across our portfolio. 
We obviously have a broad portfolio across Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial. The integration process is going really well between the parties. We actually, as it relates to penetrating the Anthem business, have embraced a lot of the clinical programs and expertise of Beacon as we integrate. 
We also, in my old life, on the Commercial side, worked on new product offerings, a product called [ Behavioral Health Advantage ], which is being deployed in 2022. And then obviously, as it relates to our Government program business, working very closely with Felicia and the Government team and the Medicare team on a post-acute care product. 
And this is just the beginning. I think there'll continue to be tremendous opportunities around behavioral. One of the areas that I'm very focused on is also virtual and the importance of virtual. We've seen an exponential increase in virtual services as it relates to Beacon, and penetrating our portfolio in that regard will become very important going forward. I appreciate the question."

October is relatively close to expectations at this point, but there's a lot of uncertainties in the fourth quarter. 
The Delta variant is still out there, and we want to be very respectful for it as well as any other new variants that may or may not exist. And we are expecting an increase in testing, an increase in some of the vaccinations and booster shots, especially with the kids. 
It's unclear right now exactly when the 5-year-olds will be eligible for vaccination, but we want to make sure that we're cautious in terms of our guidance associated with that cost structure as well.

It's very early in the rating season, but we're comfortable with what we're seeing to date in building our financial plan with the prudent assumptions that we believe are well supported. And the states are very -- let's say we're having some very productive conversations with the states as well about ensuring that we get actuarially justified rates throughout the future. 
The only other thing I'll say about the Medicaid is there are a lot of financial measures that are in place now that far more than used to be in place in terms of collars, corridors and things like that, that really help maintain the profitability and maintain the stability of that marketplace. So really need to look at Medicaid over a long period of time. Thank you, Kevin."

I'm wondering if you could shine maybe a brighter light on how your investments in behavioral and digital and some of the other areas that you've mentioned kind of accelerate your strategy and drive better return for Anthem, then the possibility of owning and controlling some of your key providers. Just I'm sure that those others are high return, but in what way are they for Anthem?"

A couple of things. I think you hit on many of the core drivers. 
First and foremost, as we've said, because of the density that we have in our markets, we believe that investing in partnerships makes the most sense because we believe we can drive better membership, better Stars ratings. And with 1 in 8 patients being an Anthem member, the density of working with those providers provides us a good return. 
And also remember, we can participate in the profit stream there by embedding some of our DBG assets, our other assets around IngenioRx. And so it's not that we're walking away from participating in those profit streams. We actually think we have a much more capitally efficient use by investing, partnering and then pulling through the other assets that we have invested in. 
And so that's the core of our strategy, and it's worked really well. And we're continuing to accelerate that strategy. And as I shared, we expect to have 70% in value-based arrangements, 30% in full-capitated arrangements. It's a big driver for our Medicare Advantage business. But quite frankly, all of our benefits businesses are going to have an opportunity there. 
In terms of other areas that we're investing in, we've said that we really want to transform ourselves, and part of that transformation is building this digital platform for health. The opportunities are inside of Anthem as well as with our Blue partners. And we see, again, opportunities to commercialize that. That's going to be over the next several years. 
One of the reasons I elevated Rajeev Ronanki, who has been leading this area, is to really explore those opportunities. Again, we've been doing that inside of Anthem, but we think there's an opportunity with our partners to do more areas around Sydney, for example, Sydney Health, which is gaining great traction; our Health OS, which we think could be a broader opportunity for the health ecosystem. 
We've done quite a bit of investment in Stars and HEDIS quality improvement in AI and analytics, digital therapeutics. So there's a broad range of things around the digital capabilities and ecosystem we're building. 
But in terms of the value, again, we look at the most efficient way to deploy our capital, where we have our strengths, which is the density in the markets we serve and how it fills, I think, our strategy and then how we pull through Ingenio, DBG and other services, which really are not -- those are still immature in the sense that we haven't pulled them through to the potential that they have, and excited about Pete's leadership there given his understanding of both Commercial and the Government business and the opportunities that exist. 
So thanks for the question. Again, we think it's a really strong future growth opportunity for us."

They are not going to be material drivers of their own, but what they do is that they represent the ability for us to continue to penetrate that pipeline that we have with our Commercial customers. So as you know, our strategy has always been to be able to penetrate the inherent Commercial pipeline that we have, so that we're able to keep members Blue for life. 
And what we've done in terms of that third quarter is to have a very robust pipeline that gives us some very nice sized group, certainly much smaller than anything you've seen around City of New York or anything else. But they are not going to be material drivers and fit, I would say, very closely with what we consider the sweet spot when we look at the opportunities to grow MA going forward. 
We still consider this a very strategic asset for us and being able to grow that business as we go forward. Once again, we are very poised to deliver on the launch of the City of New York business for 1/1/22 and are certainly pleased with the opportunity to be able to continue to support New York retirees who have been customers for Empire for a long period of time. 
So this is another, I would say, affirmation of our strategy around what we're doing with respect to group MA business. And additionally, the pipeline for this business remains strong as we head into 2023.

The first one around the labor market, clearly, across all labor markets, people are seeing pressure on the ability to get employment levels up to where they need to, and then there is some pressure. 
In terms of our negotiated contracts, we do those over 3-year cycles, and we're also very focused again on value-based payments. So I think the big opportunity is to move away from individual unit cost increases, which has been the historical, I guess, trend in the industry to really bundling value-based payment, paying for episodes and procedures, and that's really where we've been. 
So at this stage, what I'd say is, look, we're always in a dynamic environment in terms of our negotiation, but we feel we've factored that into how we're looking at the forward view of everything that's going on. 
And we do see the biggest opportunity is not just only managing unit costs, but really managing value in part of the value-based payment because there's a much better alignment of taking -- doing the right services at the right time, and that's our view.

This morning, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.13 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, ahead of expectations, despite another surge in COVID that created challenges throughout the country.  
Once again, Anthem continues to deliver on stakeholder commitments, accelerate growth in every core benefits business and made considerable progress towards our long-term strategy to transform from a health benefit company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. 
Addressing the whole person is essential to becoming a trusted lifetime partner in health. Responding to the pandemic has allowed us to instill new agility and innovation into the business, particularly around solutions for physical health, pharmacy, behavioral and social needs, with an emphasis on maternal health, access to nutritious foods and health disparities. Ultimately, we believe we're only as healthy as the communities we live in and recognize our important role in ensuring everyone has an opportunity to be and stay healthy.  
As the health care paradigm shifts, we're accelerating work to simplify members' and clients' everyday experiences and meet their evolving needs through a personalized experience. Moreover, there's abundant opportunity to modernize further and reinforce our position, leveraging our technology, predictive analytics and innovative products and services to bring an enhanced experience only Anthem can offer. 
We expect whole person health care, powered by digital technologies, to help us achieve our goal of driving commercial medical cost trend down towards the rate of CPI by 2025. Currently, we're exploring more ways to drive differentiated value across medical and pharmacy.  
Our insight-driven approach is fueling new programs that drive better cost and quality outcomes for our members, including in the areas of behavioral health and autoimmune disease. 
Additionally, we recently launched a new offering to test the full suite of our capabilities in the form of a virtual primary care first product, which we expect to demonstrate meaningful reductions in overall cost of care and greater member satisfaction. 
We are already selling virtual-first risk-based commercial plans in certain markets across each of Anthem's 14 Blue states for the 2022 plan year, featuring simplified plan designs, 24/7 service and leveraging our high-performing networks that enable affordable price points. 
We've also seen strong interest in these capabilities from our fee-based clients, and we'll be embedding virtual primary care with several large fee-based clients throughout 2022. 
At the same time, innovative product offerings like Sydney Preferred, which allows employers to customize a digital-first health care experience for their employees, are gaining considerable momentum. To date, more than 50 national accounts have signed up for Sydney Preferred, representing nearly 900,000 commercial members.  
To help accelerate our digital platform, we've elevated Rajeev Ronanki to President of Digital Platform. Rajeev will drive the commercialization of our digital capabilities for consumers and care providers as we reimagine the health ecosystem. 
We will share notable third quarter highlights and business-driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021 starting with our Medicaid business, which is performing well. Our Healthy Blue plan, in partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, has quickly become the largest Medicaid-managed care plan by membership in North Carolina and the leading choice for consumers. 
Its success, coupled with the ongoing suspension of eligibility redetermination, drove Anthem's total Medicaid membership above 10 million at quarter end, exceeding our internal expectations. Our commitment to members and their communities has never been stronger, and we continue to develop innovative solutions to meet their unique holistic health needs.  
As a result, our focus on reducing health disparities and inequities remains vital to the value Anthem offers state partners. This is reflected in our momentum, along with our 100% RFP win rate year-to-date. Looking further ahead, Anthem will launch another new statewide Medicaid-managed care contract in Ohio in the summer of 2022.  
After earning the city of New York's group Medicare Advantage contract last quarter, we added several new group MA customers in the third quarter for January 1, 2022, start date and have a growing pipeline of new prospects. As part of our strategy to deepen our Medicare Advantage market penetration, we remain focused on converting commercial age out to MA relationships and preparing for a flawless January launch of our group Medicare Advantage plan for New York City's retirees.  
Customized solutions at scale underpin our approach to individual Medicare Advantage benefits for 2022. Many of our MA plans will allow customers to choose what's best for them from a menu of innovative whole health benefit. For example, in some areas, the program will include a Kroger grocery cart; generous over-the-counter benefits; and up to 60 hours of in-home support to assist with light housekeeping, errands and companionship. We expect these and other benefit enhancements to help drive another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership next year.  
Medicare Star Ratings continue to be a focused area across Anthem, and the ratings released 2 weeks ago show we've made solid progress. We're particularly proud, HealthSun received a 5-star rating for the fifth consecutive year, the only Medicare Advantage health plan in Florida to accomplish such an achievement.  
For the 2023 payment year, we anticipate approximately 73% of members and plans that CMS rated as 4-plus stars, up from 58% on a comparable basis a year ago. That figure will move even higher with the city of New York's group Medicare Advantage contract launch next year.  
At the same time, investments in provider partnerships are accelerating Anthem's evolution toward high-quality value-based care. This is necessary to drive improved outcomes and cost of care across all of our benefits businesses and is critical in Medicare Advantage, where it impacts reimbursement through STAR ratings. 
This year, more than 60% of our Medicare Advantage spending will be in risk-sharing arrangements. Based on our current contract, we expect that to increase to more than 70% in 2022, with approximately 30% of Medicare Advantage spending in fully capitated risk arrangements. 
Investments in our primary care partnerships, in particular, will support members and drive growth through the expansion of value-based care, leading to an even larger proportion of our members in 4-plus star contracts over time.  
We recognize there's still more work to do, and we'll continue our efforts to raise customer satisfaction by aligning incentives with care providers to improve quality and medication adherence, while simultaneously enhancing our member experience, accelerating our use of data and analytics and leveraging IngenioRx as our pharmacy benefit manager.  
Lastly, a few highlights of the strong growth we see in our commercial business. We're nearing the end of the most robust national account selling season in Anthem's history. Volume of RFPs was down, but average size was up considerably, and we won a disproportionate share of new business and expanded services with our existing clients. 
IngenioRx is also showing exciting growth with a more than fivefold increase in new sales at this point in the selling season compared to the relatively depressed base a year ago when the pandemic weighed heavily on employer decision-making.  
The consistent theme across all of our businesses is that each continues to produce strong organic growth. This drove medical enrollment to more than 45 million U.S. consumers, strengthening Anthem's position as the largest health insurer in America by membership. 
I'm pleased with the progress we're making towards delivering our strategy and want to share 2 recent leadership changes to accelerate our efforts. Pete Haytaian will lead our Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx, both of which are critical components of our growth strategy. Pete has an impressive track record of growth and innovation in his previous roles leading Anthem's Commercial and Government businesses. With Pete's transition, we're confident our Commercial & Specialty Business division will maintain its strong momentum under leadership of Morgan Kendrick, who's driven market-leading growth across critical lines of our Commercial business, including national accounts and, most recently, as President of Anthem's Commercial West market, our largest region.  
The breadth and depth of our collective leadership ensures we stand ready to deliver on our promises to stakeholders across all areas of our business and will guide Anthem to long-term sustainable growth. It's a privilege to work alongside such a strong group of leaders committed to advancing our purpose and mission.  
In summary, our actions and the focus and discipline we've brought to the business have positioned Anthem for the next several years of growth. Our strategy to extend our role from a partner in health benefit to a lifetime trusted partner in health is resonating in the marketplace as evidenced by our growth. 
Our response to COVID brings a new level of agility and speed to the business, along with more opportunities to reach consumers and care providers than ever before, and we continue to simplify and personalize our member relationships with relevant benefits and enhanced innovative experiences where and when they want.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results in more detail."
160077,701419955,2417760,"Anthem, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Elevance Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, an increase of approximately 62% year-over-year driven by strong growth across all of our businesses. T",1272,"Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. 
As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, an increase of approximately 62% year-over-year driven by strong growth across all of our businesses. This growth was a result of focused execution against our strategic priorities, despite a challenging backdrop created by another surge in COVID.  
Our third quarter results once again demonstrate the balance and resilience of our core benefit businesses and the strong growth momentum we are producing across the board. 
We ended the quarter with 45.1 million members, growth of 2.4 million lives year-over-year, or 5.7%, including growth of 730,000 during the quarter, led by the successful launch of our HealthyBlue Medicaid plan in North Carolina.  
In addition to the 426,000 members gained in that state, we produced incremental organic growth of nearly 380,000 members during the quarter driven by strong growth in our Medicaid and commercial risk-based businesses. This growth was partially offset by continued in-group attrition in our group fee-based business, consistent with our expectations.  
Operating revenue in the third quarter was $35.5 billion, an increase of 16% versus prior year quarter and nearly 18% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The increase was driven by higher premium revenue associated with strong membership growth in our Medicaid, Medicare and commercial risk businesses as well as rate increases to cover cost trends and ongoing momentum in our diversified service businesses, including IngenioRx.  
The benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 87.7%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior year quarter driven by the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Excluding the impact of the HIF, our medical loss ratio would have decreased by approximately 50 basis points driven by unfavorable rate adjustments in our Medicaid business in the third quarter of 2020. 
All in, the cost of care was above what we would consider to be normalized or baseline levels in the third quarter of this year driven by higher COVID cost in the month of August and September, but medical costs were nonetheless better than we had expected for the quarter overall, with lower non-COVID utilization helping absorb the higher-than-expected COVID-related cost.  
Our third quarter SG&A ratio was 11.1%, a decrease of 620 basis points from the 17.3% in the prior year quarter primarily due to the charges we took last year related to business optimization and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association litigation settlement. 
Excluding charges from the base year and the impact of the repeal of the health insurance tax, our SG&A ratio would have decreased by approximately 130 basis points driven by leverage associated with growth in operating revenue, partially offset by higher spending to support our growth and our transition to becoming a digital enterprise for health.  
Operating cash flow during the quarter was $2.5 billion or 1.7x net income.  
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9%, down approximately 100 basis points from the 39.9% as of the end of the second quarter. The decrease was driven by growth in shareholders' equity associated with our earnings in the quarter and a reduction in commercial paper outstanding. 
We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves given the ongoing uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and lengthening and cycle times that we have seen since the pandemic began.  
We ended the third quarter with 46.8 days in claims payable, a decrease of 1.3 days compared to the second quarter and an increase of 5.7 days as compared to the prior year quarter. 
The timing of our acquisition of MMM inflated days in claims payable in the second quarter and drove the sequential change. Excluding timing and related impacts associated with the acquisition, our days in claims payable would have increased by 0.2 days sequentially.  
Given strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.85 from greater than $25.50, putting us at the high end of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%. 
Please note that this guidance continues to reflect the total COVID and non-COVID costs combined exceeding baseline in every month of the fourth quarter and assumes a similar overall net headwind from COVID for the year relative to our prior guidance.  
Given significant outperformance in the third quarter on our investment income line, we have increased our full year outlook for investment income by $100 million to approximately $1.2 billion, which is $260 million above our initial outlook of $940 million. 
Much of the outperformance in this area stems from stellar results in our alternative investment portfolio year-to-date that we would not expect to recur. Accordingly, we believe that there is at least $200 million of nonrecurring upside in the investment income line that should be removed when assessing the appropriate base for earnings growth for 2022, equating to approximately $0.65 of earnings per share in 2021 and implying a baseline for growth entering 2022 of $25.20.  
Most importantly, our businesses are performing well with strong growth momentum that we expect will carry into 2022. Although we will not provide specific guidance for next year on this call, I would now like to shift focus to the tailwinds and headwinds that we are considering into next year.  
Starting with the tailwinds. Recall that our 2021 guidance continues to embed a significant net headwind related to the effects of COVID. While it is too early to declare how much of the overall net headwind we will be able to earn back in 2022, we do believe that we will recover a portion of it, resulting in a year-over-year tailwind. 
Based on our strong competitive positioning, we expect another year of double-digit membership growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership. We also expect strong growth in our Commercial membership, aided by what is shaping up to be the strongest national account selling season in the history of the company.  
We expect accretion from the annualization of earnings of our acquisitions of MMM and myNEXUS. And we expect an EPS lift from our share repurchase program, which was opportunistic during recent periods of volatility in our stock price. 
Our tailwinds will be weighed against known headwinds, and these include: the dilution associated with the first year of operations of our new group Medicare Advantage contract serving New York City's retirees, which we continue to expect will launch on January 1; as well as dilution related to the start-up and launch of our new Medicaid contract in Ohio, which we expect to begin on July 1, 2022; in addition, the resumption of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations assuming a return to a more normal operating environment; and finally, the nonrecurrence of the upside in the investment income line this year that I had described earlier.  
Based on what we know today, we believe our tailwinds will largely offset our headwinds, enabling us to reaffirm our commitment to growth in adjusted earnings per share of at least 12% in 2022 after adjusting for the portion of investment income that we have identified as nonrecurring. 
We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call when we will discuss our 2022 outlook in more detail.  
In closing, we continue to execute against our strategic growth priorities and are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong growth and continued reinvestment in our business, all while maintaining a solid balance sheet given the ongoing uncertainties associated with the pandemic.  
And with that, operator, please open the line to questions."

Associated with the various lines of business, the Commercial profitability is still very, very good. However, Commercial had the surge of COVID in August and September, was really more significantly pronounced within the Commercial line of business than it was in the other 2 lines of business. We took the opportunity to reserve prudently within the Commercial line for that spike and to build Commercial reserves as a result of what we're seeing at that point in time. Fortunately, non-COVID came in much lower in September across all lines of business, which allowed our quarter to come out in a really, really good place.
Medicare was very much consistent with expectations. Medicaid was actually a little bit better than expectations for the quarter. And just as a reminder, we had guided to be above baseline cost for COVID and non-COVID combined for each of the 3 months in the third quarter, and we were. We were just ended up being better than our expectations. So -- but the Commercial issue was really had to do with the spike in August associated with COVID. Thank you for the question."

And I do want to thank Gail and the team for putting me in this position. I do think I'm in a unique position having run Government and Commercial to have a perspective on this. And I think working collectively as an enterprise, we can do very well in penetrating the Anthem portfolio to a much greater degree.  
But as it relates to your question on Ingenio and growth in Ingenio, we work very closely with the Commercial business. And as we've talked about before, the greatest opportunity for us is penetrating the self-funded business. 
I'd say that activity for us has really picked up this year relative to last year. We're seeing really nice success, Lance, down market on the smaller side of the business and the middle market. So we're definitely seeing more activity there, and we're also seeing a lot more wins from that perspective.  
And as we've talked about, that's really a sweet spot from a financial and profitability perspective for us, so it's a really good position for us to be in.  
On the larger end of the market with some of the jumbo accounts, we are also seeing activity pick up as it relates to pharmacy, but it is a competitive space, and we see the power of incumbency being a little more significant and a factor there.  
So heading into 2022, as it relates to Ingenio, we feel really good about our growth trajectory and our performance, and net membership growth will be improved relative to what we've seen in 2021.  
As it relates to the Diversified Business Group and our strategies, and then I'll also talk strategically about Ingenio a bit, I'm really excited about where we are. I mean, if you think about where the puck is going in health care, you think about the significance of specialty pharmacy, you heard Gail talk earlier about virtual and the opportunities for virtual even in pharmacy, there's tremendous opportunity for that business to continue to grow. We're at the beginning of the evolution of, I think, that pharmacy business, and there's a great opportunity there for us and to penetrate the Anthem business.  
And then as it relates to the DBG portfolio, if you think about the verticals that we talked about at Investor Day and the opportunity there, a tremendous opportunity. So you think about behavioral health and the opportunities there with Beacon as a leading asset in the space, and we think there's tremendous opportunity to grow that business and diversify that business.  
When you think about site of care and redirection, it becomes hugely important as it relates to the Commercial business and cost of care. And you think about assets like AIM and myNEXUS, a recent transaction where we're seeing tremendous success. And then you think about managing the chronically ill and the great assets we have there around CareMore and Aspire, I would say this, Lance, that my -- and I've only been on the job for about 1.5 weeks, so I don't want to be too presumptuous here. 
But the opportunity to penetrate Anthem is very significant across our entire portfolio, Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial. But I also think there's tremendous external opportunity. So I look forward to leading this and working with my colleague, Felicia and Morgan, on growing the business together."

There was a lot there, and when you talk about your comments about the reductions in the large group business, that's certainly in line with our expectations. We were expecting reduction on our fee-based business.  
We've had, as you indicated, noted, nice growth on the risk-based business across the segment. Individual, as you've noted, has benefited from a long extending special enrollment period, so we've seen month-over-month growth there. 
Also when you look at our large group, small group business, we've seen month-over-month growth in sales exceeding lapses. And notably, our large group business has performed quite well. In fact, 23 of the last 25 quarters, our sales have exceeded lapses.  
Looking forward into the new year, clearly, it's a competitive geography and a competitive market when you look at individual in ACA. It's one of those that I would characterize as just rational nonetheless and one that we've -- not inconsistent with our strategies in the past. 
We take a very disciplined approach. We look at this market by market, county by county. And in fact, as we expand next year for 2022, we're going to be in 83% of the counties that we can serve. That's up from 71% from the prior year. 
And this is most notably done by leveraging our unique provider partnerships, leveraging the scale and density we have in our geographies to provide value for the market. Again, the strategy is not a shortsighted one, and we're confident the pricing is appropriate on our modeling of our forward trends. So thank you again for the question."

I think it's actually a really important one as we think about the next generation of where products are going to go. One of the things that's happened is the pandemic has really highlighted the need for these virtual care services.  
We shared with you quite some time ago our JV with Hydrogen Health, and we've been in the market actually working closely with our partners to deliver those services, particularly best-in-class urgent care, primary care using chat and text. 
And what we're talking about now is, I'll call it, the next generation of virtual primary care. We've gotten some experience on our early entree with virtual care over the last year. And now we're continuing to evolve that. So we did launch, as I shared in my remarks, this virtual-first services. 
I think what's interesting and unique about this is they're integrated with our high-performance network, and that's really important. And we're seeing a lot of traction in our high-performance network. 
And I know we've shared previously, our high-performance network has anywhere from 12% to 15% cost structure differential. And as you think about virtual primary care added to that, we expect those to sort of be the starting point of what we can gain traction on. So I'm really encouraged by this initial launch. We're going to continue to, I think, innovate and evolve from that.  
In terms of where we're doing it, we are working in our Blue states. We're in -- most of our markets right now, we have offerings, not in every county, but we're going to continue to expand that as we certainly learn about it, look at the alignment. A lot of this does, as I said, rely on our high-performing networks and our ability to use both virtual care as well as our high-performing networks.  
And just to give you a sense of what it is, I mean, we're looking at the offering to cover virtual visits with a zero co-pay simplified plan design, 24/7 service to leverage the network. Value-based contracts are at the core of this to drive that cost structure differential. And again, we would expect at least 15% below traditional products. But again, that's a starting point, and we're going to gain experience with this.  
And there's been a lot of interest. We've seen a significant amount of interest. We've offered it first in our fully insured risk-based business. And now our national fee accounts are interested in embedding this in their offerings. 
And as you heard I think from my opening comments and then what Morgan said, we've had one of our strongest ever national account selling seasons. And again, I do credit the innovation we're bringing around digital to the success we're having there and just a fundamentally strong differentiated cost structure really driven by high-performance networks. 
So thanks for the question. We are excited and optimistic about how we think that this can drive future trend and future opportunities for our clients. So again, more to come on this, but you'll be hearing a lot more about it in the coming months as we gain more traction with our employers. So thanks for the question."

And then on the Medicaid side of the house, you did mention redeterminations as a headwind. But we certainly note for you and across the board, that seems to be a population that's not just vaccine hesitant, but utilization hesitant, and the MLRs look really strong there. 
So I was thinking there could be headwind, not just on redetermination, but on margin as well. So just wanted some color on those 2 things."

With the special enrollment period and the exchanges, we have talked about the fact that exchanges are a nice strategy for us. We're being very, very prudent in terms of our approach. We're going from having, I think, just a little bit over 70% of our counties covered to just over 80% of our counties covered next year. 
And we do expect some nice membership growth associated with the individual. But I would say that is all captured in just our core underlying growth and the fundamentals of the business performing extremely well. We expect all of our businesses to grow, and individual is no different.  
In terms of the Medicaid and the redeterminations, the headwind that we referenced really has to do with Medicaid membership, but this is my opportunity to again talk about the balance and resilience of our membership and our catcher's mit. 
And we may be able to turn that headwind into a tailwind depending on where those folks go. We do believe that once redeterminations start that we will be able to maintain a significant amount of that membership within an Anthem product. 
We offer a product for every American in every situation. Young, old, rich, poor, sick, healthy, we have a product for all of them. And right now, there's a significant number of members within our Medicaid plans. 
And after redetermination occurs, Medicaid may shrink a little bit, but that means that there's really some significant growth opportunities in other lines of business. 
So I didn't spike it out specifically because we think it's a driver, and we could actually turn a headwind into a tailwind. So thank you for the question."

So as it relates to some of the services from mild, moderate to acute mental health, treatment for family support, crisis prevention, opioid abuse, SMI, EAP programs, it's a broad portfolio, which really will serve, I think, Anthem really well. 
The other thing I'll say, and this was very important to us and really worked out from a strategic perspective, but the pandemic obviously really accentuated the need for behavioral health. We experienced 3x more people reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression in this period, 2.5x more people reporting suicidal ideation. And with opioid abuse, there was a very significant increase. And so that plays really well across our portfolio. 
We obviously have a broad portfolio across Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial. The integration process is going really well between the parties. We actually, as it relates to penetrating the Anthem business, have embraced a lot of the clinical programs and expertise of Beacon as we integrate. 
We also, in my old life, on the Commercial side, worked on new product offerings, a product called [ Behavioral Health Advantage ], which is being deployed in 2022. And then obviously, as it relates to our Government program business, working very closely with Felicia and the Government team and the Medicare team on a post-acute care product. 
And this is just the beginning. I think there'll continue to be tremendous opportunities around behavioral. One of the areas that I'm very focused on is also virtual and the importance of virtual. We've seen an exponential increase in virtual services as it relates to Beacon, and penetrating our portfolio in that regard will become very important going forward. I appreciate the question."

October is relatively close to expectations at this point, but there's a lot of uncertainties in the fourth quarter. 
The Delta variant is still out there, and we want to be very respectful for it as well as any other new variants that may or may not exist. And we are expecting an increase in testing, an increase in some of the vaccinations and booster shots, especially with the kids. 
It's unclear right now exactly when the 5-year-olds will be eligible for vaccination, but we want to make sure that we're cautious in terms of our guidance associated with that cost structure as well.

It's very early in the rating season, but we're comfortable with what we're seeing to date in building our financial plan with the prudent assumptions that we believe are well supported. And the states are very -- let's say we're having some very productive conversations with the states as well about ensuring that we get actuarially justified rates throughout the future. 
The only other thing I'll say about the Medicaid is there are a lot of financial measures that are in place now that far more than used to be in place in terms of collars, corridors and things like that, that really help maintain the profitability and maintain the stability of that marketplace. So really need to look at Medicaid over a long period of time. Thank you, Kevin."

I'm wondering if you could shine maybe a brighter light on how your investments in behavioral and digital and some of the other areas that you've mentioned kind of accelerate your strategy and drive better return for Anthem, then the possibility of owning and controlling some of your key providers. Just I'm sure that those others are high return, but in what way are they for Anthem?"

A couple of things. I think you hit on many of the core drivers. 
First and foremost, as we've said, because of the density that we have in our markets, we believe that investing in partnerships makes the most sense because we believe we can drive better membership, better Stars ratings. And with 1 in 8 patients being an Anthem member, the density of working with those providers provides us a good return. 
And also remember, we can participate in the profit stream there by embedding some of our DBG assets, our other assets around IngenioRx. And so it's not that we're walking away from participating in those profit streams. We actually think we have a much more capitally efficient use by investing, partnering and then pulling through the other assets that we have invested in. 
And so that's the core of our strategy, and it's worked really well. And we're continuing to accelerate that strategy. And as I shared, we expect to have 70% in value-based arrangements, 30% in full-capitated arrangements. It's a big driver for our Medicare Advantage business. But quite frankly, all of our benefits businesses are going to have an opportunity there. 
In terms of other areas that we're investing in, we've said that we really want to transform ourselves, and part of that transformation is building this digital platform for health. The opportunities are inside of Anthem as well as with our Blue partners. And we see, again, opportunities to commercialize that. That's going to be over the next several years. 
One of the reasons I elevated Rajeev Ronanki, who has been leading this area, is to really explore those opportunities. Again, we've been doing that inside of Anthem, but we think there's an opportunity with our partners to do more areas around Sydney, for example, Sydney Health, which is gaining great traction; our Health OS, which we think could be a broader opportunity for the health ecosystem. 
We've done quite a bit of investment in Stars and HEDIS quality improvement in AI and analytics, digital therapeutics. So there's a broad range of things around the digital capabilities and ecosystem we're building. 
But in terms of the value, again, we look at the most efficient way to deploy our capital, where we have our strengths, which is the density in the markets we serve and how it fills, I think, our strategy and then how we pull through Ingenio, DBG and other services, which really are not -- those are still immature in the sense that we haven't pulled them through to the potential that they have, and excited about Pete's leadership there given his understanding of both Commercial and the Government business and the opportunities that exist. 
So thanks for the question. Again, we think it's a really strong future growth opportunity for us."

They are not going to be material drivers of their own, but what they do is that they represent the ability for us to continue to penetrate that pipeline that we have with our Commercial customers. So as you know, our strategy has always been to be able to penetrate the inherent Commercial pipeline that we have, so that we're able to keep members Blue for life. 
And what we've done in terms of that third quarter is to have a very robust pipeline that gives us some very nice sized group, certainly much smaller than anything you've seen around City of New York or anything else. But they are not going to be material drivers and fit, I would say, very closely with what we consider the sweet spot when we look at the opportunities to grow MA going forward. 
We still consider this a very strategic asset for us and being able to grow that business as we go forward. Once again, we are very poised to deliver on the launch of the City of New York business for 1/1/22 and are certainly pleased with the opportunity to be able to continue to support New York retirees who have been customers for Empire for a long period of time. 
So this is another, I would say, affirmation of our strategy around what we're doing with respect to group MA business. And additionally, the pipeline for this business remains strong as we head into 2023.

The first one around the labor market, clearly, across all labor markets, people are seeing pressure on the ability to get employment levels up to where they need to, and then there is some pressure. 
In terms of our negotiated contracts, we do those over 3-year cycles, and we're also very focused again on value-based payments. So I think the big opportunity is to move away from individual unit cost increases, which has been the historical, I guess, trend in the industry to really bundling value-based payment, paying for episodes and procedures, and that's really where we've been. 
So at this stage, what I'd say is, look, we're always in a dynamic environment in terms of our negotiation, but we feel we've factored that into how we're looking at the forward view of everything that's going on. 
And we do see the biggest opportunity is not just only managing unit costs, but really managing value in part of the value-based payment because there's a much better alignment of taking -- doing the right services at the right time, and that's our view.
