Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is posted on our website, borgwarner.com on our home page and on our Investor Relations home page. 
With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations home page for a full list.
Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. 
During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes of prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. 
We will also refer to our growth compared to our markets. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus this market. 
Please note that we've posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion.
With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred."

We're very pleased to share our results for 2020 and provide an overall company update. Starting on Slide 5.

We're very pleased to share our results for 2020 and provide an overall company update. 
Starting on Slide 5. I'm very proud with our stronger-than-expected top line and cash flow performance for the year. With approximately $10.2 billion in sales, we were down about 11% organically. This compares to our market being down approximately 17%. 
And so outgrowth was about 630 basis points for the year, which was ahead of our expectations going into the fourth quarter. For the full year, we saw our growth in all major regions. We delivered close to 15% outgrowth in China. Our European and North American operations outgrowth were both in the low single-digit range. 
While our full year earnings per share declined year-over-year due to the impact of COVID-19, our decremental margin performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, our margin performance was achieved while preserving R&D spending to support future growth. 
We delivered very strong free cash flow of $743 million for the year. This represents a record for free cash flow generation for the company. This is a testament to the intense focus we've put on improving free cash flow generation over the last few years. 
While managing the operation the operational challenges of 2020, we successfully completed the largest acquisition in the company's history and secured numerous business award for electrified vehicles over the course of the year. 
Now let's discuss some of those new business awards. First, I'm happy to announce on Slide 6 that we have secured an 800-volt electric motor award, with a global commercial vehicle customer launching in 2024. This program will use 4 different variants of our latest [airplane] motor design. Using our 800 volts rated machine, customers can significantly reduce charging time and achieve a higher power density through the 800-volt architecture, enabling an even brighter future for electric trucks and buses. I am very pleased with this program. We will continue to focus on the electrification opportunities in commercial vehicles in addition to opportunities in our light vehicle market.
Next, I would like to highlight another inverter win on Slide 7. We are partnering with a major European OEM to supply our 400-volt silicon carbide inverter for the next-generation BEVs that are expected to launch in 2022. While I can't share the details of this program, I can tell you that this is our second largest inverter program to date. This illustrates our ongoing innovation in power electronics as we're leading the market trend to upgrade from silicon to silicon carbide. This enables lower energy losses and drives higher efficiency. 
With the latest win, I would like to give you an update of our positioning in the European inverter market on Slide 8. We've had tremendous success establishing ourselves in this market. When I think about BorgWarner's competitive advantages in power electronics, it's driven by first, the breadth of our product portfolio. This allows us to be faster and more effective at bringing products to market. 
Second, our ability to innovate. We continue our innovations in part by our vertical integration strategy. We have in-house capabilities for power modules, integrated circuit development and software. 
I think that the last driver is our ability to leverage the electronic scale that we already have, especially in our engine control unit business. The result is that we've secured significant new business award. 
On the chart on the right side of the slide, you will see the inverter programs we've secured with 3 large European OEs. As you can see, we expect that we'll be delivering around 1.1 million inverters in 2025. 
As a result of the successes we're achieving, we're increasing our R&D spending in 2021 to support our continued innovation and new business awards in our power electronics portfolio. Kevin will touch on that a little later. 
Next, I would like to give you an update on the Delphi Technologies integration on Slide 9. Bottom line, all is on track. 
Starting with Q4 results. The Delphi Technologies contribution to both revenue and operating income was ahead of our expectations. I'm seeing good progress across all the former Delphi businesses. The cost synergies related to the Delphi transaction are tracking in line with our plan, as Kevin will discuss later. 
And the customer feedback remains very positive. In addition to inverter wins that I just highlighted, we won new businesses across the rest of the Delphi portfolio, including awards in GDA. My overall takeaway is that the integration is on track from all perspectives. 
Before I wrap up on Slide 10, we are announcing our plan to hold an upcoming Investor Day on March 23. The event will be virtually broadcasted from the BorgWarner world headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan. It will provide insights into our technologies and into the acceleration of our positioning in an electrified world. I look forward to interacting with you during the event. 
So let me summarize our 2020 results and our outlook on Slide 11. 2020 was an extremely challenging year in terms of the operating environment, and we've put the health and safety of our people first. Even in this challenging environment, we delivered better-than-expected outgrowth and generated record free cash flow, and our bookings on BEVs are accelerating. We closed on the Delphi transaction. We're successfully integrating the companies, and we are on track to deliver the synergies as planned. 
As we look ahead, we expect to deliver another record year of free cash flow in 2021, which enables us to continue to invest in the business to successfully position the company for the future. The demand for our efficiency improving products is growing, leading to a continued increase in our content per vehicle. In fact as Kevin will highlight, when you look at our 3-year backlog, 45% of it is already coming from e-products. 
And finally, I'm excited about our long-term positioning as we look to capitalize on the profound industry shift towards electrification. We are winning. We are ramping up R&D and focusing heavily on the acceleration of the company towards electrification.
With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Kevin."
25708,700255908,2206284,"BorgWarner Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","BorgWarner Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide an overview of the 3 key takeaways from our fourth quarter results.

Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide an overview of the 3 key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. First, our revenue was ahead of our guidance, driven by stronger-than-expected outgrowth and higher levels of sales from the Delphi Technologies acquisition. Second, our margin performance was better than expected, both in the legacy BorgWarner business and in the legacy Delphi business. And third, our free cash flow was very strong at $197 million in the quarter, which resulted in record free cash flow for the full year.
So let's turn to Slide 12. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q4, you can see that foreign currencies increased revenue by about 3.4% from a year ago. Excluding this impact, our organic sales were up more than 6% and compared to a less than 2% increase in weighted average market production. 
That means we delivered 460 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, which breaks down as follows: In China, we outperformed the light vehicle market by about 13%. Strong DCT demand continues to be a key contributor to our sizable outgrowth in the region. In Europe, our light vehicle organic revenue performed roughly in line with the market. In North America, we underperformed the market by approximately 3%, just as we expected, primarily due to the impact of the changeover of the Ford F-150. 
And finally, our commercial vehicle and off-highway mbusinesses drove about 50 basis points of our outgrowth in the quarter as our China business more than offset declining commercial vehicle revenue in other regions. Now some of the strong outgrowth we delivered in Q4 and for the full year, particularly in China, was a pull forward of 2021 outgrowth. That will have an impact on our expected 2021 year-over-year outgrowth. But on a cumulative 2-year basis, we're tracking right in line with our longer-term expectations. So in the end, we're pleased with the strong finish of 2020. 
Moving past our backlog and outgrowth, you can see that the Delphi Technologies acquisition added a little more than $1.1 billion to our fourth quarter revenue. The sum of all this was just over $3.9 billion of revenue in Q4.
Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 13. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $448 million compared to $340 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 11.4%, which was well ahead of our margin guidance of 8.8% to 9.6% for the quarter. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income decreased $7 million on $159 million of higher sales. Remember, we delivered outsized margin performance of 13.3% in Q4 2019, which makes for a tough year-over-year comparable. If you look at the legacy BorgWarner margin excluding the impact of Delphi Technologies, we delivered just over 12% for the quarter, which is consistent with the company's historical top quartile margin profile. Then the Delphi Technologies business added $109 million to adjusted operating income. This was well ahead of our expectations due to the higher-than-expected revenue and stronger underlying margins in the business.
Moving on to cash flow. We're proud of the fact that we generated $197 million of positive free cash flow during the fourth quarter. As a result of that, our full year 2020 free cash flow came in at $743 million, which was a record level for the company. With those strong cash flow results and with our confidence in the business looking ahead to 2021, we repurchased $216 million of our shares during the fourth quarter.
Let's now turn to Slide 14, where you can see our perspectives on global industry production for 2021. First, let me point out that our market assumptions now incorporate our view of the commercial vehicle and off-highway markets, given our increasing exposure to those markets. With that background in mind, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 11% to 14% this year.
Looking at this by region, we're planning for North America to be up 22% to 25%. In Europe, we expect a blended market increase of 11% to 14%. And in China, we expect the overall market to be roughly flat year-over-year, as growth in light vehicle production is offset by anticipated declines in the commercial vehicle market.
Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 15. Starting with our pro forma 2020 sales, which adds back the $2.6 billion of revenue from the first 3 quarters of Delphi Technologies in 2020. As you know, those revenues were not part of our P&L last year, but in order to provide year-over-year comparability, we thought this pro forma revenue approach for the 2020 baseline would be useful. Building on that pro forma revenue base, you can see that our end market assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.
Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 100 to 300 basis points. Embedded in that outgrowth range is a roughly 200 basis point headwind from declining light-duty diesel and a 40 basis point headwind from an expectation of normalized market share in our China commercial vehicle business after considering outsized market share in 2020. 
Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase 12% to 17% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. Then adding a $355 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.7 billion to $15.3 billion. 
From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.0% to 10.5% compared to a pro forma 2020 adjusted operating margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi-related cost synergies and purchase price accounting. 
From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes $70 million to $80 million of incremental benefit in 2021. That puts us right on track to achieve 50% of our total expected cost synergies in 2021, just as we've previously told you to expect. 
One more point on our margin outlook. It's important to note that this outlook is inclusive of a planned increase in R&D spending to 5% of revenue to continue to drive the growth we're seeing in electrification opportunities. That's fully baked into the guidance. 
So based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS of $3.85 to $4.25 per diluted share. And finally, we have line of sight to delivering free cash flow of $800 million to $900 million, which is a significant increase over our record year in 2020. 
That's our 2021 outlook. Let's turn to Slide 16 to review our medium-term growth outlook. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect light vehicle diesel to be a headwind to our outgrowth in 2021. The largest portion of this headwind comes from the legacy Delphi portfolio. As you can see on the left side of this slide, we expect the impact within this business to be approximately $140 million in 2021. However, you can also see that this headwind is expected to lessen each year as we head towards 2024. This is what we saw in due diligence, which simply means that it's in line with our original planning assumptions.
Now let's move to the right side of the slide, where we profile our multiyear backlog. As you know, our backlog is a net backlog, which means it reflects increases in revenue net of decreases in revenue. So the diesel headwinds from the left side are incorporated into this net backlog. 
And what you can see is that even with this headwind, we still expect to deliver 100 to 300 basis points of outgrowth in 2021. Then as you look ahead to 2022 to 2024, we expect a combined net new business backlog inclusive of aftermarket growth to be approximately $2.8 billion. Importantly, we believe this 2022 to 2024 backlog supports our previously communicated midterm outgrowth for the combined company in the mid-4% range. 
And there's one more critical point to note about this backlog. About 45% of this net backlog is driven by our e-products, 45%. We're winning business and positioning the company for continued growth in this area. 
So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall we had a really solid year despite the headwinds resulting from COVID-19. We delivered 630 basis points of market outgrowth and $743 million of free cash flow. Not only did these results significantly exceed our most recent guidance, they also exceeded the guidance that we provided in January of last year prior to the pandemic. 
Now as we head into the new year, we're focused on leveraging our financial strength to drive continued long-term profitable growth in the business. In 2021, that means we'll be keenly focused on delivering on our near-term financial commitments, successfully integrating the Delphi acquisition, and continuing to make the necessary investments to win electrification business that will secure outgrowth and financial strength long into the future.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat."

But obviously as we're in ramp-up mode for a business like our EV portfolio, we're investing a lot more in the front end, and we're not at steady state yet from a revenue perspective. So those ROIC targets are over the life of the program, but the cost tends to come in at the front end, particularly from an R&D perspective. 
And so just as you saw, we talked about today ramping up our R&D to 5%. Some of that is contemplating -- it's really contemplating the increased investments we're making in that EV portfolio as we're securing new business wins. So that does become a headwind to margin in the near term on a discrete basis. But overall we're managing that within our portfolio, and you can see that in our margin guide. I mean the 10.0% to 10.5% contemplates that increase in R&D. 
And you see our backlog is getting skewed more and more toward e-products, which is great. We feel great about that. And we still remain on track for our 2023 margin target, with all that considered, of delivering over 11% operating margin.

So Q4 is really about $1 billion higher annualized revenue than where 2021 is x foreign currency. 
But I think directionally, you're looking at it the right way. We feel that between the incremental synergies that we expect to deliver even beyond 2021, which is another $85 million, with the additional margin improvement that we're driving in certain portions of the legacy Delphi businesses in particular, and with the revenue growth inclusive of that backlog we just highlighted and our ability to convert on that, we feel very comfortable with our ability to deliver on that greater than 11% margin in 2023.

I mean I think the first thing you look at when you look at the Q4 performance, which was in the upper 9% margin range for that as a stand-alone business, I mean keep in mind, Q4 was a really strong revenue quarter, going back to the highest levels relative to maybe a couple of years ago. So $1.1 billion in the quarter, on an annualized basis almost $4.5 billion, so that's a pretty strong level of revenue. And part of the upside that the business was seeing there came in some of the portions of the portfolio that have had historically stronger margins. So I think that's an important piece to keep in mind.
That said, I think the restructuring actions that the company had been taking pre-closing and that we're continuing on a post-closing basis will continue to support that margin profile. But remember, we're continuing to offset that headwind that's coming from that legacy diesel business. And you see from my slides that in 2021, that's expected to be about $140 million revenue decline. And that comes with some outsized margin because it's a strong margin performing piece of the portfolio. And that's where the restructuring actions that we're continuing to execute that legacy Project Pioneer are helping to mitigate the impact of those headwinds.

And at the same time, could BorgWarner be compensated by OEMs for the curtailments, given the upfront R&D investments you made that may not -- all the advanced ICE tech that might not get the full engineering cycle behind it?"

And then just keep in mind, some of our core businesses are continuing to grow even in the ICE space as we see some movement towards hybrids, whether you think of turbos and VCT and EDR. But again, the basis of the way we depreciate assets is predominantly over the life of the programs that those assets are there to support. 
And then when you think of footprint, remember, we are predominantly an assembly model business in terms of our manufacturing footprint. And so we actually can leverage using that footprint in different ways as we look ahead if we need to pivot."

Because commercial vehicle has become a much bigger part of our portfolio, especially with the Delphi acquisition, we're now using market assumptions for commercial vehicle in addition to light vehicle and then comparing our organic revenue growth against that weighted market. So that is one change that we have in the measurement. The backlog then has always included aftermarket as from a dollar perspective in totality measured against those markets. 
When we measure the outgrowth, though, what we do is we're measuring the outgrowth, but we're excluding aftermarket as a measure of that outgrowth against the markets. Because we're really measuring against the OE markets, and we're measuring the revenue that we're generating. So when you see that mid-4% range, the math actually doesn't include any tailwind from aftermarket in the mid-4% range, but the backlog is comprehensive."

We're very pleased to share our results for 2020 and provide an overall company update. Starting on Slide 5. I'm very proud with our stronger-than-expected top line and cash flow performance for the year. With",1023,"Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results for 2020 and provide an overall company update. 
Starting on Slide 5. I'm very proud with our stronger-than-expected top line and cash flow performance for the year. With approximately $10.2 billion in sales, we were down about 11% organically. This compares to our market being down approximately 17%, so our outgrowth was about 630 basis points for the year, which was ahead of our expectations going into the fourth quarter. For the full year, we saw outgrowth in all major regions. We delivered close to 15% outgrowth in China. Our European and North American operations' outgrowth were both in the low single-digit range. 
While our full year earnings per share declined year-over-year due to the impact of COVID-19, our decremental margin performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, our margin performance was achieved while preserving R&D spending to support future growth. We delivered very strong free cash flow of $743 million for the year. This represents a record for free cash flow generation for the company. This is a testament to the intense focus we've put on improving free cash flow generation over the last few years. While managing the operation -- the operational challenges of 2020, we successfully completed the largest acquisition in the company's history and secured numerous business award for electrified vehicles over the course of the year. 
Now let's discuss some of those new business awards. First, I'm happy to announce, on Slide 6, that we have secured an 800-volt electric motor award with a global commercial vehicle customer launching in 2024. This program will use 4 different variants of our latest hairpin motor design. Using our 800 volts rated machine, customers can significantly reduce charging time and achieve a higher power density through the 800-volt architecture, enabling an even brighter future for electric trucks and buses. I am very pleased with this program. We will continue to focus on the electrification opportunities in commercial vehicles in addition to opportunities in our light vehicle market.
Next, I would like to highlight another inverter win on Slide 7. We are partnering with a major European OEM to supply our 400-volt silicon carbide inverter for the next-generation BEVs that are expected to launch in 2022. While I can't share the details of this program, I can tell you that this is our second largest inverter program to date. This illustrates our ongoing innovation in power electronics as we're leading the market trend to upgrade from silicon to silicon carbide. This enables lower energy losses and drives higher efficiency. 
With the latest win, I would like to give you an update of our positioning in the European inverter market on Slide 8. We've had tremendous success establishing ourselves in this market. When I think about BorgWarner's competitive advantages in power electronics, it's driven by, first, the breadth of our product portfolio. This allows us to be faster and more effective at bringing products to market. 
Second, our ability to innovate. We continue our innovations in part by our vertical integration strategy. We have in-house capabilities for power modules, integrated circuit development and software. I think that the last driver is our ability to leverage the electronic scale that we already have, especially in our engine control unit business. 
The result is that we've secured significant new business award. On the chart on the right side of the slide, you will see the inverter programs we've secured with 3 large European OEs. As you can see, we expect that we'll be delivering around 1.1 million inverters in 2025. As a result of the successes we're achieving, we're increasing our R&D spending in 2021 to support our continued innovation and new business awards in our power electronics portfolio. Kevin will touch on that a little later. 
Next, I would like to give you an update on the Delphi Technologies integration on Slide 9. Bottom line, all is on track. Starting with Q4 results. The Delphi Technologies contribution to both revenue and operating income was ahead of our expectations. I'm seeing good progress across all the former Delphi businesses. 
The cost synergies related to the Delphi transaction are tracking in line with our plan, as Kevin will discuss later. And the customer feedback remains very positive. In addition to inverter wins that I just highlighted, we won new businesses across the rest of the Delphi portfolio, including awards in GDI. My overall takeaway is that the integration is on track from all perspectives. 
Before I wrap up on Slide 10, we are announcing our plan to hold an upcoming Investor Day on March 23. The event will be virtually broadcasted from the BorgWarner world headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan. It will provide insights into our technologies and into the acceleration of our positioning in an electrified world. I look forward to interacting with you during the event. 
So let me summarize our 2020 results and our outlook on Slide 11. 2020 was an extremely challenging year in terms of the operating environment, and we've put the health and safety of our people first. Even in this challenging environment, we delivered better-than-expected outgrowth and generated record free cash flow, and our bookings on BEVs are accelerating. We closed on the Delphi transaction. We're successfully integrating the companies, and we are on track to deliver the synergies as planned. 
As we look ahead, we expect to deliver another record year of free cash flow in 2021, which enables us to continue to invest in the business to successfully position the company for the future. The demand for our efficiency-improving products is growing, leading to a continued increase in our content per vehicle. In fact, as Kevin will highlight, when you look at our 3-year backlog, 45% of it is already coming from e-products. 
And finally, I'm excited about our long-term positioning as we look to capitalize on the profound industry shift towards electrification. We are winning, we are ramping up R&D and focusing heavily on the acceleration of the company towards electrification.
With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Kevin."
25708,700255908,2206686,"BorgWarner Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","BorgWarner Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide an overview of the 3 key takeaways from our fourth quarter results.

Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide an overview of the 3 key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. First, our revenue was ahead of our guidance, driven by stronger-than-expected outgrowth and higher levels of sales from the Delphi Technologies acquisition. Second, our margin performance was better than expected both in the legacy BorgWarner business and in the legacy Delphi business. And third, our free cash flow was very strong at $197 million in the quarter, which resulted in record free cash flow for the full year.
So let's turn to Slide 12. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q4, you could see that foreign currencies increased revenue by about 3.4% from a year ago. Excluding this impact, our organic sales were up more than 6% compared to a less than 2% increase in weighted average market production. That means we delivered 460 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, which breaks down as follows.
In China, we outperformed the light vehicle market by about 13%. Strong DCT demand continues to be a key contributor to our sizable outgrowth in the region. In Europe, our light vehicle organic revenue performed roughly in line with the market. In North America, we underperformed the market by approximately 3%, just as we expected, primarily due to the impact of the changeover of the Ford F-150. And finally, our commercial vehicle and off-highway businesses drove about 50 basis points of our outgrowth in the quarter as our China business more than offset declining commercial vehicle revenue in other regions. 
Now some of the strong outgrowth we delivered in Q4 and for the full year, particularly in China, was a pull forward of 2021 outgrowth. That will have an impact on our expected 2021 year-over-year outgrowth. But on a cumulative 2-year basis, we're tracking right in line with our longer-term expectations. So in the end, we're pleased with the strong finish of 2020. 
Moving past our backlog and outgrowth, you can see that the Delphi Technologies acquisition added a little more than $1.1 billion to our fourth quarter revenue. The sum of all this was just over $3.9 billion of revenue in Q4.
Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 13. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $448 million compared to $340 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 11.4%, which was well ahead of our margin guidance of 8.8% to 9.6% for the quarter. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income decreased $7 million on $159 million of higher sales. Remember, we delivered outsized margin performance of 13.3% in Q4 2019, which makes for a tough year-over-year comparable. 
If you look at the legacy BorgWarner margin excluding the impact of Delphi Technologies, we delivered just over 12% for the quarter, which is consistent with the company's historical top-quartile margin profile. Then the Delphi Technologies business added $109 million to adjusted operating income. This was well ahead of our expectations due to the higher-than-expected revenue and stronger underlying margins in the business.
Moving on to cash flow. We're proud of the fact that we generated $197 million of positive free cash flow during the fourth quarter. As a result of that, our full year 2020 free cash flow came in at $743 million, which was a record level for the company. With those strong cash flow results and with our confidence in the business looking ahead to 2021, we repurchased $216 million of our shares during the fourth quarter.
Let's now turn to Slide 14 where you can see our perspectives on global industry production for 2021. First, let me point out that our market assumptions now incorporate our view of the commercial vehicle and off-highway markets given our increasing exposure to those markets. With that background in mind, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 11% to 14% this year.
Looking at this by region. We're planning for North America to be up 22% to 25%. In Europe, we expect a blended market increase of 11% to 14%. And in China, we expect the overall market to be roughly flat year-over-year as growth in light vehicle production is offset by anticipated declines in the commercial vehicle market.
Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 15. Starting with our pro forma 2020 sales, which adds back the $2.6 billion of revenue from the first 3 quarters of Delphi Technologies in 2020. As you know, those revenues were not part of our P&L last year. But in order to provide year-over-year comparability, we thought this pro forma revenue approach for the 2020 baseline would be useful. Building on that pro forma revenue base, you can see that our end market assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.
Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 100 to 300 basis points. Embedded in that outgrowth range is a roughly 200 basis point headwind from declining light-duty diesel and a 40 basis point headwind from an expectation of normalized market share in our China commercial vehicle business after considering outsized market share in 2020. Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase 12% to 17% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. Then adding a $355 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.7 billion to $15.3 billion. 
From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.0% to 10.5% compared to a pro forma 2020 adjusted operating margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi-related cost synergies and purchase price accounting. From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes $70 million to $80 million of incremental benefit in 2021. That puts us right on track to achieve 50% of our total expected cost synergies in 2021 just as we've previously told you to expect. 
One more point on our margin outlook. It's important to note that this outlook is inclusive of a planned increase in R&D spending to 5% of revenue to continue to drive the growth we're seeing in electrification opportunities. That's fully baked into the guidance. 
So based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS of $3.85 to $4.25 per diluted share. And finally, we have line of sight to delivering free cash flow of $800 million to $900 million, which is a significant increase over our record year in 2020. That's our 2021 outlook. 
Let's turn to Slide 16 to review our medium-term growth outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we expect light-vehicle diesel to be a headwind to our outgrowth in 2021. The largest portion of this headwind comes from the legacy Delphi portfolio. As you can see on the left side of this slide, we expect the impact within this business to be approximately $140 million in 2021. However, you can also see that this headwind is expected to lessen each year as we head towards 2024. This is what we saw in due diligence, which simply means that it's in line with our original planning assumptions.
Now let's move to the right side of the slide, where we profile our multiyear backlog. As you know, our backlog is a net backlog, which means it reflects increases in revenue, net of decreases in revenue. So the diesel headwinds from the left side are incorporated into this net backlog. 
And what you can see is that even with this headwind, we still expect to deliver 100 to 300 basis points of outgrowth in 2021. Then as you look ahead to 2022 to 2024, we expect a combined net new business backlog inclusive of aftermarket growth to be approximately $2.8 billion. Importantly, we believe this 2022 to 2024 backlog supports our previously communicated midterm outgrowth for the combined company in the mid-4% range. 
And there's one more critical point to note about this backlog. About 45% of this net backlog is driven by our e-products, 45%. We're winning business and positioning the company for continued growth in this area. 
So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had a really solid year despite the headwinds resulting from COVID-19. We delivered 630 basis points of market outgrowth and $743 million of free cash flow. Not only did these results significantly exceed our most recent guidance, they also exceeded the guidance that we provided in January of last year prior to the pandemic. 
Now as we head into the new year, we're focused on leveraging our financial strength to drive continued long-term profitable growth in the business. In 2021, that means we'll be keenly focused on delivering on our near-term financial commitments, successfully integrating the Delphi acquisition and continuing to make the necessary investments to win electrification business that will secure outgrowth and financial strength long into the future.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat."

But obviously, as we're in ramp-up mode for a business like our EV portfolio, we're investing a lot more in the front end, and we're not at steady state yet from a revenue perspective. So those ROIC targets are over the life of the program, but the cost tends to come in at the front end, particularly from an R&D perspective. 
And so just as you saw, we talked about today ramping up our R&D to 5%. Some of that is contemplating -- it's really contemplating the increased investments we're making in that EV portfolio as we're securing new business wins. So that does become a headwind to margin in the near term on a discrete basis. But overall, we're managing that within our portfolio, and you can see that in our margin guide. I mean the 10.0% to 10.5% contemplates that increase in R&D. 
And you see our backlog is getting skewed more and more toward e-products, which is great. We feel great about that. And we still remain on track for our 2023 margin target, with all that considered, of delivering over 11% operating margin. So it's obviously a business we're investing in.

But I think directionally, you're looking at it the right way. We feel that between the incremental synergies that we expect to deliver even beyond 2021, which is another $85 million, with the additional margin improvement that we're driving in certain portions of the legacy Delphi businesses in particular and with the revenue growth inclusive of that backlog we just highlighted and our ability to convert on that, we feel very comfortable with our ability to deliver on that greater than 11% margin in 2023.

So I think that's an important piece to keep in mind.  
That said, I think the restructuring actions that the company had been taking both pre closing and that we're continuing on a post-closing basis will continue to support that margin profile. But remember, we're continuing to offset that headwind that's coming from that legacy diesel business, and you see from my slides that in 2021, that's expected to be about $140 million revenue decline, and that comes with some outsized margin because it's a strong margin performing piece of the portfolio.

So if I take last year's backlog, which was on a BorgWarner stand-alone basis I think, for the half year -- 3-year period, it was $2.1 billion, which was about $700 million a year. Now you're certainly out here talking still of about $700 million a year or so, $2.8 billion over the 4 years. But obviously, in the meantime, light vehicle production has gone worse in terms of the outlook but you also integrated Delphi within it.

Maybe just as a follow-up -- and recognizing we'll probably hear more about that later. Like one thing you did sort of update, right, was the addressable content because I think the last time you gave those, numbers were pre Delphi. So now it looks like on electric, it's like $2,400. And before, it was, I think, just under $2,000. And on combustion, it's a little bit over $900, and it was $600 before. So a couple of hundred bucks higher on each. 
You also used to give like an average CPV content, and I think that assumed your participation rate of about 1/3 on electric. Can you let us know if that has changed at all? Is that still roughly what you think you can get post Delphi? Or have the numbers changed especially with some of the inverter stuff you were talking about earlier today?"

We've actually put those numbers out here a couple of months ago. So they're consistent with what we've been sharing for the last couple of months, which contemplated basically combining the legacy BorgWarner and Delphi content opportunities. 
When you look at the electric side, you can obviously see the number has increased quite a bit. Before, we did have inverters in there because we had capability inverters in inverters even prior to Delphi, but we didn't have it at the scale and with the technological leadership position in light vehicle that Delphi has. So I think the probability of us delivering on that content opportunity has increased. 
And then the dollar amounts actually increased because of some of the other power electronics capabilities in particular that Delphi brings to the table. And so as we talk about possibly peeling back the onion here or giving a little bit more data, I think you should be on the watch for Investor Day. And we'll give more color to how we expect the business to be evolving over the coming years."

Kind of a couple of questions. Do you have any update on that based on what you're seeing in the market? And then second, with this CV win and obviously with Kevin's background in CV, is that where -- and given most, if not all, of CV motors are going to be outsourced, do you see more pivot to the commercial vehicle sector? 
And then kind of third within that, Meritor and Dana talked a lot about integrating the motors into the axle set. This looks like something you could put under the hood of a Freightliner or something and just drive through traditional transmission.

And then just keep in mind, some of our core businesses are continuing to grow even in the ICE space as we see some movement towards hybrids, whether you think of turbos and VCT and EGR. But again, the basis of the way we depreciate assets is predominantly over the life of the programs that those assets are there to support.

Because commercial vehicle has become a much bigger part of our portfolio, especially with the Delphi acquisition, we're now using market assumptions for commercial vehicle in addition to light vehicle and then comparing our organic revenue growth against that weighted market. So that is one change that we have in the measurement. The backlog then has always included aftermarket as -- from a dollar perspective in totality measured against those markets. 
When we measure the outgrowth though, what we do is we're measuring the outgrowth but we're excluding aftermarket as a measure of that outgrowth against the markets because we're really measuring against the OE markets and we're measuring the OE revenue that we're generating. So when you see that mid-4% range, the math actually doesn't include any tailwind from aftermarket in the mid-4% range, but the backlog is comprehensive."

We're very pleased to share our results today for the first quarter of 2021 and provide an overall company update starting on Slide #5. I'm very proud of our strong start of the year despite the components supply",1087,"Thank you, Pat, and good day to everyone. We're very pleased to share our results today for the first quarter of 2021 and provide an overall company update starting on Slide #5. I'm very proud of our strong start of the year despite the components supply headwinds. With just over $4 billion in sales, our first quarter revenue increased over 18% organically. This compares to a market being up less than 13%. So our outgrowth was about 570 basis points for the quarter, which was ahead of our expectation and our guidance for the year. We saw strong outgrowth in North America and Europe. Our earnings per share increased year-over-year due to the impact of our higher revenue.
Our incremental margin performance was in line with our expectations, with an even strong free cash flow of $147 million for the quarter, a good strategy towards our full year guidance. We also secured additional new business awards for electrified vehicles, which I speak about in a moment.
And finally, during the quarter, we announced our planned acquisition of AKASOL. The key strategic elements of the AKASOL acquisitions are detailed on Slide #6. Based on the last couple of years of experience we have in this space, we're believers in the prospect of easy bet resistance and are very familiar with the industry players. As a leader in this space, AKASOL had been on our radar for a long time as a potential partner. We're confident that AKASOL is an excellent strategic fit for BorgWarner, and we are really excited about adding their capabilities to our portfolio. In particular, we're attracted to AKASOL's following strength. Flexible battery technology across multiple cell architectures, proven technology and products with established manufacturing facilities already in serial production today, strong order backlog of about $2.4 billion, primarily from leading OEMs and a focus on bus, CV and off-highway applications. We're extremely excited and expect to complete the transaction during the second quarter.
Next, I would like to highlight a significant new program win for electric vehicles on Slide 7. BorgWarner's Integrated Drive Module, or as we call it, our IDM, was selected by a major non-Chinese Asian OEM for its upcoming global segment electric vehicle production planned to start in mid-2023. This is a significant program for the company as it is our first IDM award combining BorgWarner's and legacy Delphi Technologies portfolio. It is a validation of the potential we saw in bringing our 2 companies together. I want to thank the team's intense efforts to get to such a significant booking only 7 months after the close of the Delphi transaction, and there is more to come.
This IDM features our electric motor, our box and our integrated power electronics. It operates at 400 volts and has exceptional peak power of 135 kilowatts. The IDM weight and space are reduced by integrating our gearbox, our 400-volt silicon inverter and our motor. This results in a maximized power density and functionality. The IDM also offers a scalable and modular inverter design, making it easily adaptable to customer requirements. This is an important step for the company with a great partner.
Next, on Slide 8, let me summarize our new strategical project charging forward that we unveiled at our Investor Day in late March. With successful execution of this strategy, we expect to deliver over 25% of our revenue from electric vehicles by 2025 and approximately 45% by 2030. That compares to under 3% of revenue today.
Project charging forward as 3 pillars: 1, we plan to profitably scale ELVs through our continued integration of Delphi and our ability to capture synergies. The new IDM win is a great example. We would also pursue other organic and inorganic actions; 2, we intend to expand more aggressively into ECVs. We will do that by leveraging our strong intimacy with CV customers as well as our position in ELVs. We're building out a go-to-market product portfolio and operation capabilities organically and inorganically. Our AKASOL acquisition is a key part of this expansion; and 3, we plan to optimize our combustion portfolio, reducing our exposure by disposing parts of the portfolio that we believe are lower growth that on have a path to product leadership or that are not expected to deliver strong margins. We believe we can fund the EV growth underlying project charging forward, primarily from the capital generated by our existing operations. This is not a certain change in the company's direction. It is a logical extension to what we've been building since 2015. We're excited about the acceleration of the market towards electrification and about the momentum that we are building with our customers.
I want to take a moment to thank all the BorgWarner employees, who are working very hard to both manage the presence and accelerate the future of the company towards BEVs.
Next, on Slide 9. I'm proud to announce that BorgWarner achieved the Great Place to Work certified status for the second consecutive year. Great Place to Work is the global authority on workplace culture. This certification validates BorgWarner's positive work environment. I've said before that the BorgWarner secret sauce starts with our people to lead, develop and attract the best talents. We strive to be an employer of choice where we operate around the world. We cultivate a workplace environment that is collaborative, transparent, inclusive and that promotes continuous learning and excellence.
So let me summarize our first quarter results and our outlook. The first quarter was a good start to the year, particularly considering the supply challenges currently impacting the industry. We delivered strong top line growth, and we believe we're tracking well towards our full year margin and free cash flow objectives.
Our first quarter performance has led us to increase our full year revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance despite a lower industry production outlook, as Kevin will detail. As we look beyond 2021, I'm extremely excited about our long-term positioning. We are continuing to take significant steps that we believe will help us to secure our profitable growth well into the future.
We are winning, in line with our expectations in the electric world. Both from a component standpoint like inverters and heaters, for example, and also from a latest generation system standpoint with our IDMs. We're focusing on a disciplined inorganic investment approach, like the planned acquisition of AKASOL, which adds great technology to our portfolio while supplementing our growth profile.
With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Kevin."
25708,709205850,2270292,"BorgWarner Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","BorgWarner Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide a quick overview of the 2 key takeaways from our first quarter results. First, our revenue came in stronger than we were expecting going into the ye",1603,"Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide a quick overview of the 2 key takeaways from our first quarter results. First, our revenue came in stronger than we were expecting going into the year. This was driven by the fact that we delivered solid outgrowth with both the legacy BorgWarner and former Delphi Technologies businesses performing better than expected. Second, our margin and cash flow performance in the quarter were strong, driven by the top line results as well as our cost-saving measures.
So let's turn to Slide 10. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q1, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of $3.2 billion, which includes $945 million of revenue from Delphi Technologies. You can see the foreign currencies increased revenue by about 6% from a year ago. Then our organic growth year-over-year was over 18% compared to a less than 13% increase in weighted average market production.
That translates to 570 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, which breaks down as follows: In Europe, we outperformed by mid- to high single digits, driven by growth in small gasoline turbochargers and strong performance in multiple former Delphi Technologies businesses, most notably fuel injection; in North America, we outperformed the market by high single digits as we saw a nice benefit from the ramp-up of the new Ford F-150 and other new business launches; in China, we underperformed the market by mid-single digits against very strong outperformance in the first quarter of 2020. Also keep in mind, Q1 was a very unusual quarter last year in the face of COVID-19, primarily in China.
The sum of all this was just over $4 billion of revenue in Q1, which was a new quarterly record for the company. Now we do believe that some of the strong outgrowth we delivered in Q1 was a result of the production of build and hold vehicles by our customers in multiple regions of the world. That means it's likely that some level of our reported outgrowth in Q1 is inflated due to a pull forward of production into the quarter. This will have an offsetting impact on our expected outgrowth later in the year. However, our outgrowth for the full year is still expected to be above our prior guidance, as I'll discuss further in a moment.
With all that background in mind, we're pleased with the strong start to 2021. Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 11. Our first quarter adjusted operating income was $444 million, compared to the pro forma $274 million in the first quarter of 2020. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 11.1%, which was up compared to the 10.3% margin for BorgWarner only in the first quarter of 2020.
On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income increased $145 million on $591 million of higher sales. That translates to an incremental margin of roughly 25%. This solid performance was driven by conversion on higher volumes, restructuring savings and Delphi Technology synergies in excess of purchase price amortization. We are particularly pleased with this performance given elevated supplier costs that we experienced during the quarter.
Moving on to free cash flow. We're proud of the fact that we generated $147 million of positive free cash flow during the first quarter, which was roughly flat year-over-year despite increased investment in working capital.
Let's now turn to Slide 12, where you can see our perspectives of global industry production for 2021. As a reminder, our market assumptions incorporate our view of both the light vehicle and on-highway commercial vehicle markets. As you can see, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 9% to 12%, which is down from our previous assumption of an 11% to 14% increase. This reduction to our prior market outlook reflects the ongoing impact of the semiconductor shortage on industry production.
Looking at this by region, we're planning for North America to be up 17% to 20%. We see the largest incremental impact of the semiconductor shortage in North America with our market expectations down approximately 500 basis points from our initial assumptions. In Europe, we expect a blended market increase of 9% to 12%, with that range being down approximately 200 basis points from our earlier planning assumption. And in China, we expect the overall market to be roughly flat year-over-year, similar to our previous estimate.
Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 13. Starting with our pro forma 2020 sales, which includes $2.6 billion of revenue from the first 3 quarters of Delphi Technologies in 2020. As you know, those revenues were not part of our P&L last year. But to provide year-over-year comparability, we thought this pro forma revenue approach for the 2020 baseline would be useful. You can see that our end market assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $0.9 billion to $1.3 billion. Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 300 to 500 basis points, which is a meaningful step up from our previous guidance of 100 to 300 basis points.
Our higher outgrowth guidance is based on the stronger-than-expected outgrowth in the first quarter and outgrowth for the balance of the year being higher than our previous guidance based on better-than-previously-expected revenue trends in a number of former Delphi Technologies product lines. Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase about 12% to 17% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. Then adding a $400 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.8 billion to $15.4 billion. That's up from our prior guidance by about $100 million at both ends of the revenue range.
Even with weaker end market outlook, our stronger revenue outgrowth is driving an overall increase in our revenue guidance from the guidance we gave last quarter. Also, you should note that we're maintaining a wider-than-typical revenue range at this point of the year due to the wide range of potential production scenarios that I discussed on the previous slide, which stems from the volatility and uncertainty in end markets, arising from the industry-wide semiconductor issues.
From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.5% compared to a pro forma 2020 adjusted operating margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi related cost synergies and purchase price accounting. From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes $70 million to $80 million of incremental benefit in 2021. That puts us right on track to achieve 50% of our total expected cost synergies in 2021. And based on our year-to-date performance, we believe that we're tracking at the high end of this range.
Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4 to $4.35 per diluted share, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $3.85 to $4.25 per diluted share. I would point out that this guidance now assumes a 31% tax rate versus our prior guidance of 32% as a result of the successful execution of certain international tax planning initiatives.
And finally, we continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the $800 million to $900 million range for the full year. This is flat with our prior guidance as we expect the higher sales outlook to drive an increase in working capital that largely offsets higher adjusted operating income. This would still represent a record annual free cash flow generation for the company. That's our 2021 outlook.
Let's turn to Slide 14 for an update on the near-term actions related to project charging forward. On the acquisition front, we believe we remain on track to complete the AKASOL acquisition in the second quarter. We've now received regulatory approvals in all required jurisdictions. The tender offer is in progress with the final acceptance period expected to be completed later this month and then with the closing shortly thereafter. AKASOL represents an important part of Project CHARGING FORWARD. As it represents approximately 20% to 25% of the estimated 2025 revenue from acquisitions underlying our plan and it significantly increases our exposure to the ECV space.
As it relates to portfolio optimization, we continue to target combustion-related dispositions with annual revenue of approximately $1 billion to be executed over the next 12 to 18 months. The process for these dispositions is underway. We would expect to update you on our progress there as we get closer to executing those transactions.
So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had a really solid start to the year despite the industry supply headwinds. We delivered 570 basis points of market outgrowth, an 11.1% adjusted operating margin and $147 million of free cash flow. And we increased our full year revenue and earnings guidance despite moderating our industry production assumptions. Looking beyond our near-term results, we're taking the necessary steps to accelerate the company's progression towards electrification. The AKASOL acquisition and today's IDM announcement are great examples of our progression. And importantly, we're executing our strategy from a position of financial strength. Ultimately, we expect that the successful execution of our strategy will drive value creation for our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat."

We're very pleased to share our results today for the first quarter of 2021 and provide an overall company update starting on Slide #5. I'm very proud of our strong start of the year despite the components supply",1087,"Thank you, Pat, and good day to everyone. We're very pleased to share our results today for the first quarter of 2021 and provide an overall company update starting on Slide #5. I'm very proud of our strong start of the year despite the components supply headwinds. With just over $4 billion in sales, our first quarter revenue increased over 18% organically. This compares to a market being up less than 13%. So our outgrowth was about 570 basis points for the quarter, which was ahead of our expectation and our guidance for the year. We saw strong outgrowth in North America and Europe. Our earnings per share increased year-over-year due to the impact of our higher revenue.
Our incremental margin performance was in line with our expectations, with an even strong free cash flow of $147 million for the quarter, a good strategy towards our full year guidance. We also secured additional new business awards for electrified vehicles, which I speak about in a moment.
And finally, during the quarter, we announced our planned acquisition of AKASOL. The key strategic elements of the AKASOL acquisitions are detailed on Slide #6. Based on the last couple of years of experience we have in this space, we're believers in the prospect of easy bet resistance and are very familiar with the industry players. As a leader in this space, AKASOL had been on our radar for a long time as a potential partner. We're confident that AKASOL is an excellent strategic fit for BorgWarner, and we are really excited about adding their capabilities to our portfolio. In particular, we're attracted to AKASOL's following strength. Flexible battery technology across multiple cell architectures, proven technology and products with established manufacturing facilities already in serial production today, strong order backlog of about $2.4 billion, primarily from leading OEMs and a focus on bus, CV and off-highway applications. We're extremely excited and expect to complete the transaction during the second quarter.
Next I would like to highlight a significant new program win for electric vehicles on Slide 7. BorgWarner's Integrated Drive Module, or as we call it, our IDM, was selected by a major non-Chinese Asian OEM for its upcoming global S segment electric vehicle production planned to start in mid-2023. This is a significant program for the company as it is our first IDM award combining BorgWarner's and legacy Delphi Technologies portfolio. It is a validation of the potential we saw in bringing our 2 companies together. I want to thank the team's intense efforts to get to such a significant booking only 7 months after the close of the Delphi transaction. And there is more to come.
This IDM features our electric motor, our box and our integrated power electronics. It operates at 400 volts and has exceptional peak power of 135 kilowatts. The IDM weight and space are reduced by integrating our gearbox, our 400-volt silicon inverter and our motor. This results in a maximized power density and functionality. The IDM also offers a scalable and modular inverter design making it easily adaptable to customer requirements. This is an important step for the company with a great partner.
Next, on Slide 8, let me summarize our new strategical project charging forward that we unveiled at our Investor Day in late March. With successful execution of this strategy, we expect to deliver over 25% of our revenue from electric vehicles by 2025 and approximately 45% by 2030. That compares to under 3% of revenue today.
Project charging forward as 3 pillars: one, we plan to profitably scale ELVs through our continued integration of Delphi and our ability to capture synergies. The new IDM win is a great example. We would also pursue other organic and inorganic actions; two, we intend to expand more aggressively into ECVs. We will do that by leveraging our strong intimacy with CV customers as well as our position in ELVs. We're building out a go-to-market product portfolio and operation capabilities organically and inorganically. Our AKASOL acquisition is a key part of this expansion. And three, we plan to optimize our combustion portfolio, reducing our exposure by disposing parts of the portfolio that we believe are lower growth that don't ever pass to product leadership or that are not expected to deliver strong margins. We believe we can fund the EV growth underlying project charging forward, primarily from the capital generated by our existing operations. This is not a certain change in the company's direction. It is a logical extension to what we've been building since 2015. We're excited about the acceleration of the market towards electrification and about the momentum that we are building with our customers.
I want to take a moment to thank all the BorgWarner employees who are working very hard to both manage the present and accelerate the future of the company towards BEVs.
Next, on Slide 9. I'm proud to announce that BorgWarner achieved The Great Place to Work certified status for the second consecutive year. Great Place to Work is the global authority on workplace culture. This certification validates BorgWarner's positive work environment. I've said before that the BorgWarner secret sauce starts with our people: to lead, develop and attract the best talents. We strive to be an employer of choice where we operate around the world. We cultivate a workplace environment that is collaborative, transparent, inclusive and that promotes continuous learning and excellence.
So let me summarize our first quarter results and our outlook. The first quarter was a good start to the year, particularly considering the supply challenges currently impacting the industry. We delivered strong top line growth, and we believe we're tracking well towards our full year margin and free cash flow objectives.
Our first quarter performance has led us to increase our full year revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance despite a lower industry production outlook, as Kevin will detail. As we look beyond 2021, I'm extremely excited about our long-term positioning. We are continuing to take significant steps that we believe will help us to secure our profitable growth well into the future.
We are winning, in line with our expectations in the electric world, both from a component standpoint like inverters and heaters, for example, and also from a latest generation system standpoint with our IDMs. We're focusing on a disciplined inorganic investment approach, like the planned acquisition of AKASOL, which adds great technology to our portfolio while supplementing our growth profile.
With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Kevin."

Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide a quick overview of the 2 key takeaways from our first quarter results.

Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide a quick overview of the 2 key takeaways from our first quarter results. First, our revenue came in stronger than we were expecting going into the year. This was driven by the fact that we delivered solid outgrowth with both the legacy BorgWarner and former Delphi Technologies businesses performing better than expected. 
Second, our margin and cash flow performance in the quarter were strong, driven by the top line results as well as our cost-saving measures.
So let's turn to Slide 10. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q1, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of $3.2 billion, which includes $945 million of revenue from Delphi Technologies. You can see the foreign currencies increased revenue by about 6% from a year ago. Then our organic growth year-over-year was over 18% compared to a less than 13% increase in weighted average market production.
That translates to 570 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, which breaks down as follows: in Europe, we outperformed by mid- to high single digits, driven by growth in small gasoline turbochargers and strong performance in multiple former Delphi Technologies businesses, most notably fuel injection. 
In North America, we outperformed the market by high single digits as we saw a nice benefit from the ramp-up of the new Ford F-150 and other new business launches. 
In China, we underperformed the market by mid-single digits against very strong outperformance in the first quarter of 2020. Also keep in mind, Q1 was a very unusual quarter last year in the face of COVID-19, primarily in China.
The sum of all this was just over $4 billion of revenue in Q1, which was a new quarterly record for the company. Now we do believe that some of the strong outgrowth we delivered in Q1 was a result of the production of build and hold vehicles by our customers in multiple regions of the world. That means it's likely that some level of our reported outgrowth in Q1 is inflated due to a pull forward of production into the quarter. This will have an offsetting impact on our expected outgrowth later in the year. However, our outgrowth for the full year is still expected to be above our prior guidance, as I'll discuss further in a moment.  With all that background in mind, we're pleased with the strong start to 2021. 
Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 11. Our first quarter adjusted operating income was $444 million, compared to the pro forma $274 million in the first quarter of 2020. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 11.1%, which was up compared to the 10.3% margin for BorgWarner only in the first quarter of 2020.
On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income increased $145 million on $591 million of higher sales. That translates to an incremental margin of roughly 25%. This solid performance was driven by conversion on higher volumes, restructuring savings and Delphi Technology synergies in excess of purchase price amortization. We are particularly pleased with this performance given elevated supplier costs that we experienced during the quarter.
Moving on to free cash flow. We're proud of the fact that we generated $147 million of positive free cash flow during the first quarter, which was roughly flat year-over-year despite increased investment in working capital.
Let's now turn to Slide 12, where you can see our perspectives of global industry production for 2021. As a reminder, our market assumptions incorporate our view of both the light vehicle and on-highway commercial vehicle markets. As you can see, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 9% to 12%, which is down from our previous assumption of an 11% to 14% increase. This reduction to our prior market outlook reflects the ongoing impact of the semiconductor shortage on industry production.
Looking at this by region, we're planning for North America to be up 17% to 20%. We see the largest incremental impact of the semiconductor shortage in North America with our market expectations down approximately 500 basis points from our initial assumptions. 
In Europe, we expect a blended market increase of 9% to 12%, with that range being down approximately 200 basis points from our earlier planning assumption. And in China, we expect the overall market to be roughly flat year-over-year similar to our previous estimate.
Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 13. Starting with our pro forma 2020 sales, which includes $2.6 billion of revenue from the first 3 quarters of Delphi Technologies in 2020. As you know, those revenues were not part of our P&L last year. But to provide year-over-year comparability, we thought this pro forma revenue approach for the 2020 baseline would be useful. You can see that our end market assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $0.9 billion to $1.3 billion. 
Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 300 to 500 basis points, which is a meaningful step up from our previous guidance of 100 to 300 basis points. Our higher outgrowth guidance is based on the stronger-than-expected outgrowth in the first quarter and outgrowth for the balance of the year being higher than our previous guidance based on better-than-previously-expected revenue trends in a number of former Delphi Technologies product lines. Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase about 12% to 17% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. Then adding a $400 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.8 billion to $15.4 billion. That's up from our prior guidance by about $100 million at both ends of the revenue range.
Even with weaker end market outlook, our stronger revenue outgrowth is driving an overall increase in our revenue guidance from the guidance we gave last quarter. Also, you should note that we're maintaining a wider-than-typical revenue range at this point of the year due to the wide range of potential production scenarios that I discussed on the previous slide, which stems from the volatility and uncertainty in end markets, arising from the industry-wide semiconductor issues.
From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.5% compared to a pro forma 2020 adjusted operating margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi related cost synergies and purchase price accounting. From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes $70 million to $80 million of incremental benefit in 2021. That puts us right on track to achieve 50% of our total expected cost synergies in 2021. And based on our year-to-date performance, we believe that we're tracking at the high end of this range.
Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4 to $4.35 per diluted share, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $3.85 to $4.25 per diluted share. I would point out that this guidance now assumes a 31% tax rate versus our prior guidance of 32% as a result of the successful execution of certain international tax planning initiatives.
And finally, we continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the $800 million to $900 million range for the full year. This is flat with our prior guidance as we expect the higher sales outlook to drive an increase in working capital that largely offsets higher adjusted operating income. This would still represent a record annual free cash flow generation for the company. That's our 2021 outlook.
Let's turn to Slide 14 for an update on the near-term actions related to project charging forward. On the acquisition front, we believe we remain on track to complete the AKASOL acquisition in the second quarter. We've now received regulatory approvals in all required jurisdictions. The tender offer is in progress with the final acceptance period expected to be completed later this month and then with the closing shortly thereafter. AKASOL represents an important part of Project CHARGING FORWARD as it represents approximately 20% to 25% of the estimated 2025 revenue from acquisitions underlying our plan and it significantly increases our exposure to the ECV space.
As it relates to portfolio optimization, we continue to target combustion-related dispositions with annual revenue of approximately $1 billion to be executed over the next 12 to 18 months. The process for these dispositions is underway. We would expect to update you on our progress there as we get closer to executing those transactions.
So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had a really solid start to the year despite the industry supply headwinds. We delivered 570 basis points of market outgrowth, an 11.1% adjusted operating margin and $147 million of free cash flow. And we increased our full year revenue and earnings guidance despite moderating our industry production assumptions. Looking beyond our near-term results, we're taking the necessary steps to accelerate the company's progression towards electrification. The AKASOL acquisition and today's IDM announcement are great examples of our progression. And importantly, we're executing our strategy from a position of financial strength. Ultimately, we expect that the successful execution of our strategy will drive value creation for our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat."

As you think about this transition towards the electric powertrain, there are sort of skeptics on your company to believe the automakers are going to insource everything. And then there are some optimists or realist, as I would call them, that they understand at least part of the parts will get outsourced and maybe over time, full IDMs might be a way things go.
As you look at the shift in technology, how different do you think it is versus other shifts in technology you've seen in the past where the automakers are trying to learn what's going on and sometimes they might insource and sometimes, they might outsource? I mean how do you think this is going to shape up differently or similarly to past transitions in technology?"

The market is very big and the content per vehicle that we have on E is 3x more than we have on C. And I gave some examples sometimes then than 1 inverter is equivalent to pretty much what we can sell if we sell it all on combustion. So as you mentioned, the IDM is a very, very good example. There is more to come on system outsourcing. And again, you will see some customers that are outsourcing. They want to learn in order to buy better. Some customers will insource some platforms, outsource some others. And that varies across customers and across region and that will also vary over time, where I think when suppliers like us will have very good product leadership and scale in an IDM, for example, but you have other products, I think the likelihood for us to be able to sell more systems is becoming -- will become higher over time."

First, on Slide 5, I'm very proud of our strong performance in the quarter despite the ongoing component supply headwinds. With just under $3.8 billion in sales, our second quarter revenue increased over 72% organically with strong incremental margins and free cash flow. As Kevin will discuss, we are increasing our full year guidance as we believe higher our growth and synergies are offsetting commodity and other headwinds. That's for the short-term execution. 
Now going forward, I'm very proud of our sustainability strategy highlighted in our report that our team just published. The acquisition of AKASOL was completed in early June, and I'm very positive about what I see: great technology, great entrepreneurial spirit and mindset. Welcome AKASOL to BorgWarner. And we secured multiple new product awards for electrified vehicles, which I'll speak about in a few moments. 
Starting with our overarching sustainability topic, and our vision to a cleaner and more energy-efficient world, I would like to highlight some key takeaways from our global sustainability report called Evolving for All on Slide 6. 
Evolving for All compiles into one document where it's possible when nearly 50,000 people resolve to do the right things. It is a testament to our commitment to create an enterprise that is shaping the future of sustainable mobility. We are accelerating our clean mobility technologies, we're reducing our carbon footprint and are well on our way to achieving our stated goal of carbon neutrality by 2035. 
The report also includes Scope 3 emissions data to illustrate how our products are improving the world in which we all live. We're fostering a diverse and safe workplace and giving back to our communities and our equity analysis shows parity results. I'm extremely proud of our sustainability focus. 
Moving on to another pillar of Charging Forward, we have completed the takeover offer of AKASOL early June, as detailed on Slide 7. Since then, we have increased our ownership stake to approximately 93% through additional share purchases. We have informed AKASOL of our intention to progress towards a squeeze-out process to achieve 100% ownership. 
To put in perspective, we expect AKASOL to represent 20% to 25% of the M&A portion of our Charging Forward Project announced just 4 months ago. AKASOL also continues to secure additional new business awards. Last month, they announced an agreement to supply their battery systems to a major bus and commercial vehicle manufacturer from Belgium. AKASOL will supply the second and third generation of their high-energy battery systems for the customers new all-electric city bus starting in 2021. 
Now let's go to China and look at other recently announced new product awards for electrified vehicles on Slide 8. First, we announced new contracts to supply dual inverters for Great Wall Motor, another major Chinese OEM. The dual inverters will be features on both hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles for these customers. 
By combining different power electronic technologies into one compact package, our dual inverter provides unrivaled functionality. A single unit can control and drive 2 electric motors while delivering cost and weight reductions. These advanced inverter awards showcase not only the product leadership we have in these domains, but also the trust and confidence we have built in our electrified applications with multiple OEMs globally. 
In addition to their midterm revenue opportunities, advanced hybrid programs such as these, allow us to drive additional scale and product capabilities that help improve our overall competitiveness in the world of battery electric vehicles. 
Also, downstream the battery, I would like to highlight another iDM award. This new 3-in-1 has a bigger size and output functionalities than the one already announced a few months ago with Hyundai. This one is also all BorgWarner-made, mechanical, motors, vertically integrated electronics and software. We're partnering with a leading luxury new energy vehicle maker in China with SOP in 2023. 
Designed, developed and manufactured by BorgWarner, this iDM features our electric motor, our gearbox and our integrated power electronics. It operates at 400 volts and has a peak power of 250 kilowatts. 
Now adjacent to the battery packs, I would like to shed some light today on our high-voltage coolant heaters on Slide 9. This product line is a great example of a best product developed organically by BorgWarner and now commercialize and manufacture that scale. It helps improve the battery-operated range of our customer battery electric vehicles by controlling the battery temperature at an optimal level, while also increasing passenger comfort through the delivery of an ideal interior climate. 
We recently expanded our existing business with the launch of a new program with Geely. And as you can see by the chart on the slide, the business is expected to grow rapidly from 600,000 units in 2021 to 4 million units by 2025. That's a 60% CAGR, 6-0. With multiple customer awards, we expect the high-voltage coolant heaters to already account for $400 million in revenue by 2025. Or to put it another way, we expect this product to account for close to 10% of [indiscernible] second quarter results and our outlook. 
The second quarter results were strong, particularly considering the supply challenges currently impacting the industry. We delivered strong top line growth, and we believe we're tracking well towards our full year margin and free cash flow objectives. We're increasing our full year revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. 
As we look beyond these near-term results, I'm extremely excited about our long term positioning. We are continuing to secure new business for electric vehicles to support our long-term revenue targets, and I'm pleased to see awards both on the components and on a system level. BorgWarner continues to develop clean and energy-efficient solutions like our iDM family of products. And lastly, we're focusing on a disciplined, inorganic investment approach like the acquisition of AKASOL that add great technology and additional scale to our portfolio while supplementing our growth profile. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin."

Given the number of financial topics we have to get through this morning, I'm going to dive right into the details. So let's turn to Slide 10. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q2, we begin wi",1536,"Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. 
Given the number of financial topics we have to get through this morning, I'm going to dive right into the details. So let's turn to Slide 10. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q2, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of just under $2.1 billion, which includes $628 million of revenue from Delphi Technologies. 
Foreign currencies increased revenue by about 11% from a year ago. Then our organic growth year-over-year was more than 72% compared to a 64% increase in weighted average market production. The significant year-over-year changes in industry production and the varying levels of supply disruptions among our customers make it difficult to draw conclusions from the quarterly outgrowth figures. Nonetheless, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter. 
Looking at our regional performance. In Europe, we outperformed by double digits, driven by growth in small gasoline turbochargers, VCT and fuel injection. In China, we also outperformed the market by double digits, driven by growth in DCT, all-wheel drive and fuel injection. And in North America, we underperformed the market primarily due to customer exposure. The sum of all this was just under $3.8 billion of revenue in Q2. 
Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 11. Our second quarter adjusted operating income was $401 million compared to a pro forma loss of $52 million in the second quarter of 2020. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 10.7%. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income increased $423 million on about $1.5 billion of higher sales. That translates to a strong incremental margin of over 28%, driven by conversion on higher volumes, restructuring savings, and Delphi-related synergies in excess of purchase price amortization. We were particularly pleased with this performance given elevated supplier and commodity costs that we experienced during the quarter. 
Moving on to cash flow. We're proud of the fact that we generated $133 million of positive free cash flow during the second quarter, which was achieved despite an investment in inventory to help us better manage the challenging production environment. 
Let's now turn to Slide 12, where you can see our perspective on global industry production for 2021. As you can see, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 8.5% to 11%, which is down from our previous assumption of a 9% to 12% increase. This reduction from our prior market outlook reflects the ongoing impact of the semiconductor shortage on industry production, which is reducing our expectations for North American and European industry growth. 
We do expect light vehicle industry production to improve sequentially in the third and fourth quarters relative to Q2 as we believe the impact of the semiconductor shortages will be lower in the second half of the year than what we saw last quarter. However, given lower commercial vehicle production in the second half and the varying impact of ongoing supply constraints on our mix of customers, we're not expecting Q3 and Q4 revenues to return to Q1 levels. 
Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 13. You can see that our end market assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $965 million to $1.2 billion. Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 500 to 600 basis points, which is a meaningful step-up from our previous guidance of 300 to 500 basis points. 
Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase about 14% to 17% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. Then, adding a $520 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies and $75 million of revenue related to the acquisition of AKASOL, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $15.2 billion to $15.6 billion. 
From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.5% compared to a pro forma 2020 margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi-related cost synergies and purchase price accounting. 
From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes $100 million to $105 million of incremental benefit in 2021, which is higher than our previous guidance of $70 million to $80 million. As I'll discuss in more detail momentarily, the cost synergies are simply being realized faster than we previously expected. 
Partially offsetting this favorability are 2 things: first, the acquisition of AKASOL is expected to reduce full year margins by 10 basis points. And second, we're anticipating a net negative impact from commodities in the range of $70 million to $90 million, which is worse than we previously expected. But even with these 2 headwinds, we're holding our margin roughly in line with our prior guidance. 
Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.15 to $4.40 per diluted share, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4 to $4.35 per diluted share. And finally, we continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the $800 million to $900 million range for the full year. This is flat with our prior guidance as we expect the higher sales outlook to drive an increase in working capital that largely offsets higher adjusted operating income. This would still represent record free cash flow generation for the company. That's our 2021 outlook. 
Let's turn to Slide 14 for an update on the financial impact of the Delphi Technologies acquisition. As I alluded to earlier, the cost synergies related to the transaction are being realized more quickly than we previously expected. The primary driver is faster execution of headcount reductions related to our planned SG&A cost synergies. In fact, at this point, we've completed more than 95% of the headcount reductions associated with our synergy plan. 
As a result, we now expect 2021 cost synergies to be $100 million to $105 million, which means that cumulatively, we expect to have achieved synergies of $115 million to $120 million by the end of the year. But to be clear, this is an acceleration of the timing of our synergies as opposed to an overall increase in our performance. Therefore, our total cost synergy target of $175 million is unchanged. 
In addition to higher cost synergies, Delphi's revenue contribution in 2021 is also tracking ahead of our original expectations. As a result of these 2 factors, the accretion to 2021 adjusted EPS from the Delphi acquisition is now expected to be positive $0.20 to $0.30 versus our expectation at closing of a dilutive impact of approximately $0.15. This is a great result and a testament to the work being done by the integration teams across the company. 
And as we look beyond 2021, it's important to note that the revenue synergies associated with the transaction are also progressing very well. We're pleased with the systems awards that we've generated through combining our electric vehicle capabilities, including the iDM award in China that Fred mentioned earlier. We've been able to secure these and other components awards as a result of leveraging Delphi's technology leadership, with BorgWarner's commercial relationships, operational capabilities and financial strength. 
Let's turn to Slide 15 for a summary of the financial impact of the AKASOL acquisition. As you can see, we expect AKASOL to contribute 2021 sales of $75 million to BorgWarner's second half results. Then we would expect those sales to grow significantly over the next few years, with 2024 sales still expected to be in the $500 million range. This growth is supported by AKASOL's previously reported backlog. 
From an EPS perspective, we expect AKASOL to have a roughly breakeven impact on the total company in 2021, excluding the impact of purchase price amortization. Then as the business grow sequentially each year, we do expect to see conversion on the incremental revenue, which we expect to drive accretion of $0.12 by 2024, also excluding the impact of purchase price amortization. We're pleased with the transaction and the medium to long-term benefits it's expected to deliver. 
So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had another solid quarter despite the industry challenges. We meaningfully outperformed the market, delivered a 10.7% operating margin and generated $133 million of free cash flow. And then coming off that Q2 performance, we've increased our full year revenue and earnings guidance even while moderating our industry production assumptions and considering higher commodity costs. 
Looking beyond our near-term results, we believe the faster accretion from the Delphi Technologies acquisition and the completion of the AKASOL acquisition, illustrate our ability to execute the inorganic actions that are part of our project charging forward initiative. The electrification wins discussed by Fred also highlight some of our progress toward the organic portion of our plan. Ultimately, it's the pillars of near-term execution, securing future profitable growth and disciplined inorganic investments that will drive the success of our strategy and thus drive value creation for our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat."

Just based on your guidance, you had a very strong first half, $850 million of EBITDA.

I think maybe to make it simpler, why don't I speak relative to the midpoint of the range. But as you think first half to second half, I think when you exclude the impact of AKASOL, which is $75 million, revenue sequentially, first half to second half, is down a couple of hundred million dollars. So obviously, we have loss conversion on that revenue. 
But then on top of that, as you're going first half to second half you've got the net commodity headwinds, which are an incremental $20 million to $40 million in the second half. Our R&D on a net basis is stepping up in the second half, another $25 million to $30 million, and those things are being partially offset by about $20 million to $25 million of incremental synergies. So that's kind of the walk as you look first half to second half. 
I think the thing, if you look year-over-year, if you're talking second half of this year versus our pro forma second half of last year, I think one of the things you have to keep in mind is part of the revenue walk is AKASOL of $75 million and foreign exchange, which is a little bit over $100 million. So $200 million of our revenue improvement comes with virtually no margin because FX converts it basically our operating income. And AKASOL actually, because of purchase price amortization is dilutive this year about $10 million, the net is no conversion on that incremental $200 million. 
Which means what? It means then on the revenue that's left, there's actually the downside conversion at the midpoint of our guide, plus those other things I spoke of, the commodity costs, R&D being up, but synergies being a little bit of an offset. So hopefully, that helps."

I'll take that. A couple of things worth noting around the R&D guide. First thing is that when you look at our Q2 results, and when you get a chance to go through our 10-Q, you'll see that our net R&D sequentially was down in the second quarter versus the first quarter. But it's because we actually had higher customer recoveries from engineering perspective than we had anticipated and then we had in Q1 by about $20 million. 
If you look at our gross R&D going from Q1 to Q2, it was actually up sequentially, but the net was down. And so what that means is it's actually had an impact. We've actually brought down our implied full year R&D from what was about $740 million implicitly at the beginning of the year to about $725 million as our current guide. And so that's really being driven by the higher-than-anticipated customer recoveries that we generated in the second quarter. 
As you look at as a percent, the reason we gave a dollar guide as opposed to a percentage guide, is the percentage is coming down. And the reason the percentage in 2021 is coming down is because revenue is going up. So it's not because we're cutting our R&D spend. We had better recoveries, but our R&D spend is actually still $725 million. But with revenue coming -- going up, the R&D as a percent of sales is actually now 4.6% to 4.8%, which just looks like a lower percentage, but it's implying lower spend, but it really isn't the case. 
So as we look to the full year, that's what the $725 million represents about a $15 million reduction but really driven by the recoveries. And then as we think ahead to next year and beyond, we continue to expect that we're going to be driving R&D spend in that 5-plus percent range on a go-forward basis."

So when you look at our EV programs, generally speaking, they tend to have much more R&D intensity, which tends to be upfront. So as we're growing in EVs, what happens is we have a lot more R&D hitting the P&L upfront and then you generate the contribution margins over time. And the blend of all that hits our ROIC targets over the life of the program. 
But what that means as you're in ramp-up mode across EV, your R&D is much higher proportionally relative to the conversion you're generating on the incremental revenue because the revenue is still coming in the future. So the EV portfolio in total has a more depressed margin while you're in growth mode. But that's not because of the underlying fundamentals of the business. It's because we're growing and investing in R&D to support the contribution margins that we'll generate over the coming years as we start to generate the revenue."

First, on Slide 5, I'm very proud of our strong performance in the quarter despite the ongoing component supply headwinds. With just under $3.8 billion in sales, our second quarter revenue increased over 72% organically, with strong incremental margins and free cash flow. As Kevin will discuss, we are increasing our full year guidance as we believe higher outgrowth and synergies are offsetting commodity and other headwinds. That's for the short-term execution.
Now going forward, I'm very proud of our sustainability strategy highlighted in our report that our team just published. The acquisition of AKASOL was completed in early June, and I'm very positive about what I see: great technology, great entrepreneurial spirit and mindset. Welcome, AKASOL, to BorgWarner. And we secured multiple new product awards for electrified vehicles, which I'll speak about in a few moments.
Starting with our overarching sustainability topic and our vision to a cleaner and more energy-efficient world, I would like to highlight some key takeaways from our global sustainability report called Evolving for All on Slide 6. Evolving for All compiles into one document what is possible when nearly 50,000 people resolve to do the right things. It is a testament to our commitment to create an enterprise that is shaping the future of sustainable mobility. We are accelerating our clean mobility technologies, we're reducing our carbon footprint and are well on our way to achieving our stated goal of carbon neutrality by 2035.
The report also includes Scope 3 emissions data to illustrate how our products are improving the world in which we all live. We're fostering a diverse and safe workplace and giving back to our communities, and our pay equity analysis shows parity results. I'm extremely proud of our sustainability focus.
Moving on to another pillar of CHARGING FORWARD, we have completed the takeover offer of AKASOL early June, as detailed on Slide 7. Since then, we have increased our ownership stake to approximately 93% through additional share purchases. We have informed AKASOL of our intention to progress towards a squeeze-out process to achieve 100% ownership. To put in perspective, we expect AKASOL to represent 20% to 25% of the M&A portion of our CHARGING FORWARD project announced just 4 months ago.
AKASOL also continues to secure additional new business awards. Last month, they announced an agreement to supply their battery systems to a major bus and commercial vehicle manufacturer from Belgium. AKASOL will supply the second and third generation of their high-energy battery systems for the customer's new all-electric city bus starting in 2021.
Now let's go to China and look at other recently announced new product awards for electrified vehicles on Slide 8. First, we announced new contracts to supply dual inverters for Great Wall Motor and another major Chinese OEM. The dual inverters will be features on both hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles for these customers.
By combining different power electronic technologies into one compact package, our dual inverter provides unrivaled functionality. A single unit can control and drive 2 electric motors while delivering cost and weight reductions. These advanced inverter awards showcase not only the product leadership we have in these domains, but also the trust and confidence we have built in our electrified applications with multiple OEMs globally.
In addition to their midterm revenue opportunities, advanced hybrid programs such as these allow us to drive additional scale and product capabilities that help improve our overall competitiveness in the world of battery electric vehicles.
Also, downstream the battery, I would like to highlight another iDM award. This new 3-in-1 has a bigger size and output functionalities than the one already announced a few months ago with Hyundai. This one is also all BorgWarner-made, mechanical, motors, vertically integrated electronics and software. We're partnering with a leading luxury new energy vehicle maker in China, with SOP in 2023.
Designed, developed and manufactured by BorgWarner, this iDM features our electric motor, our gearbox and our integrated power electronics. It operates at 400 volts and has a peak power of 250 kilowatts.
Now adjacent to the battery packs, I would like to shed some light today on our high-voltage coolant heaters on Slide 9. This product line is a great example of a best product developed organically by BorgWarner and now commercialized and manufactured at scale. It helps improve the battery-operated range of our customer battery electric vehicles by controlling the battery temperature at an optimal level while also increasing passenger comfort through the delivery of an ideal interior climate.
We recently expanded our existing business with the launch of a new program with Geely. And as you can see by the chart on the slide, the business is expected to grow rapidly from 600,000 units in 2021 to 4 million units by 2025. That's a 60% CAGR, 6-0. With multiple customer awards, we expect the high-voltage coolant heaters to already account for $400 million in revenue by 2025. Or to put it another way, we expect this product to account for close to 10% of our planned EV revenue by 2025 under CHARGING FORWARD. This product line does not get as much attention as the more high-profile product lines like iDM, inverters or motors but still contributes meaningfully to our EV content.
So let me summarize our second quarter results and our outlook. The second quarter results were strong, particularly considering the supply challenges currently impacting the industry. We delivered strong top line growth, and we believe we're tracking well towards our full year margin and free cash flow objectives. We're increasing our full year revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance.
As we look beyond these near-term results, I'm extremely excited about our long-term positioning. We are continuing to secure new business for electric vehicles to support our long-term revenue targets, and I'm pleased to see awards both on the component and on the system level. BorgWarner continues to develop clean and energy-efficient solutions like our iDM family of products. And lastly, we're focusing on a disciplined, inorganic investment approach like the acquisition of AKASOL that add great technology and additional scale to our portfolio while supplementing our growth profile.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin."

Given the number of financial topics we have to get through this morning, I'm going to dive right into the details. So let's turn to Slide 10. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q2, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of just under $2.1 billion, which includes $628 million of revenue from Delphi Technologies.
Foreign currencies increased revenue by about 11% from a year ago. Then our organic growth year-over-year was more than 72% compared to a 64% increase in weighted average market production. The significant year-over-year changes in industry production and the varying levels of supply disruptions among our customers make it difficult to draw conclusions from the quarterly outgrowth figures. Nonetheless, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter.
Looking at our regional performance. In Europe, we outperformed by double digits, driven by growth in small gasoline turbochargers, VCT and fuel injection. In China, we also outperformed the market by double digits, driven by growth in DCT, all-wheel drive and fuel injection. And in North America, we underperformed the market primarily due to customer exposure. The sum of all this was just under $3.8 billion of revenue in Q2.
Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 11. Our second quarter adjusted operating income was $401 million compared to a pro forma loss of $52 million in the second quarter of 2020. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 10.7%. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income increased $423 million on about $1.5 billion of higher sales. That translates to a strong incremental margin of over 28%, driven by conversion on higher volumes, restructuring savings and Delphi-related synergies in excess of purchase price amortization. We were particularly pleased with this performance given elevated supplier and commodity costs that we experienced during the quarter.
Moving on to cash flow. We're proud of the fact that we generated $133 million of positive free cash flow during the second quarter, which was achieved despite an investment in inventory to help us better manage the challenging production environment.
Let's now turn to Slide 12, where you can see our perspective on global industry production for 2021. As you can see, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 8.5% to 11%, which is down from our previous assumption of a 9% to 12% increase. This reduction from our prior market outlook reflects the ongoing impact of the semiconductor shortage on industry production, which is reducing our expectations for North American and European industry growth.
We do expect light vehicle industry production to improve sequentially in the third and fourth quarters relative to Q2 as we believe the impact of the semiconductor shortages will be lower in the second half of the year than what we saw last quarter. However, given lower commercial vehicle production in the second half and the varying impact of ongoing supply constraints on our mix of customers, we're not expecting Q3 and Q4 revenues to return to Q1 levels.
Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 13. You can see that our end market assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $965 million to $1.2 billion. Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 500 to 600 basis points, which is a meaningful step-up from our previous guidance of 300 to 500 basis points.
Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase about 14% to 17% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. Then adding a $520 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies and $75 million of revenue related to the acquisition of AKASOL, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $15.2 billion to $15.6 billion.
From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.5% compared to a pro forma 2020 margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi-related cost synergies and purchase price accounting.
From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes $100 million to $105 million of incremental benefit in 2021, which is higher than our previous guidance of $70 million to $80 million. As I'll discuss in more detail momentarily, the cost synergies are simply being realized faster than we previously expected.
Partially offsetting this favorability are 2 things: first, the acquisition of AKASOL is expected to reduce full year margins by 10 basis points; and second, we're anticipating a net negative impact from commodities in the range of $70 million to $90 million, which is worse than we previously expected. But even with these 2 headwinds, we're holding our margin roughly in line with our prior guidance. Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.15 to $4.40 per diluted share, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4 to $4.35 per diluted share.
And finally, we continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the $800 million to $900 million range for the full year. This is flat with our prior guidance as we expect the higher sales outlook to drive an increase in working capital that largely offsets higher adjusted operating income. This would still represent record free cash flow generation for the company. That's our 2021 outlook.
Let's turn to Slide 14 for an update on the financial impact of the Delphi Technologies acquisition. As I alluded to earlier, the cost synergies related to the transaction are being realized more quickly than we previously expected. The primary driver is faster execution of headcount reductions related to our planned SG&A cost synergies. In fact, at this point, we've completed more than 95% of the headcount reductions associated with our synergy plan.
As a result, we now expect 2021 cost synergies to be $100 million to $105 million, which means that cumulatively, we expect to have achieved synergies of $115 million to $120 million by the end of the year. But to be clear, this is an acceleration of the timing of our synergies as opposed to an overall increase in our performance. Therefore, our total cost synergy target of $175 million is unchanged.
In addition to higher cost synergies, Delphi's revenue contribution in 2021 is also tracking ahead of our original expectations. As a result of these 2 factors, the accretion to 2021 adjusted EPS from the Delphi acquisition is now expected to be positive $0.20 to $0.30 versus our expectation at closing of a dilutive impact of approximately $0.15. This is a great result and a testament to the work being done by the integration teams across the company.
And as we look beyond 2021, it's important to note that the revenue synergies associated with the transaction are also progressing very well. We're pleased with the systems awards that we've generated through combining our electric vehicle capabilities, including the iDM award in China that Fred mentioned earlier. We've been able to secure these and other components awards as a result of leveraging Delphi's technology leadership, with BorgWarner's commercial relationships, operational capabilities and financial strength.
Let's turn to Slide 15 for a summary of the financial impact of the AKASOL acquisition. As you can see, we expect AKASOL to contribute 2021 sales of $75 million to BorgWarner's second half results. Then we would expect those sales to grow significantly over the next few years, with 2024 sales still expected to be in the $0.5 billion range. This growth is supported by AKASOL's previously reported backlog.
From an EPS perspective, we expect AKASOL to have a roughly breakeven impact on the total company in 2021, excluding the impact of purchase price amortization. Then as the business grow sequentially each year, we do expect to see conversion on the incremental revenue, which we expect to drive accretion of $0.12 by 2024, also excluding the impact of purchase price amortization. We're pleased with the transaction and the medium to long-term benefits it's expected to deliver.
So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had another solid quarter despite the industry challenges. We meaningfully outperformed the market, delivered a 10.7% operating margin and generated $133 million of free cash flow. And then coming off that Q2 performance, we've increased our full year revenue and earnings guidance even while moderating our industry production assumptions and considering higher commodity costs.
Looking beyond our near-term results, we believe the faster accretion from the Delphi Technologies acquisition and the completion of the AKASOL acquisition illustrate our ability to execute the inorganic actions that are part of our Project CHARGING FORWARD initiative. The electrification wins discussed by Fred also highlight some of our progress toward the organic portion of our plan.
Ultimately, it's the pillars of near-term execution, securing future profitable growth and disciplined inorganic investments that will drive the success of our strategy and thus drive value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat."

I think maybe to make it simpler, why don't I speak relative to the midpoint of the range. But as you think first half to second half, I think when you exclude the impact of AKASOL, which is $75 million, revenue sequentially, first half to second half, is down a couple of hundred million dollars. So obviously, we have loss conversion on that revenue.
But then on top of that, as you're going first half to second half, you've got the net commodity headwinds, which are an incremental $20 million to $40 million in the second half. Our R&D on a net basis is stepping up in the second half, another $25 million to $30 million, and those things are being partially offset by about $20 million to $25 million of incremental synergies. So that's kind of the walk as you look first half to second half.
I think the thing -- if you look year-over-year, if you're talking second half of this year versus our pro forma second half of last year, I think one of the things you have to keep in mind is part of the revenue walk is AKASOL of $75 million and foreign exchange, which is a little bit over $100 million. So $200 million of our revenue improvement comes with virtually no margin because FX converts it basically our operating income. And AKASOL actually, because of purchase price amortization, is dilutive this year, about $10 million. The net is no conversion on that incremental $200 million.
Which means what? It means then on the revenue that's left, there's actually the downside conversion at the midpoint of our guide, plus those other things I spoke of, the commodity costs, R&D being up, but synergies being a little bit of an offset. So hopefully, that helps."

There's the legacy Delphi restructuring actions, Project Pioneer, which is incremental tailwind next year, and then any conversion on our continued outgrowth.

I'll take that. A couple of things worth noting around the R&D guide. First thing is that when you look at our Q2 results and when you get a chance to go through our 10-Q, you'll see that our net R&D sequentially was down in the second quarter versus the first quarter. But it's because we actually had higher customer recoveries from engineering perspective than we had anticipated and than we had in Q1, by about $20 million.
If you look at our gross R&D going from Q1 to Q2, it was actually up sequentially, but the net was down. And so what that means is it's actually had an impact. We've actually brought down our implied full year R&D from what was about $740 million implicitly at the beginning of the year to about $725 million as our current guide. And so that's really being driven by the higher-than-anticipated customer recoveries that we generated in the second quarter.
As you look at it as a percent -- the reason we gave a dollar guide as opposed to a percentage guide is the percentage is coming down. And the reason the percentage in 2021 is coming down is because revenue is going up. So it's not because we're cutting our R&D spend. We had better recoveries, but our R&D spend is actually still $725 million. But with revenue coming -- going up, the R&D as a percent of sales is actually now 4.6% to 4.8%, which just looks like a lower percentage, but it's implying lower spend, but it really isn't the case.
So as we look to the full year, that's what the $725 million represents, about a $15 million reduction but really driven by the recoveries. And then as we think ahead to next year and beyond, we continue to expect that we're going to be driving R&D spend in that 5-plus percent range on a go-forward basis."

And the blend of all that hits our ROIC targets over the life of the program.
But what that means as you're in ramp-up mode across EV, your R&D is much higher proportionally relative to the conversion you're generating on the incremental revenue because the revenue is still coming in the future. So the EV portfolio in total has a more depressed margin while you're in growth mode. But that's not because of the underlying fundamentals of the business.

Let's start on Slide 5. We're very pleased to share our results for the third quarter and provide an overall company update. The third quarter operating environment was very challenged, both from an absolute volume",939,"Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. Let's start on Slide 5. We're very pleased to share our results for the third quarter and provide an overall company update. The third quarter operating environment was very challenged, both from an absolute volume perspective and in light of the production volatility we experienced throughout this quarter. Overall, we're doing a solid job managing the near-term environment while securing our future growth. 
With just over $3.4 billion in sales, our third quarter revenue decreased by about 7% organically. Excluding the year-over-year growth in our aftermarket business, our OEM business declined 9% compared to the 22% decline in our market during the quarter as we benefited from new business and favorable mix. 
Our margin and cash flow performance in the quarter was impacted by the volatile production environment, which put pressure on near-term cost containment and drove excess inventory within our plans. Even with those challenges, we're still on track to delivering a near double-digit operating margin for the full year. And we still expect full year free cash flow to be amongst the strongest results in our history. 
I want to thank all our employees and particularly our plant managers and plant management teams around the world who are working very hard to manage the short term and serve our customers. At the same time, we're very focused on ensuring that we secure our future. To that end, this past quarter, we won multiple new product awards for electric vehicles, which I will speak about in a few moments. As a result of these awards, along with wins in prior quarters, we are well on our way to achieving the organic electric vehicle 2025 revenue targets underlying our project CHARGING Forward. In fact, we estimate that more than 90% of that target is already booked. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6, where you can see our perspective on global industry production for the remainder of 2021. The market environment continues to be extremely volatile with the risk of future production disruption arising from ongoing supply constraints. With that in mind, on a full year basis, we now expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to be down 2.5% to flat year-over-year. This is down materially from our previous assumption, reflecting both the third quarter decline and our most recent expectations for the fourth quarter. 
As you can see from the line chart showing the different scenario, we do expect light vehicle industry production to improve sequentially Q3 to Q4. Underlying customer demand remains robust. However, just like we saw in the third quarter, industry production levels will be dependent on the varying impact of ongoing supply constraints and on the potential impact on our customer mix. 
Overall, we expect the challenging environment to continue throughout the remainder of 2021. And at this point, we think it will carry on well into 2022. As we manage this challenging environment, we're also continuing to focus on securing our mid- to long-term opportunities in electric vehicle. And we did just that during this quarter, securing several awards for electric vehicle programs. I'm very proud of the team. 
Two of those awards are highlighted on Slide 7. First, we secured a major award for a North American inverter with a global OEM expected to launch in 2024. This high-voltage silicon carbide program is our largest inverter win to date. This business award also marks the company's first major win in the North American market. It will also be used in multiple battery electric vehicle platforms, including pass cars and trucks. 
Our product performance, scalability, cost competitiveness, size optimization and global manufacturing footprint, all contributed to securing this business win. Additionally, we announced a new 800-volt silicon carbide inverter award with a German OEM expected to launch in early 2025. This award expands our existing 400-volt inverter business with this same German customer by now adding 800-volt products. This new technology offers enhanced power density, proven performance and long-term reliability. 
Given these 2 new and significant inverter awards, I would like to give you an update on our positioning in the inverter market on Slide 8. We've had tremendous success establishing ourselves in this market. When I think about BorgWarner's competitive advantages in power electronics, it's driven by, first, the breadth of our product portfolio. This allows us to be faster and more effective at bringing products to market. Second, our ability to innovate, like with our Viper power module technology. We can continue our innovations in part due to our vertical integration strategy. We have in-house capabilities for power modules, integrated circuit development and software, which we feel are an advantage in the marketplace. 
And finally, I think the last driver is our ability to leverage the electronic scale that we already have across our company, and especially within our engine control units. The result is that we've secured significant new business award. And as you can see by the chart on the slide, we expect the business to grow rapidly from about 500,000 units in 2021 to 2.5 million units by 2025, representing about 50% CAGR. We expect this volume to drive total inverter sales of $1.7 billion by 2025 -- in 2025, sorry. And remember, these programs are already booked. 
We continue to pursue additional inverter opportunities with production volumes in 2025 and beyond, and would expect to secure more awards in the coming quarters. And one more thing, with the business we've already won, we believe that we are positioned to be the #1 noncaptive inverter producer globally by 2025. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin."

Let's turn to Slide 9. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q3, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of just under $3.6 billion, which includes a little over $1 billion of revenue from Delphi Techn",1145,"Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q3, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of just under $3.6 billion, which includes a little over $1 billion of revenue from Delphi Technologies. Next, you can see that foreign currencies increased revenue by about 2%. Then our organic revenue decline year-over-year was approximately 7% or almost 9%, excluding growth in our aftermarket segment. That compares to a 22% decrease in weighted average market production, which suggests that our outgrowth in the quarter was more than 13%. 
Now with that said, the significant volatility in production schedules and the varying levels of supply disruptions among our customers are continuing to make it difficult to draw conclusions from the quarterly outgrowth figures. Nonetheless, we were pleased that we delivered strong relative revenue performance in all 3 major markets despite the overall decline in revenue. 
Regionally, in Europe, we outperformed, driven by new business in small gasoline turbochargers and fuel injection products. In China, we also outperformed the market, driven by the resilience in the former Delphi businesses. And in North America, we outperformed the market, primarily due to new business as well as vehicle and customer mix. The sum of all these was just over $3.4 billion of revenue in Q3. 
Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 10. Our third quarter adjusted operating income was $311 million compared to pro forma operating income of $396 million last year. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 9.1%. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of AKASOL, adjusted operating income decreased $79 million on $261 million of lower sales. That translates to a decremental margin of approximately 30%. 
This higher than typical decremental margin was primarily driven by $24 million of higher commodity costs, net of customer recoveries. Excluding these higher commodity costs, our year-over-year decremental margin was approximately 19%, which we view as a sign that we're effectively managing our operating cost performance in spite of the supply chain disruptions. 
Moving on to cash flow. We consumed $10 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. This was worse than our expectations going into the quarter due to lower-than-expected operating income as well as higher-than-planned inventories. Fundamentally, when production declines this rapidly and expectedly, it's difficult to get inventory out of the system in the near term. We expect inventory to improve in the coming quarters once we see less volatility in production orders, which will give us the ability to rightsize our supply chain demands accordingly. 
Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 11. We now expect our end markets to be down 2.5% to flat for the year. Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 1,000 basis points. This contemplates the strong performance to date with a sequential step down in the fourth quarter as we expect to return to more normalized year-over-year outgrowth in Q4. Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase approximately 8.5% to 11% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. 
Then adding an expected $425 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies and an expected $70 million related to the acquisition of AKASOL, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.4 billion to $14.7 billion. This wide revenue guidance range reflects the continued production uncertainty we have in the fourth quarter. 
From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 9.6% to 10.0% compared to a pro forma 2020 margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi-related cost synergies and purchase price accounting. 
From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance continues to include $100 million to $105 million of incremental benefit in 2021, the same as our prior guidance. Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $3.65 to $3.95 per diluted share. 
And finally, we expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the range of $600 million to $700 million for the full year. The reduction versus our prior guidance is a little larger than our projected decline in operating income as we expect inventory to remain higher than usual through the fourth quarter. Then once we head into 2022, we expect to start to see reductions in inventory towards more normalized levels. That's our 2021 outlook. 
Let's turn to Slide 12. Given the uncertain outlook for the remainder of 2021, we felt it appropriate to provide you with some of our initial thoughts on some key financial drivers and strategic priorities heading into 2022. 
Starting with our top line. As of right now, we do expect to see supply chain challenges, particularly with respect to semiconductors, continue well into 2022. Ultimately, where full year 2022 industry production shakes out will depend on the scope and duration of these challenges. But at this point, we would still expect a modest level of growth in industry production next year. 
Next, we expect to deliver outgrowth in 2022. However, we're currently assessing the extent to which the much stronger-than-expected outgrowth in 2021 will result in any headwind to our outgrowth next year. 
From a cost perspective, we expect incremental Delphi-related cost synergies in the $40 million to $45 million range, and we also expect incremental restructuring savings of $40 million to $50 million. These combined savings are expected to largely offset our estimated increase in R&D spending of approximately $100 million. We're planning for this significant increase in R&D spending in order to support the new business wins we've achieved to date and to pursue additional EV opportunities consistent with our CHARGING FORWARD organic growth objectives. 
And finally, we're building our plans based on the assumption that we'll see sustained levels of commodity inflation continuing into 2022, which means we expect that to create a year-over-year headwind during the first and second quarters. That's the near term. But while we're managing the near term, we're also focused on securing our long-term future. 
So consistent with our CHARGING FORWARD initiative, we have 3 key strategic priorities heading into next year. First, we plan to continue to pursue and secure additional electric vehicle awards for both components and systems. Second, we intend to execute additional M&A to accelerate our positioning in electric vehicles. 
And finally, we expect to complete the disposition of approximately $1 billion in combustion revenue. Ultimately, it's the pillars of near-term execution, securing future profitable growth and disciplined inorganic investments that will drive the success of our strategy and thus drive value creation for our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Fred."

I'm now really excited to share an update of our progress towards our project CHARGING FORWARD targets on Slide 13. And as evidenced by our program announcements over the past several quarters, including the 2 wins that I alluded to earlier, we're making significant progress on the organic growth in electric vehicles underlying our CHARGING FORWARD plan. 
As of this call, we have now booked electric vehicle programs leading to about $2.3 billion of revenue in 2025. Or to put it another way, with this booked business, we're more than 90% of the way towards our $2.5 billion organic revenue target we gave you back in March. The breakdown of these programs is highlighted on the chart to the left. We're excited about the mix of both components and system awards. And importantly, our book business is across all major regions with leading OEMs. Plus we expect to add to this booked business portfolio over the next quarters by securing additional EV awards with 2025 revenues. And then we will supplement this organically developed revenue with EV revenues from car and any future acquisitions. 
The takeaway from today is this. It's a challenging near-term environment. Once again, BorgWarner is successfully managing the presence and delivering solid financial results. At the same time, we're delivering our future. We're doing this by establishing product leadership and winning new business in the world of electrification. And with these wins, we are successfully executing on our long-term strategy, CHARGING FORWARD, which will deliver value to our shareholders long into the future. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat."

Even though production is expected to be sequentially up, our revenue with -- when you look at what's embedded in our guidance is expected to be under a little bit more pressure because we had 13-plus percent outgrowth in Q4 or Q3. But as you step into Q4, our implicit guide is somewhere of outgrowth in the range of 7.5% to 8.5%. So sequentially, actually, it's a revenue headwind, even though market production is up. So when you look at our revenue, our revenue actually is under more pressure on a sequential basis. 
The other thing you have is commodities are still a continuing headwind and that's true on a sequential basis, where it steps up probably in the range of $5 million to $15 million going from Q3 to Q4. So I'd say those are a couple of the big drivers."

I think I'd refer you to the slide that we had provided back at our Investor Day because I think that's a good way to think about it, which showed how R&D right now is heavy, particularly relative to the revenue that we have when we're running at $300 million or $400 million of EV revenue, but we're investing of that $725 million of R&D this year, around 1/3 of that being focused on the e-product portfolio. Obviously, that math doesn't work from a near-term profitability perspective. 
As we go out over time, we start to launch some of these programs from an EV perspective, the EV businesses start to get some real gross margin and contribution margin that starts to help to fund on its own, some of those R&D investments. So R&D is continuing to ramp over the next few years. But ultimately, that contribution margin is coming on more quickly, and you start to get the leverage that we -- that you alluded to. And you can see, as we laid out in that Investor Day deck, by the time you get to call it 2024-ish time frame is when we start to cross and you start to see profitability on a stand-alone basis as the contribution margin on an incremental sale starts to overtake the R&D we're making. And I would say, as you think about that for the long term, as we think about the steady state for that business, the margin profile of that business, we think, is a good margin business. It's just that we're in growth mode for a long period of time. So until you stop the growth, you never fully offset the R&D from a normal operating margin perspective. You're always continuing to invest as long as we're growing, but we start to get the real leverage in the coming years here."

So underlying the performance outside of commodity costs, we're managing right around that 20% mark on a year-over-year basis, which is good considering how much revenue has come out on a year-over-year basis. When volumes come out relatively quickly like that and then they recover, we would expect generally to increment directionally at the rate at which we decremented when you have a drop-down and then a snapback.

No different than what we saw coming out of COVID. 
When COVID started -- when we started the snap back at the end of last year, we had obviously decremented at a pretty healthy rate earlier in the year, and it came back very quickly, and we incremented at the rates in which we decremented. So I think that's the right way to think about it as we come out of hopefully, the production challenges that we're seeing in the market today sometime during '22."

I think it's pretty clear, inverters are effectively becoming your signature product sort of the same way that turbos are the signature product in an ICE world. So if we're making the inverter versus turbo comparison, maybe you can just give us a sense where turbo is clearly, you have a very concentrated position. What type of competitive environment you anticipate for inverse, I think you talked about it earlier. And how would that compare to motors and drive units? 
And then maybe you could also just give us a sense. I assume that given historically, turbos will call it like quarter 1/3 of revenue, you probably allocated disproportionate resources and that certainly deservedly so. How are you thinking about allocating resources to inverters internally versus other products? Is this going to get disproportionate attention just given this is going to be your signature product for the future?"

More to be booked, already 90% booked, and that ramp-up in R&D is to support that booking rate and also the high level of pursuits that we do. So I'm very happy with that. 
It's not -- I would not call that the signature product. When you look at Slide 13, you have other products in the mix. It's true that this product has a high content per vehicle, but we're very successful with systems IDMs. We've announced quite a few wins and more to come, very successful with the surrounding of the batteries. Needless to say that Slide 13 does not include AKASOL because we don't totally own it yet. We are on the squeeze out period. So it's not a 1 product. It is -- there are a lot of products in the world of electric vehicles that we are excelling at. 
Now inverters, as I mentioned in prior calls, are the products that are outsourced by our customers by the vast majority because it's very, very complex to do. It requires a lot of scale in electronics, a lot of vertical integration. And so we're very successful with that. 
On motors, we are embedding our own motors in our IDMs. We're also selling stand-alone motors. I would say that the market in motors is still more fragmented than the competitors and inverters that is becoming more and more concentrated. That's what I would tell you if I hope I covered most of your question."

I think that you mentioned expecting, at this point, at least, modest LVP growth and then still assessing sort of like the growth over market outlook. Could you provide just a little bit more color around your early thinking? I would think modest LVP growth is probably quite a bit more conservative than IHS, maybe or even what we've heard from some of the automakers that have spoken so far. 
And then on the gross over market side, to what extent some of the growth that you saw this year, I mean, I guess, what would be a cause for it coming out of next year's growth?"

On the outlook for next year, obviously, still early days, and we're still operating in a very volatile environment as evidenced by the fact that we still got a $300 million revenue range on our Q4 revenue outlook. And so that just gives you an indication as to the volatility in the environment. 
And as we look out into 2022 from where we sit today, we don't see a rapid solution to the semiconductor challenges and a sudden snapback in volume -- market volumes coming. So our expectation is that there's going to be continuing impact of the supply chain disruptions well into 2022. And so that's why we're suggesting, given where we sit today, we expect that, that probably translates to modest growth from a year-over-year production perspective. But I'd say sitting here in early November, trying to project what next year looks like when we're still struggling with Q4 production, it's pretty challenging to project right now. But we don't see necessarily an end in the near term in terms of some of the supply chain disruptions, which might be a little bit different than some others who are guiding to a much more rapid recovery. 
In terms of the outgrowth, it starts with, well, what was your outgrowth in 2021 and how much of that might have been effectively a pull forward or a bet that you would have otherwise expected over the couple of years. So the fact that we outgrew the market based on our guidance or expect to outgrow the market by 10% in 2021, that's obviously not a normal outgrowth for this company. We're happy with it, but it suggests to us that knowing that we normally grow in the mid-single-digit range or at least half for the last number of years, that some of that may have been a pull forward of things we would have otherwise expected in 2022. But we're in the middle of that assessment right now. We're in the middle of our long-range planning process and really understanding in this volatile environment. How much of that is a headwind in next year's year-over-year outgrowth versus we expect this is the new base from which we grow. So still in the middle of the assessment. But that wouldn't be a bad thing. It would just be that, hey, it accelerated into this year. And you can really see that in our full year guide where our backlog in our full year guide is $1.5 billion in 2021. I mean, that tells you the strength of what we've been able to accomplish this year, and it's just a question of how much of that might have been pull forward from next year."

Can you provide a framework of how to think about potential implication on margin? Like is it typically a business that would be at average margins or below margin? And then I guess more broadly as sort of the combustion engine revenues maybe decline over time, while obviously growing trust on the electric vehicle side. How do you plan on managing the impact on profitability from essentially a declining very profitable business, either organically or through disposal? And then obviously, the growth in EV, which is at least initially doesn't necessarily have the scale for that."

I'd say some probably have below average company average margins, some might not. They might have at or even above the company average margins. Remember, when we're looking at the framework for what we don't think is a business or product that fits with BorgWarner longer term, it's a business or product that doesn't tick 1 or more of 3 boxes. We look and say, do we have product leadership in this space? Do we have medium- to long-term growth prospects? Do we have a strong margin profile? So you can have businesses that might have a solid or strong margin profile, but actually just don't have the growth prospects that we would expect or product leadership. That would be a candidate for disposition. 
At the same time, we have products that are undoubtedly below the average margin profile that are candidates for disposition. So when we, at Investor Day, talked about our longer-term margin guide, we contemplated the types of businesses that we thought would be included in our disposition strategy and still thought that over the longer term, that we would be in the double-digit margin range on a go-forward basis. That contemplates the dispositions. And it also contemplates the impact of growing the EV portfolio. And the one thing you have to keep in mind when we talk about the growth in the EV portfolio, the impact on our P&L is already in our results today. It's already there because we're investing over $200 million in R&D right now in our P&L in 2021. And we only have $300 million to $400 million of EV-related revenue in our P&L. So that's only a tailwind as we continue to grow that business going forward because we start to get contribution margin that's more than offsetting the incremental R&D as we look out over the coming years. 
So you can't look at that business and say, well, it's a negative margin business and I'm growing a negative bar of business. We're growing from where we are today and starting to generate the contribution margin on the incremental revenue that comes in the P&L. And the margin profiles of those businesses we feel very good about."

And as I mentioned, Q4 is supposed to be about $30 million to $40 million of that. So the bulk of the commodity headwind we've experienced has been in the back half of the year as opposed to the front half of the year. We started to see it a little bit in Q1, but it really started to accelerate in Q2. And in Q3 and Q4, again, Q3, $24 million; Q4, $30 million to $40 million. And so you can kind of do the math based on that and assume that if commodities remain at those types of levels, it's a year-over-year headwind as you look at Q1 to Q2. So that's what I would say, given where we stand at this point, those are the planning assumptions that we're using, but it remains to be seen where we actually end up. 
In terms of the other costs, TBD. Those are embedded in the P&L today in terms of our guide, in terms of the impact on us. I think the biggest impact, though, is what we're seeing at the moment is really the commodity headwind when we look at the impact on our financials this year."

Our typical pass-throughs, when you look at the blend of all the pass-through mechanisms we have contractually as it relates to steel, aluminum, nickel, copper, the things that we're most exposed to the contractual pass-throughs are about 50% on a fully blended basis. 
A couple of things to note about that. When we talk about the net commodity headwind that we've disclosed the $80 million to $90 million, that is on a net basis and so we've been executing at or around that 50% level thus far in our guidance this year, which means the gross impact of those commodity headwinds is roughly double what we talked about roughly. And so the $80 million to $90 million already contemplates recoveries in it. 
So as you think about how that translates into next year, maybe you get a little benefit from some of the lag that's in there, but we're already pretty close to 50%, I'd say, today. 
The second thing I would just note is when you get into more sustained inflationary environments of such a high degree like we're seeing there, it's not uncommon to see suppliers having conversations across the industry with customers about what to do beyond the contractual pass-through mechanism. So the 50% in what we're experiencing to date is really the contractual piece, and we'll see how long the inflationary environment last and at what level, and whether that warrants additional conversations that we or others have with the customer heading into next year."

25708,1682586088,2423154,"BorgWarner Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","BorgWarner Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. Let's start on Slide 5. We're very pleased to share our results for the third quarter and provide an overall company update. The third quarter operating environment was very challenged, both from an absolute volume",939,"Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. Let's start on Slide 5. We're very pleased to share our results for the third quarter and provide an overall company update. The third quarter operating environment was very challenged, both from an absolute volume perspective and in light of the production volatility we experienced throughout this quarter. Overall, we're doing a solid job managing the near-term environment while securing our future growth.  
With just over $3.4 billion in sales, our third quarter revenue decreased by about 7% organically. Excluding the year-over-year growth in our aftermarket business, our OEM business declined 9% compared to the 22% decline in our market during the quarter as we benefited from new business and favorable mix.  
Our margin and cash flow performance in the quarter was impacted by the volatile production environment, which put pressure on near-term cost containment and drove excess inventory within our plans. Even with those challenges, we're still on track to delivering a near double-digit operating margin for the full year. And we still expect full year free cash flow to be amongst the strongest results in our history.  
I want to thank all our employees and particularly our plant managers and plant management teams around the world who are working very hard to manage the short term and serve our customers. At the same time, we're very focused on ensuring that we secure our future. To that end, this past quarter, we won multiple new product awards for electric vehicles, which I will speak about in a few moments. As a result of these awards, along with wins in prior quarters, we are well on our way to achieving the organic electric vehicle 2025 revenue targets underlying our project CHARGING FORWARD. In fact, we estimate that more than 90% of that target is already booked. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6, where you can see our perspective on global industry production for the remainder of 2021. The market environment continues to be extremely volatile with the risk of future production disruption arising from ongoing supply constraints. With that in mind, on a full year basis, we now expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to be down 2.5% to flat year-over-year. This is down materially from our previous assumption, reflecting both the third quarter decline and our most recent expectations for the fourth quarter. 
As you can see from the line chart showing the different scenario, we do expect light vehicle industry production to improve sequentially Q3 to Q4. Underlying customer demand remains robust. However, just like we saw in the third quarter, industry production levels will be dependent on the varying impact of ongoing supply constraints and on the potential impact on our customer mix. 
Overall, we expect the challenging environment to continue throughout the remainder of 2021. And at this point, we think it will carry on well into 2022. As we manage this challenging environment, we're also continuing to focus on securing our mid- to long-term opportunities in electric vehicle. And we did just that during this quarter, securing several awards for electric vehicle programs. I'm very proud of the teams. 
Two of those awards are highlighted on Slide 7. First, we secured a major award for a North American inverter with a global OEM expected to launch in 2024. This high-voltage silicon carbide program is our largest inverter win to date. This business award also marks the company's first major win in the North American market. It will also be used in multiple battery electric vehicle platforms, including pass cars and trucks. 
Our product performance, scalability, cost competitiveness, size optimization and global manufacturing footprint, all contributed to securing this business win. Additionally, we announced a new 800-volt silicon carbide inverter award with a German OEM expected to launch in early 2025. This award expands our existing 400-volt inverter business with this same German customer by now adding 800-volt products. This new technology offers enhanced power density, proven performance and long-term reliability. 
Given these 2 new and significant inverter awards, I would like to give you an update on our positioning in the inverter market on Slide 8. We've had tremendous success establishing ourselves in this market. When I think about BorgWarner's competitive advantages in power electronics, it's driven by, first, the breadth of our product portfolio. This allows us to be faster and more effective at bringing products to market. Second, our ability to innovate, like with our Viper power module technology. We can continue our innovations in part due to our vertical integration strategy. We have in-house capabilities for power modules, integrated circuit development and software, which we feel are an advantage in the marketplace. 
And finally, I think the last driver is our ability to leverage the electronic scale that we already have across our company, and especially within our engine control units. The result is that we've secured significant new business award. And as you can see by the chart on the slide, we expect the business to grow rapidly from about 500,000 units in 2021 to 2.5 million units by 2025, representing about 50% CAGR. We expect this volume to drive total inverter sales of $1.7 billion by 2025 -- in 2025, sorry. And remember, these programs are already booked. 
We continue to pursue additional inverter opportunities with production volumes in 2025 and beyond, and would expect to secure more awards in the coming quarters. And one more thing, with the business we've already won, we believe that we are positioned to be the #1 noncaptive inverter producer globally by 2025. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin."

Let's turn to Slide 9. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q3, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of just under $3.6 billion, which includes a little over $1 billion of revenue from Delphi Techn",1145,"Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q3, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of just under $3.6 billion, which includes a little over $1 billion of revenue from Delphi Technologies. Next, you can see that foreign currencies increased revenue by about 2%. Then our organic revenue decline year-over-year was approximately 7% or almost 9%, excluding growth in our aftermarket segment. That compares to a 22% decrease in weighted average market production, which suggests that our outgrowth in the quarter was more than 13%. 
Now with that said, the significant volatility in production schedules and the varying levels of supply disruptions among our customers are continuing to make it difficult to draw conclusions from the quarterly outgrowth figures. Nonetheless, we were pleased that we delivered strong relative revenue performance in all 3 major markets despite the overall decline in revenue. 
Regionally, in Europe, we outperformed, driven by new business in small gasoline turbochargers and fuel injection products. In China, we also outperformed the market, driven by the resilience in the former Delphi businesses. And in North America, we outperformed the market, primarily due to new business as well as vehicle and customer mix. The sum of all these was just over $3.4 billion of revenue in Q3. 
Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 10. Our third quarter adjusted operating income was $311 million compared to pro forma operating income of $396 million last year. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 9.1%. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of AKASOL, adjusted operating income decreased $79 million on $261 million of lower sales. That translates to a decremental margin of approximately 30%. 
This higher than typical decremental margin was primarily driven by $24 million of higher commodity costs, net of customer recoveries. Excluding these higher commodity costs, our year-over-year decremental margin was approximately 19%, which we view as a sign that we're effectively managing our operating cost performance in spite of the supply chain disruptions. 
Moving on to cash flow. We consumed $10 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. This was worse than our expectations going into the quarter due to lower-than-expected operating income as well as higher-than-planned inventories. Fundamentally, when production declines this rapidly and expectedly, it's difficult to get inventory out of the system in the near term. We expect inventory to improve in the coming quarters once we see less volatility in production orders, which will give us the ability to rightsize our supply chain demands accordingly. 
Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 11. We now expect our end markets to be down 2.5% to flat for the year. Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 1,000 basis points. This contemplates the strong performance to date with a sequential step down in the fourth quarter as we expect to return to more normalized year-over-year outgrowth in Q4. Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase approximately 8.5% to 11% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. 
Then adding an expected $425 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies and an expected $70 million related to the acquisition of AKASOL, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.4 billion to $14.7 billion. This wide revenue guidance range reflects the continued production uncertainty we have in the fourth quarter. 
From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 9.6% to 10.0% compared to a pro forma 2020 margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi-related cost synergies and purchase price accounting. 
From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance continues to include $100 million to $105 million of incremental benefit in 2021, the same as our prior guidance. Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $3.65 to $3.95 per diluted share. 
And finally, we expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the range of $600 million to $700 million for the full year. The reduction versus our prior guidance is a little larger than our projected decline in operating income as we expect inventory to remain higher than usual through the fourth quarter. Then once we head into 2022, we expect to start to see reductions in inventory towards more normalized levels. That's our 2021 outlook. 
Let's turn to Slide 12. Given the uncertain outlook for the remainder of 2021, we felt it appropriate to provide you with some of our initial thoughts on some key financial drivers and strategic priorities heading into 2022. 
Starting with our top line. As of right now, we do expect to see supply chain challenges, particularly with respect to semiconductors, continue well into 2022. Ultimately, where full year 2022 industry production shakes out will depend on the scope and duration of these challenges. But at this point, we would still expect a modest level of growth in industry production next year. 
Next, we expect to deliver outgrowth in 2022. However, we're currently assessing the extent to which the much stronger-than-expected outgrowth in 2021 will result in any headwind to our outgrowth next year. 
From a cost perspective, we expect incremental Delphi-related cost synergies in the $40 million to $45 million range, and we also expect incremental restructuring savings of $40 million to $50 million. These combined savings are expected to largely offset our estimated increase in R&D spending of approximately $100 million. We're planning for this significant increase in R&D spending in order to support the new business wins we've achieved to date and to pursue additional EV opportunities consistent with our CHARGING FORWARD organic growth objectives. 
And finally, we're building our plans based on the assumption that we'll see sustained levels of commodity inflation continuing into 2022, which means we expect that to create a year-over-year headwind during the first and second quarters. That's the near term. But while we're managing the near term, we're also focused on securing our long-term future. 
So consistent with our CHARGING FORWARD initiative, we have 3 key strategic priorities heading into next year. First, we plan to continue to pursue and secure additional electric vehicle awards for both components and systems. Second, we intend to execute additional M&A to accelerate our positioning in electric vehicles. 
And finally, we expect to complete the disposition of approximately $1 billion in combustion revenue. Ultimately, it's the pillars of near-term execution, securing future profitable growth and disciplined inorganic investments that will drive the success of our strategy and thus drive value creation for our shareholders. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Fred."

I'm now really excited to share an update of our progress towards our project CHARGING FORWARD targets on Slide 13. And as evidenced by our program announcements over the past several quarters, including the 2 wins that I alluded to earlier, we're making significant progress on the organic growth in electric vehicles underlying our CHARGING FORWARD plan. 
As of this call, we have now booked electric vehicle programs leading to about $2.3 billion of revenue in 2025. Or to put it another way, with this booked business, we're more than 90% of the way towards our $2.5 billion organic revenue target we gave you back in March. The breakdown of these programs is highlighted on the chart to the left. We're excited about the mix of both components and system awards. And importantly, our book business is across all major regions with leading OEMs. Plus we expect to add to this booked business portfolio over the next quarters by securing additional EV awards with 2025 revenues. And then we will supplement this organically developed revenue with EV revenues from AKASOL and any future acquisitions. 
The takeaway from today is this. It's a challenging near-term environment. Once again, BorgWarner is successfully managing the present and delivering solid financial results. At the same time, we're delivering our future. We're doing this by establishing product leadership and winning new business in the world of electrification.

But as you step into Q4, our implicit guide is somewhere of outgrowth in the range of 7.5% to 8.5%. So sequentially, actually, it's a revenue headwind, even though market production is up. So when you look at our revenue, our revenue actually is under more pressure on a sequential basis. 
The other thing you have is commodities are still a continuing headwind and that's true on a sequential basis, where it steps up probably in the range of $5 million to $15 million going from Q3 to Q4. So I'd say those are a couple of the big drivers."

I think I'd refer you to the slide that we had provided back at our Investor Day because I think that's a good way to think about it, which showed how R&D right now is heavy, particularly relative to the revenue that we have when we're running at $300 million or $400 million of EV revenue, but we're investing of that $725 million of R&D this year, around 1/3 of that being focused on the e-product portfolio. Obviously, that math doesn't work from a near-term profitability perspective. 
As we go out over time, we start to launch some of these programs from an EV perspective, the EV businesses start to get some real gross margin and contribution margin that starts to help to fund on its own, some of those R&D investments. So R&D is continuing to ramp over the next few years. But ultimately, that contribution margin is coming on more quickly, and you start to get the leverage that we -- that you alluded to. And you can see, as we laid out in that Investor Day deck, by the time you get to call it 2024-ish time frame is when we start to cross and you start to see profitability on a stand-alone basis as the contribution margin on an incremental sale starts to overtake the R&D investments that we're making. 
And I would say, as you think about that for the long term, as we think about the steady state for that business, the margin profile of that business, we think, is a good margin business. It's just that we're in growth mode for a long period of time. So until you stop the growth, you never fully offset the R&D from a normal operating margin perspective. You're always continuing to invest as long as we're growing, but we start to get the real leverage in the coming years here."

It's not -- I would not call that the signature product. When you look at Slide 13, you have other products in the mix. It's true that this product has a high content per vehicle, but we're very successful with systems IDMs. We've announced quite a few wins and more to come, very successful with the surrounding of the batteries. Needless to say that Slide 13 does not include AKASOL because we don't totally own it yet. We are on the squeeze out period. So it's not a 1 product. It is -- there are a lot of products in the world of electric vehicles that we are excelling at. 
Now inverters, as I mentioned in prior calls, are the products that are outsourced by our customers by the vast majority because it's very, very complex to do. It requires a lot of scale in electronics, a lot of vertical integration. And so we're very successful with that. 
On motors, we are embedding our own motors in our IDMs. We're also selling stand-alone motors. I would say that the market in motors is still more fragmented than the competitors and inverters that is becoming more and more concentrated.

And then on the gross over market side, to what extent some of the growth that you saw this year, I mean, I guess, what would be a cause for it coming out of next year's growth?"

On the outlook for next year, obviously, still early days, and we're still operating in a very volatile environment as evidenced by the fact that we still got a $300 million revenue range on our Q4 revenue outlook. And so that",458,"Yes. So a couple of things. On the outlook for next year, obviously, still early days, and we're still operating in a very volatile environment as evidenced by the fact that we still got a $300 million revenue range on our Q4 revenue outlook. And so that just gives you an indication as to the volatility in the environment. 
And as we look out into 2022 from where we sit today, we don't see a rapid solution to the semiconductor challenges and a sudden snapback in volume -- market volumes coming. So our expectation is that there's going to be continuing impact of the supply chain disruptions well into 2022. And so that's why we're suggesting, given where we sit today, we expect that, that probably translates to modest growth from a year-over-year production perspective. But I'd say sitting here in early November, trying to project what next year looks like when we're still struggling with Q4 production, it's pretty challenging to project right now. But we don't see necessarily an end in the near term in terms of some of the supply chain disruptions, which might be a little bit different than some others who are guiding to a much more rapid recovery. 
In terms of the outgrowth, it starts with, well, what was your outgrowth in 2021 and how much of that might have been effectively a pull forward or a bet that you would have otherwise expected over the couple of years. So the fact that we outgrew the market based on our guidance or expect to outgrow the market by 10% in 2021, that's obviously not a normal outgrowth for this company. We're happy with it, but it suggests to us that knowing that we normally grow in the mid-single-digit range or at least half for the last number of years, that some of that may have been a pull forward of things we would have otherwise expected in 2022. But we're in the middle of that assessment right now. 
We're in the middle of our long-range planning process and really understanding in this volatile environment. How much of that is a headwind in next year's year-over-year outgrowth versus we expect this is the new base from which we grow. So still in the middle of the assessment. But that wouldn't be a bad thing. It would just be that, hey, it accelerated into this year. And you can really see that in our full year guide where our backlog in our full year guide is $1.5 billion in 2021. I mean, that tells you the strength of what we've been able to accomplish this year, and it's just a question of how much of that might have been pull forward from next year."

Can you provide a framework of how to think about potential implication on margin? Like is it typically a business that would be at average margins or below margin? And then I guess more broadly as sort of the combustion engine revenues maybe decline over time, while obviously growing fast on the electric vehicle side. How do you plan on managing the impact on profitability from essentially a declining very profitable business, either organically or through disposal? And then obviously, the growth in EV, which is at least initially doesn't necessarily have the scale for that."

So the margin profile of the businesses and products that we would consider for disposition, it depends. I'd say some probably have below average company average margins, some might not.

I'd say some probably have below average company average margins, some might not. They might have at or even above the company average margins. Remember, when we're looking at the framework for what we don't think is a business or product that fits with BorgWarner longer term, it's a business or product that doesn't tick 1 or more of 3 boxes. We look and say, do we have product leadership in this space? Do we have medium- to long-term growth prospects? Do we have a strong margin profile? So you can have businesses that might have a solid or strong margin profile, but actually just don't have the growth prospects that we would expect or product leadership. That would be a candidate for disposition. 
At the same time, we have products that are undoubtedly below the average margin profile that are candidates for disposition. So when we, at Investor Day, talked about our longer-term margin guide, we contemplated the types of businesses that we thought would be included in our disposition strategy and still thought that over the longer term, that we would be in the double-digit margin range on a go-forward basis. That contemplates the dispositions. And it also contemplates the impact of growing the EV portfolio. And the one thing you have to keep in mind when we talk about the growth in the EV portfolio, the impact on our P&L is already in our results today. It's already there because we're investing over $200 million in R&D right now in our P&L in 2021. And we only have $300 million to $400 million of EV-related revenue in our P&L. So that's only a tailwind as we continue to grow that business going forward because we start to get contribution margin that's more than offsetting the incremental R&D as we look out over the coming years. 
So you can't look at that business and say, well, it's a negative margin business and I'm growing a negative margin business. We're growing from where we are today and starting to generate the contribution margin on the incremental revenue that comes into the P&L. And the margin profiles of those businesses we feel very good about."

And then moving to '22, I get the tough comps. I think what people are sort of trying to understand is like, is that going to be -- does that mean like back to your sort of mid-single-digit target?

So we're in the process of assessing, okay, what do we think 2022 looks like? And versus that 10%, okay, are we back to the average? Or is it slightly below the average? I don't think where we sit today, we're expecting to be delivering 10% growth above market again. So it's a matter of a question of, are we back to the normal growth rates that we've delivered over the last few years or that we have projected before?

So the bulk of the commodity headwind we've experienced has been in the back half of the year as opposed to the front half of the year. We started to see it a little bit in Q1, but it really started to accelerate in Q2. And in Q3 and Q4, again, Q3, $24 million; Q4, $30 million to $40 million.

A couple of things to note about that. When we talk about the net commodity headwind that we've disclosed the $80 million to $90 million, that is on a net basis and so we've been executing at or around that 50% level thus far in our guidance this year, which means the gross impact of those commodity headwinds is roughly double what we talked about roughly. And so the $80 million to $90 million already contemplates recoveries in it. 
So as you think about how that translates into next year, maybe you get a little benefit from some of the lag that's in there, but we're already pretty close to 50%, I'd say, today. 
The second thing I would just note is when you get into more sustained inflationary environments of such a high degree like we're seeing there, it's not uncommon to see suppliers having conversations across the industry with customers about what to do beyond the contractual pass-through mechanism. So the 50% in what we're experiencing to date is really the contractual piece, and we'll see how long the inflationary environment last and at what level, and whether that warrants additional conversations that we or others have with the customer heading into next year."
