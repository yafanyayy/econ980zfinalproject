Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our 2020 review and future outlook. PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.65 per share. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year rose by 4.",2653,"Thank you, Carlotta. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our 2020 review and future outlook. PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.65 per share. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year rose by 4.6% to $3.43 per share and marked the 16th year in a row that PSEG delivered results within our original earnings guidance. PSEG's GAAP results were $0.85 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $0.86 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, for the full year, PSEG reported 2020 net income of $3.76 per share compared with $3.33 per share in 2019. Details on the results for the quarter and the full year can be found on Slides 12 and 14. 
I am pleased to report that PSEG's fourth quarter and full year results reflected solid contributions from both PSE&G and PSEG Power, and I'm particularly proud of the achievements of our employees during this past year as it was one of the most challenging and recent memory. Their efforts have kept our customers connected to essential energy services to power their homes, businesses and vitally important institutions. We have also made steady progress on several key business priorities, the most important of which is our transition to becoming primarily a regulated utility with contracted generation comprised of our zero-carbon nuclear fleet and future investments in regional offshore wind. In the past 6 months, we've announced the exploration of strategic alternatives for PSEG Power's 7,200-plus megawatts of nonnuclear generating assets, and have received initial indications of interest for both the fossil and solar source assets. PSE&G successfully initiated its landmark Clean Energy Future program, securing approval to spend nearly $2 billion in energy efficiency, smart meter installations and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, all of which will enhance New Jersey's environmental profile for years to come. In addition, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, I will refer to them as the BPU, recently concluded public hearings regarding PSEG nuclear's application to extend the zero-emission certificate, I think I'll shorten that to ZEC from now, on through May 2025. Our surface area experienced milder than normal weather during the fourth quarter, bookending the weak heating season of the first quarter in 2020. Regarding weather-normalized sales for the year, while total electric sales volume declined by 2%, gas sales rose by 1%. 
In both the electric and gas businesses, higher residential usage of approximately 5%, largely offset declines in commercial and industrial sales, resulting in stable margins overall. 
Working with COVID-19 health and safety protocols since last March, PSE&G was able to execute on its planned $2.7 billion capital spending program in 2020. These capital programs provide a critical investment to support the New Jersey economy, particularly in the early months of the pandemic and preserved essential jobs while replacing widely important energy infrastructure and generating customer benefits of improved reliability and resiliency as well as methane reduction. In January of 2021, the BPU approved 2 settlements with PSE&G and other parties in the Clean Energy Future Energy Cloud and Electric Vehicle proceedings. The Energy Cloud investment program is estimated to be approximately $707 million over the next 4 years, and will result in a replacement of over 2 million electric meters with smart meters. The Electric Vehicle program will direct $166 million into EV charging infrastructure over the next 6 years. With these recent settlements, the BPU has constructively addressed the vast majority of the Clean Energy Future filing, and has approved nearly $2 billion of investment to help realize New Jersey's energy goals. The energy efficiency program will also establish clean energy job training for over 3,200 direct jobs, while enabling the avoidance of 8 million metric tons of carbon emissions through the year 2050. Investing in energy efficiency programs is the most cost-effective solution to reducing carbon emissions. Importantly, the conservation incentive of the settlement encourages the broad adoption of energy efficiency, with certain programs focusing on low and moderate-income customers that will lower bills for participating customers. We expect the balance of the Clean Energy Future filing, which includes our request to spend under $200 million on energy storage and a few remaining EV programs will be addressed following future stakeholder proceedings. 
PSE&G continues to engage with the BPU staff and Rate Counsel to advance confidential discussions toward a settlement of the return on equity-related to PSE&G formula rate for transmission overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The annual update under PSE&G's existing formula rate filed last October, was implemented this past January, and together, with cost reallocation of our revenue requirements for certain transmission projects, candidly, to customers outside of our zone. This resulted in a net reduction in PSE&G customer costs. For 2020, PSE&G once again achieved top quartile OSHA scores for [indiscernible]. We also achieved the top quartile J.D. Power Ranking in the Eastern large company category. For both residential electric and gas companies. And PSE&G posted its best-ever J.D. Power Scores for electric and gas customer satisfaction, outpacing the average industry results on metrics that consider total monthly cost, bill clarity, fairness of pricing and options and ability to manage monthly usage among residential customers. Also for the 19th year in a row, PA Consulting recognized PSE&G with its reliability 1 award as the most reliable electric utility in the Mid-Atlantic region and for the first time, with their 2020 outstanding customer engagement award. New Jersey has recently made solid progress in lowering its COVID-19 positivity rates and continues a Phase 3 opening of businesses, schools and other activities. We have a long history of partnering with the state to support the economy, and we continue to work with them on investment programs that can spur economic development and employment recovery all while being quite thoughtful about managing customer rate impacts. 
Regarding collection activity. The more [indiscernible] on shutoffs residential electric and gas service is currently scheduled to conclude in March. Recognizing the economic hardship that many of our customers continue to face, PSE&G, in partnership with the BPU and community groups, is working hard to enroll customers and customer payment support programs, such as LIHEAP and deferred payment or rates. When the moratorium is lifted, we will work closely with the BPU, other stakeholders and our customers to ensure a collections process that supports our customers' individual situations. 
Turning now to PSEG Power. We're continuing all activities related to the exploration of strategic alternatives we announced last July. In the fourth quarter of last year, we launched the formal sales processes of the 467-megawatt solar source and over 6,750-megawatt [indiscernible] portfolios. We are currently evaluating indications of interest, and believe we are on track to announce an outcome in the second half of 2021. 
As we launched the strategic alternatives initiative last year and throughout the process thus far, PSEG Power has continued to deliver on expectations for non-GAAP operating earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Last year, PSEG Fossil posted one of its best operational performance records ever, and completed its entire maintenance outage schedule without any OSHA safety violations. In addition, PSEG Nuclear completed 2 complex refueling outages in 2020 with new COVID-19 safety protocols and continue its overall outstanding operating performance. These achievements speak volumes about the professionalism of our dedicated workforce that exemplifies our focus on safety and operational excellence. 
PSEG Nuclear's zero-emission certificate application in the extension of the current ZEC is currently under consideration at the BPU. Last month, the BPU staff consultant released their preliminary findings. The consultant found that all 3 of our New Jersey units were eligible, recognizing that each unit had a financial need for ZECs. There were other aspects of the preliminary findings that we view as inconsistent with the ZEC law, and we look forward to upcoming hearings where we will have the opportunity to address those items. It is clear that New Jersey recognizes the need for nuclear power in order to achieve its short and long-term clean energy goals. As laid out in the state's own energy master plan, and DEP's 80x50 Report. The recent weather-related power and market values in Texas and California further underscore the importance of maintaining New Jersey's reliable resource mix. Over the next few weeks, you will hear us mention that our confidential filings show that these units are actually in need of more than $10 per megawatt-hour, partly due to the fact that PJM forward market prices are lower versus 2018, which was the year of our first ZEC application. As stated in the 2018 ZEC law, nuclear operating risk and market risk must be recognized as a cost in any economic determination of ZEC eligibility. We have responded to all information requests and a shared confidential financial information with Rate Council on the PJM independent market monitor in order to support transparency around this important proceeding. In the absence of an extension of the current ZEC, we would not continue to operate the plant. While the direction of public policy, both in New Jersey and in the nation, is the increased recognition of carbon-free energy to mitigate climate change, that realization in the form of a future price on carbon is highly uncertain at best. With the final decision on the ZEC application expected on April 27, we are hopeful that the BPU will act to extend the $10 per megawatt-hour attribute payment to preserve the nuclear units, and their 3,400 megawatts of zero-carbon baseload generation through May of 2025. 
The DEP is also moving forward with its investigation of resource adequacy and the potential for the creation of fixed resource -- on a fixed resource requirement service area within New Jersey, I'm just going to call that FRR in the future. We have maintained the mutual stance and the potential of an alternative capacity procurement paradigm but remains supportive of accommodations that enables state-supported resources to qualify as capacity that can satisfy both the state's capacity obligations and its clean energy goals. As we've previously stated, the current minimum offer floor prices are not expected to prevent either our nuclear or gas-fired units from clearing in the upcoming PJM capacity auction scheduled for this May. 
Now let me turn my attention to 2021 guidance. We are introducing non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.35 to $3.55 per share, with the utility expected to contribute between $1,410 million and $1,470 million; PSEG Power between $280 million and $370 million; and parent other is expected to post a loss of $15 million. 
This year, we expect PSE&G to contribute just over 80% of consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings at the midpoint of guidance. Going forward, we expect that the utility earnings will represent 80% to 90% of PSEG's non-GAAP results, with the remaining balance expected to be comprised of long-term agreements for zero-carbon offshore wind generation and our ZEC-supported New Jersey nuclear units. For PSEG Power, over 70% of its 2021 gross margin has been secured by way of energy hedges, capacity revenues established in prior auctions, zero-emission certificates, and ancillary service payments. However, for 2021, recontracting at lower market prices, higher costs tied to a Hope Creek refueling outage and the absence of tax benefits realized in 2020 result in the lower non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for 2021. Our PSEG 5-year capital spending forecast has been updated from $14 billion to $16 billion for 2021 through 2025, and includes approximately $2 billion of clean energy future investments as well as the expected extension of the gas system modernization program and energy efficiency program at their average annual run rates for the last 2 years of the period, that being 2024 and 2025. Consistent with past years, approximately 90% or $13 billion to $15 billion is capital program that will be directed to grow regulated operations at PSE&G. This ongoing investment in essential energy infrastructure and clean energy programs is expected to produce 6.5% to 8% compound annual growth in rate base over the 5-year period, starting from $22 billion at year-end 2020. 
On Slide 10, we've provided you with an ultimate view of our updated capital for 2021 through 2025. We've classified it by investments in decarbonization, energy transition, climate adaptation for resilience and reliability and methane reduction. As a side bar, any spend for offshore wind will be incremental to these totals, and is not included in the $14 billion to $16 billion capital plan notes. We also expect that our strong cash flow will enable us to fund our entire 5-year capital spending program as well as our planned offshore wind investments during the '21 through '25 period, without the need to issue new equity. As we continue to plan from the responsible reentry to our offices and facilities currently targeted for this July, I have to thank our dedicated employees for their professionalism, persistence and flexibility over the past year. Whether responding to a myriad of COVID-19 challenges, or their excellent injury-free response to the North-Eastern that we just experienced this past month, employees across our organization has embodied operational excellence as they provide our New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Mid-Atlantic customers with reliable essential energy services. 
Before moving to Dan's financial review, I will summarize the new initiatives in place for future growth and areas of our continued strategic focus. These range from the new clean energy future investments behind-the-meter to infrastructure opportunities supporting electrification of transportation, and a growing mix of renewables in the distribution system to expanding the existing aging infrastructure replacement programs to assist the New Jersey economic recovery. In addition, we are advancing the strategic alternative exploration through a robust bidding process, pursuing near-term opportunities to expand our offshore wind investments in the Mid-Atlantic and are engaged in ongoing efforts to preserve the New Jersey nuclear fleet, the most cost-effective and most reliable source of baseload supply to reduce emissions. Each of these actions served to further PSEG's already strong ESG leadership position, which we continuously strive to improve. In 2020, we moved to decarbonize our generating fleet, announced an investment in New Jersey offshore wind and initiated a landmark energy and efficiency investment to bring universal access to a broad range of clean energy opportunities. In 2021, we joined the company network of the series organization at CERES to advance our climate advocacy. We will achieve a coal free generating fleet in June, and we recently published our first ESG performance report. PSEG is getting recognized for our ESG initiatives by Standard & Poor's, who has included us in their 2021 sustainability yearbook. And by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, who was named PSEG and to the North American index for 13 years in a row. We were also gratified to be named to the 2021 listing of America's most responsible companies by Newsweek magazine, and the Forbes List of Best Employers for Diversity in 2020 and Best Employers for Veterans in 2020. 
The Board of Directors' recent decision to increase the company's common dividend to the indicative annual level of $2.04 per share is the 17th increase in the last 18 years, and reflects our ongoing commitment to returning capital to our shareholders to enhance our total return profile as we also pursue growth. There is no lack of opportunity for PSEG as we continue the transformation to a primarily regulated electric and gas utility, focused on clean energy infrastructure, complemented with contracted zero-carbon generation. We are working towards a sustainable future where customers universally use less energy. The energy they use is cleaner and its delivery is more reliable and more resilient. We are confident that pursuing this strategy will enhance our ability to provide our customers with essential energy services, which has been our core mission for the last 118 years. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dan for more details on our operating results, and I'll be available with him for your questions after his remarks."

Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everybody. As Ralph said, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $0.65 per share, and we've provided you with information on Slides 12 and 14 regarding the contribution of non-",2138,"Terrific. Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everybody. As Ralph said, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $0.65 per share, and we've provided you with information on Slides 12 and 14 regarding the contribution of non-GAAP operating earnings by business for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2020. 
Slides 13 and 15 contain waterfall charts that take you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating earnings by major business. 
I'll now review each company in more detail, starting with PSE&G. PSE&G's net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased by $0.04 and to $0.58 per share compared with net income of $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019, as shown on Slide 17. For the full year, PSE&G's net income increased by $0.16 per share or 6.5% compared with 2019 results. This improvement reflects an 8% increase in rate base at year-end 2020 to just over $22 billion, which, as we note on Slide 22, does not include approximately $1.8 billion of construction work in progress or CWIP, that's mostly a transmission. The continued growth in utility earnings resulting from investments in transmission added $0.02 per share versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Gas margin was $0.02 favorable, reflecting GSMP roll-ins and higher weather-normalized volume. Electric margin was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 as higher weather-normalized volumes were offset by lower demand. Mild temperatures during the quarter had a negative $0.03 per share impact mostly reflecting recovery limitations under the earnings test of the gas weather normalization [ loss ]. 
O&M expense was flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Higher distribution depreciation expense of $0.01 per share offset lower pension expense of $0.01 per share in the quarter. Taxes and other were $0.03 per share favorable, partly reversing the negative $0.07 per share impact that the timing of taxes had on third quarter 2020 net income. Recall in the third quarter, flowthrough taxes and other items lowered net income by $0.07 per share compared to the third quarter of 2019, and we indicated at that time that about half of the $0.07 would reverse in the fourth quarter. The balance is related to bad debts, which we anticipate reversing in the future based upon the timing of actual write-offs. Early winter weather in the fourth quarter as measured by the heating degree dates was 9% milder than normal and 14% milder than in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, PSE&G's weather-normalized residential electric sales increased by 5.6% due to the COVID-19 work-from-home impact, but a larger decline in commercial sales resulted in total electric sales declining by 2%. Total weather-normalized gas sales were up 1.2% for 2020, but by a 4.9% increase in residential use, partially offset by a smaller decline in the commercial and industrial segment. For both electric and gas sales, higher residential usage largely offset declines in commercial and industrial sales, resulting in stable margins overall. PSE&G invested $700 million in the fourth quarter as part of its 2020 capital investment program of approximately $2.7 billion, directed to infrastructure upgrades of transmission and distribution facilities to maintain reliability, increase resiliency, make life cycle replacements and clean energy investments. PSE&G's updated 5-year capital spending plan includes investing $2.7 billion in 2021. And as detailed on Slide 21, approximately $960 million is allocated to transmission; $700 million to electric distribution, which includes approximately $200 million for Energy Strong II; $875 million to gas distribution, which includes over $400 million for GSMP II; and $200 million for new clean energy future EE programs and the beginning of the AMI rollout. The clean energy future EE investment will ramp up to approximately $125 million in 2021. And before reaching a full annual run rate of about $350 million in 2023. 
As Ralph mentioned, the BPU approved 2 CEF settlements in January, totaling approximately $875 million, covering energy cloud and electric vehicle investments. The capital and operating costs of these programs will begin to be recovered in PSE&G's next rate proceeding expected to be filed in the second half of 2023. From the start of the programs until the commencement of new base rates estimated in late 2024, the return of and on capital will be included for recovery in these rates as well as operating costs, and stranded costs associated with the retirement of the existing leaders. Of these amounts, the vast majority, about 90%, receives contemporaneous or near contemporaneous for regulatory treatment either through the FERC formula rate or clause recovery mechanisms or recovering rates as replacement spend or new business. 
As Ralph also mentioned, we continue settlement discussions with the BPU staff and Rate Counsel regarding our FERC transmission return on equity. Although our forecast for 2021 assumes a resolution effective in the near term, those discussions remain confidential and ongoing. 
PSE&G net income for 2021 is forecasted at $1,410 million to $1,470 million, which reflects an assumed reduction of our transmission formula rate as well as incremental investment in T&D infrastructure and energy efficiency. 
So moving to Power. PSEG Power reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter, unchanged from the non-GAAP results in the fourth quarter of 2019. Results for the quarter brought Power's full year non-GAAP operating earnings to $430 million or $0.84 per share compared with 2019's non-GAAP results of $409 million or $0.81 per share. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA totaled $182 million for the quarter and $990 million for the full year of 2020, and this compares to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $198 million, and $1,035 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, respectively. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense. 
The earnings release and the waterfall on Slides 13 and 15 provide you with a detailed analysis of the items having an impact on PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings relative to net income quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year from changes in revenue and costs. We've also provided you with added detail on generation for the fourth quarter and full year on Slide 26. 
PSEG Power's fourth quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were aided by the scheduled increase in PSEG Power's average capacity prices in PJM covering the second half of 2020, and higher gas operations, which resulted in improved non-GAAP operating earnings comparisons of $0.04 and $0.01 per share, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. However, lower generation output and recontracting at lower market prices reduced non-GAAP operating earnings by a total of $0.08 per share versus the year ago quarter. A decline in O&M expenses in the quarter improved results by $0.01 per share, and reflects the absence of the Hope Creek refueling outage that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019. The extension of the Peach Bottom nuclear operating licenses contributed to lower depreciation expense of $0.01 per share, and lower taxes improved non-GAAP operating earnings by $0.01 over the year ago quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was $32 a megawatt hour, a $1 per megawatt hour improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019, mainly reflecting the scheduled increase in capacity prices that began June 1, 2020, and remain in place through May of 2021. For the full year 2020, gross margin was flat at $32 per megawatt hour compared to full year 2019. Mild fall temperatures and holiday related spikes and COVID-19 positivity rates, dampened market demand in New Jersey have kept power prices and natural gas prices lower than the quarter and year ago comparisons. 
So let's turn to Power's operations. Total output from power's generating facilities declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. And planned outages at Fossil and an extended average at the Salem 1 nuclear unit reduced fourth quarter generation levels compared to the fourth quarter 2019. However, full year 2020 output of 53 terawatt hours came in above our 50- to 52-terawatt-hour forecast. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 78.9% in the quarter and 90.3% for the full year, producing nearly 31 terawatt hours of zero-carbon baseload power. The combined cycle fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 46.2% in the quarter and 48.3% for the full year, generating approximately 22 terawatt hours in 2020. The 3 newest combined cycle generating units at Keys, Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor V posted an average capacity factor of over 75% for the full year 2020. And this coming June, PSEG Power will complete the planned early retirement of the 383-megawatt coal-fired Bridgeport Harbor 3 generating station, eliminating the last coal unit and power sleep. 
For 2021, Power has hedged approximately 90% to 95% of its expected output of 48 to 50 terawatt hours at an average price of $32 per megawatt hour, which represents an approximately $2 per megawatt hour decline from 2020. In addition, 2021 average hedge prices no longer include cost based transmission charges for New Jersey's basic generation service contracts due to a change in how they are built and collected. This change further reduces revenues by approximately $3 per megawatt hour, starting on February 1, 2021, and is offset on the cost side, so there's no P&L impact as a result. 
We're forecasting 2021 non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA at PSEG Power to be $280 million to $370 million, and $850 million to $950 million, respectively. Power segment guidance reflects a full year of fossil and solar operations, lower expected generation volume and lower market prices, as well as the absence of a onetime tax benefit realized in 2020. 
Now let me briefly address operating results from enterprise and other, which reported a net loss that increased by $0.03 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, and reflects lower tax benefits compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and lower results from PSEG Long Island. Regarding PSEG Long Island, following several challenges related to our response to tropical storm Isaias, we've made significant improvements in our outage management, telephony, business continuity and other systems and processes. The Long Island Power Authority filed a complaint against PSEG Long Island in New York State Court last December, alleging multiple breaches of the operating services agreement, or OSA, in connection with PSEG Long Island's preparation and response to tropical storm Isaias. We are in discussions with LIPA to address their concerns, which could include potential amendments to our OSA with LIPA and to resolve all claims. As a reminder, our 12-year contract is scheduled to run through 2025. We are committed to addressing the identified performance issues and to continue our strong track record of performance for Long Island's customers since taking over operations. 
For 2021, PSEG Enterprise and other is forecasted to have a net loss of $15 million as parent financing and other costs exceed earnings from PSEG volume. 
PSEG ended 2020 with approximately $3.8 billion of available liquidity, including cash on hand of $543 million and debt representing 52% of our consolidated capital. In December, PSEG issued $96 million or 8.63% senior notes due April 2031 in exchange for a [indiscernible] amount of 8.63% senior notes due April 2031, originally issued at Power, which were canceled following the completion of the exchange. PSEG also retired a $700 million term loan at maturity. Power's debt as a percentage of capital declined to 27% on December 31, to 28% at September 30. 
To summarize, non-GAAP results for the quarter were $0.65 per share; full year 2020 non-GAAP operating earnings were $3.43 per share; and as we move into 2021, our guidance for the year is $3.35 to $3.55 per share; with regulated operations expected to contribute over 80% of consolidated results. The range for 2021 reflects incremental investment in our T&D infrastructure and a ramp-up of the new Clean Energy Future programs as well as an assumed reduction, return on equity of our transmission formula rate during the year at PSE&G and a full year of fossil and solar operations at PSEG Power. PSEG also raised its common dividend by $0.08 per share for the indicative annual level of $2.04, a [ 4% ] increase over 2020. The 2021 indicative rate continues to represent a conservative 59% payout of consolidated earnings at the midpoint of 2021 guidance, and utility earnings alone are expected to cover 140% of the dividend at the midpoint of 2021 guidance. We still expect our strong cash flow will enable us to fully fund PSEG's 5 year $14 billion to $16 billion capital investment program as well as our planned offshore wind investment during the 2021 to 2025 period without the need to issue new equity.

Our near-death experience in January of 2014 with our own pool of vortex really has winterized these assets in a way that I'm sure Texas will now follow suit with. So no, Texas has not had any impact on us. I do -- I don't apologize for not being able to give more information. We will give greater clarity sometime in the summer, I'm sure, as we get past around 2 bids. But so far, no surprises.

I think at the end of the day, our #1 growth engine remains rate-based growth in PSE&G. Having said that, there is a window of opportunity here to stay aggressively pursue offshore wind, and we don't want to have ourselves excluded from that. I think the commercial risk is completely mitigated by the PPA or the orders, and the operational risk is mitigated by making sure you partner with a world-class partner, and we think we have that in Ørsted. So the risk profile is something that we're now comfortable with. It took us the better part of, I guess, was close to 2 years of us kind of inching along, and we're very grateful for Ørsted's patience. But on the transmission side, I think the risk-rewards, we're very comfortable with -- always was, and on the wind farm side, having the right partner mitigates that.

But you could see more of the 69 KV upgrade and just the transmission budget coming up as we get more knowledgeable about what the grid status is. I think one of the areas, though, that we are increasingly paying attention to, and it's difficult to quantify, is as a result of the pandemic, I believe long term, patterns, lifestyle patters are going to change. I know at PSEG, we're already telling our employees that many more of them will be able to work from home. The combination of the household becoming now place of business and greater penetration of electric vehicles, which are charged at the household, and the growth of electric devices in the home, whether it's smart devices, communication devices, is really changing the whole calculus behind the importance of reliability into the home. So I'm right now in the office with Dan and Carlotta, and we've got multiple 26 KV feeds into this building because New York is a commercial center for New Jersey. That's true in New Brunswick and many other downtown commercial areas about New Jersey, that's not true in my home. And it's not true in anybody's hole New Jersey. So the need to invest in the last mile to reflect the reliability expectations as the home becomes a commercial center, and really a bunch of small business operations is a public policy discussion that I think is just beginning to take place, and there's no way reflected in our numbers. So I'd say you'll see those numbers come up in the future. They always come up in the future, either because we'll just get smarter about the traditional stuff we need to do or there's this whole last mile question that will make you grow."

And I think what New Jersey's goal is, or at least what we've encouraged in New Jersey to set as its goal, it wasn't because we had any better insights than the state already did, is do not pay twice for capacity. And under the current construct, without question, offshore wind will not clear the market. At some point in the future, it's likely nuclear won't clear in the market. I'm referring to the capacity model. And solar, certainly won't clear the capacity market. So as New Jersey grows its carbon-free footprint, and even its existing carbon-free footprint for nuclear, you'd have increasing double payments for capacity, and it is about $25 million to $30 million per gigawatt that you end up paying. So that starts adding up very quickly. Now if you went to a unit-specific FRR, which is something that we were supportive of during the original capacity market discussions if PJM could come up with some sort of stakeholder process that has a regional price on carbon, there's a whole bunch of ifs, and I won't bore you with the litany of them, because they're all equally improbable.

So the 2 problems with ZEC are the overall dollar amount and the duration of the review process. So -- and we support that over the past few years as the market continues to employ it on itself. So nuclear [indiscernible], our fossil used to do great. They're running 70-plus percent at the time, as Dan said, they're enjoying nice spark spreads, and they're working beautifully. So yes, long-term nuclear questions are needing resolution. But there are multiple pathways to get there."

The rate base growth at the utility as it has for the past decade plus. Continues to drive the EPS growth at PSE&G, all the while doing things that are vitally important to customers. And we continue to project now a 6.5% to 8% CAGR in that rate base over the next 5 years, doing things that are really driven by state policy leadership and aging infrastructure that has to attract our attention to meeting the customer needs. I think -- and that is a positive outcome from what has occurred last year is this conservation incentive program, providing much greater -- even greater stability to utility revenues, the positive constructive outcomes we've had with the BPU, again, at the risk repeating myself, by virtue of us following their lead on energy master plan and public policies, accomplishments that they had targets have all just made for a terrific set of outcomes. 
Yes, we do have an ROE negotiation and is that application that is in front of the BPU. Resolution of those 2 items will introduce a prolonged period of regulatory calm and significant execution of these great programs that we've dealt with before. We'll give you greater clarification on the strategic alternatives in a couple of months, but as I said a moment ago, I couldn't be happy with the fact that it's met every 1 of our expectations so far, and I think it will continue to do so.

PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.65 per share. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year rose by 4.6% to $3.43 per share and marked the 16th year in a row that PSEG delivered results within our original earnings guidance. 
PSEG's GAAP results were $0.85 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $0.86 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, for the full year, PSEG reported 2020 net income of $3.76 per share compared with $3.33 per share in 2019. Details on the results for the quarter and the full year can be found on Slides 12 and 14.  
I am pleased to report that PSEG's fourth quarter and full year results reflected solid contributions from both PSE&G and PSEG Power, and I'm particularly proud of the achievements of our employees during this past year as it was one of the most challenging in recent memory. Their efforts have kept our customers connected to essential energy services to power their homes, businesses and vitally important institutions. 
We have also made steady progress on several key business priorities, the most important of which is our transition to becoming primarily a regulated utility with contracted generation comprised of our zero-carbon nuclear fleet and future investments in regional offshore wind. In the past 6 months, we've announced the exploration of strategic alternatives for PSEG Power's 7,200-plus megawatts of nonnuclear generating assets, and have received initial indications of interest for both the fossil and solar source assets. 
PSE&G successfully initiated its landmark Clean Energy Future program, securing approval to spend nearly $2 billion in energy efficiency, smart meter installations and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, all of which will enhance New Jersey's environmental profile for years to come. In addition, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, I will refer to them as the BPU, recently concluded public hearings regarding PSEG Nuclear's application to extend the zero-emission certificate. I think I'll shorten that to ZEC from now, on through May 2025. 
Our surface area experienced milder than normal weather during the fourth quarter, bookending the weak heating season of the first quarter in 2020. Regarding weather-normalized sales for the year, while total electric sales volume declined by 2%, gas sales rose by 1%. In both the electric and gas businesses, higher residential usage of approximately 5% largely offset declines in commercial and industrial sales, resulting in stable margins overall.  
Working with COVID-19 health and safety protocols since last March, PSE&G was able to execute on its planned $2.7 billion capital spending program in 2020. These capital programs provide a critical investment to support the New Jersey economy, particularly in the early months of the pandemic, and preserved essential jobs while replacing widely important energy infrastructure and generating customer benefits of improved reliability and resiliency as well as methane reduction. 
In January of 2021, the BPU approved 2 settlements with PSE&G and other parties in the Clean Energy Future Energy Cloud and Electric Vehicle proceedings. The Energy Cloud investment program is estimated to be approximately $707 million over the next 4 years and will result in a replacement of over 2 million electric meters with smart meters. The Electric Vehicle program will direct $166 million into EV charging infrastructure over the next 6 years. 
With these recent settlements, the BPU has constructively addressed the vast majority of the Clean Energy Future filing, and has approved nearly $2 billion of investment to help realize New Jersey's energy goals. The energy efficiency program will also establish clean energy job training for over 3,200 direct jobs, while enabling the avoidance of 8 million metric tons of carbon emissions through the year 2050. Investing in energy efficiency programs is the most cost-effective solution to reducing carbon emissions. 
Importantly, the conservation incentive of the settlement encourages the broad adoption of energy efficiency, with certain programs focusing on low and moderate-income customers that will lower bills for participating customers. We expect the balance of the Clean Energy Future filing, which includes our request to spend under $200 million on energy storage and a few remaining EV programs, will be addressed following future stakeholder proceedings.  
PSE&G continues to engage with the BPU staff and Rate Counsel to advance confidential discussions toward a settlement of the return on equity related to PSE&G's formula rate for transmission overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The annual update under PSE&G's existing formula rate filed last October was implemented this past January. And together with cost reallocation of our revenue requirements for certain transmission projects, candidly to customers outside of our zone, this resulted in a net reduction in PSE&G customer costs. 
For 2020, PSE&G once again achieved top quartile OSHA scores for [ safety ]. We also achieved the top quartile J.D. Power ranking in the eastern large company category for both residential electric and gas companies. And PSE&G posted its best-ever J.D. Power scores for electric and gas customer satisfaction, outpacing the average industry results on metrics that consider total monthly cost, bill clarity, fairness of pricing and options and ability to manage monthly usage among residential customers. Also for the 19th year in a row, PA Consulting recognized PSE&G with its ReliabilityOne award as the most reliable electric utility in the Mid-Atlantic region and, for the first time, with their 2020 Outstanding Customer Engagement award. 
New Jersey has recently made solid progress in lowering its COVID-19 positivity rates and continues a phased reopening of businesses, schools and other activities. We have a long history of partnering with the state to support the economy, and we continue to work with them on investment programs that can spur economic development and employment recovery, all while being quite thoughtful about managing customer rate impacts. 
Regarding collection activity. The moratorium on shutoffs of residential electric and gas service is currently scheduled to conclude in March. Recognizing the economic hardship that many of our customers continue to face, PSE&G, in partnership with the BPU and community groups, is working hard to enroll customers in customer payment support programs, such as LIHEAP and deferred payment arrangements. When the moratorium is lifted, we will work closely with the BPU, other stakeholders and our customers to ensure a collections process that supports our customers' individual situations.  
Turning now to PSEG Power. We're continuing all activities related to the exploration of strategic alternatives we announced last July. In the fourth quarter of last year, we launched the formal sales processes of the 467-megawatt solar source and over 6,750-megawatt fossil portfolios. We are currently evaluating indications of interest, and believe we are on track to announce an outcome in the second half of 2021.  
As we launched the strategic alternatives initiative last year and throughout the process thus far, PSEG Power has continued to deliver on expectations for non-GAAP operating earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Last year, PSEG Fossil posted one of its best operational performance records ever, and completed its entire maintenance outage schedule without any OSHA safety violations. 
In addition, PSEG Nuclear completed 2 complex refueling outages in 2020 with new COVID-19 safety protocols, and continue its overall outstanding operating performance. These achievements speak volumes about the professionalism of our dedicated workforce that exemplifies our focus on safety and operational excellence.  
PSEG Nuclear's zero-emission certificate application and the extension of the current ZEC is currently under consideration at the BPU. Last month, the BPU Staff consultant released their preliminary findings. The consultant found that all 3 of our New Jersey units were eligible, recognizing that each unit had a financial need for ZEC. There were other aspects of the preliminary findings that we view as inconsistent with the ZEC law, and we look forward to upcoming hearings where we will have the opportunity to address those items.
It is clear that New Jersey recognizes the need for nuclear power in order to achieve its short- and long-term clean energy goals. As laid out in the state's own energy master plan and DEP's 80x50 Report. The recent weather-related power and market values in Texas and California further underscore the importance of maintaining New Jersey's reliable resource mix. 
Over the next few weeks, you will hear us mention that our confidential filings show that these units are actually in need of more than $10 per megawatt-hour, partly due to the fact that PJM forward market prices are lower versus 2018, which was the year of our first ZEC application. As stated in the 2018 ZEC law, nuclear operating risk and market risk must be recognized as a cost in any economic determination of ZEC eligibility. 
We have responded to all information requests and have shared confidential financial information with Rate Counsel and the PJM Independent Market Monitor in order to support transparency around this important proceeding. In the absence of an extension of the current ZEC, we would not continue to operate the plant. 
While the direction of public policy both in New Jersey and in the nation is the increased recognition of carbon-free energy to mitigate climate change, that realization in the form of a future price on carbon is highly uncertain at best. With the final decision on the ZEC application expected on April 27, we are hopeful that the BPU will act to extend the $10 per megawatt-hour attribute payment to preserve the nuclear units and their 3,400 megawatts of zero-carbon baseload generation through May of 2025.  
The DEP is also moving forward with its investigation of resource adequacy and the potential for the creation of fixed resource -- of a fixed resource requirement service area within New Jersey, I'm just going to call that FRR in the future. We have maintained a mutual stance and the potential of an alternative capacity procurement paradigm but remains supportive of accommodations that enables state-supported resources to qualify as capacity that can satisfy both the state's capacity obligations and its clean energy goals. 
As we've previously stated, the current minimum offer floor prices are not expected to prevent either our nuclear or gas-fired units from clearing in the upcoming PJM capacity auction scheduled for this May.  
Now let me turn my attention to 2021 guidance. We are introducing non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.35 to $3.55 per share, with the utility expected to contribute between $1.410 billion and $1.470 billion; PSEG Power between $280 million and $370 million; and parent/other is expected to post a loss of $15 million. This year, we expect PSE&G to contribute just over 80% of consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings at the midpoint of guidance. Going forward, we expect that the utility earnings will represent 80% to 90% of PSEG's non-GAAP results, with the remaining balance expected to be comprised of long-term agreements for zero-carbon offshore wind generation and our ZEC-supported New Jersey nuclear units. 
For PSEG Power, over 70% of its 2021 gross margin has been secured by way of energy hedges, capacity revenues established in prior auctions, zero-emission certificates, and ancillary service payments. However, for 2021, recontracting at lower market prices, higher costs tied to a Hope Creek refueling outage and the absence of tax benefits realized in 2020 result in the lower non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for 2021. 
Our PSEG 5-year capital spending forecast has been updated to $14 billion to $16 billion for 2021 through 2025, and includes approximately $2 billion of Clean Energy Future investments as well as the expected extension of the Gas System Modernization Program and Energy Efficiency program at their average annual run rates for the last 2 years of the period, that being 2024 and 2025. 
Consistent with past years, approximately 90% or $13 billion to $15 billion of this capital program will be directed to grow regulated operations at PSE&G. This ongoing investment in essential energy infrastructure and clean energy programs is expected to produce 6.5% to 8% compound annual growth in rate base over the 5-year period, starting from $22 billion at year-end 2020.  
On Slide 10, we've provided you with an ultimate view of our updated capital for 2021 through 2025. We've classified it by investments in decarbonization, energy transition, climate adaptation for resilience and reliability and methane reduction. As a side bar, any spend for offshore wind will be incremental to these totals and is not included in the $14 billion to $16 billion capital plan [ note ]. We also expect that our strong cash flow will enable us to fund our entire 5-year capital spending program as well as our planned offshore wind investments during the '21 through '25 period, without the need to issue new equity. 
As we continue to plan from the responsible reentry to our offices and facilities currently targeted for this July, I have to thank our dedicated employees for their professionalism, persistence and flexibility over the past year. Whether responding to a myriad of COVID-19 challenges or their excellent injury-free response to the nor'easter that we just experienced this past month, employees across our organization has embodied operational excellence as they provide our New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Mid-Atlantic customers with reliable essential energy services.  
Before moving to Dan's financial review, I will summarize the new initiatives in place for future growth and areas of our continued strategic focus. These range from the new clean energy future investments behind-the-meter to infrastructure opportunities supporting electrification of transportation and a growing mix of renewables in the distribution system, to expanding the existing aging infrastructure replacement programs to assist the New Jersey economic recovery. 
In addition, we are advancing the strategic alternative exploration through a robust bidding process, pursuing near-term opportunities to expand our offshore wind investments in the Mid-Atlantic and are engaged in ongoing efforts to preserve the New Jersey nuclear fleet, the most cost-effective and most reliable source of baseload supply to reduce emissions. 
Each of these actions serves to further PSEG's already strong ESG leadership position, which we continuously strive to improve. In 2020, we moved to decarbonize our generating fleet, announced an investment in New Jersey offshore wind and initiated a landmark energy and efficiency investment to bring universal access to a broad range of clean energy opportunities. In 2021, we joined the company network of the Ceres organization, that's C-E-R-E-S, to advance our climate advocacy. We will achieve a coal-free generating fleet in June, and we recently published our first ESG performance report. 
PSEG is getting recognized for our ESG initiatives by Standard & Poor's, who has included us in their 2021 Sustainability Yearbook. And by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, who was named PSEG and to the North American index for 13 years in a row. We were also gratified to be named to the 2021 listing of America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek magazine, and the Forbes List of Best Employers for Diversity in 2020 and Best Employers for Veterans in 2020. 
The Board of Directors' recent decision to increase the company's common dividend to the indicative annual level of $2.04 per share is the 17th increase in the last 18 years, and reflects our ongoing commitment to returning capital to our shareholders to enhance our total return profile as we also pursue growth. 
There is no lack of opportunity for PSEG as we continue the transformation to a primarily regulated electric and gas utility, focused on clean energy infrastructure, complemented with contracted zero-carbon generation. We are working towards a sustainable future where customers universally use less energy. The energy they use is cleaner and its delivery is more reliable and more resilient. We are confident that pursuing this strategy will enhance our ability to provide our customers with essential energy services, which has been our core mission for the last 118 years.
I'll now turn the call over to Dan for more details on our operating results, and I'll be available with him for your questions after his remarks."
298482,702384412,2226326,"Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2021",2021-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Terrific. Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everybody. As Ralph said, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $0.65 per share, and we've provided you with information on Slides 12 and 14 regarding the contribution of non-",2134,"Terrific. Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everybody. As Ralph said, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $0.65 per share, and we've provided you with information on Slides 12 and 14 regarding the contribution of non-GAAP operating earnings by business for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2020. Slides 13 and 15 contain waterfall charts that take you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating earnings by major business. 
I'll now review each company in more detail, starting with PSE&G. PSE&G's net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased by $0.04 and to $0.58 per share compared with net income of $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019, as shown on Slide 17. For the full year, PSE&G's net income increased by $0.16 per share or 6.5% compared with 2019 results. This improvement reflects an 8% increase in rate base at year-end 2020 to just over $22 billion, which, as we note on Slide 22, does not include approximately $1.8 billion of construction work in progress or CWIP, that's mostly in transmission. 
The continued growth in utility earnings resulting from investments in transmission added $0.02 per share versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Gas margin was $0.02 favorable, reflecting GSMP roll-ins and higher weather-normalized volume. Electric margin was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 as higher weather-normalized volumes were offset by lower demand. Mild temperatures during the quarter had a negative $0.03 per share impact, mostly reflecting recovery limitations under the earnings test of the gas weather normalization clause.
O&M expense was flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Higher distribution depreciation expense of $0.01 per share offset lower pension expense of $0.01 per share in the quarter. Taxes and other were $0.03 per share favorable, partly reversing the negative $0.07 per share impact that the timing of taxes had on third quarter 2020 net income. 
Recall in the third quarter, flow-through taxes and other items lowered net income by $0.07 per share compared to the third quarter of 2019, and we indicated at that time that about half of the $0.07 would reverse in the fourth quarter. The balance is related to bad debts, which we anticipate reversing in the future based upon the timing of actual write-offs. 
Early winter weather in the fourth quarter as measured by the heating degree days was 9% milder than normal and 14% milder than in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, PSE&G's weather-normalized residential electric sales increased by 5.6% due to the COVID-19 work-from-home impact, but a larger decline in commercial sales resulted in total electric sales declining by 2%. 
Total weather-normalized gas sales were up 1.2% for 2020 led by a 4.9% increase in residential use, partially offset by a smaller decline in the commercial and industrial segment. For both electric and gas sales, higher residential usage largely offset declines in commercial and industrial sales, resulting in stable margins overall. 
PSE&G invested $700 million in the fourth quarter as part of its 2020 capital investment program of approximately $2.7 billion, directed to infrastructure upgrades of transmission and distribution facilities to maintain reliability, increase resiliency, make life cycle replacements and clean energy investments. 
PSE&G's updated 5-year capital spending plan includes investing $2.7 billion in 2021. And as detailed on Slide 21, approximately $960 million is allocated to transmission; $700 million to electric distribution, which includes approximately $200 million for Energy Strong II; $875 million to gas distribution, which includes over $400 million for GSMP II; and $200 million for new Clean Energy Future EE programs and the beginning of the AMI rollout. The Clean Energy Future EE investment will ramp up to approximately $125 million in 2021, before reaching a full annual run rate of about $350 million in 2023. 
As Ralph mentioned, the BPU approved 2 CEF settlements in January, totaling approximately $875 million, covering Energy Cloud and Electric Vehicle investments. The capital and operating costs of these programs will begin to be recovered in PSE&G's next rate proceeding expected to be filed in the second half of 2023. 
From the start of the programs until the commencement of new base rates estimated in late 2024, the return of and on capital will be included for recovery in these rates as well as operating costs, and stranded costs associated with the retirement of the existing leaders. Of these amounts, the vast majority, about 90%, receives contemporaneous or near contemporaneous for regulatory treatment either through the FERC formula rate or clause recovery mechanisms, or recovered in rates as replacement spend or new business. 
As Ralph also mentioned, we continue settlement discussions with the BPU Staff and Rate Counsel regarding our FERC transmission return on equity. Although our forecast for 2021 assumes a resolution effective in the near term, those discussions remain confidential and ongoing. 
PSE&G net income for 2021 is forecasted at $1.410 billion to $1.470 billion, which reflects an assumed reduction of our transmission formula rate as well as incremental investment in T&D infrastructure and energy efficiency. 
So moving to Power. PSEG Power reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter, unchanged from the non-GAAP results in the fourth quarter of 2019. Results for the quarter brought Power's full year non-GAAP operating earnings to $430 million or $0.84 per share compared with 2019's non-GAAP results of $409 million or $0.81 per share. 
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA totaled $182 million for the quarter and $990 million for the full year of 2020, and this compares to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $198 million and $1.035 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, respectively. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings measure, as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense. 
The earnings release and the waterfall on Slides 13 and 15 provide you with a detailed analysis of the items having an impact on PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings relative to net income quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year from changes in revenue and costs. We've also provided you with added detail on generation for the fourth quarter and full year on Slide 26. 
PSEG Power's fourth quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were aided by the scheduled increase in PSEG Power's average capacity prices in PJM covering the second half of 2020; and higher gas operations, which resulted in improved non-GAAP operating earnings comparisons of $0.04 and $0.01 per share, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. However, lower generation output and recontracting at lower market prices reduced non-GAAP operating earnings by a total of $0.08 per share versus the year ago quarter. 
A decline in O&M expenses in the quarter improved results by $0.01 per share, and reflects the absence of the Hope Creek refueling outage that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019. The extension of the Peach Bottom nuclear operating licenses contributed to lower depreciation expense of $0.01 per share, and lower taxes improved non-GAAP operating earnings by $0.01 over the year ago quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was $32 a megawatt hour, a $1 per megawatt hour improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019, mainly reflecting the scheduled increase in capacity prices that began June 1, 2020 and remained in place through May of 2021. For the full year, 2020 gross margin was flat at $32 per megawatt hour compared to full year 2019. Mild fall temperatures and holiday-related spikes and COVID-19 positivity rates dampened market demand in New Jersey and kept power prices and natural gas prices lower than the quarter and year ago comparisons. 
So let's turn to Power's operations. Total output from Power's generating facilities declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. And planned outages at Fossil and an extended average at the Salem 1 nuclear unit reduced fourth quarter generation levels compared to the fourth quarter in 2019. However, full year 2020 output of 53 terawatt hours came in above our 50- to 52-terawatt-hour forecast. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 78.9% in the quarter and 90.3% for the full year, producing nearly 31 terawatt hours of zero-carbon baseload power. 
The combined cycle fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 46.2% in the quarter and 48.3% for the full year, generating approximately 22 terawatt hours in 2020. The 3 newest combined cycle generating units at Keys, Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor 5 posted an average capacity factor of over 75% for the full year 2020. And this coming June, PSEG Power will complete the planned early retirement of the 383-megawatt coal-fired Bridgeport Harbor 3 generating station, eliminating the last coal unit and power fleet. 
For 2021, Power has hedged approximately 90% to 95% of its expected output of 48 to 50 terawatt hours at an average price of $32 per megawatt hour, which represents an approximately $2 per megawatt hour decline from 2020. In addition, 2021 average hedge prices no longer include cost-based transmission charges for New Jersey's basic generation service contracts due to a change in how they are built and collected. This change further reduces revenues by approximately $3 per megawatt hour, starting on February 1, 2021, and is offset on the cost side, so there's no P&L impact as a result. 
We're forecasting 2021 non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA at PSEG Power to be $280 million to $370 million and $850 million to $950 million, respectively. Power segment guidance reflects a full year of fossil and solar operations, lower expected generation volume and lower market prices, as well as the absence of a onetime tax benefit realized in 2020. 
Now let me briefly address operating results from Enterprise and Other, which reported a net loss that increased by $0.03 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, and reflects lower tax benefits compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and lower results from PSEG Long Island. Regarding PSEG Long Island, following several challenges related to our response to Tropical Storm Isaias, we've made significant improvements in our outage management, telephony, business continuity and other systems and processes. 
The Long Island Power Authority filed a complaint against PSEG Long Island in New York State Court last December alleging multiple breaches of the operating services agreement, or OSA, in connection with PSEG Long Island's preparation and response to Tropical Storm Isaias. We are in discussions with LIPA to address their concerns, which could include potential amendments to our OSA with LIPA and to resolve all claims. As a reminder, our 12-year contract is scheduled to run through 2025. We are committed to addressing the identified performance issues and to continue our strong track record of performance for Long Island's customers since taking over operations. 
For 2021, PSEG Enterprise and Other is forecasted to have a net loss of $15 million as parent financing and other costs exceed earnings from PSEG Long Island. 
PSEG ended 2020 with approximately $3.8 billion of available liquidity, including cash on hand of $543 million and debt representing 52% of our consolidated capital. In December, PSEG issued $96 million or 8.63% senior notes due April 2031 in exchange for a like amount of 8.63% senior notes due April 2031, originally issued at Power, which were canceled following the completion of the exchange. PSEG also retired a $700 million term loan at maturity. Power's debt as a percentage of capital declined to 27% on December 31, to 28% at September 30. 
To summarize, non-GAAP results for the quarter were $0.65 per share, full year 2020 non-GAAP operating earnings were $3.43 per share. And as we move into 2021, our guidance for the year is $3.35 to $3.55 per share, with regulated operations expected to contribute over 80% of consolidated results. The range for 2021 reflects incremental investment in our T&D infrastructure and a ramp-up of the new Clean Energy Future programs as well as an assumed reduction on return on equity of our transmission formula rate during the year at PSE&G and a full year of fossil and solar operations at PSEG Power. 
PSEG also raised its common dividend by $0.08 per share for the indicative annual level of $2.04, a 4% increase over 2020. The 2021 indicative rate continues to represent a conservative 59% payout of consolidated earnings at the midpoint of 2021 guidance, and utility earnings alone are expected to cover 140% of the dividend at the midpoint of 2021 guidance. We still expect our strong cash flow will enable us to fully fund PSEG's 5-year $14 billion to $16 billion capital investment program as well as our planned offshore wind investment during the 2021 to 2025 period without the need to issue new equity. 
That concludes my comments. And Shelby, we are now ready to take questions."

But that shouldn't be a big surprise. I mean we don't break out the guidance in terms of individual components, whether it's weather or outage durations of plants and things of that nature. 
So we are where we were for a while now. We're close. Both sides are eager to resolve this. But in deference to the BPU, they've had an incredibly active agenda for the better part of 2 years, and they are dealing with the same challenges that everyone else is in terms of working from home. And despite that, they've successfully done one offshore wind solicitation, they're in the middle of the second one. They've done stakeholder processes for FRR, energy efficiencies. So they're getting a lot done, and this ROE discussion is part of that portfolio of activities, but not resolved yet."

And we -- right now, we have an option for 25% on Ocean Wind, and we have entertained possibly going as high as 50% previously on this project. There is likely to be a transmission solicitation that will be managed by PJM on behalf of New Jersey that we feel very confident that we could do something of that sort without necessarily needing partners, although we would be welcome to partnerships in that regard, too.
I think at the end of the day, our #1 growth engine remains rate-based growth in PSE&G. Having said that, there is a window of opportunity here as states aggressively pursue offshore wind, and we don't want to have ourselves excluded from that. I think the commercial risk is completely mitigated by the PPA or the orders, and the operational risk is mitigated by making sure you partner with a world-class partner, and we think we have that in Ørsted. 
So the risk profile is something that we're now comfortable with. It took us the better part of, I guess, was close to 2 years of us kind of inching along, and we're very grateful for Ørsted's patience. But on the transmission side, I think the risk rewards there we're very comfortable with -- always was, and on the wind farm side, having the right partner mitigates that. We've never disclosed what our hurdle rates are, but suffice to say, even though I think we can manage the risk, both the commercial and the operational risk, as I just mentioned, we wouldn't do these projects for lower than -- we would only do these projects for above-utility returns."

But you could see more of the 69 KV upgrade and just the transmission budget coming up as we get more knowledgeable about what the grid status is. 
I think one of the areas, though, that we are increasingly paying attention to, and it's difficult to quantify, is as a result of the pandemic, I believe long-term patterns, lifestyle patters are going to change. I know at PSEG, we're already telling our employees that many more of them will be able to work from home. The combination of the household becoming now place of business and greater penetration of electric vehicles, which are charged at the household, and the growth of electric devices in the home, whether it's smart devices, communication devices, is really changing the whole calculus behind the importance of reliability into the home. 
So I'm right now in the office with Dan and Carlotta, and we've got multiple 26 KV feeds into this building because New York is a commercial center for New Jersey. That's true in New Brunswick and many other downtown commercial areas throughout New Jersey. That's not true in my home, and it's not true in anybody's home in New Jersey. So the need to invest in the last mile to reflect the reliability expectations as the home becomes a commercial center and really a bunch of small business operations is a public policy discussion that I think is just beginning to take place, and there's no way reflected in our numbers. 
So I'd say you'll see those numbers come up in the future. They always come up in the future, either because we'll just get smarter about the traditional stuff we need to do or there's this whole last-mile question that we'll need to grapple with."

This year, we're still including all fossil, that will go away. But hopefully, New Jersey will abide by their own energy master plan and nuclear will still be around, so that will be on top of the utility. You may recall on our BGSS, that sticks around.

And I think we've shown over the past few months how important it is to follow with BPU's leadership in terms of its clean energy aspirations and Governor Murphy's aspirations. We've had some very constructive outcomes because we have followed their lead on energy efficiency, on AMI, on electric vehicles. 
Having said that, the nuclear plants need more than $10. And what we've said is we'll look at longer-term solutions for that, hopefully, coming out of the federal government with a price on carbon hopefully if that doesn't work, coming out of the FRR process. And that's the only reason -- and the only reason why we would accept $10 now is because that's all the state can do. So that's really not a negotiation, that's just kind of the match the state has available to it, and that's why we need it. And we need more than that. So that's kind of where we're stuck, right? 
If you need more than $10, you can't accept less than $10. And when the other parties can only offer your $10, then that Venn diagram ends up at one point and only one point, which is $10. But that does not preclude the need for additional work after that. And at the risk of stating the obvious, if you don't get the $10, then what confidence can you possibly have that the longer-term solution can be realized, and that's why we would shut the unit. So I guess I could have simply said yes to you, but I gave you a [ wide ] explanation of a yes."

And I think what New Jersey's goal is, or at least what we've encouraged New Jersey to set as its goal, it wasn't because we had any better insights than the state already did, is do not pay twice for capacity. 
And under the current construct, without question, offshore wind will not clear the market. At some point in the future, it's likely nuclear won't clear the market. I'm referring to the capacity model. And solar, certainly won't clear the capacity market. So as New Jersey grows its carbon-free footprint, and even its existing carbon-free footprint for nuclear, you'd have increasing double payments for capacity. And it is about $25 million to $30 million per gigawatt that you end up paying. So that starts adding up very quickly. 
Now if you went to a unit-specific FRR, which is something that we were supportive of during the original capacity market discussions if PJM could come up with some sort of stakeholder process that has a regional price on carbon, there's a whole bunch of ifs and I won't bore you with the litany of them, because they're all equally improbable, then yes, maybe the state can do something differently than a simple broad-based FRR. But at the end of the day, the mechanism has to be one that avoids the customer burden of paying twice for capacity. That's really what the outcome would be."

So against that backdrop, you do start to have that double payment Ralph talked about in 2025. So it's a bit of a -- not necessarily a race, but it's a 2 timelines coming to that year's capacity determination with respect to how quickly FERC could move and what New Jersey's reaction would be to whatever it is they do and how much of a solution it is to that double payment problem. So those are some of the things to think about with respect to how the parties might be approaching a change from the current path."

Power markets continue to decline, more so than we expected it to. That's only going to get worse as more 0 marginal cost renewables are introduced to the market, and we're in a market that dispatches our marginal cost. And the nuclear plants rely on those infra-marginal revenues to make their economics work. And that dispatch curve is getting flatter and lower each passing year. 
Secondly, the state has very ambitious carbon-free energy goals, which are great, which we completely applaud. But they're so ambitious that they exceed their current licensed life of the nuclear plants. And you're not going to go into relicensing and you're not going to made capital improvements on the basis of the 3-year ZEC process, even if it was adequately compensating, which it isn't. So the 2 problems with the ZEC are the overall dollar amount and the duration of the review process.

I'm pleased to report that PSEG has achieved several major milestones on our path to becoming a primarily regulated utility company with a complementary and significantly contracted carbon-free generating fleet. PSEG posted solid results earlier this morning, reporting non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2021 of $1.28 per share versus $1.03 per share in last year's first quarter. Our GAAP results for the first quarter were also $1.28 per share versus $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Results from ongoing regulated investments at PSE&G and the effect of cold weather on PSEG Power drove favorable comparisons at both businesses. 
We present details on the quarter's results on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation. We are well positioned to execute on our financial and strategic goals for the balance of the year given this eventful quarter, beginning with out nearly $2 billion of Clean Energy Future programs, which have moved from approval to execution. PSE&G is helping to advance the decarbonization of New Jersey in a sizable and equitable way. Our Clean Energy Future investments are paired with a jobs training program that offers opportunities to low and middle-income New Jersey community. Last week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities voted unanimously to award a continuation of the full $10 per megawatt hour zero-emission certificates, I'll just call them ZECs from now on for all 3 New Jersey nuclear units, that would be Hope Creek and through May of 2025. This was the maximum amount that the BPU could have awarded, and we are appreciative of the support received from the many community, labor, business, environmental and employee organizations that participated in this enormously important process. 
Each of these groups recognizes the value of the reliable around the clock and carbon-free electricity supply our nuclear plants provide. Throughout this process, our nuclear team has approached operations at the units with the utmost professionalism and dedication to safety. I congratulate PSEG Nuclear for being recognized by as an industry leader in operational reliability, 1 of only 2 nuclear fleets across the industry with no scrams over the past 365 days. 
The BPU's decision to extend the ZEC program will advance climate action in New Jersey by helping to preserve the state's largest carbon-free generating resource and is consistent with the growing interest at the federal level in preserving existing nuclear as an essential part of a clean energy mix. We applaud the BPU for its decision, which is in the best interest of the state of New Jersey and its ability to achieve its long-term clean energy goals without compromising reliability or going backward on environmental gains made to date. 
Looking ahead, we will soon work with stakeholders to obtain alignment of state and federal climate goals in seeking ways to extend the duration of support for carbon-free nuclear power. During the quarter, the BPU also approved PSEG's 25% equity investment in Orsted's Ocean Wind project. In addition, Ocean Wind received a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management which we will also review -- which will also review the project's construction and operations plan. 
In April, PJM, in closed cooperation with the BPU, opened a 4-month solicitation window to seek transmission solutions to support New Jersey's offshore wind generation target. This process is PGM's first public policy transmission solicitation, and we will participate in this proceeding. The recent Biden administration proposal focusing on climate action is clearly supportive of offshore wind, existing nuclear generation and electrification of transportation, all of which are aligned with PSEG's business plan and strategy for sustainability. 
PSEG eagerly encourages an advocate for a national approach to accelerate economy wide, net zero emissions even sooner than 2050 in a constructive manner that expands green jobs by investing in clean energy infrastructure. I am more optimistic than ever that the momentum for real climate action is taking hold, PSEG continues to press ahead with our powering, progress, vision, that incorporates energy efficiency and the electrification of transportation to help our customers use energy -- use less energy. 
We are pairing that with our move to make the energy our customers use cleaner, which aligns with our efforts to preserve our existing nuclear units and pursue strategic alternatives for our Fossil fleet. Then we strive to deliver with high reliability and resiliency, which ties to our investments in Energy Infrastructure and the Energy cloud. Today, we are also announcing progress on our strategic alternatives exploration with an agreement to sell our solar source portfolio to an affiliate of LS Power. The sale resulted from a robust marketing process, and we're pleased with the outcome of the sale, having determined that the transaction is modestly accretive on the sum of the parts and on an operating earnings basis going forward. 
We expect the solar source portfolio deals to close in the second or third quarter of 2021, subject to customary, regulatory and other closing conditions. PSEG Power is continuing the exploration of strategic alternatives for its Fossil generating fleet and currently anticipate reaching an agreement around midyear. These expected transactions, along with over a decade of capital allocation directed mainly toward PSE&G to position the remaining company as a primarily regulated electric and gas utility with a complementary carbon-free nuclear fleet and offshore wind investments that will be highly contracted. 
The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact continued to affect the New Jersey economy. The large contribution of the transmission and residential electric and gas components to our overall sales mix has had a stabilizing effect on the margins of our utility business as does a supportive regulatory order that authorizes deferral of certain COVID-19-related costs for future recovery. Governor Murphy recently announced that a significant easing of COVID-19 restrictions on the state's businesses, venues and gatherings would begin on May 19 following progress in vaccinating over half of the state's population and a sustained reduction in positivity and hospitalization rates. 
PSE&G has begun implementing the Clean Energy Future Energy Efficiency programs by initiating customer engagement and outreach as well as advancing the clean energy jobs training program I mentioned earlier and related IT system build-out activity. Following the BPU approval of our $700 million AMI proposal in January, we have begun implementation of the 4-year program. Our current focus is on planning the AMI communications network, customer outreach and developing the installation schedule of the new meters. On the regulatory and policy front, there are several upcoming developments at the FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the BPU and PJM that could influence future results. 
Last month, FERC promulgated a new proposed rule to limit the 50 basis point RTO return on equity incentive to a 3-year period. Given the Biden administration's interest in the significant transmission build out to expand the integration of Clean Energy Power Grid, this development was disappointed. We have long supported the need for higher incentives for transmission investment over distribution returns based on the added complexity and risk of these projects. 
Coordination through the RTO has benefits, but risks and complications must be considered as well. Based on the short comment window provided, the proposed rule could be enacted as early as the third quarter. We will file comments to recognize the merits of continuing the RTO adder, but this looks to be an uphill battle, given the Chair's support for the supplemental rule. 
While we await the results of the first PJM capacity auction in 3 years, which PGM will announce on June 2, PSEG is continuing to advocate for a minimum offer price rule, I'll call it MOPR going forward, that will avoid double payment for resources such as offshore wind and nuclear or other supply need to achieve state goals. FERC Commissioner Danley has developed a state option to choose resources proposal, or SOCR, intended to achieve the major goals of establishing the rights of states to choose their preferred capacity resources to achieve their energy policy objectives and eliminate double payments by states for the capacity they choose. 
This proposal could have the added benefit of keeping much of FERC's capacity market reform rules intact while addressing state objections. New Jersey is expected to issue its consultants report and recommendation for resource adequacy this month. This report could determine whether a fixed resource requirement, or FRR, will be chosen to satisfy the state's future capacity obligations beyond the 2022 and  2023 energy year. We continue to believe that the state could pursue an FRR without legislation and will suggest options to minimize the cost impact of FERC's capacity ruling on New Jersey customers. Earlier in April, the BPU released its strong proposal to address the design of the solar successor program. Stakeholder meetings are being conducted to consider a solar financial incentive program that will permanently replace the Solar Renewable Energy Certificate, or SREC program, and the Temporary Transitional Renewable Energy Certificate, or TRAC program, which was instituted in 2020 upon the state attainment of 5.1% of kilowatt hours sold from solar generation 
Given a substantial increase in New Jersey solar target, the high cost of solar and the solar cost caps in the Clean Energy Act of 2018, we believe it is critical to develop a cost-effective approach to incent future solar generation. By far, the most efficient and cost-effective way for New Jersey to optimize what solar can bring to the achievement of its clean energy goals is to maximize grid-connected utility-scale projects by involving the state's electric distribution company. 
So to wrap up my remarks, we are reaffirming non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2021 of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. Our guidance assumes normal weather and plant operations for the remainder of the year and incorporates the conservation incentive programs that begin in June for electric and in October for gas to cover variations in revenue due to energy efficiency and other impacts. 
In addition, as we mentioned on our year-end call, our 2021 guidance assumes a prospective settlement of our transmission return on equity at a lower rate and the inclusion of Fossil's results for the full year. We are on track to execute PSEG's 5 year $14 billion to $16 billion capital program through 2025 and had the financial strength to fund it without the need to issue new equity. 
Over 90% of the current capital program is directed to PSE&G, which is expected to produce 6.5% to 8% compound annual growth in rate base over the '21 to '25 period, starting from PSEG's year-end 2020 rate base of $22 billion. As we've noted previously, PSE&G's considerable cash-generating capabilities are supported by over 90% of its capital spending, continuing to receive either formula rate last based or current rate recovery of and on capital. 
Finally, I thank our employees for their exceptional contributions to a compelling PSEG story this quarter. From nuclear operations marking a second breaker-to-breaker uninterrupted run at Hope Creek to a cross-functional regulatory, legal, financing, government affairs group that multi cash on Clean Energy Future, ZECs and a host of other regulatory proceedings, to our field crews in New Jersey and Long Island who exemplify a safety conscious mindset, I could not be prouder of our entire PSEG team. And now I'll turn the call over to Dan for more details on our financial and operating results and will be available for your questions after his remarks. Dan?"

Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2021 of $1.28 per share versus $1.03 per share in last year's first quarter. We've provided you with information on",1681,"Great. Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2021 of $1.28 per share versus $1.03 per share in last year's first quarter. We've provided you with information on Slide 12 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings by business for the quarter. And Slide 13 contains a waterfall chart that takes you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter in non-GAAP operating earnings by major business. I'll now review each company in more detail. 
PSE&G, as shown on Slide 15, reported net income for the first quarter 2021 of $0.94 per share compared with $0.87 per share for the first quarter of 2020, up 8% versus last year. Results improved by $0.07 per share, driven by revenue growth from ongoing capital investment program and favorable pension OPEB results. Transmission capital spending added $0.02 per share of the first quarter net income compared to the first quarter of 2020. On the distribution side, gas margin improved by $0.03 per share over last year's first quarter, driven by the scheduled recovery of investments made under the second phase of the Gas System Modernization Program. Electric margin was $0.01 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020 on a higher weather-normalized residential volume. 
O&M expense was $0.02 per share unfavorable compared to the first quarter of 2020, reflecting higher costs from several February snowstorms. Depreciation expense increased by $0.01 per share, reflecting higher plant in service, and pension expense was $0.02 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020. Flow through taxes and other were $0.02 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020. And this tax benefit is due to the use of an annual effective tax rate that will reverse over the remainder of the year and was partly offset by the timing of taxes related to bad debt expense. 
Winter weather, as measured by heating degree days, was 4% milder than normal, but was 18% colder than the mild winter experienced in the first quarter of 2020. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, total weather-normalized sales reflected the higher expected residential and lower commercial and industrial sales observed in 2020 due to the economic impacts of COVID-19. Total electric sales declined by 2%, while gas sales increased by approximately 1%. Residential customer growth for electric and gas remained positive during the period. 
PSE&G invested approximately $600 million in the first quarter and is on track to fully execute on its planned 2021 capital investment program of $2.7 billion. The 2021 capital spending program will include infrastructure upgrades to transmission and distribution facilities as well as the rollout of the Clean Energy Future investments in Energy Efficiency, Energy cloud, including Smart Meters and Electric Vehicle charging infrastructure. 
PSE&G is continuing to defer the impact of additional expenses incurred to protect its employees and customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. PSE&G has experienced significantly higher accounts receivables and bad debts, and lower cash collections from customers due to the moratorium on shut offs for residential customers that began last March and has been extended through June of this year. We've launched an Expanded Customer Communications Program designed to inform all customers about payment assistance programs and bill management tools. As a reminder, PSE&G continues to make quarterly filings with the BPU, detailing the COVID-19 pandemic related deferrals. 
And as of March 31, PSE&G has recorded a regulatory asset of approximately $60 million for net incremental costs, which includes $35 million for incremental gas bad debt expense. Electric bad debt expenses recovered through the societal benefits charge and trued up periodically. With respect to subsidiary guidance for PSE&G, our forecast of net income for 2021 is unchanged at 1 billion 410 million  to 1 billion 470 million dollars. 
Now moving to Power. In the first quarter of 2021, PSEG Power reported net income of $161 million or $0.32 per share, non-GAAP operating earnings of $163 million or $0.32 per share, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $321 million. This compares to first quarter 2020 net income of $13 million, non-GAAP operating earnings of $85 million and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $201 million. 
The earnings release and Slide 21 provide you with a detailed analysis of the items having an impact on Power's non-GAAP operating earnings relative to net income quarter-over-quarter. And we have also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter on Slide 22. PSEG Power's first quarter results benefited from a scheduled improvement in capacity prices for the first half of 2021, a favorable weather comparison to the mild winter in the first quarter of 2020, and other items, some of which are expected to reverse in subsequent quarters. 
The expected increase in PJM's capacity revenue improved non-GAAP operating earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share compared with last year's first quarter. Higher generation in the 2021 first quarter added $0.01 per share due to the absence of the first quarter 2020 unplanned on 1 average. And favorable market conditions influenced by February's cold weather benefited results by $0.03 per share compared to last year's first quarter. We continue to forecast a $2 per megawatt hour average decline in recontracting for the full year recognizing that the shape of the annual average change favors the winter months of the first quarter. 
The weather-related improvement in total gas send out to commercial and industrial customers increased results by $0.04 per share. We expect some of this increase to gas will reverse later in 2021, reflecting the absence of a onetime benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2020 related to a pipeline refund. O&M expense was $0.03 per share favorable in the quarter, benefiting from the absence of first quarter 2020 outages at BerGen 2 and Salem 1, and lower depreciation and lower interest expense combined to improve by $0.01 per share versus the quarter ago -- or the year ago quarter. 
Generation output increased by just under 1% to total 13.3-terawatt hours versus last year's first quarter when Salem Unit 1 experienced a month-long unplanned outage. PSEG Power's combined cycle fleet produced 4.7-terawatt hours, down 8%, reflecting lower market demand in the quarter. The Nuclear fleet produced 8.2-terawatt hours, up 3%, and  operated at a capacity factor of 98.8% for the first quarter, representing 62% of total generation. 
As Ralph mentioned, Hope Creek posted an uninterrupted run between refueling outages and just began its 23rd refueling outage in April. PSEG power is forecasting generation output of 36 to 38 terawatt hours for the remaining 3 quarters of 2021 and has hedged approximately 95% to 100% of this production at an average price of $30 per megawatt hour. 
Gross margin for the first quarter rose to approximately $34 per megawatt hour compared to $30 per megawatt hour in the first quarter of 2020, which contained one of the mildest winters in recent history. Power prices in the first quarter of 2021 were stronger across PJM New York and New England compared to the year earlier period. And this winter's temperatures were 12% cooler on average and resulted in better market conditions compared to the first quarter of 2020. 
Power's average capacity prices in PJM were higher in the first quarter of 2021 versus the first quarter of 2020 and will remain stable at $168 per megawatt hour -- per megawatt day through May of 2022. In New England, our average realized capacity price will decline slightly to $192 per megawatt day, beginning June 1. However, Power's cleared capacity will decline by 383 megawatts with the scheduled retirement of the Bridgeport Harbor Unit 3, achieving our goal of making Power's fleet completely coal free. 
Over 75% of PSEG Power's expected gross margin in 2021 is secured by our fully hedged position of energy output, capacity revenue set in previous auctions and the opportunity to earn a full year of ZEC revenues and certain ancillary service payments such as reactive power.  The forecast of PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2021 remain unchanged at $280 million to $370 million and $850 million to $950 million, respectively. 
Now let me briefly address results from PSEG Enterprise and Other. For the first quarter of 2021, Enterprise and other reported net income of $10 million or $0.02 per share for the first quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of $5 million or $0.01 per share for the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in the quarter reflects higher tax benefits recorded in the first quarter of 2021 due to the use of an annual effective tax rate that will reverse over the remainder of the year as well as interest income associated with a prior IRS audit settlement. 
For 2021, the forecast for PSEG Enterprise and Other remains unchanged at a net loss of $15 million. With respect to financial position, PSG ended the quarter with $803 million of cash on the balance sheet. During the first quarter, PSE&G issued $450 million of 5-year secured medium-term notes at 95 basis points and $450 million of 30-year secured medium-term notes at 3%. In addition, we retired a $300 million, 1.9% medium-term note at PSE&G that matured in March. In March of 2021, PSEG closed on a $500 million, 364-day variable rate term loan agreement, following the January prepayment of a $300 million term loan initiated in March of 2020. 
For the balance of the year, we have approximately $950 million of debt at PSEG Power scheduled to mature in June and September. $300 million of debt scheduled to mature at the parent in November and $134 million of debt at PSE&G scheduled to mature in June. Our solid balance sheet and credit metrics keep us in a position to fund our 2021 to 2025 capital investment program without the need to issue new equity. 
As Ralph mentioned earlier, we are affirming our forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year of 2021 of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. That concludes my comments. And Christy, we are now ready to take questions."

We were one of the very small group of companies candidly in our industry who worked to the President and supported his 80% reduction by 2030 for the electric sector. And we're working with members of Congress on making sure that nuclear is included in any clean energy standard in a technology neutral way. Candidly, we have been talking to folks about the possibility that if tax credits are extended for carbon-free energy that nuclear be eligible for that as well. That, to an extent, an incentive system is set up to achieve these targets that may not be technology specific, but that they be, I'll repeat myself here, technology indifferent as long as you're achieving the desired outcome, which is carbon reductions. 
We know that there is a lot of wisdom to all the above approach, including nuclear, solar, wind, carbon capture and storage. And we're pleased to see what the President has said about the prospects for offshore wind in New Jersey in the middle of the second round, solicitation looking from another 2.4 gigawatts. Maryland is seeking an additional fee of 100-gig megawatts. So I do think the momentum is real. And the combination of enthusiasm coming out of Washington and enthusiasm on the part of Governors in the region in which we operate leads me to believe that there is going to be a lot of opportunity to invest both in the transmission infrastructure needed to access carbon-free resources and the continued development of carbon-free resources as well as the preservation of existing carbon-free resources. 
Don't forget, I know you know this, but nationwide, the existing nuclear fleet is responsible for over -- just over 50% of the carbon-free energy in the nation, even though it only supplies 20% of the total electricity. And in New Jersey, those numbers are even more pronounced. Our nuclear plants are over 90% of the carbon-free energy. So he's got this really nice confluence of political leadership in capital and in the states, all rolling the same -- rolling above in the same direction."

In Phase II, there are 3 pathways we're going to explore. One is a federal pathway via that a clean energy standard or production tax credit, and we talked about that just a moment ago. So we're going to work hard to pursue that because it is global climate change, not New Jersey climate change. 
Second path is to being honest broker and adviser to the state in its pursuit of an FRR. And that, as I said in my remarks, is in process, and we're expecting a summary report from the state consultants sometime this month. That's just a little bit behind schedule, but not by much and state has some time to do that thoughtfully and well. In the unlikely event that all of that doesn't achieve the long-term economic viability of the nuclear plants, then we would talk to state policymakers about modifying the ZEC program to do that. 
It is pretty clear that a 3-year process is untenable in such a capital-intensive asset. And as we said throughout the proceeding, the $10 per megawatt hour was not commensurate with the cost of capital associated on a risk-adjusted basis when operating those plants. But given the opportunity to pursue these 3 other remedy paths that we would accept the $10 per megawatt. So I do think that there's a fair amount of opportunity to change the economic support for the nuclear plants."

And we've said throughout the year and even before, if you take a look at the capital program that we have in front of us for 21 to '25 that we could fund that without the need for incremental equity. So take that as it is and start to think about the sale of the business and proceeds coming in, there's going to be excess proceeds. And so your question is the right one. What do you think about for use of proceeds? And so there's debt at the Power level. And if you think about working your way through some of the terms of that debt, you'll see that some of the conditions there in is reliant upon some of the assets that are being sold. 
So I think, pay down of debt at the Power level is an obvious first use of proceeds. We would anticipate excess proceeds beyond that. At which point, you start to take a look at how we have described the business and how we've described the business is continuing to grow the utility. It has a fairly voracious appetite. The existing capital plan can be done without additional equity. But as we step through time, as we've always said, if you take a look at the 5-year capital plan, there are additional things that end up coming to bear during those 4- or 5-year periods and then towards the back end of that plan. That are not known at the beginning. 
So there certainly ends up being opportunity at the utility. We've had a lot of discussion about offshore wind. We've talked about investing in Ocean Wind and that we would not intend to do ocean wind as a one-off project, so we would either be in the business or not. So opportunities will come there, and they tend to be lumpy when they come based upon the various solicitations. So I think there's another opportunity to deploy capital there. And then there is always the opportunity to return some capital to shareholders. 
To your point, we have said very often that, to the extent that we look at some of the transactions that are going on and people are paying more than 1x rate base to get the ability to earn on a dollar of rate base, that's a challenging economic situation for us. So we have looked, and we'll continue to look at those opportunities. But to date, they have kind of fallen below the optimal things that we can do with our capital."

If I tend to think about the assets that we're selling to they are assets with they're very efficient, great capacity factors. And so they're getting significant spark spreads that ultimately drive their value. Capacity has some of the value, obviously. But given how much they run, I think the energy margins are going to be critical to that determination. And this auction is going to be 1 year. And what folks will see after that, they can draw some conclusions from a year. 
But as I just talked about, you think about historical auctions compared to the current auction, you're going to have differences in the parameters as you step through time. So I think that the capacity auctions of the past have not been a  wonderful forebearer of what could happen in future auctions. So obviously, each participant is going to take a look at that and see what they're going to do with it from a bid perspective. But it's not as big of an impact to look at a historical capacity auction as the some other things."

I'm pleased to report that PSEG has achieved several major milestones on our path to becoming a primarily regulated utility company with a complementary and significantly contracted carbon-free generating fleet.
PSEG posted solid results earlier this morning, reporting non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2021 of $1.28 per share versus $1.03 per share in last year's first quarter. Our GAAP results for the first quarter were also $1.28 per share versus $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Results from ongoing regulated investments at PSE&G and the effect of cold weather on PSEG Power drove favorable comparisons at both businesses.
We present details on the quarter's results on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation. We are well positioned to execute on our financial and strategic goals for the balance of the year given this eventful quarter.
Beginning was out nearly $2 billion of Clean Energy Future programs, which have moved from approval to execution. PSE&G is helping to advance the decarbonization of New Jersey in a sizable and equitable way. Our Clean Energy Future investments are paired with a jobs training program that offers opportunities to low and middle-income New Jersey community. Last week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities voted unanimously to award a continuation of the full $10 per megawatt hour zero-emission certificates, I'll just call them ZECs from now on, for all 3 New Jersey nuclear units, that would be Hope Creek, Salem number 1 and Salem number 2 through May of 2025. This was the maximum amount that the BPU could have awarded, and we are appreciative of the support received from the many community, labor, business, environmental and employee organizations that participated in this enormously important process.
Each of these groups recognizes the value of the reliable around the clock and carbon-free electricity supply our nuclear plants provide. Throughout this process, our nuclear team has approached operations at the units with the utmost professionalism and dedication to safety. I congratulate PSEG Nuclear for being recognized by as an industry leader in operational reliability, 1 of only 2 nuclear fleets across the industry with no scrams over the past 365 days.
The BPU's decision to extend the ZEC program will advance climate action in New Jersey by helping to preserve the state's largest carbon-free generating resource and is consistent with the growing interest at the federal level in preserving existing nuclear as an essential part of a clean energy mix. We applaud the BPU for its decision, which is in the best interest of the state of New Jersey and its ability to achieve its long-term clean energy goals without compromising reliability or going backward on environmental gains made to date.
Looking ahead, we will soon work with stakeholders to obtain alignment of state and federal climate goals in seeking ways to extend the duration of support for carbon-free nuclear power. During the quarter, the BPU also approved PSEG's 25% equity investment in Ørsted's Ocean Wind project. In addition, Ocean Wind received a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, which we will also review -- which will also review the project's construction and operations plan.
In April, PJM, closed cooperation with the BPU, opened a 4-month solicitation window to seek transmission solutions to support New Jersey's offshore wind generation target. This process is PGM's first public policy transmission solicitation, and we will participate in this proceeding. The recent Biden administration proposal focusing on climate action is clearly supportive of offshore wind, existing nuclear generation and electrification of transportation, all of which are aligned with PSEG's business plan and strategy for sustainability.
PSEG eagerly encourages an advocate for a national approach to accelerate economy wide, net zero emissions even sooner than 2050 in a constructive manner that expands green jobs by investing in clean energy infrastructure. I am more optimistic than ever that the momentum for real climate action is taking hold, PSEG continues to press ahead with our powering, progress, vision, that incorporates energy efficiency and the electrification of transportation to help our customers use energy -- use less energy.
We are pairing that with our move to make the energy our customers use cleaner, which aligns with our efforts to preserve our existing nuclear units and pursue strategic alternatives for our Fossil fleet. Then we strive to deliver with high reliability and resiliency, which ties to our investments in Energy Infrastructure and the Energy cloud. Today, we are also announcing progress on our strategic alternatives exploration with an agreement to sell our solar source portfolio to an affiliate of LS Power. The sale resulted from a robust marketing process, and we're pleased with the outcome of the sale, having determined that the transaction is modestly accretive on the sum of the parts and on an operating earnings basis going forward.
We expect the solar source portfolio deals to close in the second or third quarter of 2021, subject to customary, regulatory and other closing conditions.
PSEG Power is continuing the exploration of strategic alternatives for its Fossil generating fleet and currently anticipate reaching an agreement around midyear. These expected transactions, along with over a decade of capital allocation directed mainly toward PSE&G to position the remaining company as a primarily regulated electric and gas utility with a complementary carbon-free nuclear fleet and offshore wind investments that will be highly contracted.
The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact continued to affect the New Jersey economy. The large contribution of the transmission and residential electric and gas components to our overall sales mix has had a stabilizing effect on the margins of our utility business as does a supportive regulatory order that authorizes deferral of certain COVID-19-related costs for future recovery. Governor Murphy recently announced that a significant easing of COVID-19 restrictions on the state's businesses, venues and gatherings would begin on May 19 following progress in vaccinating over half of the state's population and a sustained reduction in positivity and hospitalization rates.
PSE&G has begun implementing the Clean Energy Future Energy Efficiency programs by initiating customer engagement and outreach as well as advancing the clean energy jobs training program I mentioned earlier and related IT system build-out activity. Following the BPU approval of our $700 million AMI proposal in January, we have begun implementation of the 4-year program. Our current focus is on planning the AMI communications network, customer outreach and developing the installation schedule of the new meters. On the regulatory and policy front, there are several upcoming developments at the FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the BPU and PJM that could influence future results.
Last month, FERC promulgated a new proposed rule to limit the 50 basis point RTO return on equity incentive to a 3-year period. Given the Biden administration's interest in the significant transmission build out to expand the integration of Clean Energy into the nation's power grid, this development was disappointed. We have long supported the need for higher incentives for transmission investment over distribution returns based on the added complexity and risk of these projects.
Coordination through the RTO has benefits, but [indiscernible] risks and complications must be considered as well. Based on the short comment window provided, the proposed rule could be enacted as early as the third quarter. We will file comments to recognize the merits of continuing the RTO adder, but this looks to be an uphill battle, given the Chair's support for the supplemental rule.
While we await the results of the first PJM capacity auction in 3 years, which PGM will announce on June 2, PSEG is continuing to advocate for a minimum offer price rule, I'll call it MOPR going forward, that will avoid double payment for resources such as offshore wind and nuclear or other supply need to achieve state goals. FERC Commissioner Danly has developed a state option to choose resources proposal, or SOCR, intended to achieve the major goals of establishing the rights of states to choose their preferred capacity resources to achieve their energy policy objectives and eliminate double payments by states for the capacity they choose.
This proposal could have the added benefit of keeping much of FERC's capacity market reform rules intact while addressing state objections. New Jersey is expected to issue its consultants report and recommendation for resource adequacy this month. This report could determine whether a fixed resource requirement, or FRR, will be chosen to satisfy the state's future capacity obligations beyond the 2022 and 2023 energy year. We continue to believe that the state could pursue an FRR without legislation and will suggest options to minimize the cost impact of FERC's capacity ruling on New Jersey customers.
Earlier in April, the BPU released its strong proposal to address the design of the solar successor program. Stakeholder meetings are being conducted to consider a solar financial incentive program that will permanently replace the Solar Renewable Energy Certificate, or SREC program, and the Temporary Transitional Renewable Energy Certificate, or TRAC program, which was instituted in 2020 upon the state attainment of 5.1% of kilowatt hours sold from solar generation fee.
Given the substantial increase in New Jersey solar target, the high cost of solar and the solar cost caps in the Clean Energy Act of 2018, we believe it is critical to develop a cost-effective approach to incent future solar generation. By far, the most efficient and cost-effective way for New Jersey to optimize what solar can bring to the achievement of its clean energy goals is to maximize grid-connected utility-scale projects by involving the state's electric distribution company.
So to wrap up my remarks, we are reaffirming non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2021 of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. Our guidance assumes normal weather and plant operations for the remainder of the year and incorporates the conservation incentive programs that begin in June for electric and in October for gas to cover variations in revenue due to energy efficiency and other impacts.
In addition, as we mentioned on our year-end call, our 2021 guidance assumes a prospective settlement of our transmission return on equity at a lower rate and the inclusion of Fossil's results for the full year. We are on track to execute PSEG's 5-year $14 billion to $16 billion capital program through 2025 and had the financial strength to fund it without the need to issue new equity.
Over 90% of the current capital program is directed to PSE&G, which is expected to produce 6.5% to 8% compound annual growth in rate base over the '21 to '25 period, starting from PSEG's year-end 2020 rate base of $22 billion. As we've noted previously, PSE&G's considerable cash-generating capabilities are supported by over 90% of its capital spending, continuing to receive either formula rate last based or current rate recovery of and on capital.
Finally, I thank our employees for their exceptional contributions to a compelling PSEG story this quarter. From nuclear operations marking a second breaker-to-breaker uninterrupted run at Hope Creek to a cross-functional regulatory, legal, financing, government affairs group that multi cash on Clean Energy Future, ZECs and a host of other regulatory proceedings, to our field crews in New Jersey and Long Island who exemplify a safety conscious mindset, I could not be prouder of our entire PSEG team.
And now I'll turn the call over to Dan for more details on our financial and operating results and will be available for your questions after his remarks. Dan?"

Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone.

We've provided you with information on",1679,"Great. Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2021 of $1.28 per share versus $1.03 per share in last year's first quarter. We've provided you with information on Slide 12 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings by business for the quarter. And Slide 13 contains a waterfall chart that takes you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter in non-GAAP operating earnings by major business. I'll now review each company in more detail.
PSE&G, as shown on Slide 15, reported net income for the first quarter 2021 of $0.94 per share compared with $0.87 per share for the first quarter of 2020, up 8% versus last year. Results improved by $0.07 per share, driven by revenue growth from ongoing capital investment program and favorable pension OPEB results. Transmission capital spending added $0.02 per share of the first quarter net income compared to the first quarter of 2020.
On the distribution side, gas margin improved by $0.03 per share over last year's first quarter, driven by the scheduled recovery of investments made under the second phase of the Gas System Modernization Program. Electric margin was $0.01 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020 on a higher weather-normalized residential volume.
O&M expense was $0.02 per share unfavorable compared to the first quarter of 2020, reflecting higher costs from several February snowstorms. Depreciation expense increased by $0.01 per share, reflecting higher plant in service, and pension expense was $0.02 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020. Flow through taxes and other were $0.02 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020. And this tax benefit is due to the use of an annual effective tax rate that will reverse over the remainder of the year and was partly offset by the timing of taxes related to bad debt expense.
Winter weather, as measured by heating degree days, was 4% milder than normal, but was 18% colder than the mild winter experienced in the first quarter of 2020. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, total weather-normalized sales reflected the higher expected residential and lower commercial and industrial sales observed in 2020 due to the economic impacts of COVID-19. Total electric sales declined by 2%, while gas sales increased by approximately 1%. Residential customer growth for electric and gas remained positive during the period.
PSE&G invested approximately $600 million in the first quarter and is on track to fully execute on its planned 2021 capital investment program of $2.7 billion. The 2021 capital spending program will include infrastructure upgrades to transmission and distribution facilities as well as the rollout of the Clean Energy Future investments in Energy Efficiency, Energy Cloud, including smart meters and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. 
PSE&G is continuing to defer the impact of additional expenses incurred to protect its employees and customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. PSE&G has experienced significantly higher accounts receivables and bad debts, and lower cash collections from customers due to the moratorium on shut offs for residential customers that began last March and has been extended through June of this year. We've launched an Expanded Customer Communications Program designed to inform all customers about payment assistance programs and bill management tools.
As a reminder, PSE&G continues to make quarterly filings with the BPU, detailing the COVID-19 pandemic related deferrals.
And as of March 31, PSE&G has recorded a regulatory asset of approximately $60 million for net incremental costs, which includes $35 million for incremental gas bad debt expense. Electric bad debt expenses recovered through the societal benefits charge and trued up periodically. With respect to subsidiary guidance for PSE&G, our forecast of net income for 2021 is unchanged at $1.410 billion to $1.470 billion.
Now moving to Power. In the first quarter of 2021, PSEG Power reported net income of $161 million or $0.32 per share, non-GAAP operating earnings of $163 million or $0.32 per share, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $321 million. This compares to first quarter 2020 net income of $13 million, non-GAAP operating earnings of $85 million and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $201 million.
The earnings release and Slide 21 provide you with a detailed analysis of the items having an impact on Power's non-GAAP operating earnings relative to net income quarter-over-quarter. And we have also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter on Slide 22.
PSEG Power's first quarter results benefited from a scheduled improvement in capacity prices for the first half of 2021, a favorable weather comparison to the mild winter in the first quarter of 2020, and other items, some of which are expected to reverse in subsequent quarters.
The expected increase in PJM's capacity revenue improved non-GAAP operating earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share compared with last year's first quarter. Higher generation in the 2021 first quarter added $0.01 per share due to the absence of the first quarter 2020 unplanned [ on 1 average. ] And favorable market conditions influenced by February's cold weather benefited results by $0.03 per share compared to last year's first quarter.
We continue to forecast a $2 per megawatt hour average decline in recontracting for the full year recognizing that the shape of the annual average change favors the winter months of the first quarter.
The weather-related improvement in total gas send out to commercial and industrial customers increased results by $0.04 per share. We expect some of this increase to gas apps will reverse later in 2021, reflecting the absence of a onetime benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2020 related to a pipeline refund. O&M expense was $0.03 per share favorable in the quarter, benefiting from the absence of first quarter 2020 outages at Bergen 2 and Salem 1, and lower depreciation and lower interest expense combined to improve by $0.01 per share versus the quarter ago -- or the year ago quarter.
Generation output increased by just under 1% to total 13.3-terawatt hours versus last year's first quarter when Salem Unit 1 experienced a month-long unplanned outage. PSEG Power's combined cycle fleet produced 4.7-terawatt hours, down 8%, reflecting lower market demand in the quarter. The Nuclear fleet produced 8.2-terawatt hours, up 3%, and  operated at a capacity factor of 98.8% for the first quarter, representing 62% of total generation.
As Ralph mentioned, Hope Creek posted an uninterrupted run between refueling outages and just began its 23rd refueling outage in April. PSEG Power is forecasting generation output of 36 to 38 terawatt hours for the remaining 3 quarters of 2021 and has hedged approximately 95% to 100% of this production at an average price of $30 per megawatt hour.
Gross margin for the first quarter rose to approximately $34 per megawatt hour compared to $30 per megawatt hour in the first quarter of 2020, which contained one of the mildest winters in recent history. Power prices in the first quarter of 2021 were stronger across PJM New York and New England compared to the year earlier period. And this winter's temperatures were 12% cooler on average and resulted in better market conditions compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Power's average capacity prices in PJM were higher in the first quarter of 2021 versus the first quarter of 2020 and will remain stable at $168 per megawatt hour -- per megawatt day through May of 2022. In New England, our average realized capacity price will decline slightly to $192 per megawatt day, beginning June 1. However, Power's cleared capacity will decline by 383 megawatts with the scheduled retirement of the Bridgeport Harbor Unit 3, achieving our goal of making Power's fleet completely coal free.
Over 75% of PSEG Power's expected gross margin in 2021 is secured by our fully hedged position of energy output, capacity revenue set in previous auctions and the opportunity to earn a full year of ZEC revenues and certain ancillary service payments such as reactive power. The forecast of PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2021 remain unchanged at $280 million to $370 million and $850 million to $950 million, respectively.
Now let me briefly address results from PSEG Enterprise and Other. For the first quarter of 2021, Enterprise and Other reported net income of $10 million or $0.02 per share for the first quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of $5 million or $0.01 per share for the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in the quarter reflects higher tax benefits recorded in the first quarter of 2021 due to the use of an annual effective tax rate that will reverse over the remainder of the year as well as interest income associated with a prior IRS audit settlement.
For 2021, the forecast for PSEG Enterprise and Other remains unchanged at a net loss of $15 million.
With respect to financial position, PSG ended the quarter with $803 million of cash on the balance sheet. During the first quarter, PSE&G issued $450 million of 5-year secured medium-term notes at 95 basis points and $450 million of 30-year secured medium-term notes at 3%. In addition, we retired a $300 million, 1.9% medium-term note at PSE&G that matured in March. In March of 2021, PSEG closed on a $500 million, 364-day variable rate term loan agreement, following the January prepayment of a $300 million term loan initiated in March of 2020.
For the balance of the year, we have approximately $950 million of debt at PSEG Power scheduled to mature in June and September. $300 million of debt scheduled to mature at the parent in November and $134 million of debt at PSE&G scheduled to mature in June. Our solid balance sheet and credit metrics keep us in a position to fund our 2021 to 2025 capital investment program without the need to issue new equity.
As Ralph mentioned earlier, we are affirming our forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year of 2021 of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. That concludes my comments. And Christi, we are now ready to take questions."

We were one of the very small group of companies candidly in our industry who worked to the President and supported his 80% reduction by 2030 for the electric sector. And we're working with members of Congress on making sure that nuclear is included in any clean energy standard in a technology-neutral way. Candidly, we have been talking to folks about the possibility that if tax credits are extended for carbon-free energy that nuclear be eligible for that as well. That, to an extent, an incentive system is set up to achieve these targets that may not be technology specific, but that they be, I'll repeat myself here, technology indifferent as long as you're achieving the desired outcome, which is carbon reductions.
We know that there is a lot of wisdom to all the above approach, including nuclear, solar, wind, carbon capture and storage. And we're pleased to see what the President has said about the prospects for offshore wind in New Jersey in the middle of the second round, solicitation looking from another 2.4 gigawatts. Maryland is seeking an additional fee of 100-gig megawatts.
So I do think the momentum is real. And the combination of enthusiasm coming out of Washington and enthusiasm on the part of Governors in the region in which we operate leads me to believe that there is going to be a lot of opportunity to invest both in the transmission infrastructure needed to access carbon-free resources and the continued development of carbon-free resources as well as the preservation of existing carbon-free resources.
Don't forget, I know you know this, but nationwide, the existing nuclear fleet is responsible for over -- just over 50% of the carbon-free energy in the nation, even though it only supplies 20% of the total electricity. And in New Jersey, those numbers are even more pronounced. Our nuclear plants are over 90% of the carbon-free energy. So he's got this really nice confluence of political leadership in capital and in the states, all rowing the same -- rowing the boat in the same direction."

In Phase II, there are 3 pathways we're going to explore. One is a federal pathway via that a clean energy standard or production tax credit, and we talked about that just a moment ago. So we're going to work hard to pursue that because it is global climate change, not New Jersey climate change.
Second path is to being honest broker and adviser to the state in its pursuit of an FRR. And that, as I said in my remarks, is in process, and we're expecting a summary report from the state consultants sometime this month. That's just a little bit behind schedule, but not by much and state has some time to do that thoughtfully and well. In the unlikely event that all of that doesn't achieve the long-term economic viability of the nuclear plants, then we would talk to state policymakers about modifying the ZEC program to do that.
It is pretty clear that a 3-year process is untenable in such a capital-intensive asset. And as we said throughout the proceeding, the $10 per megawatt hour was not commensurate with the cost of capital associated on a risk-adjusted basis when operating those plants. But given the opportunity to pursue these 3 other remedy paths that we would accept the $10 per megawatt. So I do think that there's a fair amount of opportunity to change the economic support for the nuclear plants."

And we've said throughout the year and even before, if you take a look at the capital program that we have in front of us for 21 to '25 that we could fund that without the need for incremental equity. So take that as it is and start to think about the sale of the business and proceeds coming in, there's going to be excess proceeds. And so your question is the right one. What do you think about for use of proceeds?
And so there's debt at the Power level. And if you think about working your way through some of the terms of that debt, you'll see that some of the conditions there in is reliant upon some of the assets that are being sold.
So I think, pay down of debt at the Power level is an obvious first use of proceeds. We would anticipate excess proceeds beyond that, at which point, you start to take a look at how we have described the business and how we've described the business is continuing to grow the utility. It has a fairly voracious appetite. The existing capital plan can be done without additional equity. But as we step through time, as we've always said, if you take a look at the 5-year capital plan, there are additional things that end up coming to bear during those 4- or 5-year periods and then towards the back end of that plan that are not known at the beginning.
So there certainly ends up being opportunity at the utility. We've had a lot of discussion about offshore wind. We've talked about investing in Ocean Wind, and that we would not intend to do ocean wind as a one-off project, so we would either be in the business or not. So opportunities will come there, and they tend to be lumpy when they come based upon the various solicitations. So I think there's another opportunity to deploy capital there. And then there is always the opportunity to return some capital to shareholders.
To your point, we have said very often that, to the extent that we look at some of the transactions that are going on and people are paying more than 1x rate base to get the ability to earn on a dollar of rate base, that's a challenging economic situation for us. So we have looked, and we'll continue to look at those opportunities. But to date, they have kind of fallen below the optimal things that we can do with our capital."

But as I just talked about, you think about historical auctions compared to the current auction, you're going to have differences in the parameters as you step through time. So I think that the capacity auctions of the past have not been a  wonderful forebearer of what could happen in future auctions.

So because New Jersey is clearly in for the long-haul in terms of securing carbon-free energy.

And I could see the states are saying, okay, I can't live that way, let me chart my own course.

I'm pleased to report that PSEG has achieved several major milestones on our path to becoming a primarily regulated utility company with a complementary and significantly contracted carbon-free generating fleet.
PSEG posted solid results earlier this morning, reporting non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2021 of $1.28 per share versus $1.03 per share in last year's first quarter. Our GAAP results for the first quarter were also $1.28 per share versus $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Results from ongoing regulated investments at PSE&G and the effect of cold weather on PSEG Power drove favorable comparisons at both businesses.
We present details on the quarter's results on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation. We are well positioned to execute on our financial and strategic goals for the balance of the year given this eventful quarter.
Beginning was out nearly $2 billion of Clean Energy Future programs, which have moved from approval to execution. PSE&G is helping to advance the decarbonization of New Jersey in a sizable and equitable way. Our Clean Energy Future investments are paired with a jobs training program that offers opportunities to low and middle-income New Jersey community. Last week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities voted unanimously to award a continuation of the full $10 per megawatt hour zero-emission certificates, I'll just call them ZECs from now on, for all 3 New Jersey nuclear units, that would be Hope Creek, Salem number 1 and Salem number 2 through May of 2025. This was the maximum amount that the BPU could have awarded, and we are appreciative of the support received from the many community, labor, business, environmental and employee organizations that participated in this enormously important process.
Each of these groups recognizes the value of the reliable around the clock and carbon-free electricity supply our nuclear plants provide. Throughout this process, our nuclear team has approached operations at the units with the utmost professionalism and dedication to safety. I congratulate PSEG Nuclear for being recognized by as an industry leader in operational reliability, 1 of only 2 nuclear fleets across the industry with no scrams over the past 365 days.
The BPU's decision to extend the ZEC program will advance climate action in New Jersey by helping to preserve the state's largest carbon-free generating resource and is consistent with the growing interest at the federal level in preserving existing nuclear as an essential part of a clean energy mix. We applaud the BPU for its decision, which is in the best interest of the state of New Jersey and its ability to achieve its long-term clean energy goals without compromising reliability or going backward on environmental gains made to date.
Looking ahead, we will soon work with stakeholders to obtain alignment of state and federal climate goals in seeking ways to extend the duration of support for carbon-free nuclear power. During the quarter, the BPU also approved PSEG's 25% equity investment in Ørsted's Ocean Wind project. In addition, Ocean Wind received a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, which we will also review -- which will also review the project's construction and operations plan.
In April, PJM, closed cooperation with the BPU, opened a 4-month solicitation window to seek transmission solutions to support New Jersey's offshore wind generation target. This process is PGM's first public policy transmission solicitation, and we will participate in this proceeding. The recent Biden administration proposal focusing on climate action is clearly supportive of offshore wind, existing nuclear generation and electrification of transportation, all of which are aligned with PSEG's business plan and strategy for sustainability.
PSEG eagerly encourages an advocate for a national approach to accelerate economy wide, net zero emissions even sooner than 2050 in a constructive manner that expands green jobs by investing in clean energy infrastructure. I am more optimistic than ever that the momentum for real climate action is taking hold, PSEG continues to press ahead with our powering, progress, vision, that incorporates energy efficiency and the electrification of transportation to help our customers use energy -- use less energy.
We are pairing that with our move to make the energy our customers use cleaner, which aligns with our efforts to preserve our existing nuclear units and pursue strategic alternatives for our Fossil fleet. Then we strive to deliver with high reliability and resiliency, which ties to our investments in Energy Infrastructure and the Energy cloud. Today, we are also announcing progress on our strategic alternatives exploration with an agreement to sell our solar source portfolio to an affiliate of LS Power. The sale resulted from a robust marketing process, and we're pleased with the outcome of the sale, having determined that the transaction is modestly accretive on the sum of the parts and on an operating earnings basis going forward.
We expect the solar source portfolio deals to close in the second or third quarter of 2021, subject to customary, regulatory and other closing conditions.
PSEG Power is continuing the exploration of strategic alternatives for its Fossil generating fleet and currently anticipate reaching an agreement around midyear. These expected transactions, along with over a decade of capital allocation directed mainly toward PSE&G to position the remaining company as a primarily regulated electric and gas utility with a complementary carbon-free nuclear fleet and offshore wind investments that will be highly contracted.
The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact continued to affect the New Jersey economy. The large contribution of the transmission and residential electric and gas components to our overall sales mix has had a stabilizing effect on the margins of our utility business as does a supportive regulatory order that authorizes deferral of certain COVID-19-related costs for future recovery. Governor Murphy recently announced that a significant easing of COVID-19 restrictions on the state's businesses, venues and gatherings would begin on May 19 following progress in vaccinating over half of the state's population and a sustained reduction in positivity and hospitalization rates.
PSE&G has begun implementing the Clean Energy Future Energy Efficiency programs by initiating customer engagement and outreach as well as advancing the clean energy jobs training program I mentioned earlier and related IT system build-out activity. Following the BPU approval of our $700 million AMI proposal in January, we have begun implementation of the 4-year program. Our current focus is on planning the AMI communications network, customer outreach and developing the installation schedule of the new meters. On the regulatory and policy front, there are several upcoming developments at the FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the BPU and PJM that could influence future results.
Last month, FERC promulgated a new proposed rule to limit the 50 basis point RTO return on equity incentive to a 3-year period. Given the Biden administration's interest in the significant transmission build out to expand the integration of Clean Energy into the nation's power grid, this development was disappointed. We have long supported the need for higher incentives for transmission investment over distribution returns based on the added complexity and risk of these projects.
Coordination through the RTO has benefits, but [indiscernible] risks and complications must be considered as well. Based on the short comment window provided, the proposed rule could be enacted as early as the third quarter. We will file comments to recognize the merits of continuing the RTO adder, but this looks to be an uphill battle, given the Chair's support for the supplemental rule.
While we await the results of the first PJM capacity auction in 3 years, which PGM will announce on June 2, PSEG is continuing to advocate for a minimum offer price rule, I'll call it MOPR going forward, that will avoid double payment for resources such as offshore wind and nuclear or other supply need to achieve state goals. FERC Commissioner Danly has developed a state option to choose resources proposal, or SOCR, intended to achieve the major goals of establishing the rights of states to choose their preferred capacity resources to achieve their energy policy objectives and eliminate double payments by states for the capacity they choose.
This proposal could have the added benefit of keeping much of FERC's capacity market reform rules intact while addressing state objections. New Jersey is expected to issue its consultants report and recommendation for resource adequacy this month. This report could determine whether a fixed resource requirement, or FRR, will be chosen to satisfy the state's future capacity obligations beyond the 2022 and 2023 energy year. We continue to believe that the state could pursue an FRR without legislation and will suggest options to minimize the cost impact of FERC's capacity ruling on New Jersey customers.
Earlier in April, the BPU released its strong proposal to address the design of the solar successor program. Stakeholder meetings are being conducted to consider a solar financial incentive program that will permanently replace the Solar Renewable Energy Certificate, or SREC program, and the Temporary Transitional Renewable Energy Certificate, or TRAC program, which was instituted in 2020 upon the state attainment of 5.1% of kilowatt hours sold from solar generation fee.
Given the substantial increase in New Jersey solar target, the high cost of solar and the solar cost caps in the Clean Energy Act of 2018, we believe it is critical to develop a cost-effective approach to incent future solar generation. By far, the most efficient and cost-effective way for New Jersey to optimize what solar can bring to the achievement of its clean energy goals is to maximize grid-connected utility-scale projects by involving the state's electric distribution company.
So to wrap up my remarks, we are reaffirming non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2021 of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. Our guidance assumes normal weather and plant operations for the remainder of the year and incorporates the conservation incentive programs that begin in June for electric and in October for gas to cover variations in revenue due to energy efficiency and other impacts.
In addition, as we mentioned on our year-end call, our 2021 guidance assumes a prospective settlement of our transmission return on equity at a lower rate and the inclusion of Fossil's results for the full year. We are on track to execute PSEG's 5-year $14 billion to $16 billion capital program through 2025 and had the financial strength to fund it without the need to issue new equity.
Over 90% of the current capital program is directed to PSE&G, which is expected to produce 6.5% to 8% compound annual growth in rate base over the '21 to '25 period, starting from PSEG's year-end 2020 rate base of $22 billion. As we've noted previously, PSE&G's considerable cash-generating capabilities are supported by over 90% of its capital spending, continuing to receive either formula rate last based or current rate recovery of and on capital.
Finally, I thank our employees for their exceptional contributions to a compelling PSEG story this quarter. From nuclear operations marking a second breaker-to-breaker uninterrupted run at Hope Creek to a cross-functional regulatory, legal, financing, government affairs group that multi cash on Clean Energy Future, ZECs and a host of other regulatory proceedings, to our field crews in New Jersey and Long Island who exemplify a safety conscious mindset, I could not be prouder of our entire PSEG team.
And now I'll turn the call over to Dan for more details on our financial and operating results and will be available for your questions after his remarks. Dan?"
298482,710410680,2271325,"Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Great. Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2021 of $1.28 per share versus $1.03 per share in last year's first quarter. We've provided you with information on",1679,"Great. Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2021 of $1.28 per share versus $1.03 per share in last year's first quarter. We've provided you with information on Slide 12 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings by business for the quarter. And Slide 13 contains a waterfall chart that takes you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter in non-GAAP operating earnings by major business. I'll now review each company in more detail.
PSE&G, as shown on Slide 15, reported net income for the first quarter 2021 of $0.94 per share compared with $0.87 per share for the first quarter of 2020, up 8% versus last year. Results improved by $0.07 per share, driven by revenue growth from ongoing capital investment program and favorable pension OPEB results. Transmission capital spending added $0.02 per share of the first quarter net income compared to the first quarter of 2020.
On the distribution side, gas margin improved by $0.03 per share over last year's first quarter, driven by the scheduled recovery of investments made under the second phase of the Gas System Modernization Program. Electric margin was $0.01 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020 on a higher weather-normalized residential volume.
O&M expense was $0.02 per share unfavorable compared to the first quarter of 2020, reflecting higher costs from several February snowstorms. Depreciation expense increased by $0.01 per share, reflecting higher plant in service, and pension expense was $0.02 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020. Flow through taxes and other were $0.02 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2020. And this tax benefit is due to the use of an annual effective tax rate that will reverse over the remainder of the year and was partly offset by the timing of taxes related to bad debt expense.
Winter weather, as measured by heating degree days, was 4% milder than normal, but was 18% colder than the mild winter experienced in the first quarter of 2020. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, total weather-normalized sales reflected the higher expected residential and lower commercial and industrial sales observed in 2020 due to the economic impacts of COVID-19. Total electric sales declined by 2%, while gas sales increased by approximately 1%. Residential customer growth for electric and gas remained positive during the period.
PSE&G invested approximately $600 million in the first quarter and is on track to fully execute on its planned 2021 capital investment program of $2.7 billion. The 2021 capital spending program will include infrastructure upgrades to transmission and distribution facilities as well as the rollout of the Clean Energy Future investments in Energy Efficiency, Energy Cloud, including smart meters and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. 
PSE&G is continuing to defer the impact of additional expenses incurred to protect its employees and customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. PSE&G has experienced significantly higher accounts receivables and bad debts, and lower cash collections from customers due to the moratorium on shut offs for residential customers that began last March and has been extended through June of this year. We've launched an Expanded Customer Communications Program designed to inform all customers about payment assistance programs and bill management tools.
As a reminder, PSE&G continues to make quarterly filings with the BPU, detailing the COVID-19 pandemic related deferrals.
And as of March 31, PSE&G has recorded a regulatory asset of approximately $60 million for net incremental costs, which includes $35 million for incremental gas bad debt expense. Electric bad debt expenses recovered through the societal benefits charge and trued up periodically. With respect to subsidiary guidance for PSE&G, our forecast of net income for 2021 is unchanged at $1.410 billion to $1.470 billion.
Now moving to Power. In the first quarter of 2021, PSEG Power reported net income of $161 million or $0.32 per share, non-GAAP operating earnings of $163 million or $0.32 per share, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $321 million. This compares to first quarter 2020 net income of $13 million, non-GAAP operating earnings of $85 million and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $201 million.
The earnings release and Slide 21 provide you with a detailed analysis of the items having an impact on Power's non-GAAP operating earnings relative to net income quarter-over-quarter. And we have also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter on Slide 22.
PSEG Power's first quarter results benefited from a scheduled improvement in capacity prices for the first half of 2021, a favorable weather comparison to the mild winter in the first quarter of 2020, and other items, some of which are expected to reverse in subsequent quarters.
The expected increase in PJM's capacity revenue improved non-GAAP operating earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share compared with last year's first quarter. Higher generation in the 2021 first quarter added $0.01 per share due to the absence of the first quarter 2020 unplanned [ on 1 average. ] And favorable market conditions influenced by February's cold weather benefited results by $0.03 per share compared to last year's first quarter.
We continue to forecast a $2 per megawatt hour average decline in recontracting for the full year recognizing that the shape of the annual average change favors the winter months of the first quarter.
The weather-related improvement in total gas send out to commercial and industrial customers increased results by $0.04 per share. We expect some of this increase to gas apps will reverse later in 2021, reflecting the absence of a onetime benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2020 related to a pipeline refund. O&M expense was $0.03 per share favorable in the quarter, benefiting from the absence of first quarter 2020 outages at Bergen 2 and Salem 1, and lower depreciation and lower interest expense combined to improve by $0.01 per share versus the quarter ago -- or the year ago quarter.
Generation output increased by just under 1% to total 13.3-terawatt hours versus last year's first quarter when Salem Unit 1 experienced a month-long unplanned outage. PSEG Power's combined cycle fleet produced 4.7-terawatt hours, down 8%, reflecting lower market demand in the quarter. The Nuclear fleet produced 8.2-terawatt hours, up 3%, and  operated at a capacity factor of 98.8% for the first quarter, representing 62% of total generation.
As Ralph mentioned, Hope Creek posted an uninterrupted run between refueling outages and just began its 23rd refueling outage in April. PSEG Power is forecasting generation output of 36 to 38 terawatt hours for the remaining 3 quarters of 2021 and has hedged approximately 95% to 100% of this production at an average price of $30 per megawatt hour.
Gross margin for the first quarter rose to approximately $34 per megawatt hour compared to $30 per megawatt hour in the first quarter of 2020, which contained one of the mildest winters in recent history. Power prices in the first quarter of 2021 were stronger across PJM New York and New England compared to the year earlier period. And this winter's temperatures were 12% cooler on average and resulted in better market conditions compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Power's average capacity prices in PJM were higher in the first quarter of 2021 versus the first quarter of 2020 and will remain stable at $168 per megawatt hour -- per megawatt day through May of 2022. In New England, our average realized capacity price will decline slightly to $192 per megawatt day, beginning June 1. However, Power's cleared capacity will decline by 383 megawatts with the scheduled retirement of the Bridgeport Harbor Unit 3, achieving our goal of making Power's fleet completely coal free.
Over 75% of PSEG Power's expected gross margin in 2021 is secured by our fully hedged position of energy output, capacity revenue set in previous auctions and the opportunity to earn a full year of ZEC revenues and certain ancillary service payments such as reactive power. The forecast of PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2021 remain unchanged at $280 million to $370 million and $850 million to $950 million, respectively.
Now let me briefly address results from PSEG Enterprise and Other. For the first quarter of 2021, Enterprise and Other reported net income of $10 million or $0.02 per share for the first quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of $5 million or $0.01 per share for the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in the quarter reflects higher tax benefits recorded in the first quarter of 2021 due to the use of an annual effective tax rate that will reverse over the remainder of the year as well as interest income associated with a prior IRS audit settlement.
For 2021, the forecast for PSEG Enterprise and Other remains unchanged at a net loss of $15 million.
With respect to financial position, PSG ended the quarter with $803 million of cash on the balance sheet. During the first quarter, PSE&G issued $450 million of 5-year secured medium-term notes at 95 basis points and $450 million of 30-year secured medium-term notes at 3%. In addition, we retired a $300 million, 1.9% medium-term note at PSE&G that matured in March. In March of 2021, PSEG closed on a $500 million, 364-day variable rate term loan agreement, following the January prepayment of a $300 million term loan initiated in March of 2020.
For the balance of the year, we have approximately $950 million of debt at PSEG Power scheduled to mature in June and September. $300 million of debt scheduled to mature at the parent in November and $134 million of debt at PSE&G scheduled to mature in June. Our solid balance sheet and credit metrics keep us in a position to fund our 2021 to 2025 capital investment program without the need to issue new equity.
As Ralph mentioned earlier, we are affirming our forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year of 2021 of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. That concludes my comments. And Christi, we are now ready to take questions."

We were one of the very small group of companies candidly in our industry who worked to the President and supported his 80% reduction by 2030 for the electric sector. And we're working with members of Congress on making sure that nuclear is included in any clean energy standard in a technology-neutral way. Candidly, we have been talking to folks about the possibility that if tax credits are extended for carbon-free energy that nuclear be eligible for that as well. That, to an extent, an incentive system is set up to achieve these targets that may not be technology specific, but that they be, I'll repeat myself here, technology indifferent as long as you're achieving the desired outcome, which is carbon reductions.
We know that there is a lot of wisdom to all the above approach, including nuclear, solar, wind, carbon capture and storage. And we're pleased to see what the President has said about the prospects for offshore wind in New Jersey in the middle of the second round, solicitation looking from another 2.4 gigawatts. Maryland is seeking an additional fee of 100-gig megawatts.
So I do think the momentum is real. And the combination of enthusiasm coming out of Washington and enthusiasm on the part of Governors in the region in which we operate leads me to believe that there is going to be a lot of opportunity to invest both in the transmission infrastructure needed to access carbon-free resources and the continued development of carbon-free resources as well as the preservation of existing carbon-free resources.
Don't forget, I know you know this, but nationwide, the existing nuclear fleet is responsible for over -- just over 50% of the carbon-free energy in the nation, even though it only supplies 20% of the total electricity. And in New Jersey, those numbers are even more pronounced. Our nuclear plants are over 90% of the carbon-free energy. So he's got this really nice confluence of political leadership in capital and in the states, all rowing the same -- rowing the boat in the same direction."

In Phase II, there are 3 pathways we're going to explore. One is a federal pathway via that a clean energy standard or production tax credit, and we talked about that just a moment ago. So we're going to work hard to pursue that because it is global climate change, not New Jersey climate change.
Second path is to being honest broker and adviser to the state in its pursuit of an FRR. And that, as I said in my remarks, is in process, and we're expecting a summary report from the state consultants sometime this month. That's just a little bit behind schedule, but not by much and state has some time to do that thoughtfully and well. In the unlikely event that all of that doesn't achieve the long-term economic viability of the nuclear plants, then we would talk to state policymakers about modifying the ZEC program to do that.
It is pretty clear that a 3-year process is untenable in such a capital-intensive asset. And as we said throughout the proceeding, the $10 per megawatt hour was not commensurate with the cost of capital associated on a risk-adjusted basis when operating those plants. But given the opportunity to pursue these 3 other remedy paths that we would accept the $10 per megawatt. So I do think that there's a fair amount of opportunity to change the economic support for the nuclear plants."

First, just curious how you're thinking about maybe capital allocation from the Fossil sale -- pending sale? And especially as you guys are getting over the finish line, I mean, kind of with the derisking nature of the transaction, do you sort of need the cash proceeds further delevering? Or do you anticipate the transaction to be credit accretive. And then maybe as a sub-point, how efficiently do you think you could redeploy proceeds on the organic side? Because we've seen some pretty healthy transactions on the asset side with PEG, so curious there."

So take that as",429,"Yes, it's a great question, Shahriar. And we've said throughout the year and even before, if you take a look at the capital program that we have in front of us for 21 to '25 that we could fund that without the need for incremental equity. So take that as it is and start to think about the sale of the business and proceeds coming in, there's going to be excess proceeds. And so your question is the right one. What do you think about for use of proceeds?
And so there's debt at the Power level. And if you think about working your way through some of the terms of that debt, you'll see that some of the conditions there in is reliant upon some of the assets that are being sold.
So I think, pay down of debt at the Power level is an obvious first use of proceeds. We would anticipate excess proceeds beyond that, at which point, you start to take a look at how we have described the business and how we've described the business is continuing to grow the utility. It has a fairly voracious appetite. The existing capital plan can be done without additional equity. But as we step through time, as we've always said, if you take a look at the 5-year capital plan, there are additional things that end up coming to bear during those 4- or 5-year periods and then towards the back end of that plan that are not known at the beginning.
So there certainly ends up being opportunity at the utility. We've had a lot of discussion about offshore wind. We've talked about investing in Ocean Wind, and that we would not intend to do ocean wind as a one-off project, so we would either be in the business or not. So opportunities will come there, and they tend to be lumpy when they come based upon the various solicitations. So I think there's another opportunity to deploy capital there. And then there is always the opportunity to return some capital to shareholders.
To your point, we have said very often that, to the extent that we look at some of the transactions that are going on and people are paying more than 1x rate base to get the ability to earn on a dollar of rate base, that's a challenging economic situation for us. So we have looked, and we'll continue to look at those opportunities. But to date, they have kind of fallen below the optimal things that we can do with our capital."

But given how much they run, I think the energy margins are going to be critical to that determination. And this auction is going to be 1 year. And what folks will see after that, they can draw some conclusions from a year.
But as I just talked about, you think about historical auctions compared to the current auction, you're going to have differences in the parameters as you step through time. So I think that the capacity auctions of the past have not been a  wonderful forebearer of what could happen in future auctions.
So obviously, each participant is going to take a look at that and see what they're going to do with it from a bid perspective. But it's not as big of an impact to look at a historical capacity auction as the some other things."

And it's actually been used for something called the Skipjack project, which serves Maryland. We also reach into Delaware, should Delaware choose to pursue Ocean Wind and can reach New Jersey. It's in the southern tip of New Jersey.
So that has a 3-state reach. Our arrangement with Ørsted is in a certain part of the Mid-Atlantic region. So we're free to work with others outside this region.
But as you're well aware, most of the participants in offshore wind are seeking partnerships, if at all, with local utilities for a variety of regulatory and planning -- transmission planning reasons.
So while we would be open to it, I think it's safe to conclude that our primary focus and emphasis is with this partner in this Mid-Atlantic region."

PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the second quarter of 2021 versus $0.79 per share in last year's second quarter. GAAP results for the second quarte",2115,"Thank you, Carlotta, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the second quarter of 2021 versus $0.79 per share in last year's second quarter. GAAP results for the second quarter were $0.35 per share net loss related to transition charges at PSEG Power, and that compares with $0.89 per share of net income for the second quarter of 2020. 
Also in the quarter, PSEG Power recorded a pretax impairment of $519 million at its New England Asset Group, partly offset by a pretax gain of $62 million from the sale of the Solar Source portfolio. We continue to make great progress on a number of fronts to position ourselves for the future. We had a strong operating quarter that, once again, produced non-GAAP operating earnings in line with our expectations for the year. 
Our results for the second quarter bring non-GAAP operating earnings for the first half of 2021 to $1.98 per share. This 9% increase over non-GAAP results of $1.82 per share for the first half of 2020 and reflects the growing contribution from our regulated operations and continued derisking at PSEG Power. Slides 13 and 15 summarize the results for the quarter and the first half of the year. 
It's been a year since we announced our intention to explore strategic alternatives for our nonnuclear generation assets, and I'm pleased with the progress to date in what I believe is a compelling platform for future regulated growth at PSE&G. Our utility, a clean energy infrastructure-focused business, will be complemented by a significantly contracted, carbon-free generating portfolio, consisting of our nuclear fleet and investments and opportunities in regional offshore wind. 
The marketing of the fossil assets has garnered a significant level of interest from numerous qualified buyers in a competitive process, which is advancing as expected. And we expect to provide you with more information on this process in the very near future. 
I'm pleased that we've reached a balanced agreement with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and the Division of Rig Counsel on PSE&G's transmission rate, which, if approved by FERC, will resolve a significant regulatory uncertainty for us and provide a timely rate reduction for customers. PSE&G has agreed to voluntarily reduce its annual transmission revenue requirement, which includes a reduction in its base return on equity to 9.9% from 11.18%. If approved by the FERC, a typical electric residential customer will save 3% on their monthly bills. 
New Jersey continues to experience positive economic activity since Governor Murphy lifted the Public Health Emergency Order in June. Our largest customer class in terms of sales, the commercial segment, has shown a rebound in electricity demand. Electric sales overall adjusted for weather were up nearly 4% over the second quarter of 2020, led by an 11% increase in commercial sales, which was partly offset by a 5% decline in residential sales as people gradually returned to work outside the home. 
The warmer-than-normal summer has also increased PSE&G's average daily peak load for the quarter to 5,480 megawatts compared to last year's second quarter average of 5,100 megawatts and the 5,330 megawatts experienced in the pre-COVID second quarter of 2019. And so far this summer, PSE&G's load has peaked at 10,064 megawatts on June 30, exceeding the 10,000-megawatt mark for the first time since July 19 of the year 2013, 8 years ago. 
Turning to clean energy development in New Jersey, the BPU in June awarded a second round of offshore wind projects totaling 2,658 megawatts and is now halfway towards the state's goal of procuring 7,500 megawatts of offshore wind generation by 2035. The award was split between the 1,510 megawatt Atlantic Shores project and Ørsted's 1,148 megawatt Ocean Wind 2. The [indiscernible] price is set in the second round range from about $86 to $84 from the Atlantic Shores and Ocean Wind projects, respectively. 
And last week, the BPU approved a new solar successor incentive framework that consists of 2 programs: An administratively determined incentive; and a competitive solicitation incentive, which would apply to larger projects defined as 5 megawatts and above. Incentive levels for the administratively determined segment range from $90 per megawatt hour for net metered residential projects to $70 to $100 per megawatt hour for the commercial and community solar segments and up to $120 per megawatt hour for certain public entity projects. 
You will recall that the prior program consisting of solar renewable energy credits or as we frequently refer to the SRECs, average well above $200 per megawatt hour over the past decade. And combined with net metering subsidies and federal tax credits provided later incentives topping $300 per megawatt hour. So this successor program is a positive step towards balancing the need for clean energy while recognizing the importance of affordability for our customers. 
PSEG's existing solar programs are essentially fully subscribed. We'll continue to work with the state MBP on programs that can help meet the solar gold in the Energy Master Plan. PSEG continues to make tangible progress on our own decarbonization and ESG goals. In the second quarter alone, we closed on our 25% equity stake in the 1,100-megawatt Ocean Wind project in New Jersey, that's the Ocean Wind 1 project obviously. We retired our last coal unit at Bridgeport Harbor in Connecticut, making our generating fleet coal-free and moved up our net zero vision by 20 years to 2030. 
But not only do we accelerate the net zero vision, we also expanded it to include Scope 1 direct greenhouse gas emissions, and Scope 2 indirect greenhouse gas emissions from operations at both PSEG Power and PSE&G. Expanding the Net Zero vision to include both the utility and power operations is a significant move forward in our decarbonization efforts, and one that will both inspire and challenges to do more and do it better. 
Coming up, PSEG is preparing to bid into a competitive process to build offshore wind transmission infrastructure. This solicitation is intended to procure transmission solutions, this important New Jersey 7,500-megawatt offshore wind target by 2035. The potential projects can cover onshore upgrades, new onshore transmission connection facilities, new offshore transmission connection facilities and a networked offshore transmission system. Proposals may address any or all of these 4 components. 
The decision-making criteria is expected to include, among other things: An evaluation of reliability and economic benefits; cost; constructability; environmental benefits; permitting risks; and other ""New Jersey benefits"". This competitive transmission open window will be jointly conducted by PJM and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. PJM will lead the technical analysis of the proposed transmission solutions, and the BP will be the ultimate decision-maker. We support the state's efforts to procure transmission in a manner that is most reliable, constructable and cost effective for our customers. 
All of this is great progress on our decarbonization efforts and continues to demonstrate our alignment with the state's Clean Energy agenda and our industry leadership on environmental stewardship. 
New Jersey's recent endorsement of the environmental benefits provided by our New Jersey nuclear plants through the second zero-emission certificates, I'll refer to that as ZEC for the rest of this conversation, extends the $10 per megawatt hour carbon-free attribute recognition through May of 2025. This extension will allow us, along with stakeholders in New Jersey and at the federal level, the time we need to work on a long-term economic solution to keep our merchant nuclear fleet economically viable and preserve its currently unmatched contribution of reliable, carbon-free baseload generation, the most cost-effective clean generation source available. 
During the ZEC deliberations, a growing recognition of these nuclear units were economically at risk, but vitally important to New Jersey's ability to reach its clean energy and carbon goals gain further traction. The importance of the New Jersey nuclear units to the state's climate goals was also recognized in the BPU stats recent resource adequacy report. The report recommends that New Jersey should continue exploring a region-wide or New Jersey only integrated clean capacity market, with the fixed resource requirement, often, we refer to that as an FRR. 
We expect that the BPU will be closely watching to see whether FERC accepts PJM's just filed modifications to the minimum of our price rule which appears to better align the PJM capacity market with New Jersey's clean energy goals. The results of the first PJM capacity auction in 3 years, influenced by a COVID-19 pandemic stifled demand curve, serve as further evidence of the market risks faced by our nuclear units. This sentiment is shared by Biden administration officials, including DOE Secretary Grant Holm Hall and White House Domestic Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, who have both spoken publicly on the importance of nuclear energy as a clean energy resource. 
We continue to work on promoting a federal nuclear production tax credit proposal where the value of the credit declines as market revenue increases. This is the primary federal policy that would help prevent premature closing of merchant plants whose market revenues are not currently covering cost and risk. 
Other options, such as the federal nuclear grant program administered by the Department of Energy are also being discussed. However, we and others in the industry share the view that a competitive grant program will not provide timely relief nor the certainty that these plants need to remain operational. 
Nonetheless, we're encouraged by the attention that at-risk nuclear plants are getting in Washington. And we especially appreciate the efforts of New Jersey Commerce from Bill Pascrell, who's leading this effort in the House of Representatives, and Senators Cardin, Manchin and Booker in the Senate. That said, we do expect the federal infrastructure effort to take the better part of the rest of the year to unfold. 
On the social side of ESG during the second quarter, we recognized the Juneteenth holiday by giving employees paid time off to commemorate and celebrate this important day in our nation's history and supported our LBGTQ community with numerous events for Pride Month. Also in June, PSEG was named to Just Capital's Top 100 companies supporting healthy families and communities. 
Overall, we had a solid quarter and results for the first half of the year have positioned us to update our full year guidance somewhat earlier than has been our practice. We are raising by $0.05 per share at the bottom end of PSEG's non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for full year 2021 to a range of $3.40 to $3.55 per share, based on favorable results of PSE&G and Power through the first 6 months of the year. This update also incorporates an August 1 effective date to implement the transmission rate settlement and the expectation that the fossil assets will contribute to consolidated results through the end of the year. 
We're on track to achieve the Utilities 2021 planned capital spending of $2.7 billion on schedule and on budget. This spend is part of PSEG's consolidated 5-year, $14 billion to $16 billion capital plan, which we still intend to execute without the need to issue new equity while also continuing to offer the opportunity for consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend. 
Before closing, I do want to recognize the contributions of Dave Daly, who will be retiring on January 4, 2022, after 35 years of dedicated service to the company. Kim Hanemann who had been named PSE&G Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, was promoted to succeed Dave as President and COO of PSE&G effective June 30. In support of a seamless transition of leadership at PSE&G, Dave is serving as an executive adviser through the end of the year. 
With her promotion, Kim is the first woman to lead New Jersey's largest [indiscernible] gas utility in our 118-year history. Many of you know Kim is the power behind the transmission buildout over the past 10 years, and I hope all of you will have the opportunity to meet here in the near future. 
Speaking of meeting, New Jersey has among the highest rates of fully vaccinated people in the country, but vaccination rates in the state have recently plateaued. So we're carefully monitoring the impact that highly contagious variants are having on updated health and safety protocols. So whether in person or virtually, we are looking forward to hosting an investor owned -- an investor event in the fall when we expect to share with you the many good things that are happening at PSEG regarding our improved business mix, increased financial flexibility and solid growth opportunities. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Dan for more details on our operating results and we'll rejoin you at the end of this for your questions."

I'll now review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G. PSE&G reported net income of $309 million or $0.61 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared with net income of $283 million or $0.56 per share for the second quarter of 2020. PSE&G's second quarter results reflect revenue growth from ongoing capital investment programs. Growth in transmission added $0.01 per share to second quarter net income, reflecting continued infrastructure investment as well as the timing of transmission O&M in the quarter and true ups from prior year filings. 
Electric margin added $0.02 per share to net income compared to the year earlier quarter. driven by commercial and industrial demand, reflecting higher margins in April and May compared to the COVID-19 restrictions that affected prior year results; and the implementation of the Conservation Incentive Program or CIP mechanism in June. 
Gas margin added $0.01 per share, driven by the Gas System Modernization Program rate rollings. Gas related bad debt expense and O&M expense were both $0.01 per share favorable compared to the year earlier quarter, driven by the timing of COVID-related deferrals since the issuance of the BPU's order in the third quarter of last year. 
An increase in distribution-related depreciation due to higher rate base, lower net income by $0.01 per share. Nonoperating pension expense was $0.02 per share favorable compared to the second quarter of 2020, reflecting the continued recognition of strong asset returns experienced last year. Tax expense was $0.02 unfavorable compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by the timing of adjustments to reflect PSE&G's estimated annual effective tax rate. 
The transmission agreement between PSE&G, the BPU and Rate Counsel that Ralph mentioned earlier has been filed with FERC for approval with an August 1 requested effective date. There's no timetable from what FERC must respond, however, we will begin recording the impact of the settlement on our financials starting with the August 1 requested effective date. The agreement would reset the base ROE for PSE&G's formula rate to 9.9% from 11.18% and which lowers the annual transmission revenue requirement by about $100 million per year on a pretax basis. 
Other key elements of the settlement lower annual depreciation expense by approximately $42 million, which has a corresponding reduction in revenue that results in no net impact on earnings and an improved cost recovery methodology for our administrative and general costs and investments in materials and supplies. The agreement also includes an increase of PSE&G's equity ratio from 54% to 55% of total capitalization. The financial impact of the settlement agreement is expected to lower PSE&G's net income by approximately $50 million to $60 million or $0.10 to $0.12 per share on an annual basis in the first 12 months once implemented. 
Weather for the second quarter was significantly warmer than the second quarter of 2020, with the temperature humidity index that was 34% higher than normal and a significantly higher than normal number of hours at 90 degrees or greater. The New Jersey economy continued to recover in the second quarter, increased by total weather-normalized electric sales by approximately 4% compared to the second quarter of 2020, which was at the height of the COVID-19 economic restrictions. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, weather-normalized electric and gas sales were each higher by approximately 1%, with residential electric and gas usage up by 4% and 2%, respectively. The Conservation Incentive Program, which started June 1 for electric sales, removes the variations of weather, economic activity, efficiency and customer usage from our financial results, resetting margins to a baseline level. This new mechanism supports PSE&G's ability to maximize customer participation in energy efficiency programs without losing margins from lower sales. A similar program covering gas sales will commence October 1 and replace the weather normalization clause. 
PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule. PSE&G invested approximately $700 million in the second quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date through June. This capital was part of 2021's $2.7 billion Electric and Gas Infrastructure Program to upgrade transmission and distribution facilities and enhance reliability and increase resiliency. We continue to forecast over 90% of PSEG's planned capital investment will be directed to the utility over the 2021 to 2025 time frame. 
PSE&G's forecast of net income in 2021 has been updated to $1.42 billion to $1.27 billion from $1.21 billion to $1.47 billion. Now moving on to Power. PSEG Power reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter of $0.10 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $159 million. This compares to non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.24 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $258 million for the second quarter of 2020. 
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense. The earnings release and Slide 23 provide you with a detailed analysis of the items having an impact on PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings relative to net income quarter-over-quarter. We also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and for the first half of 2021 on Slide 24. 
PSEG  Power's second quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were affected by several items that combined lowered results by $0.14 per share below the quarter from a year ago. Recontracting and market impacts reduced results by $0.09 per share, reflecting seasonal shape of hedging activity and higher cost to serve load versus the year ago quarter. Generating volume and zero emission certificates were each down by $0.01 per share, affected by lower nuclear output related to the spring refueling outage at the 100% owned Hope Creek nuclear plant. 
PJM capacity revenue added $0.02 per share to the year ago quarterly comparison. For the year ended June 30 -- for the year-to-date ended June 30, capacity is $0.05 per share favorable compared to the first half of 2020, reflecting the scheduled higher price of approximately $167 per megawatt day for the majority of the first half of 2021 versus the $116 per megawatt day for the same period in 2020. 
Higher O&M expense reduced results by $0.04 per share compared to last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting the planned Hope Creek refueling outage and higher fossil operating expenses. Lower depreciation expense, reflecting the sale of the solar source portfolio and the early retirement of the Bridgeport Harbor coal-fired generating station, combined with lower interest expense, to add $0.02 per share versus the year ago quarter. 
Taxes and other items were $0.03 per share unfavorable, reflecting the absence of a multiyear tax audit settlement included in the second quarter 2020 results. 
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2020 was $28 per megawatt hour compared with $33 per megawatt hour for last year's second quarter. The decline quarter-over-quarter reflects the seasonal price impact of recontracting, that is anticipated to result in a negative $2 per megawatt hour price decline in the hedge portfolio for the full year. We expect recontracting results in the third quarter of 2021 to be similarly negative, as we mentioned last quarter, will more than offset the $0.03 per share benefit seen in the first quarter of [indiscernible]. 
Now let's turn to Power's operations. Total generation output declined by 1% to 12.6 terawatt hours in the second quarter as the refueling outage at Hope Creek and subsequent forced out its lower nuclear output versus the second quarter of 2020. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 86% for the quarter, producing 7.2 terawatt hours, down by 7% versus last year, which represented 57% of total generation. 
Power's combined cycle fleet produced 5.3 terawatt hours of output, up 8% in response to higher market demand helped by warm weather. Power is forecasting generation output of 25 to 27 terawatt hours for the remaining 2 quarters of 2021, and has hedged 95% to 100% of its production at an average price of $30 per megawatt hour. Also during the quarter, we're pleased to remind you that PSEG Power eliminated all coal from its generating mix with the early retirement of Bridgeport Harbor Station 3. 
Power's quarterly impairment assessments, including consideration of its strategic review of the nonnuclear fleet, determined that the ISO New England asset grouping showed an impairment as of June 30, 2021. As a result, Power recorded a pretax charge of $519 million for this asset group. 
PJM and New York ISO asset groupings did not show an impairment as of June 30, 2021. However, a move of these assets to held for sale, which would be effective upon an anticipated sale agreement, would be expected to prompt an additional material impairment to the fossil portfolio. Such a move to held for sale would also prop the cessation of depreciation and amortization expense for the held-for-sale units, resulting in a favorable impact to GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings through the close of the transaction. 
In June of 2021, PSEG completed the sale of PSEG Solar source, which resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $62 million and income tax expense of approximately $63 million, primarily due to the recapture of investment tax credits on units that operated for less than 5 years. For the remainder of the year, depreciation expense will also decline by approximately $0.03 per share as a result of the Solar Source sale. 
Forecast of PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2021 has been updated to $295 million to $370 million, from $280 million to $370 million, while our estimated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $850 million to $950 million. 
Now let me briefly address operating results from Enterprise and Other and provide an update on PSEG Long Island. For the second quarter of 2021, PSEG Enterprise and Other reported a net loss of $3 million or $0.01 per share for the second quarter of 2021, which was flat compared to a net loss of $2 million or $0.01 per share for the second quarter of 2020. The net loss for the second quarter of 2021 reflects higher interest expense at the parent initially offset -- partially offset, I should say, by the ongoing contributions from PSEG Long Island. 
In June, PSEG Long Island entered into a nonbinding term sheet with the Long Island Power Authority, that would resolve all the authorities claims related to tropical storm [indiscernible]. The terms will be adopted into amendments to our operation service agreement, or OSA, and submitted to New York state authorities for approval later this year. The OSA contract term will continue through 2025, with a mutual option to extend. 
For 2021, the forecast for PSEG Enterprise and Other remains unchanged at a net loss of $15 million. PSEG's financial position remains strong. At June 30, we had approximately $4 billion of available liquidity, including cash on hand of about $107 million and debt represented 52% of our consolidated capital. During the first half of 2021, PSEG entered into 2, 364-day variable rate term loan agreements totaling $1.25 billion. 
During the second quarter, PSEG Power retired $950 million of senior notes maturing in June and September 2021 and ended June with debt as a percentage of capital of 20%. In May, Moody's changed PSE&G's credit rating outlook to negative from stable. Their first mortgage bond rating remains aa3. We still expect to fund PSEG's $14 billion to $16 billion capital investment program over the 2021 to 2025 period without the need to issue new equity, while also continuing to offer consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend payment. 
As Ralph mentioned, we've raised the bottom end of our forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year to $3.40 to $3.55 per share, up by $0.05 per share based on the solid results we have seen in the first half of the year that give us confidence that we can deliver results at the upper end of our original guidance. 
That concludes my comments. And Carol, we are now ready to answer questions."

With respect to your question on the different asset groupings, when we think about and when we do our impairment tests, we use those asset groupings. And so there's an asset grouping for New England, one for New York and one for PJM. 
And so I would not look at the timing of the impairment in the second quarter in New England as being different timing for different components. I think what you would look at is the way that the test is done by looking at both the traditional view of an undiscounted set of future cash flows, as well as the potential for a sale that go into that calculation. And basically, that calculation was such that we did as of the end of the second quarter, see an impairment in New England, but did not see one in New York and PJM. 
As I noted in my remarks that continue forward and upon a movement to held for sale, you could see material impairment incremental to what's there. But it does not have to do with timing per se of the sale. And -- what we have said all along was somewhere around midyear, we would be moving to agreement. 
We're still in that ballpark, I believe. But I still think year-end is about you would anticipate the path that we're on. But it does not imply separate sales by virtue of what's happened. It's more just based upon the overall accounting and how that test works vis-a-vis, let's say, the balance on the books."

They were originally do the end of this month, but they were delayed now to sometime in September, probably the end of September.  
We're expecting PJM to review that through the balance of the year and then handing their results over to the BPU for an early decision probably end of first quarter next year, it could slip a little further than that. 
But there's a sizable opportunity in offshore wind. And it's quite real, just given the fact that we now have over 3,700 megawatts of wind farms that are due to become operational depending upon the project anywhere from 2024 to 2028. 
Nuclear is wholly separate from that, and we are greatly encouraged by the amount of attention being given to merchant plants, in particular by President Biden and his administration, by bipartisan members of the House and the Senate. There is a component of the infrastructure build that right now allows for a grant program for nuclear. 
And while that is by no means the preferred path for us, just a matter of fact that Congress is recognizing the challenge of nuclear plants, I think, is important for the nation and could relieve some of the cost pressure on New Jersey customers who are currently bearing the full burden of keeping our 3 units economically viable. But I don't see that connected to offshore wind in any way."

Now a couple of things will happen by part of changing the depreciation rate. The rate base will decline more slowly. So that's an improvement to earnings in the out years. But having said that, however, though, as you grow the rate base from new CapEx, the lower ROE is going to be a drag on earnings.

And we do anticipate being able to give multiyear earnings guidance and revisit our dividend policy at that point in time. 
I think -- right now, we give you 10 months of earnings guidance. So multiyear may start out being 3 to 5 years. I don't think it's going to -- it's certainly not going to be beyond that. It's just so tough to predict, longer term than that, Shar. But really, what we highlighted not that long ago is still in place, we think after the sale, will be close to 90% regulated. 
Now that could drop a little bit as we start adding offshore wind, but that we expect to be fully contracted. And so that was the 80% to 90% range that we had given in prior earnings calls, and that's still in place. We are determined to get a longer-term treatment of our nuclear plants. We've said in a matter of fact that the 3 years that is untenable. And we're delighted that New Jersey gave us that to be able to enter into this more thoughtful discussion either at the federal level or if it has to be at the state level to expand that time frame. 
But the utility growth trajectory has only been enhanced, right? Its growth trajectory has always been supported by the fact that we have an aging infrastructure that can: A, not meet the needs of a customer base that is increasingly dependent on that infrastructure; and B, that infrastructure in addition to its age is confronting more intense weather patterns and storms. 
So -- so the need to replace that aging infrastructure, inclusive of greater emphasis on the last mile as more and more people work from home, is just equally, if not growing in prominence. And then we have the ability to add to that the carbon-free agenda and the green agenda of New Jersey, which allows this whole opportunity of adding to the rate base on the customer side of the meter. 
And as I said in the past, it takes a lot of light bulbs to replace the transmission tower in terms of earnings power, but they're equally important to the customer, both from an energy efficiency point of view and a reliability point of view. 
So I'd say that the utility growth prospects remain intact, if not, are enhanced. But what we continue to see in terms of climate change and a stress inputs on the infrastructure and the desire to battle that and the opportunity it creates on the customer side of the meter."

The other thing that I would -- that I think is probably worth mentioning though, is just the -- if you think about the utility, if you think about on the electric side, that SIP program, which has a leveling effect -- is in effect for electric in June, it's in effect in October for gas. And if you think about going through the summer period, gas usage is low during that period. So that will take some volatility out of the balance of the year from those perspectives.

I do think your question points in a direction that I would agree with, that it is probably easier to optimize the whole by putting in all 4 components and a specialist that just wants to do 1 component may or may not fit as naturally into the other components. But they could have just such a low-cost solution on land or out in the ocean that, that PJM figures out a way to ensure the technical requirements of the project are achieved and then leaves it to the [indiscernible] whether or not they want to have bifurcated ownership of what will become an offshore wind grid."

PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the second quarter of 2021 versus $0.79 per share in last year's second quarter. GAAP results for the second quarte",2110,"Thank you, Carlotta, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the second quarter of 2021 versus $0.79 per share in last year's second quarter. GAAP results for the second quarter were $0.35 per share net loss related to transition charges at PSEG Power, and that compares with $0.89 per share of net income for the second quarter of 2020. 
Also in the quarter, PSEG Power recorded a pretax impairment of $519 million at its New England Asset Group, partly offset by a pretax gain of $62 million from the sale of the Solar Source portfolio. We continue to make great progress on a number of fronts to position ourselves for the future. We had a strong operating quarter that, once again, produced non-GAAP operating earnings in line with our expectations for the year. 
Our results for the second quarter bring non-GAAP operating earnings for the first half of 2021 to $1.98 per share. This 9% increase over non-GAAP results of $1.82 per share for the first half of 2020 reflects the growing contribution from our regulated operations and continued derisking at PSEG Power. Slides 13 and 15 summarize the results for the quarter and the first half of the year. 
It's been a year since we announced our intentions to explore strategic alternatives for our nonnuclear generation assets, and I'm pleased with the progress to date in what I believe is a compelling platform for future regulated growth at PSE&G. Our utility, a clean energy infrastructure-focused business, will be complemented by a significantly contracted, carbon-free generating portfolio, consisting of our nuclear fleet and investments and opportunities in regional Offshore Wind.
The marketing of the fossil assets has garnered a significant level of interest from numerous qualified buyers in a competitive process, which is advancing as expected. And we expect to provide you with more information on this process in the very near future. 
I'm pleased that we've reached a balanced agreement with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and the Division of Rate Counsel on PSE&G's transmission rate, which, if approved by FERC, will resolve a significant regulatory uncertainty for us and provide a timely rate reduction for customers. PSE&G has agreed to voluntarily reduce its annual transmission revenue requirement, which includes a reduction in its base return on equity to 9.9% from 11.18%. If approved by the FERC, a typical electric residential customer will save 3% on their monthly bills.
New Jersey continues to experience positive economic activity since Governor Murphy lifted the Public Health Emergency Order in June. Our largest customer class in terms of sales, the commercial segment, has shown a rebound in electricity demand. Electric sales overall adjusted for weather were up nearly 4% over the second quarter of 2020, led by an 11% increase in commercial sales, which was partly offset by a 5% decline in residential sales as people gradually returned to work outside the home. 
The warmer-than-normal summer has also increased PSE&G's average daily peak load for the quarter to 5,480 megawatts compared to last year's second quarter average of 5,100 megawatts and the 5,330 megawatts experienced in the pre-COVID second quarter of 2019. And so far this summer, PSE&G's load has peaked at 10,064 megawatts on June 30, exceeding the 10,000-megawatt mark for the first time since July 19 of the year 2013, 8 years ago.
Turning to clean energy developments in New Jersey, the BPU in June awarded a second round of Offshore Wind projects totaling 2,658 megawatts and is now halfway towards the state's goal of procuring 7,500 megawatts of Offshore Wind generation by 2035. The award was split between the 1,510 megawatt Atlantic Shores project and Ørsted's 1,148 megawatt Ocean Wind 2. The OREC price is set in the second round range from about $86 to $84 for the Atlantic Shores and Ocean Wind projects, respectively. 
And last week, the BPU approved a new solar successor incentive framework that consists of 2 programs: an administratively determined incentive; and a competitive solicitation incentive, which would apply to larger projects defined as 5 megawatts and above. Incentive levels for the administratively determined segment range from $90 per megawatt hour for net metered residential projects to $70 to $100 per megawatt hour for the commercial and community solar segments and up to $120 per megawatt hour for certain public entity projects. 
You will recall that the prior program consisting of solar renewable energy credits or as we frequently refer to them as SRECs, average well above $200 per megawatt hour over the past decade. And combined with net metering subsidies and federal tax credits provided later incentives topping $300 per megawatt hour. So this successor program is a positive step towards balancing the need for clean energy while recognizing the importance of affordability for our customers. 
PSEG's existing solar programs are essentially fully subscribed. We'll continue to work with the state MBP on programs that can help meet the solar goals in the Energy Master Plan. PSEG continues to make tangible progress on our own decarbonization and ESG goals. In the second quarter alone, we closed on our 25% equity stake in the 1,100-megawatt Ocean Wind project in New Jersey, that's the Ocean Wind 1 project, obviously. We retired our last coal unit at Bridgeport Harbor in Connecticut, making our generating fleet coal-free and moved up our net-zero vision by 20 years to 2030. 
But not only do we accelerate the net-zero vision, we also expanded it to include Scope 1 direct greenhouse gas emissions, and Scope 2 indirect greenhouse gas emissions from operations at both PSEG Power and PSE&G. Expanding the net-zero vision to include both the utility and power operations is a significant move forward in our decarbonization efforts, and one that will both inspire and challenge us to do more and do it better. 
Coming up, PSEG is preparing to bid into a competitive process to build Offshore Wind transmission infrastructure. This solicitation is intended to procure transmission solutions to this important New Jersey 7,500-megawatt Offshore Wind target by 2035. The potential projects can cover onshore upgrades, new onshore transmission connection facilities, new offshore transmission connection facilities and a network to offshore transmission system. Proposals may address any or all of these 4 components. 
The decision-making criteria is expected to include, among other things: an evaluation of reliability and economic benefits; cost; constructability; environmental benefits; permitting risks; and other ""New Jersey benefits"". This competitive transmission open window will be jointly conducted by PJM and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. PJM will lead the technical analysis of the proposed transmission solutions, and the BP will be the ultimate decision-maker. We support the state's efforts to procure transmission in a manner that is most reliable, constructable and cost effective for our customers.
All of this is great progress on our decarbonization efforts and continues to demonstrate our alignment with the state's Clean Energy agenda and our industry leadership on environmental stewardship.
New Jersey's recent endorsement of the environmental benefits provided by our New Jersey nuclear plants through the second zero-emission certificates, I'll refer to that as ZEC for the rest of this conversation, extends the $10 per megawatt hour carbon-free attribute recognition through May of 2025. This extension will allow us, along with stakeholders in New Jersey and at the federal level, the time we need to work on a long-term economic solution to keep our merchant nuclear fleet economically viable and preserve its currently unmatched contribution of reliable, carbon-free baseload generation, the most cost-effective clean generation source available. 
During the ZEC deliberations, a growing recognition of these nuclear units were economically at risk, but vitally important to New Jersey's ability to reach its clean energy and carbon goals gain further traction. The importance of the New Jersey nuclear units to the state's climate goals was also recognized in the BPU Staff's recent resource adequacy report. The report recommends that New Jersey should continue exploring a region-wide or New Jersey-only integrated clean capacity market, with the fixed resource requirement, often, we refer to that as an FRR. 
We expect that the BPU will be closely watching to see whether FERC accepts PJM's just filed modifications to the minimum offer price rule which appears to better align the PJM capacity market with New Jersey's clean energy goals. The results of the first PJM capacity auction in 3 years, influenced by a COVID-19 pandemic stifled demand curve, served as further evidence of the market risks faced by our nuclear units. 
This sentiment is shared by Biden administration officials, including DOE Secretary Granholm and White House Domestic Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, who have both spoken publicly on the importance of nuclear energy as a clean energy resource. 
We continue to work on promoting a federal nuclear production tax credit proposal where the value of the credit declines as market revenue increases. This is the primary federal policy that would help prevent premature closing of merchant plants whose market revenues are not currently covering cost and risk. 
Other options, such as the federal nuclear grant program administered by the Department of Energy are also being discussed. However, we and others in the industry share the view that a competitive grant program will not provide timely relief nor the certainty these plants need to remain operational. 
Nonetheless, we're encouraged by the attention that at-risk nuclear plants are getting in Washington. And we especially appreciate the efforts of New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell, who's leading this effort in the House of Representatives, and Senators Cardin, Manchin and Booker in the Senate. That said, we do expect the federal infrastructure effort to take the better part of the rest of the year to unfold.
On the social side of ESG during the second quarter, we recognized the Juneteenth holiday by giving employees paid time off to commemorate and celebrate this important day in our nation's history and supported our LBGTQ+ community with numerous events for Pride Month. Also in June, PSEG was named to JUST Capital's Top 100 companies supporting healthy families and communities. 
Overall, we had a solid quarter and results for the first half of the year have positioned us to update our full year guidance somewhat earlier than has been our practice. We are raising by $0.05 per share at the bottom end of PSEG's non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for full year 2021 to a range of $3.40 to $3.55 per share, based on favorable results of PSE&G and Power through the first 6 months of the year. This update also incorporates an August 1 effective date to implement the transmission rate settlement and the expectation that the fossil assets will contribute to consolidated results through the end of the year.
We're on track to achieve the Utilities 2021 planned capital spending of $2.7 billion on schedule and on budget. This spend is part of PSEG's consolidated 5-year, $14 billion to $16 billion capital plan, which we still intend to execute without the need to issue new equity, while also continuing to offer the opportunity for consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend. 
Before closing, I do want to recognize the contributions of Dave Daly, who will be retiring on January 4, 2022, after 35 years of dedicated service to the company. Kim Hanemann, who had been named PSE&G's Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, was promoted to succeed Dave as President and COO of PSE&G effective June 30. In support of a seamless transition of leadership at PSE&G, Dave is serving as an executive adviser through the end of the year. 
With her promotion, Kim is the first woman to lead New Jersey's largest electric and gas utility in our 118-year history. Many of you know Kim is the power behind the transmission buildout over the past 10 years, and I hope all of you will have the opportunity to meet here in the near future. 
Speaking of meeting, New Jersey has among the highest rates of fully vaccinated people in the country, but vaccination rates in the state have recently plateaued. So we're carefully monitoring the impact that highly contagious variants are having on updated health and safety protocols. So whether in person or virtually, we are looking forward to hosting an investor owned -- an investor event in the fall when we expect to share with you the many good things that are happening at PSEG regarding our improved business mix, increased financial flexibility and solid growth opportunities.
So now I'll turn the call over to Dan for more details on our operating results and we'll rejoin you at the end of this for your questions."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter of 2021 at $0.70 per share versus $0.79 per share in last year's second quarter. We've provided you with an information on Slides 13 and 15 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings by business for the quarter and the year-to-date periods, and Slides 14 and 16 contain corresponding waterfall charts that take you through the net changes in non-GAAP operating earnings by major business. 
I'll now review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G. PSE&G reported net income of $309 million or $0.61 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared with net income of $283 million or $0.56 per share for the second quarter of 2020. PSE&G's second quarter results reflect revenue growth from ongoing capital investment programs. Growth in transmission added $0.01 per share to second quarter net income, reflecting continued infrastructure investment as well as the timing of transmission O&M in the quarter and true ups from prior year filings.
Electric margin added $0.02 per share to net income compared to the year earlier quarter. driven by commercial and industrial demand, reflecting higher margins in April and May compared to the COVID-19 restrictions that affected prior year results; and the implementation of the Conservation Incentive Program or CIP mechanism in June. 
Gas margin added $0.01 per share, driven by the Gas System Modernization Program rate rollings. Gas related bad debt expense and O&M expense were both $0.01 per share favorable compared to the year earlier quarter, driven by the timing of COVID-related deferrals since the issuance of the BPU's order in the third quarter of last year. 
An increase in distribution-related depreciation due to higher rate base lowered net income by $0.01 per share. Nonoperating pension expense was $0.02 per share favorable compared to the second quarter of 2020, reflecting the continued recognition of strong asset returns experienced last year. Tax expense was $0.02 unfavorable compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by the timing of adjustments to reflect PSE&G's estimated annual effective tax rate. 
The transmission agreement between PSE&G, the BPU and Rate Counsel that Ralph mentioned earlier has been filed with FERC for approval with an August 1 requested effective date. There's no timetable from when FERC must respond, however, we will begin recording the impacts of the settlement on our financials starting with the August 1 requested effective date. The agreement would reset the base ROE for PSE&G's formula rate to 9.9% from 11.18%, which lowers the annual transmission revenue requirement by about $100 million per year on a pretax basis.
Other key elements of the settlement lower annual depreciation expense by approximately $42 million, which has a corresponding reduction in revenue that results in no net impact on earnings and an improved cost recovery methodology for our administrative and general costs and investments in materials and supplies. 
The agreement also includes an increase of PSE&G's equity ratio from 54% to 55% of total capitalization. The financial impact of the settlement agreement is expected to lower PSE&G's net income by approximately $50 million to $60 million or $0.10 to $0.12 per share on an annual basis in the first 12 months once implemented.
Weather for the second quarter was significantly warmer than the second quarter of 2020, with the temperature humidity index that was 34% higher than normal and a significantly higher than normal number of hours at 90 degrees or greater. The New Jersey economy continued to recover in the second quarter, increased by total weather-normalized electric sales by approximately 4% compared to the second quarter of 2020, which was at the height of the COVID-19 economic restrictions.
On a trailing 12-month basis, weather-normalized electric and gas sales were each higher by approximately 1%, with residential electric and gas usage up by 4% and 2%, respectively. The Conservation Incentive Program, which started June 1 for electric sales, removes the variations of weather, economic activity, efficiency and customer usage from our financial results, resetting margins to a baseline level. This new mechanism supports PSE&G's ability to maximize customer participation in energy efficiency programs without losing margins from lower sales. A similar program covering gas sales will commence October 1 and replace the weather normalization clause. 
PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule. PSE&G invested approximately $700 million in the second quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date through June. This capital was part of 2021's $2.7 billion Electric and Gas Infrastructure Program to upgrade transmission and distribution facilities and enhance reliability and increase resiliency. We continue to forecast over 90% of PSEG's planned capital investment will be directed to the utility over the 2021 to 2025 time frame. PSE&G's forecast of net income in 2021 has been updated to $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion from $1.41 billion to $1.47 billion. 
Now moving on to Power. PSEG Power reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter of $0.10 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $159 million. This compares to non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.24 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $258 million for the second quarter of 2020.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense. The earnings release and Slide 23 provide you with a detailed analysis of the items having an impact on PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings relative to net income quarter-over-quarter. We also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and for the first half of 2021 on Slide 24. 
PSEG  Power's second quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were affected by several items that combined lowered results by $0.14 per share below the quarter from a year ago. Recontracting and market impacts reduced results by $0.09 per share, reflecting seasonal shape of hedging activity and higher cost to serve load versus the year ago quarter. Generating volume and zero emission certificates were each down by $0.01 per share, affected by lower nuclear output related to the spring refueling outage at the 100% owned Hope Creek Nuclear Plant. 
PJM capacity revenue added $0.02 per share to the year ago quarterly comparison. For the year ended June 30 -- for the year-to-date ended June 30, capacity is $0.05 per share favorable compared to the first half of 2020, reflecting the scheduled higher price of approximately $167 per megawatt day for the majority of the first half of 2021 versus the $116 per megawatt day for the same period in 2020.
Higher O&M expense reduced results by $0.04 per share compared to last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting the planned Hope Creek refueling outage and higher fossil operating expenses. Lower depreciation expense, reflecting the sale of the solar source portfolio and the early retirement of the Bridgeport Harbor coal-fired generating station, combined with lower interest expense, to add $0.02 per share versus the year ago quarter. 
Taxes and other items were $0.03 per share unfavorable, reflecting the absence of a multiyear tax audit settlement included in the second quarter 2020 results. 
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2020 was $28 per megawatt hour compared with $33 per megawatt hour for last year's second quarter. The decline quarter-over-quarter reflects the seasonal price impact of recontracting, that is anticipated to result in a negative $2 per megawatt hour price decline in the hedge portfolio for the full year. We expect recontracting results in the third quarter of 2021 to be similarly negative, as we mentioned last quarter, will more than offset the $0.03 per share benefit seen in the first quarter of this year.
Now let's turn to Power's operations. Total generation output declined by 1% to 12.6 terawatt hours in the second quarter as the refueling outage at Hope Creek and subsequent forced out its lower nuclear output versus the second quarter of 2020. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 86% for the quarter, producing 7.2 terawatt hours, down by 7% versus last year, which represented 57% of total generation. 
Power's combined cycle fleet produced 5.3 terawatt hours of output, up 8% in response to higher market demand helped by warm weather. Power is forecasting generation output of 25 to 27 terawatt hours for the remaining 2 quarters of 2021, and has hedged 95% to 100% of its production at an average price of $30 per megawatt hour. Also during the quarter, we're pleased to remind you that PSEG Power eliminated all coal from its generating mix with the early retirement of Bridgeport Harbor Station 3. 
Power's quarterly impairment assessments, including consideration of its strategic review of the nonnuclear fleet, determined that the ISO New England asset grouping showed an impairment as of June 30, 2021. As a result, Power recorded a pretax charge of $519 million for this asset group. 
PJM and New York ISO asset groupings did not show an impairment as of June 30, 2021. However, a move of these assets to held for sale, which would be effective upon an anticipated sale agreement, would be expected to prompt an additional material impairment to the fossil portfolio. Such a move to held for sale would also prop the cessation of depreciation and amortization expense for the held-for-sale units, resulting in a favorable impact to GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings through the close of the transaction. 
In June of 2021, PSEG completed the sale of PSEG's Solar Source, which resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $62 million and income tax expense of approximately $63 million, primarily due to the recapture of investment tax credits on units that operated for less than 5 years. For the remainder of the year, depreciation expense will also decline by approximately $0.03 per share as a result of the Solar Source sale. 
Forecast of PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2021 has been updated to $295 million to $370 million, from $280 million to $370 million, while our estimated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $850 million to $950 million. 
Now let me briefly address operating results from Enterprise and Other and provide an update on PSEG Long Island. For the second quarter of 2021, PSEG Enterprise and Other reported a net loss of $3 million or $0.01 per share for the second quarter of 2021, which was flat compared to a net loss of $2 million or $0.01 per share for the second quarter of 2020. The net loss for the second quarter of 2021 reflects higher interest expense at the parent initially offset -- partially offset, I should say, by the ongoing contributions from PSEG Long Island.
In June, PSEG Long Island entered into a nonbinding term sheet with the Long Island Power Authority, that would resolve all the authorities claims related to Tropical Storm Isaias. The terms will be adopted into amendments to our operation service agreement, or OSA, and submitted to New York state authorities for approval later this year. The OSA contract term will continue through 2025, with a mutual option to extend. For 2021, the forecast for PSEG Enterprise and Other remains unchanged at a net loss of $15 million.
PSEG's financial position remains strong. At June 30, we had approximately $4 billion of available liquidity, including cash on hand of about $107 million and debt represented 52% of our consolidated capital. During the first half of 2021, PSEG entered into 2, 364-day variable rate term loan agreements totaling $1.25 billion.
During the second quarter, PSEG Power retired $950 million of senior notes maturing in June and September 2021 and ended June with debt as a percentage of capital of 20%. In May, Moody's changed PSE&G's credit rating outlook to negative from stable. Their first mortgage bond rating remains Aa3. We still expect to fund PSEG's $14 billion to $16 billion capital investment program over the 2021 to 2025 period without the need to issue new equity, while also continuing to offer consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend payment. 
As Ralph mentioned, we've raised the bottom end of our forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year to $3.40 to $3.55 per share, up by $0.05 per share based on the solid results we have seen in the first half of the year that give us confidence that we can deliver results at the upper end of our original guidance. 
That concludes my comments. And Carol, we are now ready to answer questions."

With respect to your question on the different asset groupings, when we think about and when we do our impairment tests, we use those asset groupings.

With respect to your question on the different asset groupings, when we think about and when we do our impairment tests, we use those asset groupings. And so there's an asset grouping for New England, one for New York and one for PJM. 
And so I would not look at the timing of the impairment in the second quarter in New England as being different timing for different components. I think what you would look at is the way that the test is done by looking at both the traditional view of an undiscounted set of future cash flows, as well as the potential for a sale that go into that calculation. And basically, that calculation was such that we did as of the end of the second quarter, see an impairment in New England, but did not see one in New York and PJM. 
As I noted in my remarks that as we continue forward and upon a movement to held for sale, you could see a material impairment incremental to what's there. But it does not have to do with timing per se of the sale. And -- what we have said all along was somewhere around midyear, we would be moving to agreement. 
We're still in that ballpark, I believe. But I still think year-end is about what you would anticipate the path that we're on. But it does not imply separate sales by virtue of what's happened. It's more just based upon the overall accounting and how that test works vis-a-vis, let's say, the balance on the books."

Now it's sometime in September, probably the end of September.  
We're expecting PJM to review that through the balance of the year and then handing their results over to the BPU for an early decision probably end of first quarter next year, it could slip a little further than that. But there's a sizable opportunity in Offshore Wind. And it's quite real, just given the fact that we now have over 3,700 megawatts of wind farms that are due to become operational depending upon the project anywhere from 2024 to 2028.
Nuclear is wholly separate from that, and we are greatly encouraged by the amount of attention being given to merchant plants, in particular by President Biden and his administration, by bipartisan members of the House and the Senate. There is a component of the infrastructure build that right now allows for a grant program for nuclear.
And while that is by no means the preferred path for us, just a mere fact that Congress is recognizing the challenge of nuclear plants, I think, is important for the nation and could relieve some of the cost pressure on New Jersey customers who are currently bearing the full burden of keeping our 3 units economically viable. But I don't see that connected to Offshore Wind in any way."

Some of the benefits realized from an earnings point of view of reducing the depreciation rate, but it also includes the most obvious drag of lowering the allowed ROE. 
Now a couple of things will happen by parts of changing the depreciation rate. The rate base will decline more slowly. So that's an improvement to earnings in the out years. But having said that, however, though, as you grow the rate base from new CapEx, the lower ROE is going to be a drag on earnings. 
So we won't break it out in the future, Shar, because there's no sense talking about what is no longer our ROE, but it will all be factored into any earnings guidance we give for 2022 and beyond."

So we're hoping to get together late in September. That's still our current thinking. And we do anticipate being able to give multiyear earnings guidance and revisit our dividend policy at that point in time. 
I think -- right now, we give you 10 months of earnings guidance. So multiyear may start out being 3 to 5 years. I don't think it's going to -- it's certainly not going to be beyond that. It's just so tough to predict, longer term than that, Shar. But really, what we highlighted not that long ago is still in place, we think after the sale, we'll be close to 90% regulated. 
Now that could drop a little bit as we start adding Offshore Wind, but that we expect to be fully contracted. And so that was the 80% to 90% range that we had given in prior earnings calls, and that's still in place. We are determined to get a longer-term treatment of our nuclear plants. We've said in a matter of fact that the 3 years that is untenable. And we're delighted that New Jersey gave us that to be able to enter into this more thoughtful discussion either at the federal level or if it has to be at the state level to expand that time frame. 
But the utility growth trajectory has only been enhanced, right? Its growth trajectory has always been supported by the fact that we have an aging infrastructure that can: A, not meet the needs of a customer base that is increasingly dependent on that infrastructure; and B, that infrastructure in addition to its age is confronting more intense weather patterns and storms. 
So the need to replace that aging infrastructure, inclusive of greater emphasis on the last mile as more and more people work from home, is just equally, if not growing in prominence. And then we have the ability to add to that the carbon-free agenda and the green agenda of New Jersey, which allows this whole opportunity of adding to the rate base on the customer side of the meter. 
And as I said in the past, it takes a lot of light bulbs to replace the transmission tower in terms of earnings power, but they're equally important to the customer, both from an energy efficiency point of view and a reliability point of view.
So I'd say that the utility growth prospects remain intact, if not, are enhanced. But what we continue to see in terms of climate change and the stress it puts on the infrastructure and the desire to battle that and the opportunity it creates on the customer side of the meter."

The other thing that I would -- that I think is probably worth mentioning though, is just the -- if you think about the utility, if you think about on the electric side, that SIP program, which has a leveling effect -- is in effect for electric in June, it's in effect in October for gas. And if you think about going through the summer period, gas usage is low during that period. So that will take some volatility out of the balance of the year from those perspectives.

So when we say it's not regularly what we mean is it's not going to be part of the transmission, it's not going to part of PSE&G, but all transmission is FERC regulated.

But in terms of Ocean Wind 2, it is obviously safe to conclude that we will have some conversations with Ørsted about that as well as some other opportunities in the region."

As you have seen, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.98 per share for the third quarter of 2021 versus $0.96 per share in the year ago quarter. GAAP results for the third quarter were at $3.10 per share net loss related to transition charges at PSEG Power, and they compare with a $1.14 per share of net income for the third quarter of 2020. 
In this year's quarter, PSEG Power recorded a pretax impairment loss of approximately $2.17 billion to reflect the announced sale of its fossil generating fleet that includes $13 million of other related costs. Results for the third quarter bring non-GAAP operating earnings for the first 9 months of 2021 to $2.96 per share.
The 6.5% increase over non-GAAP results of $2.78 per share for the first 9 months of 2020 reflects the growing contribution from our regulated operations and continued derisking at PSEG Power. 
Slides 12 and 14 summarize the results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2021. The third quarter of 2021 was one of the most significant in recent PSEG history. Since July, we've announced the sale of Power fossil fleet and reached the transmission rate settlement that will help lower customer build. 
In addition, at our recent investor conference, we announced an increase in our 5-year capital spending plan by $1 billion, a $0.12 per share increase to the common stock dividend for 2022, a $500 million share repurchase program expected to be implemented upon the close of the fossil sale and initiated a 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth projection over the 2022 to 2025 period. 
On the ESG front, we advanced our decarbonization efforts with the elimination of coal in our fuel mix this past June. Our participation in the New Jersey Wind port and ongoing consideration of regional offshore wind opportunities in generation and transmission, demonstrates our alignment clean energy agenda. And our Clean Energy Future program was recently named a star of energy efficiency recipient in [indiscernible]. 
Of critical importance, we have staked out a leadership position in the industry by accelerating our net 0 vision to 2030 and joining the UN-backed Race to Zero campaign that will put us on a test to establish science-based targets to all of our missions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Later this week, I will be attending the conference of parties referred to as COP 26 to engage with policymakers and further support emissions reduction goals. 
This includes advocating for climate action now and advancing the case for preserving existing nuclear generation. This month, we issued a combined sustainability and climate report that outlines our progress to date and commitments for the future. We intend to continue taking meaningful climate action in response to the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather in our service area. 
Speaking of extreme weather, tropical storm [indiscernible] soaks parts of New Jersey was nearly 9 inches of rain within a 24-hour period and caused extensive flooding throughout the state. Our past and current Energy Strong investments that hardened flood-pro energy infrastructure brought tremendous benefit to customers during IDA, minimizing the damage to adaptive substations and switching stations and keeping them operational. 
That said, the extreme weather did read Havoc throughout our service area and our thoughts go out to the families who lost loved ones to the storm and to the community still recovering from flood damaged homes and businesses. To continue these enhancements and bring them closer to the customer, we are expanding our reliability improvement programs to the last mile of work we will propose in our upcoming infrastructure advancement program, which we plan to file with the BPU in a few days. 
This proposal, if approved, would direct approximately $848 million of investment over a 4-year period to improve the reliability of our electric distribution system, addressing aging substations and gas metering and regulating stations and electric vehicle charging infrastructure at PSE&G facilities that will support the planned electrification of the utility fleet, all of this while serving the dual purpose of creating important high-quality jobs and helping to further stimulate the New Jersey economy. 
The foundation of results for the quarter was the solid operating performances by both PSE&G and PSEG Power. This summer, the third hottest on record contributed to the hottest first 9 months we've ever recorded, pushing a number of total hours with temperatures exceeding 90 degrees or greater, nearly 65% higher than the same period in 2020 and versus normal, thereby increasing peak demand. 
The conservation incentive program effective since June 1 for electric and October 1 for natural gas provides recovery for variations in customer usage due to weather, economic conditions and energy efficiency, thereby enabling the utility to promote maximum customer participation in energy efficiency programs without the loss of margin from lower sales. 
This also has a stabilizing effect on our margins more broadly. The continued reopening of the New Jersey economy is unwinding some of the shift in sales experienced during most of 2020. Residential electric sales declined adjusted for weather as more people return to work, school and other activities outside the home, partly offset by higher commercial and industrial sales. 
Due to the warmer-than-normal summer weather and the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the daily peak load for the quarter topped out at 9,620 megawatts compared to last year's third quarter daily peak, which was slightly less at 9,557megawatts. Our peak load for the year remains the 10,064 megawatts we hit on June 30, which exceeded the 10,000 megawatt mark for the first time since 2013. 
Moving to the Zero Carbon and infrastructure side of PSEG. We recently announced that we have submitted several joint proposals to New Jersey's competitive state agreement approach, open window to build offshore wind transmission infrastructure. These joint proposals submitted with Orsted are collectively named the coastal wind link and leverage the experienced partnership of PSEG and Orsted in New Jersey energy infrastructure, our commitment to diverse suppliers and our mature working relationships with local building and construction trades.
The proposals cover onshore upgrades, new onshore transmission connection facilities, new offshore transmission connection facilities and a networked offshore transmission system in any stand-alone configuration or combination. PJM is providing the technical analysis and recommendations to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, who will make the final decisions based on an evaluation of reliability and economic benefits, cost, constructability, environmental benefits, permitting risks and other myriad New Jersey benefits. A BPU decision is not expected before the third or fourth quarter of 2022. 
FERC has granted PJM's request to delay the next capacity auction covering the 2023, 2024 energy year to late January 2022. This revised time line places the 2024, 2025 auction into August of 2022 and the '25-'26 auction into February of 2023. These upcoming capacity auctions will provide additional surety to the gross margin of our nuclear fleet in the outer years of our 2021 to 2025 planning horizon. 
Nuclear Power's economic struggles are a national challenge that call for a broad federal solution so that individual states like New Jersey aren't shouldering more than their share of the loan. We are continuing efforts to secure support for existing at-risk nuclear plants in the federal tax code, the House version of the build back better infrastructure legislation currently contains an 8-year production tax credit for existing nuclear at $15 per megawatt hour, with the value of the credit declining as market revenues increase. 
The proposal has support in the Senate and from the Biden administration. While passage is not assured , this would be an impactful provision for the nation's nuclear fleet, and we are hopeful that commerce can enact this fall. You may recall that the New Jersey's ZEC law contained considerable customer protections and specifically requires that state 0 emission certificate payments that I just referred to a moment ago as ZEC payments, be offset by any out-of-market payment compensating nuclear for the same 0 carbon attribute. 
Specific to the nuclear production tax credit, the value of the PTC for our New Jersey units would reduce the ZEC payment up to the maximum $10 per megawatt hour. However, the ZEC would not reduce the value of the PTC and our share of the 2 Pennsylvania peach bottom units would benefit from the full production tax credit. 
Moving forward, there needs to be broad recognition at both the state and federal level of the value of nuclear 0 carbon attributes both for the quality of air today and the climate tomorrow. To avoid backsliding for decades to come, we need to ensure that the long-term viability of New Jersey's nuclear generation is preserved as we bring more clean energy resources into the mix. 
Turning my attention to guidance. We are raising our forecast for full year 2021 non-GAAP operating earnings to a range of $3.55 per share to $3.70 per share from the prior range of $3.50 to [ $3 ] [indiscernible] per share. And this is based on results in the first 9 months of the year. Results for the third quarter and the first 9 months incorporate the planned August 1 implementation of PSE&G's transmission rate settlement.
The forecasted results also reflect PSEG Power cessation of depreciation expense on the fossil assets based upon the move to held to sale accounting treatment in August while otherwise continuing to contribute to consolidated results. We are also reaffirming PSEG's 2022 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.60 per share. We remain on track to execute on PSE&G's 2021 planned capital spend of $2.7 billion. 
This spend is part of PSEG's consolidated 5-year $15 billion to $17 billion capital plan, which we still intend to execute without the need to issue new equity offer the opportunity for consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend. Following the close of the peak of the fossil sale, PSEG will be a 90% regulated and predominantly contracted platform of stable carbon-friendly businesses. 
As we continue to execute on this strategy as well as on the significant financial announcements made in our recent investor conference, we remain fully dedicated to providing our shareholders with the premier opportunity in earnings and dividends with an industry-leading ESG. I'll turn the call over to Dan for more details on our results, and we'll make sure -- make myself available for your questions after [indiscernible] remarks."
298482,1684778191,2421438,"Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Great. Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everybody. As Ralph said, PCG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of $0.98 per share versus $0.96 per share in last year's third quarter. We provided you with information on Slides 12 and 1",1784,"Great. Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everybody. As Ralph said, PCG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of $0.98 per share versus $0.96 per share in last year's third quarter. We provided you with information on Slides 12 and 14 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings by business for the quarter and the year-to-date period, and Slides 13 and 15 containing corresponding waterfall charts that take you through the net changes in non-GAAP operating margin. So now I'll review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G. 
PSE&G reported net income of $389 million or $0.77 per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared with net income of $313 million or $0.61 per share for the third quarter of 2020. PSE&G's third quarter results rose by $0.16 per share over third quarter 2020 and reflect revenue growth from ongoing capital investments as well as growth in transmission rate base added $0.01 per share to third quarter net income operating the August 1 implementation of PSE&G's transmission rate settlement, which FERC proved on equity and our formula rate can 9.9%. 
Electric margin added $0.02 per share to net income compared to the year ago quarter as the conservation incentive program, combined with [Audio Gap] more than offset a reduction in weather-normalized volumes. Gas results were $0.04 favorable compare compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting the absence of the gas weather normalization clause reversal in the third quarter of 2020. O&M expense was $0.01 per share favorable compared to the year ago quarter and nonoperating pension expense was $0.02 per share favorable compared to the third quarter of 2020. 
Lastly, tax expense was $0.06 favorable compared to the third quarter of 2020, driven by the timing of taxes to reflect PSE&G's lower estimated annual effective tax rate due to higher tax flowbacks in 2021. This impact is expected to reverse next quarter when PSE&G finalize its actual tax rate for the year. 
Moving to sales for the quarter. The weather for the third quarter of 2021 was 4% warmer than the year ago period and 22% warmer than normal, with significantly higher than normal number of hours at 90 degrees or greater. On a trailing 12-month basis, weather normalized electric sales were flat and gas sales were up nearly 2%. 
Growth in the number of both electric and gas customers rose by approximately 1.5% each versus the third quarter of 2020. Ralph mentioned earlier, the stabilizing impact of the conservation incentive program, now fully in effect for both electric and gas margins, resetting those margins to a baseline level. 
Going forward, about 95% of our electric distribution, 90% of gas distribution will be stabilized via this mechanism, which will still pass through the variation in the actual number of customers. PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule. PSE&G invested approximately $670 million in the third quarter aggregating to $1.95 billion year-to-date through September. 
This capital is part of 2021's $2.7 billion electric and gas capital program to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure, enhance reliability and increase resiliency. We continue to forecast that over 90% of PSEG's planned capital investment will be directed to the utility over the 2021 to 2025 time frame. We have raised P&G's forecast of net income for 2021 to $1.430 billion to $1.480 billion from $1.420 billion to $1.470 billion. Now moving to Power. Power reported a net loss of $1.933 billion or $3.84 per share for the third quarter of 2021, non-GAAP operating earnings of $119 million or $0.23 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $237 million. 
This compares to the third quarter 2020 net income of $254 million or $0.51 per share, non-GAAP operating earnings of $167 million or $0.33 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $349 million. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items from non-GAAP operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense and the benefit of net operating loss purchases, which are included in net income.
The earnings release on Slide 23 provide you with a detailed analysis of the items having an impact on PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings relative to net income year-over-quarter. We've also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and for the year-to-date 2021 on Slide 24. Power's third quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.10 per share lower than third quarter 2020 results. The recontracting and tire market impacts reduced results by $0.11 per share as the seasonal shape of hedging activity and higher cost to serve load versus the year ago quarter lower gross margin. 
The sale of the solar source portfolio earlier in the year also lowered gross margin results by $0.02 compared to the year ago quarter. The retirement of Bridgeport over 3 on May 31 and Power's last call unit lowered New England capacity revenues by $0.01 per share versus the third quarter of 2020. 
And gas operations were lower by $0.02 per share, reflecting the absence of a pipeline recon received in last year's third quarter. O&M expense lowered results by $0.01 per share compared to the year ago quarter as higher nuclear costs were partly offset by lower solar expenses and lower depreciation expense associated with fossil assets moving to held-for-sale accounting status and the sale of the solar source portfolio and the early retirement of Bridgeport Harbor, combined with lower interest expense to add $0.08 per share versus the year ago quarter. 
Lastly, taxes and other items were paying per share unfavorable compared to the third quarter of 2020. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2021 was $28 a megawatt hour compared to $33 a megawatt hour for the last year's third quarter. This decline reflects the seasonal price impact of recontracting, including the third quarter's anticipated higher portion of the $2 per megawatt hour annualized price decline in the hedged portfolio.
We expect recontracting results in the fourth quarter of 2021 to moderate from Q3 levels. Now let's turn to PSEG Power's operations, with total generation output of 14.9 terawatt hours matched the output of third quarter 2020. Power's combined cycle fleet produced 6.8 terawatt hours of output in response to higher market prices. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 94.8% for the quarter, producing 8.1 terawatt hours, which represent 54% of total generation. 
For the balance of '21, total baseload and combined cycle generation is forecasted to be 12 to 14 terawatt hours, hedged 85% to 90% at an average price of $32 per megawatt hour. Power's third quarter activity included the announcement of the fossil sale to ArcLight in August of this year. 
As previously mentioned, PSEG Fossil's assets have been reclassified to held for sale as of the date of the sale of the announcement. This change has prompted the cessation of depreciation and amortization expense for these held-for-sale units and resulted in a favorable impact to GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings through the close of the sale and contributed to the increase of our 2021 full year non-GAAP operating earnings guidance. 
Power has raised the forecast for its non-GAAP operating earnings for 2021 to $365 million to $440 million from $350 million to $425 million. Our estimate of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA has also been raised to $870 million to $970 million from $850 million to $950 million.
Now let me briefly address operating results for Enterprise and Other, where for the third quarter, we reported a net loss of $20 million or $0.03 per share compared to net income of $8 million or $0.02 per share for the third quarter of 2020. The non-GAAP operating loss for the third quarter was $13 million or $0.02 per share compared to non-GAAP operating earnings of $8 million or $0.02 per share for the third quarter of 2020. 
Results this quarter reflected higher tax and O&M expenses at the parent versus the year ago period. For 2021, the forecast of Enterprise and Other is unchanged at a non-GAAP operating loss of $20 million. From a financial standpoint at September 30, we had approximately $3 billion of available liquidity as well as cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion and debt represented 58% of our consolidated capital. 
PSEG Power had net cash collateral postings of $999 million at September 30 related to out-of-the-money hedge positions resulting from higher energy prices during the third quarter of 2021. It's been several years since the sustained rise in power prices has caused collateral postings of this magnitude. Our liquidity and cash position are ample and capable of accommodating additional cash collateral postings if necessary. Overall, our ratable hedging program remains an effective risk management tool that we implement over a rolling 3-year period, which smooths volatility in earnings through the averaging of forward sales and importantly locks in gross margin. 
Turning to financings during the quarter. In August, PSE&G issued $425 million of 1.9% secured medium-term notes due 2031. Also in August, PSEG entered into a $1.25 billion 364-day variable rate term loan agreement. In September, Power and after retirement of its 3 senior notes totaling $1.4 billion on October 8. These remaining notes were retired at a redemption price that included a make-whole premium of approximately $294 million.
Following the retirement of all of its debt, PSEG Power's 8.625% senior notes due 2031 were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange effective October '18. Because PSEG Power no longer has any registered securities outstanding, we'll go through a process to terminate status of the SEC registrant. 
In October, Moody's lowered the credit ratings of PSE&G, PSEG Power and PSEG. The current senior secured ratings of PSE&G, our A1A at Moody's S&P, respectively, with stable credit outlooks from both agencies. PSEG's senior unsecured credit ratings and PSEG powers issuer credit ratings play to BBB at Moody's and S&P, respectively, also with stable outlooks from both agencies.
As we outlined during the investor conference, we raised PSEG's 2021 to 2025 capital program by $1 billion to a range of $15 billion to $17 billion. We continue to anticipate execution of this 5-year capital program without the need to issue new equity as we continue to offer a compelling shareholder dividend, with the opportunity for consistent and sustainable growth.
And as Ralph mentioned, we've raised our 2021 guidance of non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year to $3.55 to $3.70 per share based on solid results year-to-date and the benefit from cessation of depreciation on fossil assets. We also accounting the initial 2022 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.60 per share that we provided at the investor conference on September 27. That concludes my remarks and Jesse. Ralph and I are ready to take questions."

So the debate that's taking place,",327,"Jeremy, yes, so I feel very good about the bipartisan nature of the support I would be less than candid if I didn't express some concerns and hesitation about the overriding piece of legislation to which it's attached. 
So the debate that's taking place, as you know, is around 2 separate pieces of legislation. One is a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan bill. So the PTC is not part of that then there's a -- depending upon what price accounts you believe a $1.75 billion to $1.5 trillion bill that is not bipartisan that is requiring reconciliation rules and full Democratic party support to get through. 
But the nuclear component has not attracted any controversy whatsoever. I believe the estimates in that bill is that there's about $550 billion of that legislation dedicated to climate mitigation. And it's widespread recognition that if we're going to make progress, it's got to be based upon the existing nuclear fleet still being around upon which to build that progress. 
So the House version has an 8-year PTC. Roughly speaking, it targets all in $15 per megawatt hour of tax credits starting with energy prices of $25 per megawatt hour or less. And then there's a declining scale of the PTC benefit as market revenues climb above $25 per megawatt hour where every dollar above that level, $0.80 of PTC is removed. 
It kind of gets you to a $40 per megawatt hour or so outcome. There's a pre and post-tax adjustment that needs to make that but for simplicity's sake. So it's really, I think, great news. And I think just today, for example, President Biden announced an SMR development project in Romania that's going to be done with new scale. You should check the press accounts on that. I don't want to speak for others. But it's just indicative of the support that nuclear is gaining in recognition of the pretty aggressive carbon reduction goals that need to be achieved."

And clearly, longer-term support for nuclear is going to be much more valuable and much more stabilizing than something on a shorter-term basis. And that's something that we've been pretty vocal about for quite some time. And so I think that's a positive as well. 
The number of years that's been tied into the PTC has moved around a little bit. Ralph mentioned earlier in period. So we'll see where it goes. But I do think that what you have seen is increasing support, I think, universally, both we saw it initially in New Jersey as we went through the ZEC process and I think folks are getting on board in Washington as well."

They've all had 5- and 10-year life spans that have been renewed for multiple decades. So I'm not at all worried about the 8-year PTC. 
By the way, I do want to add one other thing that's happening at COP 26 right now. That's great news for us is that there is a growing consensus around a 30% reduction in methane by the year 2030. There's an article written today by Fred Krupp of EDF in the Wall Street Journal highlighting the importance of methane reduction. 
And that is just incredibly supportive of our gas system modernization program and continued funding for that and expansion of that. So I think between nuclear, offshore wind and methane reduction, we're really quite well positioned for some important investments going forward."

I mean energy revenues are really the primary consideration for nuclear plants. That's not to say that we're completely disregard capacity revenues for our group fleet. Having said that, our units have not needed to be mitigated according to the IMM. 
So they should be able to compete in that capacity market whatever that ends up being in the future. I'd say the other changes at FERC that we're eagerly anticipating is the recognition of the importance of transmission investment to carbon mitigation. That's a little bit of a head scratcher when you think about some of the mentioned earlier this year, about reducing the RTO adder for a transmission ROE, which seems to have quieted down right now and has given way to the an nul for the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, which is looking at transmission planning on a much more comprehensive basis.
So I just think at a high level, the things that are being discussed and taken up are favorable to our business, both in terms of nuclear being able to participate in capacity markets, states being able to make renewable energy decisions, free of penalties from the prior version of the MOP, which is important to state like New Jersey, where people otherwise would have been paying twice for offshore wind capacity, which would have significant crimping of the headroom on the utility bill, which now we don't have to worry onset."

And there's a hearing, I think, on this week or next week in the Senate on alternate sources of nuclear power in terms of its applicability to the health sciences and medical fields. So I think there's just a growing recognition of nuclear as a carbon mitigant and the multiple ways that we need to act to keep it around and keep it vibrant, whether it's a PTC or source for hydrogen creation or medical science. I know means want to be a sunken party, though. 
I do think that there needs to be much more conversation around the safety of large-scale hydrogen generation than we're seeing right now in in various forms. That's an engineering challenge. But as with other engineering challenges, I'm sure there are solutions, but that does need to be discussed much more prominently than it's getting attention right now."

I think you should think about what we're doing as being aligned with what we've talked about in the past. I mean we still think that a multiyear hedging program for baseload power, such as nuclear does make sense, what you saw within some of the numbers that we provided align very closely to if you were to just step back over time and take a look at where forward prices have been for the years that we've hedged and take a look at those hedge prices, it's consistent with exactly what we have told you that we have done on that front. 
That said, we have always talked a little bit too about the fact that while that's a general range, there is a little bit of a range around what we can hedge as we go through those times. And so in times like what we've seen more recently, there's been a little bit more activity to try to capture some of those prices. But if you think about it over the long run and over a 3-year hedging period, you're not going to be able to move the needle that much with respect to what's been done on the nearer term. 
And as you step out, while prices are a little bit backward dated, there's maybe a little bit less of an opportunity. We're into a little bit of a challenge on liquidity. So will we seek to capture some of these higher prices, absolutely. But should you anticipate that it's going to have a very big move on the needle, I think, against the backdrop of a base of hedges that we have and the backwardation and some liquidity challenges on the back end, it will be more moderated of an impact."

So David, I think that the mechanisms that are in place are there and do protect the customer pretty well, both on the electric and the gas side because obviously, when gas price is going to go up, you see the effect on the electric prices. And so what we have and we actually referred to within our remarks is an ability to put forth a 5% increase on the commodity component of the bill 2x during the year.
 And so there's a -- because of some timing and some kind of a technical aspect to work through the utilities in the state are looking through the ability to do that. So you can think about that on the gas side has been 5% and 5% is on just the supply side of things that you may end up seeing. And then most customers, I think on the electric side, the best model to think about is the provider of last resort contract for BGS. 
And so what folks are paying now or prices that were established this past February the February before and the February before that, on a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 basis. And so nothing will change from the residential standpoint until we get to next year. and the auction that will come this February will get put in place next June. What will get put in place is for 1/3 that will roll off and the remaining 2/3 will be sticky from the prior 2 auctions. 
So that has a mitigating effect as well. That mechanism has a mediating effect as does the fact that if you think about some of the most current prices on the electric side, they are higher for the current year, for the upcoming year than they are for the following couple of years. We've got a backwardated curve. And so that auction in February will cover 3 years forward, which will have a higher price year for 2022, if you just look at the forwards and then lower as you go into '23 and '24. 
All to say that, that also has a very moderating effect how this stuff will ultimately flow through to the customer bill. So if we are in a position where prices like we're seeing now are sustained for the longer term. Obviously, that would all work its way down to the retail customer. But if anything is shorter lives, you're going to see less of an impact because of those mechanisms that I described."

As you have seen, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.98 per share for the third quarter of 2021 versus $0.96 per share in the year ago quarter. GAAP results for the third quarter were a $3.10 per share net loss   related to transition charges at PSEG Power, and they compare with a $1.14 per share of net income for the third quarter of 2020. 
In this year's quarter, PSEG Power recorded a pretax impairment loss of approximately $2.17 billion to reflect the announced sale of its fossil generating fleet that includes $13 million of other related costs. Results for the third quarter bring non-GAAP operating earnings for the first 9 months of 2021 to $2.96 per share. 
The 6.5% increase over non-GAAP results of $2.78 per share for the first 9 months of 2020 reflects the growing contribution from our regulated operations and continued derisking at PSEG Power.
Slides 12 and 14 summarize the results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2021. The third quarter of 2021 was one of the most significant in recent PSEG history. Since July, we've announced the sale of Power's Fossil fleet and reached the transmission rate settlement that will help lower customer build. 
In addition, at our recent investor conference, we announced an increase in our 5-year capital spending plan by $1 billion, a $0.12 per share increase to the common stock dividend for 2022, a $500 million share repurchase program expected to be implemented upon the close of the Fossil sale and initiated a 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth projection over the 2022 to 2025 period.
On the ESG front, we advanced our decarbonization efforts with the elimination of coal in our fuel mix this past June. Our participation in the New Jersey Wind Port and ongoing consideration of regional offshore wind opportunities in generation and transmission demonstrates our alignment with clean energy agenda. And our Clean Energy Future program was recently named a star of energy efficiency recipient in [indiscernible].
Of critical importance, we have staked out a leadership position in the industry by accelerating our net-zero vision to 2030 and joining the UN-backed Race to Zero campaign that will put us on a path to establish science-based targets to all of our missions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Later this week, I will be attending the Conference of Parties referred to as COP26 to engage with policymakers and further support emissions reduction goals. This includes advocating for climate action now and advancing the case for preserving existing nuclear generation. This month, we issued a combined sustainability and climate report that outlines our progress to date and commitments for the future. We intend to continue taking meaningful climate action in response to the increase frequency and severity of extreme weather in our service area.
Speaking of extreme weather, tropical storm Ida soaked parts of New Jersey with nearly 9 inches of rain within a 24-hour period and caused extensive flooding throughout the state. Our past and current Energy Strong investments that hardened flood-proof energy infrastructure brought tremendous benefit to customers during Ida, minimizing the damage to adaptive substations and switching stations and keeping them operational.  
That said, the extreme weather did wreak havoc throughout our service area and our thoughts go out to the families who lost loved ones to the storm and to the community still recovering from flood damaged homes and businesses. 
To continue these enhancements and bring them closer to the customer, we are expanding our reliability improvement programs to the last mile of work we will propose in our upcoming Infrastructure Advancement Program, which we plan to file with the BPU in a few days. 
This proposal, if approved, would direct approximately $848 million of investment over a 4-year period to improve the reliability of our electric distribution system, addressing aging substations and gas metering and regulating stations and electric vehicle charging infrastructure at PSE&G facilities that will support the planned electrification of the utility fleet, all of this while serving the dual purpose of creating important high-quality jobs and helping to further stimulate the New Jersey economy. 
The foundation of results for the quarter was the solid operating performances by both PSE&G and PSEG Power. This summer, the third hottest on record contributed to the hottest first 9 months we've ever recorded, pushing a number of total hours with temperatures exceeding 90 degrees or greater, nearly 65% higher than the same period in 2020 and versus normal, thereby increasing peak demands.
The Conservation Incentive Program effective since June 1 for electric and October 1 for natural gas provides recovery for variations in customer usage due to weather, economic conditions and energy efficiency, thereby enabling the utility to promote maximum customer participation in energy efficiency programs without the loss of margin from lower sales. This also has a stabilizing effect on our margins more broadly. The continued reopening of the New Jersey economy is unwinding some of the shift in sales experienced during most of 2020. Residential electric sales declined adjusted for weather as more people return to work, school and other activities outside the home, partly offset by higher commercial and industrial sales.
Due to the warmer-than-normal summer weather and the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the daily peak load for the quarter topped out at 9,620 megawatts compared to last year's third quarter daily peak, which was slightly less at 9,557 megawatts. Our peak load for the year remains the 10,064 megawatts we hit on June 30, which exceeded the 10,000 megawatt mark for the first time since 2013.
Moving to the zero-carbon and infrastructure side of PSEG. We recently announced that we have submitted several joint proposals to New Jersey's competitive State Agreement Approach open window to build offshore wind transmission infrastructure. These joint proposals submitted with Ørsted are collectively named the Coastal Wind Link and leverage the experienced partnership of PSEG and Ørsted in New Jersey energy infrastructure, our commitment to diverse suppliers and our mature working relationships with local building and construction trades.
The proposals cover onshore upgrades, new onshore transmission connection facilities, new offshore transmission connection facilities and a networked offshore transmission system in any stand-alone configuration or combination. PJM is providing the technical analysis and recommendations to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, who will make the final decisions based on an evaluation of reliability and economic benefits, cost, constructability, environmental benefits, permitting risks and other myriad New Jersey benefits. A BPU decision is not expected before the third or fourth quarter of 2022.
FERC has granted PJM's request to delay the next capacity auction covering the 2023, 2024 energy year to late January 2022. This revised time line places the 2024, 2025 auction into August of 2022 and the '25-'26 auction into February of 2023. These upcoming capacity auctions will provide additional surety to the gross margin of our nuclear fleet in the outer years of our 2021 to 2025 planning horizon.
Nuclear power's economic struggles are a national challenge that call for a broad federal solution so that individual states like New Jersey aren't shouldering more than their share of the loan. We are continuing efforts to secure support for existing at-risk nuclear plants in the federal tax code. The House version of the Build Back Better infrastructure legislation currently contains an 8-year production tax credit for existing nuclear at [indiscernible] per megawatt hour with the value of the credit declining as market revenues increase.  
The proposal has support in the Senate and from the Biden administration. While passage is not assured, this would be an impactful provision for the nation's nuclear fleet, and we are hopeful that commerce can enact it this fall. You may recall that the New Jersey's ZEC Law contains considerable customer protections and specifically requires that state zero-emission certificate payments that I just referred to a moment ago as ZEC payments, be offset by any out-of-market payment compensating nuclear for the same zero carbon attribute.
Specific to the nuclear production tax credit, the value of the PTC for our New Jersey units would reduce the ZEC payment up to the maximum $10 per megawatt hour. However, the ZEC would not reduce the value of the PTC and our share of the 2 Pennsylvania Peach Bottom units would benefit from the full production tax credit.
Moving forward, there needs to be broad recognition at both the state and federal level of the value of nuclear zero carbon attributes both for the quality of air today and the climate tomorrow.  To avoid backsliding for decades to come, we need to ensure that the long-term viability of New Jersey's nuclear generation is preserved as we bring more clean energy resources into the mix.
Turning my attention to guidance. We are raising our forecast for full year 2021 non-GAAP operating earnings to a range of $3.55 per share to $3.70 per share from the prior range of $3.50 to [indiscernible] per share. And this is based on results in the first 9 months of the year. Results for the third quarter and the first 9 months incorporate the planned August 1 implementation of PSE&G's transmission rate settlement.
In addition, full year forecasted results also reflect PSEG Power cessation of depreciation expense on the Fossil assets based upon the move to held to for sale accounting treatment in August while otherwise continuing to contribute to consolidated results. We are also reaffirming PSEG's 2022 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.60 per share.  
We remain on track to execute on PSE&G's 2021 planned capital spend of $2.7 billion. This spend is part of PSEG's consolidated 5-year $15 billion to $17 billion capital plan, which we still intend to execute without the need to issue new equity while continuing to offer the opportunity for consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend. Following the close of the peak of the Fossil sale, PSEG will be a 90% regulated and predominantly contracted platform of stable carbon-friendly businesses.
As we continue to execute on this strategy as well as on the significant financial announcements made in our recent investor conference, we remain fully dedicated to providing our shareholders with the premier opportunity to pursue sustainable growth in earnings and dividends with an industry-leading ESG platform. 
I'll turn the call over to Dan for more details on our results, and we'll make sure -- make myself available for your questions after his remarks."

Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everybody. As Ralph said, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of $0.98 per share versus $0.96 per share in last year's third quarter. We provided you with information on Slides 12 and",1795,"Great. Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everybody. As Ralph said, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of $0.98 per share versus $0.96 per share in last year's third quarter. We provided you with information on Slides 12 and 14 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings by business for the quarter and the year-to-date period, and Slides 13 and 15 containing corresponding waterfall charts that take you through the net changes in non-GAAP operating margin. So now I'll review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G.    
PSE&G reported net income of $389 million or $0.77 per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared with net income of $313 million or $0.61 per share   for the third quarter of 2020. PSE&G's third quarter results rose by $0.16 per share over third quarter 2020 and reflect revenue growth from ongoing capital investments as well as several one-time items. Growth in transmission rate base added $0.01 to share to third quarter net income even after incorporating the August 1 implementation of PSE&G's Transmission rate settlement, which FERC proved in October bringing the return on equity and our formula rate to 9.9%.  
Electric margin added $0.02 per share to net income compared to the year ago quarter as the Conservation Incentive Program, combined with Energy Strong II roll-ins more than offset a reduction in weather-normalized volumes. Gas results were $0.04 favorable compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting the absence of the gas weather normalization clause reversal in the third quarter of 2020. O&M expense was $0.01 per share favorable compared to the year ago quarter and nonoperating pension expense was $0.02 per share favorable compared to the third quarter of 2020. 
Lastly, tax expense was $0.06 favorable compared to the third quarter of 2020, driven by the timing of taxes to reflect PSE&G's lower estimated annual effective tax rate due to higher tax flowbacks in 2021. This impact is expected to reverse next quarter when PSE&G finalizes its actual tax rate for the year.
Moving to sales for the quarter. The weather for the third quarter of 2021 was 4% warmer than the year ago period and 22% warmer than normal, with significantly higher than normal number of hours at 90 degrees or greater.  On a trailing 12-month basis, weather normalized electric sales were flat and gas sales were up nearly 2%.  
Growth in the number of both electric and gas customers rose by approximately 1.5% each versus the third quarter of 2020. Ralph mentioned earlier, the stabilizing impact of the Conservation Incentive Program, now fully in effect for both electric and gas margins, resetting those margins to a baseline level. Going forward, about 95% of our electric distribution, 90 % of gas distribution will be stabilized via this mechanism, which will still pass through the variation in the actual number of customers. 
PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule. PSE&G invested approximately $670 million in the third quarter aggregating to $1.95 billion year-to-date through September. This capital is part of 2021's $2.7 billion electric and gas capital program to upgrade transmission and distribution infrastructure, enhance reliability and increase resiliency. 
We continue to forecast that over 90% of PSEG's planned capital investment will be directed to the utility over the 2021 to 2025 time frame.  We have raised PSE&G's forecast of net income for 2021 to $1.430 billion to $1.480 billion from $1.420 billion to $1.470 billion.   
Now moving to Power. Power reported a net loss of $1.933 billion or $3.84 per share for the third quarter of 2021, non-GAAP operating earnings of $119 million or $0.23 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $237 million.  
This compares to the third quarter 2020 net income of $254 million or $0.51 per share, non-GAAP operating earnings of $167 million or $0.33 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $349 million.   Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items from non-GAAP operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense and the benefit of net operating loss purchases, which are included in net income. 
The earnings release on Slide 23 provide you with a detailed analysis of the items having an impact on PSEG Power's non-GAAP operating earnings relative to net income year-over-quarter.  We've also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and for the year-to-date 2021 on Slide 24. Power's third quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.10 per share lower than third quarter 2020 results.   The recontracting and power market impacts reduced results by $0.11 per share as the seasonal shape of hedging activity and higher cost to serve load versus the year ago quarter lower gross margin.
The sale of the Solar Source portfolio earlier in the year also lowered gross margin results by $0.02 compared to the year ago quarter. The retirement of Bridgeport Harbor 3 on May 31, Power's last coal unit lowered New England capacity revenues by $0.01 per share versus the third quarter of 2020. And gas operations were lower by $0.02 per share, reflecting the absence of a pipeline refund received in last year's third quarter.  
O&M expense lowered results by $0.01 per share compared to the year ago quarter as higher nuclear costs were partly offset by lower solar expenses and lower depreciation expense associated with Fossil assets moving to held-for-sale accounting status and the sale of the Solar Source portfolio and the early retirement of Bridgeport Harbor, combined with lower interest expense to add $0.08 per share versus the year ago quarter. Lastly, taxes and other items were $0.01 per share unfavorable compared to the third quarter of 2020. 
Gross margin in the third quarter of 2021 was $28 a megawatt hour compared to $33 a megawatt hour for the last year's third quarter. This decline reflects the seasonal price impact of recontracting, including the third quarter's anticipated higher portion of the $2 per megawatt hour annualized price decline in the hedged portfolio. We expect recontracting results in the fourth quarter of 2021 to moderate from Q3 levels. 
Now let's turn to PSEG Power's operations, with total generation output of 14.9 terawatt hours matched the output of third quarter 2020. Power's combined cycle fleet produced 6.8 terawatt hours of output in response to higher market prices. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 94.8% for the quarter, producing 8.1 terawatt hours, which represented 54% of total generation.  
For the balance of '21, total baseload and combined cycle generation is forecasted to be 12 to 14 terawatt hours, hedged 85% to 90% at an average price of $32 per megawatt hour. 
Power's third quarter activity included the announcement of the Fossil sale to ArcLight in August of this year. As previously mentioned, PSEG Fossil's assets have been reclassified to held for sale as of the date of the sale of the announcement. This change has prompted the cessation of depreciation and amortization expense for these held-for-sale units and resulted in a favorable impact to GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings through the close of the sale and contributed to the increase of our 2021 full year non-GAAP operating earnings guidance.
Power has raised the forecast for its non-GAAP operating earnings for 2021 to $365 million to $440 million from $350 million to $425 million.   Our estimate of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA has also been raised to $870 million to $970 million from $850 million to $950 million. 
Now let me briefly address operating results for Enterprise and Other, where for the third quarter, we reported a net loss of $20 million or $0.03 per share compared to net income of $8 million or $0.02 per share for the third quarter of 2020. The non-GAAP operating loss for the third quarter was $13 million or $0.02 per share compared to non-GAAP operating earnings of $8 million or $0.02 per share for the third quarter of 2020.  
Results this quarter reflected higher tax and O&M expenses at the parent versus the year ago period. For 2021, the forecast of Enterprise and Other is unchanged at a non-GAAP operating loss of $20 million.  
From a financial standpoint at September 30, we had approximately $3 billion of available liquidity as well as cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion and debt represented 58% of our consolidated capital.    
PSEG Power had net cash collateral postings of $999 million at September 30 related to out-of-the-money hedge positions resulting from higher energy prices during the third quarter of 2021. It's been several years since the sustained rise in power prices has caused collateral postings of this magnitude. Our liquidity and cash position are ample and capable of accommodating additional cash collateral postings if necessary.  Overall, our ratable hedging program remains an effective risk management tool that we implement over a rolling 3-year period, which smooths volatility in earnings through the averaging of forward sales and importantly locks in gross margin.
Turning to financings during the quarter. In August, PSE&G issued $425 million of 1.9% secured medium-term notes due 2031. Also in August, PSEG entered into a $1.25 billion 364-day variable rate term loan agreement. In September, Power and after retirement of its 3 senior notes totaling $1.4 billion on October 8.   These remaining notes were retired at a redemption price that included a make-whole premium of approximately $294 million. 
Following the retirement of all of its debt, PSEG Power's 8.625% senior notes due 2031 were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange effective October '18. Because PSEG Power no longer has any registered securities outstanding, we'll go through a process to terminate status of the SEC registrant.  
In October, Moody's lowered the credit ratings of PSE&G, PSEG Power and PSEG. The current senior secured ratings of PSE&G, are A1, A at Moody's, S&P, respectively, with stable credit outlooks from both agencies. PSEG's senior unsecured credit ratings and PSEG Power's issuer credit ratings Baa2, BBB at Moody's and S&P, respectively, also with stable outlooks from both agencies.
As we outlined during the investor conference, we raised PSEG's 2021 to 2025 capital program by $1 billion to a range of $15 billion to $17 billion. We continue to anticipate execution of this 5-year capital program without the need to issue new equity as we continue to offer a compelling shareholder dividend, with the opportunity for consistent and sustainable growth. 
And as Ralph mentioned, we've raised our 2021 guidance of non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year to $3.55 to $3.70 per share based on solid results year-to-date and the benefit from cessation of depreciation on fossil assets. We also accounting the initial 2022 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.60 per share that we provided at the investor conference on September 27. That concludes my remarks, and Jesse. Ralph and I are ready to take questions."

I would be less than candid if I didn't express some concerns and hesitation about the overriding piece of legislation to which it's attached.
So the debate that's taking place, as you know, is around 2 separate pieces of legislation. One is a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan bill. So the PTC is not part of that then there's, depending upon what price accounts you believe, a $1.75 trillion to $1.85 trillion bill that is not bipartisan that is requiring reconciliation rules and full Democratic party support to get through. But the nuclear component has not attracted any controversy whatsoever. I believe the estimates in that bill is that there's about $550 billion of that legislation dedicated to climate mitigation. And it's widespread recognition that if we're going to make progress, it's got to be based upon the existing nuclear fleet still being around upon which to build that progress. 
So the House version has an 8 year PTC. Roughly speaking, it targets all-in $15 per megawatt hour of tax credits starting with energy prices of $25 per megawatt hour or less. And then there's a declining scale of the PTC benefit as market revenues climb above $25 per megawatt hour where every dollar above that level, $0.80 of PTC is removed.
It kind of gets you to a $40 per megawatt hour or so outcome. There's a pre and post tax adjustment that needs to be mixed in that but for simplicity's sake. So it's really, I think, great news. And I think just today, for example, President Biden announced an SMR development project in Romania that's going to be done with new scale. You should check the press accounts on that. I don't want to speak for others. But it's just indicative of the support that nuclear is gaining in recognition of the pretty aggressive carbon reduction goals that need to be achieved."

And clearly, longer term support for nuclear is going to be much more valuable and much more stabilizing than something on a shorter term basis. And that's something that we've been pretty vocal about for quite some time. And so I think that's a positive as well.
The number of years that's been tied into the PTC has moved around a little bit, ralph mentioned earlier, 8-year period. So we'll see where it goes. But I do think that what you have seen is increasing support, I think, universally, both we saw it initially in New Jersey as we went through the ZEC process and I think folks are getting on board in Washington as well."

They've all had 5- and 10-year life spans that have been renewed for multiple decades. So I'm not at all worried about the 8-year PTC.  
By the way, I do want to add one other thing that's happening at COP26 right now that's great news for us is that there is a growing consensus around a 30% reduction in methane by the year 2030. There's an article written today by Fred Krupp of EDF in the Wall Street Journal highlighting the importance of methane reduction.
And that is just incredibly supportive of our Gas System Modernization Program and continued funding for that and expansion of that. So I think between nuclear, offshore wind and methane reduction, we're really quite well positioned for some important investments going forward."

I mean energy revenues are really the primary consideration for nuclear plants. That's not to say that were completely disregard capacity revenues for our nuclear fleet. Having said that, our units have not needed to be mitigated according to the IMM.
So they should be able to compete in that capacity market whatever that ends up being in the future. I'd say the other changes at FERC that we're eagerly anticipating is the recognition of the importance of transmission investment to carbon mitigation. That's a little bit of a head scratcher when you think about some of the mentioned earlier this year, about reducing the RTO adder for a transmission ROE, which seems to have quieted down right now and has given way to the ANOPR, the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which is looking at transmission planning on a much more comprehensive basis. 
So I just think at a high level, the things that are being discussed and taken up are favorable to our business, both in terms of nuclear being able to participate in capacity markets, states being able to make renewable energy decisions, free of penalties from the prior version of the MOPR, which is important to state like New Jersey, where people otherwise would have been paying twice for offshore wind capacity, which would have significant crimping of the headroom on the utility bill, which now we don't have to worry about as much."

And there's a hearing, I think, this week or next week in the Senate on alternate sources of nuclear power in terms of its applicability to the health sciences and medical fields. So I think there's just a growing recognition of nuclear as a carbon mitigant and the multiple ways that we need to act to keep it around and keep it vibrant, whether it's a PTC or source for hydrogen creation or medical science. I no means want to be a skunk in the party, though I do think that there needs to be much more conversation around the safety of large scale hydrogen generation than we're seeing right now in various forms. That's an engineering challenge. But as with other engineering challenges, I'm sure there are solutions, but that does need to be discussed much more prominently than it's getting attention right now."

I think you should think about what we're doing as being aligned with what we've talked about in the past. I mean we still think that a multiyear hedging program for baseload power, such as nuclear, does make sense. What you saw within some of the numbers that we provided aligned very closely to if you were to just step back over time and take a look at where forward prices have been for the years that we've hedged and take a look at those hedge prices. It's consistent with exactly what we have told you that we have done on that front. 
That said, we have always talked a little bit too about the fact that while that's a general range, there is a little bit of a range around what we can hedge as we go through those times. And so in times like what we've seen more recently, there's been a little bit more activity to try to capture some of those prices. But if you think about it over the long run and over a 3-year hedging period, you're not going to be able to move the needle that much with respect to what's been done on the nearer term. And as you step out, while prices are a little bit backwardated, there's maybe a little bit less of an opportunity, you're into a little bit of a challenge on liquidity. So will we seek to capture some of these higher prices? Absolutely. But should you anticipate that it's going to have a very big move on the needle? I think, against the backdrop of a base of hedges that we have and the backwardation and some liquidity challenges on the back end, it will be more moderated of an impact."

One, it's just recently submitted and Ralph gave you the time line for when we'll start to get a determination. We feel very good about our proposals, but it's unknown exactly what's going to come back. And on top of that, there are a series of different proposals that are out there.
And so the prospect of all of them actually being part of the solution is unlikely. And so you're going to get piece parts and you don't know what they're going to do from the standpoint of magnitude of bidder. So I think it's early. It's just a little bit tough to gauge. I do think -- as I said, I think we have a solid position with respect to what we have submitted. But that said, it's tough to tell exactly where they're going to go with the solutions they see and how wide they may distribute."

So David, I think that the mechanisms that are in place are there and do protect the customer pretty well, both on the electric and the gas side because obviously, when gas prices go up, you see the effect on the electric prices. And so what we have",416,"Yes. So David, I think that the mechanisms that are in place are there and do protect the customer pretty well, both on the electric and the gas side because obviously, when gas prices go up, you see the effect on the electric prices. And so what we have and we actually referred to within our remarks is an ability to put forth a 5% increase on the commodity component of the bill 2x during the year.
And so there's a -- because of some timing and some kind of a technical aspect to work through, the utilities in the state are looking through the ability to do that. So you can think about that on the gas side has been 5% and 5% is on just the supply side of things that you may end up seeing. And then most customers, I think on the electric side, the best model to think about is the provider of last resort contract for BGS. 
And so what folks are paying now are prices that were established this past February, the February before and the February before that, on a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 basis. And so nothing will change from the residential standpoint until we get to next year. and the auction that will come this February will get put in place next June. What will get put in place is for 1/3 that will roll off and the remaining 2/3 will be sticky from the prior 2 auctions. 
So that has a mitigating effect as well. That mechanism has a mediating effect as does the fact that if you think about some of the most current prices on the electric side, they are higher for the current year, for the upcoming year than they are for the following couple of years. We've got a backwardated curve. And so that auction in February will cover 3 years forward, which will have a higher price year for 2022, if you just look at the forwards and then lower as you go into '23 and '24.  
All to say that, that also has a very moderating effect how this stuff will ultimately flow through to the customer bill. So if we are in a position where prices like we're seeing now are sustained for the longer term. Obviously, that would all work its way down to the retail customer. But if anything is shorter lived, you're going to see less of an impact because of those mechanisms that I described."

So we put forward a series of proposals that can be used in a comprehensive manner. They wouldn't need all of our proposals as there are alternative options that are in there, and they can also be mixed and matched with proposals made by others. So we tried to create as robust of options for PJM and the BPU as was possible. 
Now the short answer to your specific questions, yes, there are some onshore advantages to being the landing point from a right of way point of view as an example. But beyond that, it's really just a question of what are the path lengths, what are your relationships with suppliers and your ability to manage the work and be cost competitive. And what those right of ways look like with respect to environmental permits and other issues that will come up. So I guess, technically, the short answer is yes, there are some advantages, but they, by no means, assure victory for whoever is at substation [indiscernible]."
