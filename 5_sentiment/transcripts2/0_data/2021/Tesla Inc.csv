I'd just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesl",1334,"Thank you. So just to recap the year, 2020 was a defining year for us on many levels. Despite a challenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5 million cars. I'd just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort. We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history. So really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging 2020. So my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla. So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3 billion on building new factories and other expenditures. We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow. 
Regarding capacity expansion. While we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity. We started producing the model out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed. We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly. We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles. We ramped the single piece -- we started and we're able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings for Model Y. This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made. 
We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in 1 year. We're also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year. And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area. And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant. 
Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we're super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X [ pad] -- are in production now and will be delivered in February. So we've been able to bring forward the fab, Model S and X. And Model S will be delivered in February and Model X a little later. The Model S pad, and we're actually in production now, and we'll be delivering next month. So this is a tri motor Model S with a completely new interior. There are actually a lot of great things about this. I'll do another call about the Model S later. But it's really a tremendous improvement over the prior version. And the Model S will be the first -- the smallest pad will be the first production car ever that is able to go 0 to 60 miles an hour in under 2 seconds. So no production car ever has been able to get below 2 seconds 0 to 60. This is a luxury stand that is able to go 0 to 60 in less than 2 seconds, and will have the ability to seat up to 7 people with the third row seats. So this is pretty nice. This is faster to be clear than any car. It's not like there was a different type of car, like a 2-door sports car that was able to do be -- is the fastest accelerating car ever made for -- that is allowed to go on roads in history. And like I say, we'll start delivering it in a matter of weeks. 
And obviously gets into the details what the Model S changes maybe later this week or next. But it's really better in many ways. We will be actually raising the price of Model S for these new models of -- the old model -- the new model will be $10,000 more. So hopefully, people aren't too upset if they bought the old model last month, but this one $10,000 more. 
So yes, we think it's probably the best car of any kind at any price available in the world today. So then with regard to full self-driving, we've made massive progress on Full Self-Driving. I recommend watching the videos of our public beta. So we've got, I think, almost 1,000 people in the beta at this point. And with each successful release of the beta FSD software, just -- it's really improving rapidly. It's not very common for -- I drive the latest [indiscernible]. It's very common for me to have no interventions on drives that I do, including drives to a place that I've never been to. So these are not preplanned routes. The car has never been there before. And it's now actually more -- it's more common than not for the car to have no interventions, even on a complex drive. So -- and this is -- basically I'm highly confident the car will drive itself for the reliability in excess of a human this year. This is a very big deal. 
And thinking about like how does one justify the value of the company being where it is? And I think there is a way, just with back of the on road map to potentially justify it, where if Tesla's ships, let's say, hypothetically, $50 billion or $60 billion worth of vehicles, and those vehicles become full self-driving and can be used in robotaxis -- used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an average of 12 hours a week to potentially an average of 60 hours a week if they're capable of serving as robotaxi. So that's like roughly a 5x increase in utility. But let's -- even if you say like, okay, let's just assume that the car becomes twice as useful as -- not 5x as useful, but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of the company, which is almost entirely gross margin. So it would mean, it would be like if you made $50 million -- $50 billion worth of cars, it will be like having $50 million of incremental profit basically from that because it's just software. So -- and the pace you get [ 20 PE on ] that, it's like $1 trillion and the company is still in high-growth mode. So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of the company where it is using just the cars and nothing else, the cars with FSD. And I suspect at least some number of investors are taking that approach. 
So in conclusion, while 2020 was a turning point for Tesla and in terms of profitability, we believe this is just the beginning. We think 2021 is going to be even more exciting. And you don't know what to expect in a given year. Obviously, last year, we did not hear many things, we do not expect. But assume that '21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint. I think it's going to be a great year for Tesla. 
We've got a ton of -- many great new products coming out We've got factories that are advanced factories out of [indiscernible] production. It will also make it easier how you're having a factory in Berlin, one, in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint. Texas can help supply the eastern half of the U.S. and Berlin can help supply Europe. And there's just pure cars on both, much less capital tied up with big cars that are at or -- have been transported to customers. And I think the fundamental efficiency of the company will be much better with the factories or at least having factories on -- on each continent and having 2 factories in the U.S. 
So I'm super excited about the future. And yes, we look forward to making it happen. Thank you."

As Elon mentioned, 2020 has been an extremely successful year while managing through many unforeseen and unexpected challenges.

As Elon mentioned, 2020 has been an extremely successful year while managing through many unforeseen and unexpected challenges. On cash, we continue to generate strong free cash flows, reaching a record $1.9 billion in Q4 alongside growth and investment for future programs. Additionally, we've been able to reduce our use of debt and various working capital lines, including settling $2 billion of convertible debt in Q4, which will continue into Q1. 
For net income, we achieved our first calendar year and 6 sequential quarters of profitability. In addition, auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved from 2019 to 2020 despite reductions in ASP and inefficiencies from new product launches and transitions. 
On Q4 specifically, this was a noisy quarter so let's unpack a few things. Stock-based comp increased, part of which is driven by the rise of the stock price over the course of our 2020 employee performance grant process and a portion of which is unique to Q4 only. The impact of SBC increases is seen across both COGS as well as operating expenses. 
Automotive gross margin in Q4 was primarily impacted by 2 things: First, we invested in improving our products built in Fremont, including converting over to the new Model S and Model X, launching the single-piece castings on Model Y and introducing heat pump on Model 3. Second, logistics and labor costs were impacted due to supply chain instability and pandemic inefficiencies. Adjusting for items such as these as we do in our internal management views, we saw an improvement in auto gross margin. 
Our services and other P&L was impacted by many of the same factors just mentioned, including onboarding costs associated with new service capacity. However, what's most important here is that we've accelerated the growth in service capacity and will continue to drive capacity expansion as fast as possible. 
On energy gross margin, we saw an impact from Solar Roof-related ramp costs and typical seasonality in the lease PPA business. OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce despite impacts from items mentioned as well as increased investment in development of future products. 
Finally, the early settlement of our convertible notes resulted in an additional $100 million of interest expense for the quarter. All that being said, nothing has changed about our view that operating margin will continue to grow and remain industry-leading. 
As we look forward, 2021 may be our most meaningful step forward yet as we see the benefits of long-standing investments in capacity and technology. The range of possible outcomes this year is wide, given the magnitude of launches. 
There's a few things we should keep in mind. We continue to expect a long-term volume CAGR of 50%, of which we may materially exceed this in 2021. As we increase production rates, volumes will skew towards the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will be a part of this year's story and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals. Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products. Additionally, we're working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage as well as port capacity, which may have a temporary impact. We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including OpEx as a percentage of revenue. Global demand continues to outpace production, and we're moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long term. I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year."

Yes. As I'm saying, it's not remarkable at all for the car to completely drive you from 1 location to another through a series of complex intersections. It's now about just improving the corner case reliability and getting it to 99.9999% reliable with respect to an accident. Basically, we need to get it to better than human bio factor at least 100% or 200%. And the business happening rapidly because we've got so much training data with all [indiscernible] deals. And the software is improving dramatically. The -- we also write the software for labeling. And I'll say it's quite challenging. We're moving everything towards video labeling. So all video labeling for video incurrence. And so there are still a few of new met that need to be upgraded to video training inference. And really, as we transition to each net to video, the performances become exceptional. 
So this is like a hot thing. The video -- the labeling software that we work for, video labeling, making that better has a huge effect on the efficiency of labeling. And then, of course, the holy grail is auto labeling. So we're -- we put a lot of work into having the labeling tool to be more efficient when we use [indiscernible] as well as enabling order labeling where we can. 
Dojo is a training supercomputer. We believe it will be -- we think it may be the best neural net training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude. So it is a whole thing in and of itself. And this is something we can offer potentially as a service. So some of the others need neural net training, we're not trying to keep it to ourselves. So I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself. And then, of course, for training vast amounts video data and getting the reliability from 100% to 200% better than average human to 2,000% better than average human. So that will be very helpful in that regard."

For 100 out of those 140, you can get appointments in less than 10 days. And we're going to make sure it's all service centers are -- have a short wait time. 
We're accelerating, as Zach mentioned earlier, the pace of opening. In North America, we opened 11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year. So that's what we're doing to improve service. 
In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app. Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the Tesla app, and we're trying to move away from the phone. The app is much better than the phone. It can spot directly alerts directly from the car and schedule a service appointment. And there is a written record of all communication between the customer and the service team. You can have pictures in there. You can take care of your payment without entering the credit card and doing all that stuff. You get updates on the service. And there is even more features that are going to come in the coming months on the app. And I think everybody will be happy, including the ability to spot where your service technician is and how far it is to coming from your car and what's going on there. So we are investing everything on the app. I think just like most other companies as well, and that's the way of the future."

And in order to do that, the whole stack has to be to -- the whole stack has to be changed to video. That means gathering video clips than using -- and this is actually surround video. So you've got 8 cameras operating simultaneously with synchronized frame rates. So you've got basically 8 frames surround video -- 8 camera surround video. And then you've got to label basically everything in that video snippet and then train against that and have those neural nets operate the car. 
So -- and this is coming from the past where we would label, the neural nets would be a single camera, single frame. So no video and not combining the cameras. And then we went from single frame, single frame, 1 frame at a time, 1 camera at a time, neural nets to surround camera, neural nets would look at all -- all 8 cameras but only 1 frame at a time, and now to where we include the time dimension, and that's video. 
So I really do see this as a question of getting work done. We're getting it done. And you can see the results in the rapidly improving FSD betas that are at least -- we're also going to be expanding the FSD beta itself to include more and more people. 
So from my standpoint, it looks like a very clear and obvious path towards a vehicle that will drive 100% safer than a person. Yes. I really don't see any obstacles here. Yes."

What's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours? And you can't grow faster than that. Now at Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of how cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range even with the standard range battery pack. 
It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the sort of high 200s. And some slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with Standard Pack and an order 500 kilometers. So there's efficiency improvements in the car. But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production. And there's obviously a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales. 
So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth. It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers. In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers. And we've been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many batteries as they can produce. So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us. 
Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable. But I'm just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers. It is to supplement our suppliers. And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production and in addition, have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production. 
So it's an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us. And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the -- and then -- I mean probably the board [indiscernible] value of Tesla is just what's the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue on [indiscernible] level. And that's how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term."

On the regulatory and credit sales side, this isn't always an area that's extremely difficult for us to forecast. 2020 regulatory credit sales ended up being higher than our expectations. And it's difficult to give guidance on that. 
I mean what I said before is that in the long term, regulatory credit sales will not be a material part of the business, and we don't plan the business around that. It's possible that for a handful of additional quarters, it remains strong. It's also possible that it's not. 
Most of our regulatory credit revenue from Q4 was not lined up prior to the beginning of the quarter. And these were discrete deals that were struck over the course of the quarter. So I wish I could give you more on this, Dan, but it's a space that's extraordinarily difficult for us to forecast. 
On the second side, with respect to capital, a couple of things that we're thinking through there. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, debt reduction is an important thing that we're focused on now. 
Early conversions. These are things we don't have a choice on. We did around $2 billion of that in Q4. We currently have $1.4 billion that we expect to go out in Q1 as a result of early conversions or conversions on convertible debt. That number may increase. And so debt reduction is important. That's helpful on interest expense as well. 
We are also using the money with respect to our investments in future capacity. And so what we're able to do now that we haven't had the opportunity to do in the past is, as we're building capacity, particularly in Austin and Berlin, we can build that capacity with the expectation of what the end state of capacity will be pulling forward some of those investments, rather than incrementally adding capacity as we go along. 
And so this is an important part in terms of capital efficiency that we haven't had the luxury to do in the past. And it's great to be able to have the liquidity to focus on that. 
And then more broadly, as Jerome was touching on, service expansion is really important to the future strategy of the company. So as you saw in our Q4 numbers, the expansion of service centers and mobile service from Q3 to Q4 increased quite a bit and was also quite a bit higher than the first part of the year. And so we're able now to make investments there and also in the supercharging network to get ahead of future demand, which will cost us more in the near term, but is what the right long-term thing is for our customers and the company."

The thing to bear in mind is that there is fundamentally a constraint on battery cell output.

So a big part of the reason -- the main reason we have not accelerated new products is -- like, for example, Tesla Semi is that we simply don't happen our cells built. We -- this -- if we were to make the Semi like right now, which we could easily go into production with the Semi, but we would not have enough to cells built for it right now. We will have cells group in ourselves for Semi when we were producing the 4680 volume. But for example, Semi would use typically 5x the number of cells that car would use, but it would not sell for 5x what a car would sell for. So it kind of doesn't make -- it would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint. The same would go for that."

It is really just incredibly powerful computer and [indiscernible]. I'm personally certain that you can create full self-driving with safe level 5 just using the Full Self-Driving version 1 computer. 
The version 2, we expect to be about 3x as powerful. And this needs to be paired with higher resolution cameras. And so it's quite a -- it requires a bunch of things to change simultaneously. But we have not been rushing version 2 of the chip. It's coming along well, and it's in good shape. But since we can achieve FSD, Full Self-Driving, with the current system, it would actually be a distraction right now if we were to introduce the Full Self-Driving, the Tesla FSD chip 2 because it would set us back quite a bit on software. And software is the critical path to Full Self-Driving. 
So I wouldn't worry too much about that. That's not a -- that's an improvement, but not a game changer. That has to be changed. Getting the software to work and getting all the neural nets to be video, that's the game changer."

I love these great projects halfway or part like hallway done. So I do expect to be running the company for several years into the future. 
Now obviously, nobody is or should be CEO forever. So I don't expect to be -- like the sheer amount of work required to be CEO of Tesla is insane. And I do -- I think I do probably more -- I definitely do more technical work than is typical for a CEO. So it would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands as opposed to just working day and night, from when I wake up to when I go to sleep 7 days a week, pretty intense. 
So -- but I think the mission isn't over yet, and we still got a long way ago before we can really make a dent in the world on accelerating the advent of sustainable energy. I mean the goal Tesla, from beginning, has been to accelerate sustainable energy. And -- but if you say like what percentage of cars on the road are electric today, it's still very, very tiny, like an order of 1%, or less than 1% of the total fleet worldwide. So that's the full have long way to go for on the order of 1% of the fleet is electric. There's also a tremendous way to go on solar power, although it's exciting to see the advent of very cost-competitive wind and solar and geothermal. And of course, we need a large volume of stationary battery packs. 
I mean basically, maybe the 3 legs of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, led by solar, wind, geothermal and hydro and a few others. And I'm actually not against nuclear fission. I actually think nuclear fission is -- with a well-designed reactor and in a situation that is not subject to bad weather or seriously bad weather, is actually -- it is a good thing to do. So -- and then the second thing you need is stationary storage need batteries because most renewable energy is intermittent. It doesn't -- the wind doesn't blow all the time. The sun doesn't shine all the time. So you need a lot of batteries. And it needs to be very long-lasting and high cycle life. And then you need electric transport. 
If you have those 3 things, we've got a very bright future with respect to energy and the environment. So a long way to go on that. And so I'm still very much fired up to work on that."

I mean, honestly, I've had this question a million times for just for regular vehicles, even back in the early Roadster days, even before we had the Roadster out. People were saying that somehow hydrogen is going to be a better means of energy storage in a car than batteries. And it was like this is just really not the case. 
Hydrogen is a very -- it's #1 in the periodic table. It's got very low density. It's got low density as a liquid, like styrofoam-level density as a liquid. And then it's only a liquid very close to absolute 0. So you have to have a -- it's really not realistic to keep it as liquid. You want to have it as a high-pressure gas that has even lower density. So you need a gigantic fuel tank volumetrically, and it's got to be very high pressure. It's a big pain in the ass basically. If somebody is going to say, use an ultimate chemical energy storage mechanism to hydrogen, I'd say just use propane or something like that, or methane -- those will be way better than hydrogen. And then having it be a fuel cell just adds even further complications to the situation. It's just crazy basically. 
And we're extremely confident that we could do a long-range trucking with batteries. The math works out. You don't -- if you could just like take, say, what hours per kilogram of currently available cells, and say, okay, how much -- what weight would you need to go, let's say, 500 miles? And to what degree does that affect your payload? And it's like, okay, do this. If you do it right, You basically have no effect on your payload or almost nothing, and you can have a long-range truck. 
I mean, Jerome, do you want to add to that?"

So just to recap the year, 2020 was a defining year for us on many levels. Despite a challenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5 million cars. And I'd just like to once again thank the people at Te",1343,"Thank you. So just to recap the year, 2020 was a defining year for us on many levels. Despite a challenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5 million cars. And I'd just like to once again thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort. We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history. So really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging 2020. So my hat is off. It's such an honor to work with such great people at Tesla. 
So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3 billion on building new factories and other expenditures. We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity. We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and almost reached full production speed. We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly. We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles. 
We ramped the single piece -- we started and we're able to ramp to volume production the single-piece castings for Model Y. This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made. 
We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in 1 year. We're also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year. And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area. And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.
Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we're super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X Plaid are in production now and will be delivered in February. So we've been able to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X. And so Model S will be delivered in February and Model X a little later. For the Model S Plaid, we're actually in production now and we'll be delivering next month. 
So this is a tri-motor Model S with a completely new interior. There are actually a lot of great things about this. I'll do another call about the Model S later. But it's really a tremendous improvement over the prior version. 
And the Model S will be the first -- this Model S Plaid will be the first production car ever that is able to go 0 to 60 miles an hour in under 2 seconds. So no production car ever has been able to get below 2 seconds, 0 to 60. This is a luxury sedan that is able to go 0 to 60 in less than 2 seconds and will have the ability to seat up to 7 people with the third-row seats. 
So this is pretty nice. This is faster, to be clear, than any car. It's not like there was a different type of car, like a 2-door sports car that was able to do fast -- it's the fastest accelerating car ever made for -- that is allowed to go on roads in history. And like I said, we'll start delivering it in a matter of weeks.
And actually, we'll obviously get into the details what the Model S changes may be later this week or next. But it's really better in many ways. We will be actually raising the price of Model S for these new models of -- the old model -- the new model will be $10,000 more. So hopefully, people aren't too upset if they bought the old model last month. But this one, $10,000 more. So yes, we think it's probably the best car of any kind at any price available in the world today. 
So then with regard to Full Self-Driving, we've made massive progress on Full Self-Driving. I recommend watching the videos of our public beta. So we've got, I think, almost 1,000 people in the beta at this point. And with each successful release of the beta FSD software, it just gets -- it's really improving rapidly. It's not very common for -- I drive the latest roads.
It's very common for me to have no interventions on drives that I do, including drives to a place that I've never been to. So these are not preplanned routes. The car has never been there before. And it's now actually more -- it's more common than not for the car to have no interventions, even on a complex drive. So -- and this is -- basically, I'm highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year. This is a very big deal. 
And thinking about like how does one justify the value of the company being where it is, I think there is a way, just with back-of-the-envelope math, to potentially justify it, where if Tesla ships, let's say, hypothetically, $50 billion or $60 billion worth of vehicles and those vehicles become Full Self-Driving and can be used in robotaxis -- used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an average of 12 hours a week to potentially an average of 60 hours a week if they're capable of serving as robotaxi. So that's like roughly a 5x increase in utility. 
But let's -- even if you say like, okay, let's just assume that the car becomes twice as useful as -- not 5x as useful but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of the company, which is almost entirely gross margin. So it would mean -- it would be like if you made $50 million -- $50 billion worth of cars, it will be like having [ $50 million ] of incremental profit basically from that because of the software. 
So -- and if that was the case, then yes, you get 20 PE on that. It's like $1 trillion and the company is still in high-growth mode. So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of the company where it is using just the cars and nothing else, the cars with FSD. And I suspect at least a number of investors are taking that approach.
So in conclusion, while 2020 was a turning point for Tesla in terms of profitability, we believe this is just the beginning. We think 2021 is going to be even more exciting. And you don't know what to expect in a given year. Obviously, last year, we did not -- there were many things we did not expect. But assuming that '21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint, I think it's going to be a great year for Tesla.
We've got a ton of -- many great new products coming out. We've got factories that are -- advanced factories that can start production. It will also make it easier how you're having a factory in Berlin, one, and in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint. And Texas can help supply the Eastern half of the U.S. and Berlin can help supply Europe. And there's just fewer cars on boats, much less capital tied up with built cars that are on boats or going -- being transported to customers.

As Elon mentioned, 2020 has been an extremely successful year while managing through many unforeseen and unexpected challenges. On cash, we continue to generate strong free cash flows, reaching a record $1.9 billion in Q4 alongside",604,"Yes. Thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, 2020 has been an extremely successful year while managing through many unforeseen and unexpected challenges. 
On cash, we continue to generate strong free cash flows, reaching a record $1.9 billion in Q4 alongside growth and investment for future programs. Additionally, we've been able to reduce our use of debt and various working capital lines, including settling $2 billion of convertible debt in Q4, which will continue into Q1.
For net income, we achieved our first calendar year and 6 sequential quarters of profitability. In addition, auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved from 2019 to 2020 despite reductions in ASP and inefficiencies from new product launches and transitions.
On Q4 specifically, this was a noisy quarter. So let's unpack a few things. Stock-based comp increased, part of which is driven by the rise of the stock price over the course of our 2020 employee performance grant process, and a portion of which is unique to Q4 only. The impact of SBC increases is seen across both COGS as well as operating expenses.
Automotive gross margin in Q4 was primarily impacted by 2 things. First, we invested in improving our products built in Fremont, including converting over to the new Model S and Model X, launching the single-piece castings on Model Y and introducing heat pump on Model 3. Second, logistics and labor costs were impacted due to supply chain instability and pandemic inefficiencies. Adjusting for items such as these, as we do in our internal management views, we saw an improvement in auto gross margin.
Our services and other P&L was impacted by many of the same factors just mentioned, including onboarding costs associated with new service capacity. However, what's most important here is that we've accelerated the growth in service capacity and will continue to drive capacity expansion as fast as possible.
On energy gross margin, we saw an impact from Solar Roof-related ramp costs and typical seasonality in the lease/PPA business. OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce despite impacts from items mentioned as well as increased investment in development of future products.
Finally, the early settlement of our convertible notes resulted in an additional $100 million of interest expense for the quarter. All that being said, nothing has changed about our view that operating margin will continue to grow and remain industry-leading.
As we look forward, 2021 may be our most meaningful step forward yet as we see the benefits of long-standing investments in capacity and technology. The range of possible outcomes this year is wide given the magnitude of launches. 
There's a few things we should keep in mind. We continue to expect a long-term volume CAGR of 50%, of which we may materially exceed this in 2021. As we increase production rates, volumes will skew towards the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will be a part of this year's story and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals. Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai. However, S and X production will be low due to the transition to the newly rearchitected products. 
Additionally, we're working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage as well as port capacity, which may have a temporary impact. We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including OpEx as a percentage of revenue. Global demand continues to outpace production, and we're moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long term. 
I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year."

Yes. As I'm saying, it's not remarkable at all for the car to completely drive you from one location to another through a series of complex intersections. It's now about just improving the corner case reliability and getting it to 99.9999% reliable with respect to an accident. 
Basically, we need to get it to better than human by a factor of at least 100% or 200%. And this is happening rapidly because we've got so much training data with all cars in the field. And the software is improving dramatically. The -- we also write the software for labeling. And I'll say it's quite challenging. We're moving everything towards video labeling. So it's all video labeling, all video inference. And so there are still a few of the neural nets that need to be upgraded to video training and video inference. And really, as we transition each net to video, the performances become exceptional. 
So this is like a hot thing. The video -- the labeling software that we work for, video labeling, making that better has a huge effect on the efficiency of labeling. And then, of course, the holy grail is auto labeling. So we're putting a lot of work into having the labeling tool be more efficient when used by a person as well as enabling auto labeling where we can. 
Dojo is a sort of training supercomputer. We believe it will be -- we think it may be the best neural net training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude. So it is a whole thing in and of itself. And this is something we can offer potentially as a service. So some of the others need neural net training. We're not trying to keep it to ourselves. 
So I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself, and then, of course, for training vast amounts video data and getting the reliability from, say, 100% to 200% better than average human to 2,000% better than average human. Dojo will be very helpful in that regard."

And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible. 
One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in North America. We're trying to push that to 50% this year. And 50% of service visits last less than 2 hours. So we're trying to service the cars very quickly so people can get their vehicles back on the road. 
And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve. We have about -- we have actually 140 service centers right now in North America. For 100 out of those 140, you can get appointments in less than 10 days. And we're going to make sure all service centers are -- have a short wait time. 
We're accelerating, as Zach mentioned earlier, the pace of opening. In North America, we opened 11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year. So that's what we're doing to improve service. 
In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app. Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the Tesla app, and we're trying to move away from the phone. The app is much better than the phone. It can start directly -- alerts directly from the car and schedule a service appointment. And there is a written record of all communication between the customer and the service team. You can have pictures in there. You can take care of your payment without entering the credit card and doing all that stuff. You get updates on the service. 
And there is even more features that are going to come in the coming months on the app. And I think everybody will be happy, including the ability to spot where your service technician is and how far it is to coming from your car and what's going on there. So we are investing everything on the app, I think, just like most other companies as well, and that's the way of the future."

And in order to do that, the whole stack has to be -- the whole stack has to be changed to video. That means gathering video clips than using -- and this is actually surround video. So you've got 8 cameras operating simultaneously with synchronized frame rates. So you've got basically 8-frame surround video -- 8-camera surround video. And then you've got to label basically everything in that video snippet and then train against that and have those neural nets operate the car. 
So -- and this is coming from the past where we would label, the neural nets would be a single camera, single frame. So no video and not combining the cameras. And then we went from single frame, single frame, one frame at a time, one camera at a time, neural nets to surround camera, neural nets would look at all -- all 8 cameras but only one frame at a time and now to where we include the time dimension. And that's video. 
So I really do see this as a question of getting work done. We're getting it done. And you can see the results in the rapidly improving FSD betas that are leased. And we're also going to be expanding the FSD beta itself to include more and more people. 
So from my standpoint, it looks like a very clear and obvious path towards a vehicle that will drive 100% safer than a person. Yes. I really don't see any obstacles here. Yes."

It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the sort of high 200s. And with some slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with the Standard pack, an order of 500 kilometers. So there's efficiency improvements in the car. But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production. And there's obviously a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for cells. 
So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth. It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers. In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers. And we've been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG, that we will take as many batteries as they can produce. So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us. 
Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable. But I'm just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers. It is to supplement our suppliers. And we want our suppliers of cells to increase their production and in addition, have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production. 
So it's an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us. And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the -- and then -- I mean probably the broad brushstroke value of Tesla is just what's the cell output that implies vehicle output and then at least double that for autonomy revenue, [ probably a whole new ] level. And that's how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term."

So we're no longer iterating at the design center level or design level. We've got the designs fixed. We're getting to -- we'll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work. 
We're obviously going to be using even bigger casting machines for the rear body of the Cybertruck because you've got -- obviously, it's a bigger vehicle and you've got a long truck bed that's going to support a lot of load. So we'll be using an 8,000-ton casting press for the rear body casting as opposed to 6,000 tons for Model Y. So 6,000 tons was the biggest casting machine in the world. 8,000 tons is obviously quite a bit bigger than that. 
And I think it's going to be an incredible vehicle. If we get lucky, we'll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production to be in 2022."

On the regulatory credit sales side, this is always an area that's extremely difficult for us to forecast. 2020 regulatory credit sales ended up being higher than our expectations. And it's difficult to give guidance on that. 
I mean what I said before is that in the long term, regulatory credit sales will not be a material part of the business, and we don't plan the business around that. It's possible that for a handful of additional quarters, it remains strong. It's also possible that it's not. 
Most of our regulatory credit revenue from Q4 was not lined up prior to the beginning of the quarter. And these were discrete deals that were struck over the course of the quarter. So I wish I could give you more on this, Dan, but it's a space that's extraordinarily difficult for us to forecast. 
On the second side, with respect to capital, a couple of things that we're thinking through there. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, debt reduction is an important thing that we're focused on now. 
Early conversions, these are things we don't have a choice on. We did around $2 billion of that in Q4. We currently have $1.4 billion that we expect to go out in Q1 as a result of early conversions or conversions on convertible debt. That number may increase. And so debt reduction is important. That's helpful on interest expense as well. 
We are also using the money with respect to our investments in future capacity. And so what we're able to do now that we haven't had the opportunity to do in the past is, as we're building capacity, particularly in Austin and Berlin, we can build that capacity with the expectation of what the end state of capacity will be, pulling forward some of those investments rather than incrementally adding capacity as we go along. And so this is an important part in terms of capital efficiency that we haven't had the luxury to do in the past, and it's great to be able to have the liquidity to focus on that. 
And then more broadly, as Jerome was touching on, service expansion is really important to the future strategy of the company. So as you saw in our Q4 numbers, the expansion of service centers and mobile service from Q3 to Q4 increased quite a bit and was also quite a bit higher than the first part of the year. And so we're able now to make investments there and also in the Supercharging network to get ahead of future demand, which will cost us more in the near term but is what the right long-term thing is for our customers and the company."

The thing to bear in mind is that there is fundamentally a constraint on battery cell output. It's like -- if one is not involved in manufacturing, it's really hard to appreciate just how hard it is to scale production. It's the hardest thing in the world. Prototypes are easy. Scaling production is very hard. 
So a big part of the reason -- the main reason we have not accelerated new products is -- like, for example, Tesla Semi, is that we simply don't have enough cells built. Like we -- this -- if we were to make the Semi like right now, which we could easily go into production with the Semi, but we would not have enough to cells for it right now. We will have cells -- enough cells for Semi when we were producing the 4680 in volume. But for example, Semi would use typically 5x the number of cells that a car would use, but it would not sell for 5x what a car would sell for. 
So it kind of doesn't make -- it would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint. The same would go for a van."

But we have not been rushing with version 2 of the chip. It's coming along well and it's in good shape.

So -- but I think the mission isn't over yet, and we still got a long way to go before we can really make a dent in the world on accelerating the advent of sustainable energy.

And -- but if you say like what percentage of cars on the road are electric today, it's still very, very tiny, like an order of 1% or less than 1% of the total fleet worldwide. 
So that's still a hell of a long way to go for ""on the order of 1% of the fleet is electric."" There's also a tremendous way to go on solar power, although it's exciting to see the advent of very cost-competitive wind and solar and geothermal. And of course, we need a large volume of stationary battery packs. 
I mean basically, the -- I mean the 3 legs of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation led by solar, wind, geothermal and hydro and a few others. And I'm actually not against nuclear fusion. I actually think nuclear fusion is -- with a well-designed reactor in a situation that is not subject to bad weather or seriously bad weather is actually -- it is a good thing to do. 
So -- and then the second thing you need is you need stationary storage. You need batteries because most renewable energy is intermittent. It doesn't -- the wind doesn't blow all the time. The sun doesn't shine all the time. So you need a lot of batteries. And it needs to be very long-lasting and high cycle life. And then you need electric transport. 
And if you have those 3 things, we've got a very bright future with respect to energy and the environment. So still a long way to go on that. And so I'm still very much fired up to work on that."

I mean honestly, I've had this question a million times for -- just for regular vehicles, even back in the early Roadster days, even before we had the Roadster out. People were saying that somehow hydrogen is going to be a better means of energy storage in a car than batteries. And it was like this is just really not the case. 
Hydrogen is a very -- it's #1 in the periodic table. It's got very low density. It's got low density as liquid, like styrofoam-level density as liquid. And then it's only liquid very close to absolute 0. So you have to have a -- it's really not realistic to keep it as liquid. You want to have it as a high-pressure gas that has even lower density. So you need a gigantic fuel tank volumetrically, and it's got to be very high pressure. It's a big pain in the ass basically. 
If somebody is going to say use an ultimate chemical energy storage mechanism to hydrogen, I'd say just use propane or something like that or methane or -- those will be way better than hydrogen. And then having it be a fuel cell just adds even further complications to the situation. It's just crazy basically. 
And we're extremely confident that we could do a long-range trucking with batteries. The math works out. You don't -- if you could just like take, say, what hours per kilogram of currently available cells and say, okay, how much -- what weight would you need to go, let's say, 500 miles and to what degree does that affect your payload and it's like, okay, you could do this. If you do it right, you basically have no effect on your payload or almost nothing, and you can have a long-range truck. 
I mean, Jerome, do you want to add to that?"

Tesla achieved record production deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time. And we've seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and",1190,"Great. Thank you. So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. Tesla achieved record production deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time. And we've seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and our demand is the best we've ever seen. So this is -- we're used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter, and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal in demand in Q1. So Model 3 became the best-selling midsized premier sedan in the world, in fact, I should say the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world. The BMW 3 series was for the longest time the best-selling premium sedan, has been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3. And this is only 3.5 years into production and was just 2 factories. For Model 3 outselling its combustion competitors, I think is quite remarkable. 
In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly 0.25 million Model 3s, so -- which translates to annualized rates of $0.5 million per year. When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world and probably next year. So I'm not 100% certain next year, but I think quite likely. I'd say more likely than not, that in 2022 Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world. 
Then with regard to full self-driving, full self-driving continues to make great progress. But there's definitely one of the -- I think one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that's maybe ever existed. And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, specifically real-world artificial intelligence. And that sort of AI, the needs be compressed into a fairly small computer -- a very efficient computer that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that's using on the order of 70 or 80 watts. So this is a much harder problem than if you were you say 10,000 computers in a server room or something like that. 
This is going to fit into a smallest brain. And -- I think with the elimination of we're finally getting rid of one of the last was really -- it was making up for some of the shortfalls of vision, but this is not good. You actually just need vision to work. And when vision works, it works -- it works better than the best human. It's like having 8 cameras. It's like having eyes in the back of your head, besides you had a 3 eyes of different focal businesses looking forward. This is -- and processing it at a speed that is superhuman. I know there's no question in that with vision solution, we can make a car that is dramatically safer than the average So -- but it is a hard problem because we are actually solving something quite fundamental about artificial intelligence, where we basically have to solve real-world vision AI, and we are. So -- and key to some of this is also having a massive data set. So just having well over 1 million cars on the road that are collecting data from very sort of corner case rare situations -- yes, sort of like so many things in the world like a truck -- carrying a truck or a car with -- one example is like a car as an example, a car with the kayak on the roof where the kayak has a little weight dangling from the front of the kayak in front of the car and the car ingore this and just look at the road. 
So it's really quite tricky, but I am highly confident that we will get this done. So -- yes.  This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage. This is a huge problem. But then in addition to that example, we had quite a difficulty scaling, production in China because we're unable to get critical engineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions. So -- which meant that  worldwide was dependent on drive units made at our factory in So that was a very challenging situation. 
I think we're mostly out of that particular problem. That's just -- this was just 2 of many challenges. So team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chain shortages. So with respect to the Model S and X, there were more challenges than expected in developing the Model S or what we call the program, which is the new version of Model S and X, which has revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics, and has, for example, a station 5 level system. There's just a lot of issues encountered, ensuring that the new factory was, as also were saying was quite energy in a smaller pace. So it took quite a bit of of development to ensure that the battery of the new is safe. And we're trying to get in the cars slowly for the past few months, but we're just stacking them up in the yard and just making refinements to the cars that we built. 
But we do expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering in probably next month. And then to be in sort of fairly high volume production for in Q3 and delivering Model X in Q3 as well. So I think as we ramp up, I think probably the demand for the new will be quite high. So it's really just going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes. So probably, like we're going to aim to produce over 2,000 per week, perhaps if we get lucky, upwards of 2,400 or 2,500. This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here. But I do think these will it's just a matter of time, and then we'll be doing well over 2,000 per week at a car that actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce. But it is a product. 
So the conclusion is there's a lot to be excited about in 2021 and '22. We're going as quickly as we can. Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well, and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year. At this time, we are continuing to ramp production of in Fremont and Shanghai. In the background, we're continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, Roadster and other products. Thanks to everyone at Tesla, who made this year, a huge success. Now on to questions."

To summarize the quarter, I think it's best understood by 3 key items",762,"So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of '21, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons. To summarize the quarter, I think it's best understood by 3 key items: First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the first quarter of and receiving a great reception from the market. Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we have not yet begun customer deliveries. The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit generation. 
For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this program in Q1 and the majority of which is reflected in COGS and that's before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of the transition. And as mentioned -- as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly. Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors and port capacities, the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running. We did experience high expedite costs in the quarter, and they were also higher than they were in Q4 with some minor interruptions to production over the course of the quarter. We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it's an evolving situation. 
If we double-click within net income,  gross margin, excluding credits, improved sequentially and year-over-year. This is in spite of the cost mentions for and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs and as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace. So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as some of these headwinds we're experiencing start to be resolved. 
On services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities to help absorb fixed overheads. On energy gross margins, these remained negative for our second quarter. This is driven by solar-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the PPA business. We continue to manage through a multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall. We're working as fast as we can to increase production. And this will aid in profitability of this business as those volumes increase. 
On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which is driven by our investments in technology and growth, in particular, for R&D, this includes the structural battery pack and cells, investments in the new and our and silicon investments. On the SG&A side, we're setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA in anticipation of volume to come there. And as I said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins. 
Double-clicking on cash flows. We continue to generate positive free cash flows and this was despite the significant working capital headwinds from S and X. Additionally, we are making progress reducing various forms of debt. We also invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin during the quarter, then trimmed our position by 10%, and which contributed to a small gain in our Q1 financials. 
Taking a step back, we've generated $8 billion in operating cash flows and $4 billion in free cash flows over the past 4 quarters. As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-term growth of 50% annually, and believe we're on track to exceed that this year as we guided to last quarter. Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels. And so we're driving as fast as we can to increase our production rates. As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quarters should largely be driven by execution on S and X, as we've discussed, continued ramp of Model Y in Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs. And we expect profitability and cash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements. 
And then as we get towards the end of the year, our story will pivot towards the launch and ramp of our newest factories in Austin and Berlin. So there's certainly no shortage of exciting things for us to work on and look forward to. Thank you, and we'll open it up for questions."

I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company.",692,"So yes, I was just basically saying that the -- although like right now, people think of Tesla has car company or energy company. I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company. I think we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world. Certainly, we appear to be able to use things with full self-driving that others cannot. So if you look at the evolution of what technologies we developed, we developed them in order to solve the problem of self-driving. So we can find a  computer. So we designed and our own. The software out there was really quite primitive for this task. And so we built the team from scratch and have been developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in the world. And then if it makes sense, this is kind of what needs to happen because the road system is designed for a neural net computer, our brain. Our brain is neural net computer. And it's -- the entire road system is designed for vision with neural net computer, which is because it's designed for eyes in the brain. And so if you have a system which has very good eyes, you can see all directions at once, be 3 focal points ahead or forward, but it never gets tired. It's never sort of texting. It has redundancy and its reaction time is super human. Then it seems pretty obvious that, that such a system would achieve an extremely high level of safety, of the average person. That's what we're doing. is kind of the training part of that. So because we're -- we have over 1 million cars, and perhaps next year, we'll have 2 million cars in active use, providing vast amounts of video training data that then needs to be digested by a very powerful training system. And currently, we use Tesla training software. So we developed a lot of training software, a lot of labeling software to do, to do, surround video labeling, which is quite tricky. This means all 8 cameras simultaneously of 36 frames a second per count labeling video over time. There wasn't a tool that existed for this. So we developed our own labeling tool. Then taking it a step further, obviously, the holy grail is auto labeling. So now we're getting quite good at auto labeling, where we do -- we're -- but the trainers train the training system and then the system auto labels the data and the human labels just need to look at the labeling to confirm that it is correct and perhaps make edits. And then every time an edit is made, that's where it trains the system. So it's kind of like a rule. It's just sort of spinning up. And really, the only way to do this is with fast amounts of video data. So then we need to train this efficiently. So is really a -- it is a supercomputer optimized for neural net training. We think will be probably in order of magnitude more efficient on, say, not sure what the exact right metric is, but say, per frame of video, we think it will be an order of magnitude more cost efficiency in hardware and in energy usage for a frame of video compared to a GPU-based solution or compared to the next best solution that we're aware of. 
So then possibly that could be used by others. It does seem as though over time -- I mean just an observation, I think basically just the fact that neural net based computing or AI-based computing is and more and more of the compute stack. We -- conventional perhaps heuristics based computing is going to be important -- still going to be very important.

First of all, I should say that the demand for the Solar Roof remains strong. So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the Solar Roof. So production has gone fine. But we a",1110,"Yes. First of all, I should say that the demand for the Solar Roof remains strong. So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the Solar Roof. So production has gone fine. But we are at the inflation point. We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessing the difficulty of certain roofs, but the complexity of roofs varies dramatically. Some roofs are to be literally 2 or 3x easier than other roofs. So you just can't have a one size fits all situation. If a roof has large or if the roof sort of -- the core structure of the roof is or is it not strong enough to hold the Solar Roof, then the cost can be double, sometimes 3x what we -- what our initial quotes were. So in those cases, what we obviously hope to do is to refund customers their deposit, and -- but what we cannot do is go and just lose an absolute amount of money. We just got to provide a refund of the early deposit. But that's what is I think most important about the Solar Roof situation, which I about this past week is that we're shifting the whole sort of solar situation -- the solar power basically situation to there's only 1 product basically -- or there's only 1 configuration. Every house -- we will not sell a house, solar without a Powerwall. The solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solarglass Roof. But in all cases, it will have the power to  it's actually The plus refers to a higher peak power capability. So basically, all Powerwall made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak power capability than than the specification on the website. They have about twice the power capability roughly. It on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and arguably twice the steady-state power of the specification of the website. The energy the power is roughly double. And all the installations -- so all installations will have a Powerwall. And the difficulty installation will dramatically -- or the difficulty of the installation will be much less. It will be much easier because the power from the Solar Roof -- Solarglass Roof or the solar panels will only ever go directly into the Powerwall. And the Powerwall will only ever go between the utility means -- between the utility and the main power panel of the house, which means you never need to touch the main breakers of the house. You never need to touch the house breakers. Effectively, almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a unique work of art and requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel. 
So this is extremely important for scalability is the only way to do it, really. And this also means that every solar power installation that the house or whatever the case may be, will be its own utility. And so even if all lights go in the neighborhood, you will still have power. So that gives people energy security. And we can also in working with the utilities use the Powerwall to stabilize the overall grid. So let's say that there's a -- like there was in Texas, there was a peak power demand, and the power demand, because the grid lack the ability to buffer the power, they have to shut down power. There's no power storage. No good point on power storage. However, with a whole bunch of Powerwall and houses, we can actually buffer the power. And so if the grid needs more power, we can actually then, with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and the partnership with the utility, we can then actually release power onto the grid to take care of peak power demand. 
So effectively, the Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility. This is profound. I'm not sure how much you actually understand this as this is extremely profound and necessary. Because we are headed towards a world where as we just talked about earlier, where people are moving towards electric vehicles. This will mean that the power needs in -- at homes and businesses will increase significantly. We will -- there will need to be a bunch more electricity coming somewhere. In fact, if you go to full renewable electricity, we need about 3x as much electricity as we currently have. So these are rough numbers, but roughly you need twice -- roughly need twice much electricity if transport goes electric, and they need 3x much electricity if all heating goes electric. So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think both for Tesla and for the utilities. 
Because -- and in fact, I think this will be very -- if this is not done, the utilities will fail to serve their customers. They won't be able to do it. They won't be able to that stuff. And we're going to see more and more of what we see, say, in California and Texas of people seeing and blackouts and utility not being able to respond because there's a massive change going on with the transition to electric transport, and we're seeing more extreme weather events. This is the reported So it is very important to have solar and batteries at the level of the house. In addition, it is important to have large battery storage at the utility level. So that -- solar and wind, which are the main forms of renewable electricity can be -- that electricity can be stored because sometimes the wind doesn't is worthwhile. So that's worth too much but didn't go up. But if you have a battery, you can source the energy and provide the energy to the grid as needed. The same goes for solar because obviously, the sun does not shine at night. And sometimes, it is very cloudy. And so by having battery storage paired with solar and wind, this is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future. And as I said, especially to both at the local level and at the utility level. If it doesn't occur at the local level, what will actually be required is a massive increase in power lines in power plants. So I have to put long distance and local power lines all over the place, they'll have to increase the size of the substations is a nightmare. This must occur. 
There must be solar battery is the only way."

So as I noted in our opening remarks, and we've announced is Tesla did invest $1.5 billion into Bitcoin in Q1, and then we subsequently sold a 10% stake in that. We also allow customers to make vehicle deposits and final vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. And so where our Bitcoin story -- maybe just to share a little bit of context here. Jon and I were looking for a place to store cash that wasn't being immediately used, trying to get some level of return on this, but also preserve liquidity. Particularly as we look forward to the launch of Austin and Berlin and uncertainty that's happening with semiconductors and port capacity, being able to access our cash very quickly is super important to us right now. And there aren't many traditional opportunities to do this or at least that we found and in talking to others that we could get good feedback on, particularly with yields being so low and without taking on additional risk or sacrificing liquidity. And Bitcoin seemed at the time and so far has proven to be a good decision. A good place to play some of our cash that's not immediately being used for daily operations or maybe not needed until the end of the year and be able to get some return on that. And I think one of the key points that I want to make about our experiences in the digital currency space is that there's a lot of reasons to optimistic here. We're certainly watching it very closely at Tesla, watching how the market develops, listening to what our customers are saying. But thinking about it from a corporate treasury perspective, we've been quite pleased with how much liquidity there is in the Bitcoin market. So our ability to build our first position happen quickly. When we did the sale later in March, we also were able to execute on that very quickly. And so as we think about kind of global liquidity for the business in risk management, being able to get cash in and out of the market is something that I think is exceptionally important for us. So we do believe long term in the value of Bitcoin. So it is our intent to hold what we have long term and continue to accumulate Bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles. Specifically with respect to things we may do, there are things that we're constantly discussing. We're not planning to make any announcements here, and we're watching this space closely. So when we're ready to make an announcement on this front, if there's one to come, we'll certainly let you all know."

And what we've learned from that effort was that auto steer not -- could not engage on the road condition that -- as it was designed. Our adaptive cruise control only engage when a driver was buckled in about 5 miles per hour. And it only accelerated to 30 miles per hour distance before the car crashed. As well adaptive fusion control disengage the cars fully to complete to a stop when the driver's seatbelt was unbuckled. Through further investigation of the vehicle and accident remains, we inspected the car with NTSB and and the local police and we're able to find that the steering oil was indeed so they must leading to likelihood that someone was in the driver seat at the time of the crash and all seatbelts post crash were found to be unbundled.

We've got a long way to go before we're dealing with seasonal technology issues. But certainly a way to deal with seasonal technology would be to have wind and solar erring on the side of more latitude. And -- but then across a variety of longitude. So essentially, like let's say, in the U.S., for example, there was -- I'm not sure if you understand that you can actually power the entire United States with just sort of 100 -- roughly a 100 mile -- by 100-mile grid of solar. Some people don't quite understand like, well, how much solar is needed out of the United States. Almost nothing of the [indiscernible] of almost any country in the world. The incident is a gigawatt per square kilometer. This is insane. In fact, you took the clear area, just the area or saying for nuclear power plants, the area that is considered not usable because of a nuclear power plant is there. In most cases, If you just put solar there, it would generate more power than the nuclear power plant because they typically have pretty wide clear areas. So it really -- so if you have, say, 25% efficient solar panels and then those are 80% efficient in how they laid out, you're going to do about 200 megawatts per square kilometer. Therefore 5 kilometer at which might be a typical sort of power plant. It's really not much area at all. And a lot of places can have wind and solar in place. So anyway, it's entirely possible to power all of us with a small percentage of earth's area. And then to transfer that power to high-voltage DC lines, no new technology. No -- you don't need like room temperature superconductors. This another room temperature superconductors. Almost irrelevant, in my opinion, almost irrelevant. Low-cost, long-distance power lines using copper or aluminum very important. So heating is So that's current time of resistance. So as you increase voltage, you can drop the current dramatically and drop the heating dramatically to the point where it is of minor relevance, like maybe you lose 5% to 7% with a high-voltage DC power line, something like that. So I wonder [indiscernible]  We just need to scale this thing up. We -- the technologies exist today to solve renewable energy. And some people will say, well, why don't we do it? That's because the energy basis of the earth is gigantic, super mega and gigantic. So you can't just go and do 1 billion terawatts overnight. You've got to build the production capacity for the cells -- for the battery cells or solar cells. You've got to put that into vehicles, you going to put that storage pack, you've got to solar panels and Solarglass Roof and you've got to deploy all this thing -- all this stuff. But it is certainly the case that we can accelerate this. And we should try to accelerate it. And the right thing to do, I think, from an economic standpoint, I think as an economist to agree is to have a common tax, just as we have a tax on and alcohol, which we think are more likely to be bad than good, and we tend to tax vegetables less. It was the same should be true. We should tax energy that we think is fully bad and support energy think is probably good, just like alcohol versus fruits and vegetables. Just And -- but I guess on the plus side, I'm not suggesting anyone to be complacent, but sustainable energy, renewable energy will be sold. It is being sold, but it matters how fast we sold it. And if we sold it faster, that's better for the world. 
There's no question in my mind, what sort of the energy storage can be sold with the batteries. 0. I want to be clear, 0. I think the buyers will tend to be towards iron-based lithium cells. When we say lithium, I don't think lithium must be a big constitute of the cells. It's more like 1% to 2% if the cell is lithium. But the main part of the cell is cathode. The main mass and in the cells is the cathode. Where high-energy cells like for example, what we use in most have nickel-based lithium-ion cells, which have higher energy density, longer range than iron-based cells. However, stationary storage -- the energy that is not as important because just thinking around. And so I think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron-based lithium-ion cells with an iron phosphate cathode typically. But I think the phosphate part of necessary is or nickel on the terminology. I just think it was iron and nickel. And there's the same amount of iron in the world, more iron than we possible use. And there's also more lithium than we could possibly use. Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron lithium-ion cells."

And our R&D OpEx spend kind of correlates to where we are in the product life cycle on different programs. And so we're kind of at the tail end of investments in what we call internally palladium, which is the new Model S and Model X. And so we expect that to decrease over time, but it was high in Q1 for a lot of the reasons that Eolon have mentioned. We're also getting very heavy into 4680 development that Drew and team are working on and the associated structural battery pack that goes along with that. And so these are new technologies, not only new to Tesla, but new to the industry. And so we're investing heavily there on the R&D side to work out those And spend along in those areas should continue as we continue to work through the development cycle of those. And then I also mentioned Elon talked a bit about and the potential there. So from neural net investments and custom silicon investments, these continue to be areas that we spend on and make investments in. On the SG&A side, the business is pivoting very quickly to be global. And China is ramping quite quickly. And we're trying to make sure that we are staying ahead of the volume, so that we have the right sales capacity, store capacity there, local investments and IT and others to manage the growth such that as the growth comes, the execution challenges are smaller than maybe in similar periods of growth that we've seen in the past. And so we're making investments there ahead of the growth. And overall, as we look at OpEx as a percentage of revenue over the course of the year, we do expect to see a substantial drop from 2020 to 2021 as the volumes in the latter part of the year pickup."

Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time. And we've seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and",1263,"Great. Thank you. So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time. And we've seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and our demand is the best we've ever seen. So this is -- [ we're talking about ] we're used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter, and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in in Q1. 
So Model 3 became the best-selling midsized premier sedan in the world, in fact, I should say the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world. The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time the best-selling premium sedan, has been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3. And this is only 3.5 years into production and was just 2 factories. For Model 3 to be outselling its combustion engine competitors, I think, is quite remarkable. 
In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly 0.25 million Model 3s, so -- which translates to annualized rate of 0.5 million per year. 
When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world and probably next year. So I'm not 100% certain next year, but I think it's quite likely. I'd say more likely than not, that in 2022, Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world. 
Then with regard to Full Self-Driving. Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress. It is definitely one of the -- I think one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that's maybe ever existed. And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, specifically real-world artificial intelligence. And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that's using on the order of 70 or 80 watts. So this is a much harder problem than if you were you, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or something like that. 
This has got to fit into a [ smaller sprain ]. And this -- I think with the elimination of radar, we're finally getting rid of one of the last crutches. Radar was really -- it was making up for some of the shortfalls of vision, but this is not good. You actually just need vision to work. And when [ beam ] works, it works better than the best human because it's like having 8 cameras, it's like having eyes in the back of your head, beside your head and has 3 eyes of different focal distances looking forward. This is -- and processing it at a speed that is superhuman. There's no question in my mind that with a pure vision solution, we can make a car that is dramatically safer than the average [ person ]. 
So -- but it is a hard problem because we are actually solving something quite fundamental about artificial intelligence, where we basically have to solve real-world vision AI. And we are. So -- and key to solving this is also having some massive data set. So just having well over 1 million cars on the road that are collecting data from very sort of corner case rare situations -- sort of like so many weird things in the world like a truck carrying a truck or a car with -- one example is like a car as an actual example, a car with the kayak on the roof where the kayak has a little weight dangling from the front of the kayak in front of the car and -- but yet the car must ignore this and just look at the road. 
So it's really quite tricky, but I am highly confident that we will get this done. So -- yes.  This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage. This is a huge problem. But then in addition to that, for example, we had quite a difficulty scaling, driving our production in China because we're unable to get critical engineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions. So -- which meant that Tesla worldwide was dependent on drive units made at our factory in Nevada, Giga Nevada. So that was a very challenging situation. 
I think we're mostly out of that particular problem. That's just -- those was just 2 of many challenges. So the team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chain shortages. 
So with respect to the Model S and X, there were more challenges than expected in developing the Model S or what we call the Palladium program, which is the new version of Model S and X, which has revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics and has, for example, a PlayStation 5 level infotainment system. There's just a lot of issues encountered, ensuring that the new factory was, [ as also we're saying ] was quite hard because we were working more energy in a smaller pace. So it took quite a bit of of development to ensure that the battery of the new S/X is safe. And we're trying to get all the -- in the cars slowly for the past few months. But we're just stacking them up in the yard and just making refinements to the cars that we built. But we do expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month. And then to be in sort of fairly high volume production for the X in Q3 and start delivering Model X in Q3 as well. 
So I think as we ramp up, I think probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high. So it's really just going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes. So probably, like, we're going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week. Perhaps if we get lucky, upwards of 2,400 or 2,500. This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which is just a lot of factors outside of our control here. But I do think [ these will get solved ], so it's just a matter of time, and then we'll be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week. It's a great car. It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce, but it is a superior product. 
So in conclusion is there's a lot to be excited about in 2021 and '22. We're building factories as quickly as we can. Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well, and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year. At this time, we are continuing to ramp production of Model Y in Fremont and Shanghai. In the background, we're continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, the Roadster and other products. Thanks to everyone at Tesla who made this year a huge success. Now on to questions."

So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of '21, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons. To summarize the quarter, I thin",778,"Yes. Thanks, Martin. Thanks, Elon. So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of '21, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons. 
To summarize the quarter, I think it's best understood by 3 key items. First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market. Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet begun customer deliveries. The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit generation. 
For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority of which is reflected in COGS and that's before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of the transition. And as he mentioned -- as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly. 
Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors and port capacities, while the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in the quarter, and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions to production over the course of the quarter. We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult, and it's an evolving situation. 
If we double-click within net income. Auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved sequentially and year-over-year. This is in spite of the cost mentions for S and X and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace. So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as some of these headwinds we're experiencing start to be resolved. 
On services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb fixed overhead. 
On energy gross margins, these remained negative for second quarter. This is driven by solar-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease PPA business. We continue to manage through a multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall. We're working as fast as we can to increase production. And this will aid in profitability of this business as those volumes increase. 
On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which is driven by our investments in technology and growth. In particular, for R&D, this includes the structural battery pack and 4680 cells, investments in the new S and X and our neural net and silicon investments. 
On the SG&A side, we're setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA in anticipation of volume to come there. And as I said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins. 
Double-clicking on cash flows. We continue to generate positive free cash flows, and this was despite the significant working capital headwinds from S and X. Additionally, we are making progress reducing various forms of debt. We also invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin during the quarter, then trimmed our position by 10%, which contributed to a small gain in our Q1 financials. 
Taking a step back, we've generated $8 billion in operating cash flows and $4 billion in free cash flows over the past 4 quarters. As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-term growth of 50% annually, and we believe we're on track to exceed that this year as we guided to last quarter. Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels. And so we're driving as fast as we can to increase our production rates. As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quarters should largely be driven by execution on S and X, as we've discussed, continued ramp of Model Y in Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs. And we expect profitability and cash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements. 
And then as we get towards the end of the year, our story will pivot towards the launch and ramp of our newest factories in Austin and Berlin. So there's certainly no shortage of exciting things for us to work on and look forward to. Thank you, and we'll open it up for questions."

I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we",731,"So yes, I was just basically saying that the -- although like right now, people think of Tesla as -- a lot will think of Tesla as a car company or as an energy company. I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company. I think we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world. Certainly, we appear to be able to use things with full self-driving that others cannot. So if you look at the evolution of what technologies we developed, we developed them in order to solve the problem of self-driving. So we couldn't find a powerful enough neural net [ in terms of a ] computer. So we designed and built our own. 
The software out there was really quite primitive for this task. And so we built the team from scratch and have been developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in the world. And then it sort makes sense that this is kind of what needs to happen because the road system is designed for a neural net computer, our brain. Our brain is neural net computer. And it's -- the entire road system is designed for vision with a neural net computer, which is because it's designed for eyes in the brain. And so if you have a system which has very good eyes, you can see in all directions at once, you can see 3 focal points ahead or forward, but it never gets tired. It's never sort of texting. It has redundancy and its reaction time is super human. Then it seems pretty obvious that such a system would achieve an extremely high level of safety, far in excess of the average person. 
So that's what we're doing. Then Dojo is kind of the training part of that. So because we're -- we have over 1 million cars, and perhaps next year, we'll have 2 million cars in active use, providing vast amounts of video training data that then needs to be digested by a very powerful training system. And currently, we use Tesla training software. So we developed a lot of training software, a lot of labeling software to do, to able to do surround video labeling, which is quite tricky. This means all 8 cameras simultaneously at 36 range a second per camera labeling video over time. There wasn't any tool that existed for this, so we developed our own labeling tool. 
Then taking it a step further, obviously, the Holy Grail is auto labeling. So now we're getting quite good at auto labeling, where we do -- where -- that the trainers train the training system and then the system auto labels the data and then the human laborers just need to look at the labeling to confirm that it is correct and perhaps make edits. And then every time an edit is made, that further trains the system. So it's kind of like a flywheel that's just sort of spinning up. And really, the only way to do this is with vast amounts of video data. 
So then we need to train this efficiently. So Dojo is really a -- it is a supercomputer optimized for neural net training. We think Dojo will be, probably in order of magnitude, more efficient on, say -- not sure what the exact right metric is, but say, per frame of video, we think it will be an order of magnitude more cost efficient in hardware and in energy usage for a frame of video compared to a GPU-based solution or compared to the next best solution that we're aware of. 
So then possibly that could be used by others. It does seem as though over time -- I mean just an observation, I think basically is the fact that neural net based computing or AI-based computing is and more and more of the compute stack. We -- conventional computing -- well, perhaps heuristics-based computing is still going to be important, still going to be very important, but it will become -- but neural net will become a bigger and bigger portion of compute. So a long story, but I think, yes, probably others will want to use it too, and we will make it available."

First of all, I should say that the demand for the solar roof remains strong. So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the solar roofs. So production is going fine, but we",1159,"Yes. First of all, I should say that the demand for the solar roof remains strong. So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the solar roofs. So production is going fine, but we are [ curbed ] at the installation point. We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessing the difficulty of certain roofs, but the complexity of roofs varies dramatically. Some roofs are to be literally 2 or 3x easier than other roofs. So you just can't have a one-size-fits-all situation. If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if the roof sort of -- the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is it not strong enough to hold the solar roof, then the cost can be double, sometimes 3x what we -- what our initial quotes were. So in those cases, what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit and -- but what we cannot do is go and just lose a massive amount of money. We just got to provide a refund of the early deposit. 
But that's what is, I think, most important about the solar roof situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we're shifting the whole sort of solar situation -- the solar power -- well, basically, solar power situation to there's only 1 product basically -- or there's only 1 configuration. Every house -- we will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall. That solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solarglass Roof. But in all cases, it will have the power to -- technically, this is -- it's actually Powerwall 2 plus, if you will. The plus refers to a higher peak power capability. 
So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak power capability than the specification on the website. They have about twice the power capability roughly. It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about arguably twice the steady-state power of the specification of the website. The energy is the same, but the power is roughly double. And all the installations -- so all installations will have a Powerwall. And the difficulty installation will dramatically -- or the difficulty of the installation will be much less. It will be much easier because the power from the solar roof -- Solarglass Roof or the solar panels will only ever go directly into the Powerwall. And the Powerwall will only ever go between the utility means -- between the utility and the main power panel of the house, which means you never need to touch the main circuit breakers of the house. You never need to touch the house circuit breakers. Effectively, almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a unique work of art and requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel. 
So this is extremely important for scalability is. It's the only way to do it, really. And this also means that every solar Powerwall installation that the house, or whatever the case may be, will be its own utility. And so even if all lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power. So that gives people energy security. 
And we can also, in working with the utilities, use the Powerwalls to stabilize the overall grid. So let's say that there's a -- like there was in Texas, there was a peak power demand, and the power demand, because the grid lacked the ability to buffer the power, they had to shut down power. There's no power storage. No good point on power storage. However, with a whole bunch of Powerwalls and houses, we can actually buffer the power. And so if the grid needs more power, we can actually then, with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and in partnership with the utility, we can then actually release power onto the grid to take care of peak power demand. 
So effectively, the Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility. This is profound. I'm not sure how many of you will actually understand this but this is extremely profound and necessary because we are headed towards a world where, as we were just talking about earlier, where people are moving towards electric vehicles. This will mean that the power needs in -- at homes and businesses will increase significantly. We will -- there will need to be a bunch more electricity coming somewhere. In fact, if you go to full renewable electricity, we need about 3x as much electricity as we currently have. So these are rough numbers, but roughly you need twice -- roughly need twice much electricity if all transport goes electric, and they need 3x much electricity if all heating goes electric. So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think, both for Tesla and for the utilities. 
Because -- and in fact, I think this will be very -- if this is not done, the utilities will fail to serve their customers. They won't be able to do it. They won't be able to react fast enough. And we're going to see more and more of what we see, say, in California and Texas of people seeing brownouts and blackouts and the utilities not being able to respond because there's a massive change going on with the transition to electric transport. And we're seeing more extreme weather events. This is a recipe for disaster. So it is very important to have solar and batteries at the local level, at the house. 
In addition, it is important to have large battery storage at the utility level, so that solar and wind, which are the main forms of renewable electricity, can be -- that electricity can be stored because sometimes the wind doesn't blow, sometimes it blows wide. Sometimes it blows too much and sometimes it didn't blow enough. But if you have a battery, you can store the energy and provide the energy to the grid as needed. The same goes for solar because, obviously, the sun does not shine at night and sometimes it is very cloudy. And so by having battery storage paired with solar and wind, this is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future. 
And as I said, it needs to occur both at the local level and at the utility level. If it doesn't occur at the local level, what will actually be required is a massive increase in power lines in power plants. So they have to put long distance and local power lines all over the place. They'll have to increase the size of the substations, is a nightmare. This must occur. There must be solar plus battery. That's the only way. So yes."

So as I noted in our opening remarks and we've announced previously, so Tesla did invest $1.5 billion into bitcoin in Q1, and then we subsequently sold a 10% stake in that. We also allow customers to make vehicle deposits and final vehicle purchases using bitcoin. And so where our Bitcoin story began, maybe just to share a little bit of context here. Elon and I were looking for a place to store cash that wasn't being immediately used, trying to get some level of return on this, but also preserve liquidity. Particularly as we look forward to the launch of Austin and Berlin and uncertainty that's happening with semiconductors and port capacity, being able to access our cash very quickly is super important to us right now. And there aren't many traditional opportunities to do this or at least that we found and in talking to others that we could get good feedback on, particularly with yields being so low and without taking on additional risk or sacrificing liquidity. And Bitcoin seemed at the time and so far has proven to be a good decision. A good place to place some of our cash that's not immediately being used for daily operations or maybe not needed till the end of the year and be able to get some return on that. 
And I think one of the key points that I want to make about our experiences in the digital currency space is that there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic here. We're certainly watching it very closely at Tesla, watching how the market develops, listening to what our customers are saying. But thinking about it from a corporate treasury perspective, we've been quite pleased with how much liquidity there is in the bitcoin market. So our ability to build our first position happened quickly. When we did the sale later in March, we also were able to execute on that very quickly. 
And so as we think about kind of global liquidity for the business in risk management, being able to get cash in and out of the market is something that I think is exceptionally important for us. So we do believe long term in the value of bitcoin. So it is our intent to hold what we have long term and continue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles. 
Specifically with respect to things we may do, there are things that we're constantly discussing. We're not planning to make any announcements here, and we're watching this space closely. So when we're ready to make an announcement on this front, if there's one to come, we'll certainly let you all know."

In that vein, we did a study with them over the past week to understand what happened in that particular crash. And what we've learned from that effort was that Autosteer did not and could not engage on the road condition that -- as it was designed. Our adaptive cruise control only engage when a driver was buckled in about 5 miles per hour. And it only accelerated to 30 miles per hour with the distance before the car crashed. As well adaptive cruise control disengage the cars fully to complete to a stop when the driver's seatbelt was unbuckled. Through further investigation of the vehicle and accident remains, we inspected the car with NTSB and NHTSA and the local police and were able to find that the steering wheel was indeed deformed so there must -- leading to a likelihood that someone was in the driver's seat at the time of the crash and all seatbelts post crash were found to be unbuckled. We're unable to recover the data from the SD card at the time of impact, but the local authorities are working on doing that, and we await their report.

We've got a long way to go before we're dealing with seasonal technology issues. But certainly a way to deal with seasonal technology would be to have wind and solar erring on the side of more [ sublay ] latitude and -- but then across a variety of longitude. So essentially, like let's say, in the U.S., for example, if there was a -- I'm not sure if you'll understand this, you can actually power the entire United States with just sort of 100 -- roughly a 100-mile -- by a 100-mile grid of solar. Some people don't quite understand like, well, how much solar is needed to power the United States. Almost nothing of the [indiscernible] of almost any country in the world. 
The solar incident is a gigawatt per square kilometer. This is insane. In fact, you took the clear area, just the area or saying for nuclear power plants, the area that is considered not usable because of a nuclear power plant is there, in most cases, if you just put solar there, it would generate more power than the nuclear power plant because they typically have pretty wide clear areas. So it really -- so if you have, say, 25% efficient solar panels and then those are 80% efficient in how they laid out, you're going to do about 200 megawatts per square kilometer. Therefore, [ 5 straight ] kilometers is a gigawatt, which might be a typical sort of power plant. It's really not much area at all. And a lot of places can have wind and solar in place. 
So anyway, it's entirely possible to power all of earth with a small percentage of earth's area. And then to transfer that power through high-voltage DC lines with no new technology. No -- you don't need like room temperature superconductors. This another room temperature superconductors. This is a total -- also another myth. Room temperature superconductors, almost irrelevant, in my opinion, almost irrelevant. Low-cost, long-distance power lines using copper or aluminum is very important. So heating is [ ice where are ]. So that's current square type of resistance. So as you increase voltage, you can drop the current dramatically and drop the heating dramatically to the point where it is of minor relevance, like maybe you lose 5% to 7% with a high-voltage DC power line, something like that. 
So I want to be clear. [indiscernible] no new materials are necessary. We just need to scale this thing up. We -- the technologies exist today to solve renewable energy. And some people will say, well, why don't we do it? That's because the energy basis of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanely gigantic. So you can't just go and do 1 zillion terawatts overnight. You've got to build the production capacity for the cells, for the battery cells, for the solar cells. You've got to put that into vehicles. You've got to put that into [indiscernible] storage packs. You've got to put that into solar panels and Solarglass Roofs, and you've got to deploy all this thing -- all this stuff. 
But it is certainly the case that we can accelerate this. And we should try to accelerate it. And the right thing to do, I think, from an economic standpoint, and I think an economist to agree is to have a common tax, just as we have a tax on cigarettes and alcohol, which we think are more likely to be bad than good, and we tend to tax fruit and vegetables less. It was the same should be true. We should tax energy that we think is probably bad and support energy we think is probably good, just like cigarettes and alcohol versus fruits and vegetables. This is common sense. 
And -- but I guess on the plus side, I'm not suggesting anyone be complacent. But sustainable energy, renewable energy will be sold, it is being sold, but it matters how fast we sold it. And if we sold it faster, that's better for the world. There's no question in my mind whatsoever that the energy storage problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero. I want to be clear, zero. 
I think the bias will tend to be towards iron-based lithium-ion cells. When we say lithium-ion, you will think lithium must be a big constituent of the cells. It's more like 1% to 2% of the cell is lithium. But the main part of the cell is the cathode, the main mass and cost in the cells is the cathode. For high-energy cells, like for example, what we use in most -- most Teslas have nickel-based lithium-ion cells, which have higher energy density, longer range than iron-based cells. However, stationary storage, the energy density is not as important because it's just staying on the ground. And so I think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron-based lithium-ion cells with an iron phosphate cathode technically. But I think the phosphate part is unnecessary, so is the iron ore nickel. I'm destroying the terminology. Just think of it as iron and nickel. And there's an insane amount of iron in the world, more iron than we could possible use. And there's also more lithium than we could possibly use. Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron plus base lithium-ion cells."

One of the things we'll need to keep an eye on is a potential transition from cash purchases of FSD subscription over to -- or cash purchases of FSD who may move over to FSD subscription. And so there could be a period of time in which cash reduces in the near term and then as the portfolio of subscription customers builds up, then that becomes a pretty strong business for us over time.

And our R&D OpEx spend kind of correlates to where we are in the product life cycle on different programs. And so we're kind of at the tail end of investments in, what we call internally Palladium, which is the new Model S and Model X. And so we expect that to decrease over time, but it was high in Q1 for a lot of the reasons that Elon had mentioned. 
We're also getting very heavy into 4680 development that Drew and team are working on and the associated structural battery pack that goes along with that. And so these are new technologies, not only new to Tesla, but new to the industry. And so we're investing heavily there on an R&D side to work out those kinks. And spend along in those areas should continue over time as we continue to work through the development cycle of those. 
And then I also mentioned Elon talked a bit about Dojo and the potential there. So from neural net investments and custom silicon investments, these continue to be areas that we spend on and make investments in. 
On the SG&A side, the business is pivoting very quickly to be global. And China is ramping quite quickly. And we're trying to make sure that we are staying ahead of the volume so that we have the right sales capacity, store capacity there, local investments and IT and others to manage the growth, such that as the growth comes, the execution challenges are smaller than maybe in similar periods of growth that we've seen in the past. And so we're making investments there ahead of the growth.

Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time. And we've seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and",1263,"Great. Thank you. So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time. And we've seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and our demand is the best we've ever seen. So this is -- [ we're talking about ] we're used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter, and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in in Q1. 
So Model 3 became the best-selling midsized premier sedan in the world, in fact, I should say the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world. The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time the best-selling premium sedan, has been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3. And this is only 3.5 years into production and was just 2 factories. For Model 3 to be outselling its combustion engine competitors, I think, is quite remarkable. 
In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly 0.25 million Model 3s, so -- which translates to annualized rate of 0.5 million per year. 
When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world and probably next year. So I'm not 100% certain next year, but I think it's quite likely. I'd say more likely than not, that in 2022, Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world. 
Then with regard to Full Self-Driving. Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress. It is definitely one of the -- I think one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that's maybe ever existed. And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, specifically real-world artificial intelligence. And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that's using on the order of 70 or 80 watts. So this is a much harder problem than if you were you, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or something like that. 
This has got to fit into a [ smaller sprain ]. And this -- I think with the elimination of radar, we're finally getting rid of one of the last crutches. Radar was really -- it was making up for some of the shortfalls of vision, but this is not good. You actually just need vision to work. And when [ beam ] works, it works better than the best human because it's like having 8 cameras, it's like having eyes in the back of your head, beside your head and has 3 eyes of different focal distances looking forward. This is -- and processing it at a speed that is superhuman. There's no question in my mind that with a pure vision solution, we can make a car that is dramatically safer than the average [ person ]. 
So -- but it is a hard problem because we are actually solving something quite fundamental about artificial intelligence, where we basically have to solve real-world vision AI. And we are. So -- and key to solving this is also having some massive data set. So just having well over 1 million cars on the road that are collecting data from very sort of corner case rare situations -- sort of like so many weird things in the world like a truck carrying a truck or a car with -- one example is like a car as an actual example, a car with the kayak on the roof where the kayak has a little weight dangling from the front of the kayak in front of the car and -- but yet the car must ignore this and just look at the road. 
So it's really quite tricky, but I am highly confident that we will get this done. So -- yes.  This quarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage. This is a huge problem. But then in addition to that, for example, we had quite a difficulty scaling, driving our production in China because we're unable to get critical engineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions. So -- which meant that Tesla worldwide was dependent on drive units made at our factory in Nevada, Giga Nevada. So that was a very challenging situation. 
I think we're mostly out of that particular problem. That's just -- those was just 2 of many challenges. So the team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chain shortages. 
So with respect to the Model S and X, there were more challenges than expected in developing the Model S or what we call the Palladium program, which is the new version of Model S and X, which has revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics and has, for example, a PlayStation 5 level infotainment system. There's just a lot of issues encountered, ensuring that the new factory was, [ as also we're saying ] was quite hard because we were working more energy in a smaller pace. So it took quite a bit of of development to ensure that the battery of the new S/X is safe. And we're trying to get all the -- in the cars slowly for the past few months. But we're just stacking them up in the yard and just making refinements to the cars that we built. But we do expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month. And then to be in sort of fairly high volume production for the X in Q3 and start delivering Model X in Q3 as well. 
So I think as we ramp up, I think probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high. So it's really just going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes. So probably, like, we're going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week. Perhaps if we get lucky, upwards of 2,400 or 2,500. This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which is just a lot of factors outside of our control here. But I do think [ these will get solved ], so it's just a matter of time, and then we'll be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week. It's a great car. It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce, but it is a superior product. 
So in conclusion is there's a lot to be excited about in 2021 and '22. We're building factories as quickly as we can. Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well, and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year. At this time, we are continuing to ramp production of Model Y in Fremont and Shanghai. In the background, we're continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, the Roadster and other products. Thanks to everyone at Tesla who made this year a huge success. Now on to questions."

So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of '21, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons. To summarize the quarter, I thin",778,"Yes. Thanks, Martin. Thanks, Elon. So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of '21, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons. 
To summarize the quarter, I think it's best understood by 3 key items. First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market. Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet begun customer deliveries. The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit generation. 
For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority of which is reflected in COGS and that's before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of the transition. And as he mentioned -- as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly. 
Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors and port capacities, while the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in the quarter, and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions to production over the course of the quarter. We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult, and it's an evolving situation. 
If we double-click within net income. Auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved sequentially and year-over-year. This is in spite of the cost mentions for S and X and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace. So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as some of these headwinds we're experiencing start to be resolved. 
On services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb fixed overhead. 
On energy gross margins, these remained negative for second quarter. This is driven by solar-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease PPA business. We continue to manage through a multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall. We're working as fast as we can to increase production. And this will aid in profitability of this business as those volumes increase. 
On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which is driven by our investments in technology and growth. In particular, for R&D, this includes the structural battery pack and 4680 cells, investments in the new S and X and our neural net and silicon investments. 
On the SG&A side, we're setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA in anticipation of volume to come there. And as I said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins. 
Double-clicking on cash flows. We continue to generate positive free cash flows, and this was despite the significant working capital headwinds from S and X. Additionally, we are making progress reducing various forms of debt. We also invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin during the quarter, then trimmed our position by 10%, which contributed to a small gain in our Q1 financials. 
Taking a step back, we've generated $8 billion in operating cash flows and $4 billion in free cash flows over the past 4 quarters. As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-term growth of 50% annually, and we believe we're on track to exceed that this year as we guided to last quarter. Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels. And so we're driving as fast as we can to increase our production rates. As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quarters should largely be driven by execution on S and X, as we've discussed, continued ramp of Model Y in Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs. And we expect profitability and cash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements. 
And then as we get towards the end of the year, our story will pivot towards the launch and ramp of our newest factories in Austin and Berlin. So there's certainly no shortage of exciting things for us to work on and look forward to. Thank you, and we'll open it up for questions."

I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we",731,"So yes, I was just basically saying that the -- although like right now, people think of Tesla as -- a lot will think of Tesla as a car company or as an energy company. I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company. I think we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world. Certainly, we appear to be able to use things with full self-driving that others cannot. So if you look at the evolution of what technologies we developed, we developed them in order to solve the problem of self-driving. So we couldn't find a powerful enough neural net [ in terms of a ] computer. So we designed and built our own. 
The software out there was really quite primitive for this task. And so we built the team from scratch and have been developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in the world. And then it sort makes sense that this is kind of what needs to happen because the road system is designed for a neural net computer, our brain. Our brain is neural net computer. And it's -- the entire road system is designed for vision with a neural net computer, which is because it's designed for eyes in the brain. And so if you have a system which has very good eyes, you can see in all directions at once, you can see 3 focal points ahead or forward, but it never gets tired. It's never sort of texting. It has redundancy and its reaction time is super human. Then it seems pretty obvious that such a system would achieve an extremely high level of safety, far in excess of the average person. 
So that's what we're doing. Then Dojo is kind of the training part of that. So because we're -- we have over 1 million cars, and perhaps next year, we'll have 2 million cars in active use, providing vast amounts of video training data that then needs to be digested by a very powerful training system. And currently, we use Tesla training software. So we developed a lot of training software, a lot of labeling software to do, to able to do surround video labeling, which is quite tricky. This means all 8 cameras simultaneously at 36 range a second per camera labeling video over time. There wasn't any tool that existed for this, so we developed our own labeling tool. 
Then taking it a step further, obviously, the Holy Grail is auto labeling. So now we're getting quite good at auto labeling, where we do -- where -- that the trainers train the training system and then the system auto labels the data and then the human laborers just need to look at the labeling to confirm that it is correct and perhaps make edits. And then every time an edit is made, that further trains the system. So it's kind of like a flywheel that's just sort of spinning up. And really, the only way to do this is with vast amounts of video data. 
So then we need to train this efficiently. So Dojo is really a -- it is a supercomputer optimized for neural net training. We think Dojo will be, probably in order of magnitude, more efficient on, say -- not sure what the exact right metric is, but say, per frame of video, we think it will be an order of magnitude more cost efficient in hardware and in energy usage for a frame of video compared to a GPU-based solution or compared to the next best solution that we're aware of. 
So then possibly that could be used by others. It does seem as though over time -- I mean just an observation, I think basically is the fact that neural net based computing or AI-based computing is and more and more of the compute stack. We -- conventional computing -- well, perhaps heuristics-based computing is still going to be important, still going to be very important, but it will become -- but neural net will become a bigger and bigger portion of compute. So a long story, but I think, yes, probably others will want to use it too, and we will make it available."

First of all, I should say that the demand for the solar roof remains strong. So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the solar roofs. So production is going fine, but we",1159,"Yes. First of all, I should say that the demand for the solar roof remains strong. So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the solar roofs. So production is going fine, but we are [ curbed ] at the installation point. We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessing the difficulty of certain roofs, but the complexity of roofs varies dramatically. Some roofs are to be literally 2 or 3x easier than other roofs. So you just can't have a one-size-fits-all situation. If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if the roof sort of -- the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is it not strong enough to hold the solar roof, then the cost can be double, sometimes 3x what we -- what our initial quotes were. So in those cases, what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit and -- but what we cannot do is go and just lose a massive amount of money. We just got to provide a refund of the early deposit. 
But that's what is, I think, most important about the solar roof situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we're shifting the whole sort of solar situation -- the solar power -- well, basically, solar power situation to there's only 1 product basically -- or there's only 1 configuration. Every house -- we will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall. That solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solarglass Roof. But in all cases, it will have the power to -- technically, this is -- it's actually Powerwall 2 plus, if you will. The plus refers to a higher peak power capability. 
So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak power capability than the specification on the website. They have about twice the power capability roughly. It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about arguably twice the steady-state power of the specification of the website. The energy is the same, but the power is roughly double. And all the installations -- so all installations will have a Powerwall. And the difficulty installation will dramatically -- or the difficulty of the installation will be much less. It will be much easier because the power from the solar roof -- Solarglass Roof or the solar panels will only ever go directly into the Powerwall. And the Powerwall will only ever go between the utility means -- between the utility and the main power panel of the house, which means you never need to touch the main circuit breakers of the house. You never need to touch the house circuit breakers. Effectively, almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a unique work of art and requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel. 
So this is extremely important for scalability is. It's the only way to do it, really. And this also means that every solar Powerwall installation that the house, or whatever the case may be, will be its own utility. And so even if all lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power. So that gives people energy security. 
And we can also, in working with the utilities, use the Powerwalls to stabilize the overall grid. So let's say that there's a -- like there was in Texas, there was a peak power demand, and the power demand, because the grid lacked the ability to buffer the power, they had to shut down power. There's no power storage. No good point on power storage. However, with a whole bunch of Powerwalls and houses, we can actually buffer the power. And so if the grid needs more power, we can actually then, with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and in partnership with the utility, we can then actually release power onto the grid to take care of peak power demand. 
So effectively, the Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility. This is profound. I'm not sure how many of you will actually understand this but this is extremely profound and necessary because we are headed towards a world where, as we were just talking about earlier, where people are moving towards electric vehicles. This will mean that the power needs in -- at homes and businesses will increase significantly. We will -- there will need to be a bunch more electricity coming somewhere. In fact, if you go to full renewable electricity, we need about 3x as much electricity as we currently have. So these are rough numbers, but roughly you need twice -- roughly need twice much electricity if all transport goes electric, and they need 3x much electricity if all heating goes electric. So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think, both for Tesla and for the utilities. 
Because -- and in fact, I think this will be very -- if this is not done, the utilities will fail to serve their customers. They won't be able to do it. They won't be able to react fast enough. And we're going to see more and more of what we see, say, in California and Texas of people seeing brownouts and blackouts and the utilities not being able to respond because there's a massive change going on with the transition to electric transport. And we're seeing more extreme weather events. This is a recipe for disaster. So it is very important to have solar and batteries at the local level, at the house. 
In addition, it is important to have large battery storage at the utility level, so that solar and wind, which are the main forms of renewable electricity, can be -- that electricity can be stored because sometimes the wind doesn't blow, sometimes it blows wide. Sometimes it blows too much and sometimes it didn't blow enough. But if you have a battery, you can store the energy and provide the energy to the grid as needed. The same goes for solar because, obviously, the sun does not shine at night and sometimes it is very cloudy. And so by having battery storage paired with solar and wind, this is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future. 
And as I said, it needs to occur both at the local level and at the utility level. If it doesn't occur at the local level, what will actually be required is a massive increase in power lines in power plants. So they have to put long distance and local power lines all over the place. They'll have to increase the size of the substations, is a nightmare. This must occur. There must be solar plus battery. That's the only way. So yes."

So as I noted in our opening remarks and we've announced previously, so Tesla did invest $1.5 billion into bitcoin in Q1, and then we subsequently sold a 10% stake in that. We also allow customers to make vehicle deposits and final vehicle purchases using bitcoin. And so where our Bitcoin story began, maybe just to share a little bit of context here. Elon and I were looking for a place to store cash that wasn't being immediately used, trying to get some level of return on this, but also preserve liquidity. Particularly as we look forward to the launch of Austin and Berlin and uncertainty that's happening with semiconductors and port capacity, being able to access our cash very quickly is super important to us right now. And there aren't many traditional opportunities to do this or at least that we found and in talking to others that we could get good feedback on, particularly with yields being so low and without taking on additional risk or sacrificing liquidity. And Bitcoin seemed at the time and so far has proven to be a good decision. A good place to place some of our cash that's not immediately being used for daily operations or maybe not needed till the end of the year and be able to get some return on that. 
And I think one of the key points that I want to make about our experiences in the digital currency space is that there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic here. We're certainly watching it very closely at Tesla, watching how the market develops, listening to what our customers are saying. But thinking about it from a corporate treasury perspective, we've been quite pleased with how much liquidity there is in the bitcoin market. So our ability to build our first position happened quickly. When we did the sale later in March, we also were able to execute on that very quickly. 
And so as we think about kind of global liquidity for the business in risk management, being able to get cash in and out of the market is something that I think is exceptionally important for us. So we do believe long term in the value of bitcoin. So it is our intent to hold what we have long term and continue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles. 
Specifically with respect to things we may do, there are things that we're constantly discussing. We're not planning to make any announcements here, and we're watching this space closely. So when we're ready to make an announcement on this front, if there's one to come, we'll certainly let you all know."

In that vein, we did a study with them over the past week to understand what happened in that particular crash. And what we've learned from that effort was that Autosteer did not and could not engage on the road condition that -- as it was designed. Our adaptive cruise control only engage when a driver was buckled in about 5 miles per hour. And it only accelerated to 30 miles per hour with the distance before the car crashed. As well adaptive cruise control disengage the cars fully to complete to a stop when the driver's seatbelt was unbuckled. Through further investigation of the vehicle and accident remains, we inspected the car with NTSB and NHTSA and the local police and were able to find that the steering wheel was indeed deformed so there must -- leading to a likelihood that someone was in the driver's seat at the time of the crash and all seatbelts post crash were found to be unbuckled. We're unable to recover the data from the SD card at the time of impact, but the local authorities are working on doing that, and we await their report.

Some people don't quite understand like, well, how much solar is needed to power the United States. Almost nothing of the [indiscernible] of almost any country in the world. 
The solar incident is a gigawatt per square kilometer. This is insane. In fact, you took the clear area, just the area or saying for nuclear power plants, the area that is considered not usable because of a nuclear power plant is there, in most cases, if you just put solar there, it would generate more power than the nuclear power plant because they typically have pretty wide clear areas. So it really -- so if you have, say, 25% efficient solar panels and then those are 80% efficient in how they laid out, you're going to do about 200 megawatts per square kilometer. Therefore, [ 5 straight ] kilometers is a gigawatt, which might be a typical sort of power plant. It's really not much area at all. And a lot of places can have wind and solar in place. 
So anyway, it's entirely possible to power all of earth with a small percentage of earth's area. And then to transfer that power through high-voltage DC lines with no new technology. No -- you don't need like room temperature superconductors. This another room temperature superconductors. This is a total -- also another myth. Room temperature superconductors, almost irrelevant, in my opinion, almost irrelevant. Low-cost, long-distance power lines using copper or aluminum is very important. So heating is [ ice where are ]. So that's current square type of resistance. So as you increase voltage, you can drop the current dramatically and drop the heating dramatically to the point where it is of minor relevance, like maybe you lose 5% to 7% with a high-voltage DC power line, something like that. 
So I want to be clear. [indiscernible] no new materials are necessary. We just need to scale this thing up. We -- the technologies exist today to solve renewable energy. And some people will say, well, why don't we do it? That's because the energy basis of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanely gigantic. So you can't just go and do 1 zillion terawatts overnight. You've got to build the production capacity for the cells, for the battery cells, for the solar cells. You've got to put that into vehicles. You've got to put that into [indiscernible] storage packs. You've got to put that into solar panels and Solarglass Roofs, and you've got to deploy all this thing -- all this stuff. 
But it is certainly the case that we can accelerate this. And we should try to accelerate it. And the right thing to do, I think, from an economic standpoint, and I think an economist to agree is to have a common tax, just as we have a tax on cigarettes and alcohol, which we think are more likely to be bad than good, and we tend to tax fruit and vegetables less. It was the same should be true. We should tax energy that we think is probably bad and support energy we think is probably good, just like cigarettes and alcohol versus fruits and vegetables. This is common sense. 
And -- but I guess on the plus side, I'm not suggesting anyone be complacent. But sustainable energy, renewable energy will be sold, it is being sold, but it matters how fast we sold it. And if we sold it faster, that's better for the world. There's no question in my mind whatsoever that the energy storage problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero. I want to be clear, zero. 
I think the bias will tend to be towards iron-based lithium-ion cells. When we say lithium-ion, you will think lithium must be a big constituent of the cells. It's more like 1% to 2% of the cell is lithium. But the main part of the cell is the cathode, the main mass and cost in the cells is the cathode. For high-energy cells, like for example, what we use in most -- most Teslas have nickel-based lithium-ion cells, which have higher energy density, longer range than iron-based cells. However, stationary storage, the energy density is not as important because it's just staying on the ground. And so I think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron-based lithium-ion cells with an iron phosphate cathode technically. But I think the phosphate part is unnecessary, so is the iron ore nickel. I'm destroying the terminology. Just think of it as iron and nickel. And there's an insane amount of iron in the world, more iron than we could possible use. And there's also more lithium than we could possibly use. Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron plus base lithium-ion cells."

I mean the thing to bear in mind with production is -- for those who've never done production, they just don't understand how insanely hard production is. I want to really be very, very emphatic here. Prototypes are trivial, they're child's play. Production is hard, is very hard. Now you say production at large scale with higher liability and low cost, insanely difficult. But Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car. The truly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the first American car company to achieve volume production of a car in 100 years and not go bankrupt. 
So this is -- this -- basically, myself and many others at Tesla had to basically have several aneurysms to get this done. It was so hard to have no idea. So anyway -- and the thing about making a large complex manufacturing object is, let's say you have first-order approximation, 10,000 unique items. And even one of those items is slow, that says you wait, just one. Doesn't matter how -- so trivial. We've had production stop because of carpet in the trunk. We've had production stop because of a USB cable. At one point, for Model S, the -- we literally raided every electronics store in the Bay Area. For a few days there, nobody could buy a USB cable in the Bay Area because we went and bought them all to put them in the car, literally. 
And there's like hundreds of stories like that. So anyway, that -- solving that -- those constraints and a logistics problem that makes World War II look trivial. I'm not kidding. Like the scale is insane. We're talking millions of cars, massive global supply chain, 50 countries, dozens of regulatory regimes. It's insane. So yes."

One of the things we'll need to keep an eye on is a potential transition from cash purchases of FSD subscription over to -- or cash purchases of FSD who may move over to FSD subscription.

We achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed over $1 billion in GAAP net income for the first time in Tesla history. I'd really like to congratulate everyone at Tesla for an amazin",1283,"Sure. So to recap, Q2 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. We achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed over $1 billion in GAAP net income for the first time in Tesla history. I'd really like to congratulate everyone at Tesla for an amazing job. This is really an incredible milestone. 
It also seems that public sentiment towards EVs is at an inflection point. And at this point, I think almost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward. Regarding supply chain, while we're making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious. For the rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain, which is there are a wide range of chips that are, at various times, the slowest parts of the supply chain. 
I mean, it's worth noting that if we had everything else, if we had vast numbers of vehicles themselves, we would not be able to make them -- if everything, except the chips, we wouldn't be able to make them. The chip supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output. It is difficult for us to see how long this will last because we don't have -- this is out of our control essentially. It does seem like it's getting better but it's hard to predict. 
So in fact, even achieving the output that we did achieve was only due to an immense effort from people within Tesla. We were able to substitute alternative chips and then write the firmware in a matter of weeks. It's not just a matter of swapping out a chip, you also have to rewrite the software. So it was an incredibly intense effort of finding new chips, writing new firmware, integrating with the vehicle and testing in order to maintain production. 
And I'd also like to thank our suppliers who work with us. And there have been many calls at midnight, 1 a.m., just with suppliers but -- in resolving a lot of the shortages. So thanks very much to our suppliers. 
Let's see, in terms of FSD subscription, we were able to launch Full Self-Driving subscription last month. And we expect it to build slowly and -- but then gather a lot of momentum over time. Obviously, we need to have the Full-Self Driving build widely available for it really to take off at high rates and making a lot of progress there. So yes, I think FSD subscription will be a significant factor probably next year. 
With regard to Giga Texas and Giga Berlin, we're actually doing this earnings call from Giga Texas, so we're in the factory right now doing this earnings call. And the team has made incredible progress here. You can see the pictures online and see that there's basically nothing a year ago and this mostly complete large factory a year later. So it's really great work by the Giga Texas team. And then also great work in Berlin [indiscernible] with the team there. 
So we expect to be producing the sort of new design of the Model Y in both factories and limited production later this year. It's always like -- it's not -- it's hard to sort of explain to people who have not been through the agony of a manufacturing ramp, like why can't you just turn it on and make 5,000 a week? This is -- it is so hard to do manufacturing. It is so hard to do production. At gross approximation, there are 10,000 unique parts and processes that have to work. And the greater growth of production goes as fast as the least lucky and dumbest of those 10,000 things, and a bunch of them are not even in our control. So I think it's like -- it's insanely difficult. 
I'm fond of saying that prototypes are easy and production is hard. And arguably, the really remarkable thing that Tesla's done is not to make an electric car or to be a car start-up because there have been hundreds of car start-ups in the United States and outside United States. So the thing that's remarkable is that Tesla didn't go bankrupt in reaching volume production. That's the amazing part because everyone else did, because they all got the prototype or the idea was the hard part and it is not. It is trivial by comparison with actual production. 
So it's always worth noting that of all the American car companies, there are only 2 that have not gone bankrupt and that is Ford and Tesla. So the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory and we must be careful that we do not do that. So often, if you look at history, so often, the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory. We will endeavor not to make that the case of Tesla. 
So let's see, the model lines in Texas and mainly, Texas and Berlin, will be -- will look very much like the Model Ys we currently make, but there are substantial improvements in the difficulty of manufacturing. So for example, the Model Y made here and in Berlin will have a cast body and a case body, whereas the 1 in California has a cast-rear body but not a cast-front body. We're also aiming to do a structural pack with [ 4680s ] cells, which is a mass reduction and a cost reduction. 
But we're not counting on that as the only way to make things work. We have some backup plan with nonstructural -- with a nonstructural pack and 2170s essentially. But at scale production, we obviously want to be using 4680s and a structural pack. From a physics standpoint, this is the best architecture. And from an economic standpoint, it is the lowest cost way to go. So the life is lowest cost. 
But there's a lot of new technology there so it is difficult to predict with precision. When does it work? And when do you reach scale production? And Drew's going to talk a bit more about the 4680 production. Yes. So we're all making great progress on the 4680 cells, but there is a tremendous amount of innovation that we're packing into that 4680 cells. And so it's not simply a sort of minor improvement on state-of-the-art. There are -- and we went through this on the Battery Cell Day, really dozens of -- half a dozen major improvements and dozens of small improvements. So I think it will be great, but it's difficult to say when the last of the technical challenges will be solved. 
So in conclusion, our team continues to make huge efforts to make our factories run at full speed, which is very difficult. We have had some factory shutdowns due to partial outages, and we hope those will be relieved in the coming weeks and months. And we're making great progress on Full Self-Driving. Some of the progress is not easy to see because it is at a foundational software level, and so that ends up being sort of 2 steps forward, 1 step back situation. And -- but over time, you do 2 steps forward and 1 step back and keep going, you do move forward. 
So I'm highly confident that the cars will be capable of full self-driving. They have a full self-driving computer and the cameras, I'm confident that they will be able to themselves with the safety level substantially greater than that of the average post. Once again, thanks to all of our employees who are making this a breakthrough year for Tesla and an incredible quarter. Thanks, guys."

Just to reiterate, Q2 was a great quarter for the Tesla team with strong improvements across the business. In particular, auto gross profit and margin, excluding credit, increased substantially. This was primarily dr",574,"Yes. Thanks, Martin, and thanks, Elon. Just to reiterate, Q2 was a great quarter for the Tesla team with strong improvements across the business. In particular, auto gross profit and margin, excluding credit, increased substantially. This was primarily driven by better cost optimization across our factories, good execution against our cost reduction plans as well as increases in production and delivery volumes. 
There was some benefit from pricing actions mostly in North America. However, it was small in the context of the other contributors. Note that the Model S and X program was at a slight loss for the quarter due to the relatively low volume. 
In supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds. Additionally, it's encouraging to see the progress made on profitability within our energy and services and other businesses. While there's some benefit to looking at our progress quarter-over-quarter, I find it more helpful to look at progress over a slightly long-term horizon. Over the last 2 years, our vehicle delivery volumes have more than doubled. This volume increase was made possible by a steady decrease in ASPs of more than 10%, driven by our road map to increase affordability and shifting mix towards our more affordable vehicles. 
Yet over that same period of time, our auto gross margin, excluding credit, has increased nearly 10 percentage points to our highest yet since the introduction of Model 3. This is only possible because our average cost per vehicle has reduced by more than the reduction in average price. This is a remarkable achievement in the context of the volume growth and ASP reduction, as mentioned, and a testament to the hard work by the Tesla team. 
Additionally, OpEx as a percentage of revenue has declined and in particular, SG&A, representing the work we've done to become more efficient as we scale the company while still making the required R&D investments to support our future. As a result, our GAAP operating margins have risen from negative to double digit in line with what we have guided. By managing our overhead costs and driving higher volumes, our P&L is benefiting from the marginal profitability of each incremental unit or, said differently, we are recognizing the benefits of scale and improved fixed cost absorption. 
With strong operating cash flows and cash balance, we are putting that cash to use. CapEx continues to tick up, primarily driven by capacity investments in Austin, Berlin and Shanghai. Additionally, each quarter, we are using our cash to retire legacy debt, which was taken on at a time when interest rates and company risks were much higher than in today's environment. 
As I've mentioned before, our 2021 volumes will skew towards the second half of the year as we push for continued sequential increases in volume. Despite the great work so far managing the instability of the supply chain, these challenges remain and are unfortunately increasing in [ pain ] with a higher volume. As we work through the uncertainty, we want to ensure we do our best to manage customer wait times as well as the impact these interruptions have on our employees and costs. 
And as Elon mentioned, volume growth will be determined by part availability as we have the factory capacity ready and are in a strong demand position. I'm excited to see the progress made by the Tesla team as we continue building the business and strengthening our financials. Thank you very much."

[indiscernible] of being competitive, it's actually easy to make prototypes or sort of handle small volume production. But anything produced at high volume, which is really what's relevant here is, it's going to move as fast as the slowest of the say, rough order of magnitude, 10,000 unique parts and processes. 
And so you can have 9,999, which is 1 is missing. I mean, we were missing, for example, like a big struggle this quarter was the module that controls the airbags and the seatbelts. And obviously, you cannot ship a car without those. And that limited our production severely worldwide in Shanghai and in Fremont. So it -- like it wouldn't have mattered if we had like 17 different car models because they won't need the airbag module [indiscernible] 
So the -- in order for Cybertruck and [indiscernible] to scale to volume that's meaningful for customer deliveries, we would have got to solve the chip shortage or working with our suppliers and people say, ""Why don't you just build a chip fab?"" Okay, well, okay, that would take us, even moving like lightning, 12 to 18 months. So it's not like you can just swap out a chip fab. It is like yes, I'll just make a quick chip fab. 
So some of these things are -- yes, anyway. It is quite a trial dealing with all of the constraints of scaling a large manufacturing object. I think it may be the case that Tesla is scaling. I think we might be the fastest in history ever for scaling a large manufactured object. Maybe the Model T would have been comparable back in the day, the Model T. Probably, the Internet knows the answer. But I think we may be scaling large manufactured object at the fastest rate in history. Or I'd like to know who did it faster so we can learn from them. So it's worth just noting that, and they're going thing is not bad. 
So yes, so Cybertruck and Semi, actually both are heavy users of cell capacity. So we've got to make sure we have the cell capacity for those 2 vehicles or it's kind of point that we can make a small number of vehicles. The effective cost, if you make a small number of vehicles is the same, like they literally cost $1 million a piece or more. There's a reason why you do things at volume production, which is to get the economies of scale that get us down. 
So we are looking at a pretty massive increase in cell availability next year. But it's not like in January 1. It comes through -- it ramps up through the course of next year. But even without Tesla cell production, we believe our suppliers will be able to deliver about twice as much cell output in next year as this year. Drew, do you want to talk more about that?"

It's worth thing like if you have a target of a certain number, that doesn't mean it happens like as sure as night follows day. It's a target. So if there is some calamity in the world that it drops the supply chain, then it will be less. But the contracts that we have with cell suppliers quote roughly a doubling of cell supply to Tesla in 2022. 
And we have to juggle these exponential -- there's a whole much of exponential graphs sort of overlay on the top of each other and small changes in where you are on the X axis of time can quite substantially change the area under the curve. So what we're thinking of doing is like depending on -- if it's basically overshooting on cell supply for vehicles, and then as we have, say, excess cell supply in 1 month or another, then routing that cell output to the Megapack and Powerwall, [indiscernible] by the same if we're prior to taking vehicle production, if there's a shortage of cell output, for some reason, then we will throttle down Megapack and Powerwall production. So it will be something's got to give basically."

As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest part of the entire supply chain, which goes all the way back to raw materials but the -- nickel and that kind of thing. And there's sometimes perception that Tesla uses a lot of cobalt but we actually don't. Apple uses, I think, almost 100% cobalt in their batteries and cellphones, laptops. But Tesla uses no cobalt in the iron phosphate packs and almost none in the nickel basis chemistries. 
So on a weighted average basis, we might use 2% cobalt compared to the Apple's 100% cobalt. Anyway, so it's just -- it's really just not a fact that -- we expect to basically have 0 cobalt in the future. So I do -- maybe with -- I think probably there is a long-term shift more in the direction of iron-based lithium-ion cells over nickel. As the energy density of sort of iron ore to the iron phosphate, [indiscernible] taken for granted. But iron-based cell cells and nickel-based [indiscernible] cells, I think probably we'll see a shift. My guess is probably to 2/3 iron, 1/3 nickel or something on that order. 
And this is actually good because there's plenty of iron in the world. There's an insane amount of iron. But nickel is -- there's much less nickel and there's way less cobalt. So it is good for relieving the long-term scaling to move to iron-based cells mostly. And I think long term, possibly all -- there's a good chance that all stationary storage, that is Powerwall and Megapack moves iron. It is most likely the case since you do not need to transport it and there's less volume of constraint for stationary storage. So then nickel would be for -- really for long-range road transport ships and aircraft and that kind of thing."

Sometimes, I get questions from our cells suppliers like, are we just going to make all the cells ourselves and we're like no. Please make as many as you possibly can and them to us. We have a significant unmet demand in stationary storage. 
Megapack is basically sold out until the end of next year, I believe. We have a massive backlog in Powerwall demand. The [indiscernible] versus production is same mismatch. Now part of that problem is also the semiconductor issue. So we use a lot of the same chips in the Powerwall as you do the car. So it's like which one do you want to make? Cars or Powerwalls. So we need to make cars so that Powerwall production has been reduced. 
But as that semiconductor shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up Powerwall production. I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of 1 million units of Powerwall next year, maybe towards on the order of 20,000 a week, but again, dependent on cell supply and semiconductors. But in terms of demand, I think there's probably demand for in excess of 1 million Powerwalls per year and actually just a vast amount of for utilities as a little transition to a sustainable energy production, solar and wind are intermittent and, by their nature, really need battery packs in order to provide a steady flow of electricity. 
And when you look at all of the utilities in the world, this is a vast amount of back batteries that are needed. That's why long term, we really think sort of combine Tesla and suppliers need to produce at least 1,000 gigawatt hours a year and maybe 2,000 gigawatt hours a year."

We achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed over $1 billion in GAAP net income for the first time in Tesla history. I'd really like to congratulate everyone at Tesla for an amazing job. This is really an incredible milestone.
It also seems that public sentiment towards EVs is at an inflection point; and at this point, I think almost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward. Regarding supply chain, while we're making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious. For the rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain, which is there's a wide range of chips that are, at various times, the slowest parts in the supply chain.
I mean it's worth noting that if we had -- everything else, if we had vast numbers of vehicles themselves, we would not be able to make them -- if everything, except the chips, we wouldn't be able to make them. The chip supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output. It is difficult for us to see how long this will last because we don't have -- this is out of our control essentially. It does seem like it's getting better, but it's hard to predict.
So in fact, even achieving the output that we did achieve was only due to an immense effort from people within Tesla. We were able to substitute alternative chips and then write the firmware in a matter of weeks. It's not just a matter of swapping out a chip. You also have to rewrite the software. So it was an incredibly intense effort of finding new chips, writing new firmware, integrating with the vehicle and testing in order to maintain production.
And I'd also like to thank our suppliers who worked with us. And there have been many calls at midnight, 1 a.m., just with suppliers but -- in resolving a lot of the shortages. So thanks very much to our suppliers.
Let's see. In terms of FSD subscription, we were able to launch full self-driving subscription last month. And we expect it to build slowly and then -- but then gather a lot of momentum over time. Obviously, we need to have the full-self driving build widely available for it really to take off at a high rate and make a lot of progress there. So yes, I think FSD subscription will be a significant factor probably next year.
With regard to Giga Texas and Giga Berlin, we're actually doing this earnings call from Giga Texas, so we're in the factory right now doing this earnings call. And the team has made incredible progress here. You can see the pictures online and see that there's basically nothing a year ago and this -- a large -- a mostly complete large factory a year later. So it's really great work by the Giga Texas team.  And then also great work in Berlin, Brandenburg with the team there.
So we expect to be producing the sort of new design of the Model Y in both factories in limited production later this year. It's always like it's not -- it's hard to sort of explain to people who have not been through the agony of a manufacturing ramp. Like why can't you just turn it on and make 5,000 a week? This is -- it is so hard to do manufacturing. It is so hard to do production. At gross approximation, there are 10,000 unique parts and processes that have to work. And the greater growth of production goes as fast as the least lucky and dumbest of those 10,000 things. And a bunch of them are not even in our control, so it's like -- it's insanely difficult.
I'm fond of saying that prototypes are easy and production is hard. And arguably, the really remarkable thing that Tesla's done is not to make an electric car or to be a car start-up because there have been hundreds of car start-ups in the United States and outside United States. So the thing that's remarkable is that Tesla didn't go bankrupt in reaching volume production. That's the amazing part because everyone else did, because they all got the prototype before the idea was the hard part and it is not. It is trivial by comparison with actual production.
So it's always worth noting that of all the American car companies, there are only 2 that have not gone bankrupt and that is Ford and Tesla. So the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory, and we must be careful that we do not do that. So often, if you look at history, so often, the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory. We will endeavor not to make that the case of Tesla.
So let's see, the model lines in Texas -- and mainly in Texas and Berlin will be -- will look very much like the Model Ys we currently make, but there are substantial improvements in the difficulty of manufacturing. So for example, the Model Y made here and in Berlin will have a cast front body and a cast rear body, whereas the one in California has a cast rear body but not a cast front body. We're also aiming to do a structural pack with 4680s cells, which is a mass reduction and a cost reduction.
But we're not counting on that as the only way to make things work. We have some backup plan with nonstructural -- with a nonstructural pack and 2170s essentially. So -- but at scale production, we obviously want to be using 4680s and a structural pack. From a physics standpoint, this is the best architecture; and from an economic standpoint, it is the lowest cost way to go. So the lightest, lowest cost.  
But there's a lot of new technology there, so it is difficult to predict with precision when does it work and when do you reach scale production. And Drew's going to talk a bit more about the 4680 production. Yes.
So we're all making great progress on the 4680 cells, but there is a tremendous amount of innovation that we're packing into that 4680 cell. And so it's not simply a sort of minor improvement on state of the art. There are -- and we went through this on the Battery Cell Day -- really dozens of -- half a dozen major improvements and dozens of small improvements. So I think it will be great, but it's difficult to say when the last of the technical challenges will be solved. 
So in conclusion, our team continues to make huge efforts to make our factories run at full speed, which is very difficult. We have had some factory shutdowns due to part shortages, and we hope those will be relieved in the coming weeks and months. And we're making great progress on full self-driving. Some of the progress is not easy to see because it is at a foundational software level, and so then it ends up being sort of a 2 steps forward, 1 step back situation. And -- but over time, you do 2 steps forward and 1 step back and keep going, you do move forward.
So I'm highly confident that the cars will be capable of full self-driving. If they have a full self-driving computer and the cameras, I'm confident that they will be able to drive themselves with the safety level substantially greater than that of the average cars.
Once again, thanks to all of our employees who are making this a breakthrough year for Tesla and an incredible quarter. Thanks, guys."

Just to reiterate, Q2 was a great quarter for the Tesla team with strong improvements across the business. In particular, auto gross profit and margin, excluding credit, increased substantially. This was primarily dr",572,"Yes. Thanks, Martin, and thanks, Elon. Just to reiterate, Q2 was a great quarter for the Tesla team with strong improvements across the business. In particular, auto gross profit and margin, excluding credit, increased substantially. This was primarily driven by better cost optimization across our factories, good execution against our cost reduction plans as well as increases in production and delivery volumes.  
There was some benefit from pricing action mostly in North America. However, it was small in the context of the other contributors. Note that the Model S and X program was at a slight loss for the quarter due to the relatively low volume. And supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds. 
Additionally, it's encouraging to see the progress made on profitability within our energy and services and other businesses. While there's some benefit to looking at our progress quarter-over-quarter, I find it more helpful to look at progress over a slightly long-term horizon. Over the last 2 years, our vehicle delivery volumes have more than doubled. This volume increase was made possible by a steady decrease in ASPs of more than 10%, driven by our road map to increase affordability and shifting mix towards our more affordable vehicles. Yet over that same period of time, our auto gross margin, excluding credit, has increased nearly 10 percentage points to our highest yet since the introduction of Model 3. This is only possible because our average cost per vehicle has reduced by more than the reduction in average price. This is a remarkable achievement in the context of the volume growth and ASP reduction, as mentioned, and a testament to the hard work by the Tesla team.
Additionally, OpEx as a percentage of revenue has declined and in particular, SG&A, representing the work we've done to become more efficient as we scale the company while still making the required R&D investments to support our future. As a result, our GAAP operating margins have risen from negative to double digit in line with what we have guided. By managing our overhead costs and driving higher volumes, our P&L is benefiting from the marginal profitability of each incremental unit, or said differently, we are recognizing the benefits of scale and improved fixed cost absorption.
With strong operating cash flows and cash balance, we are putting that cash to use. CapEx continues to tick up, primarily driven by capacity investments in Austin, Berlin and Shanghai. Additionally, each quarter, we are using our cash to retire legacy debt, which was taken on at a time when interest rates and company risks were much higher than in today's environment.
As I've mentioned before, our 2021 volumes will skew towards the second half of the year as we push for continued sequential increases in volume. Despite the great work so far managing the instability of the supply chain, these challenges remain and are unfortunately increasing in pain with the higher volume. As we work through the uncertainty, we want to ensure we do our best to manage customer wait times as well as the impact these interruptions have on our employees and costs.
And as Elon mentioned, volume growth will be determined by part availability as we have the factory capacity ready and are in a strong demand position. I'm excited to see the progress made by the Tesla team as we continue building the business and strengthening our financials. Thank you very much."

With the Cybertruck, we're redefining how the vehicle is being made. As Elon said, it carries much of the structural pack and large casting designs of the Model Y being built in Berlin and Austin. Obviously, those take priority over the Cybertruck, but we are moving into the beta phases of Cybertruck later this year, and we'll be looking to ramp that in production in Giga Texas after Model Y is up and going."
27444752,1673737210,2351125,"Tesla, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2021",2021-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Tesla, Inc.","Executives","Yes, just worth reemphasizing that the extraordinarily difficult -- extraordinary difficulty of ramping production of large manufacturing items.

The risk of being repetitive, it's actually easy to make prototypes or sort of handle small volume production. But anything produced at high volume, which is really what's relevant here, is it's going to move as fast as the slowest of the, say, at rough order of magnitude, 10,000 unique parts and processes.
And so you can have 9,999, which is 1 is missing. I mean we were missing -- for example, like a big struggle this quarter was the module that controls the airbags and the seatbelts. And obviously, you cannot ship a car without those. And that limited our production severely worldwide in Shanghai and in Fremont. So it -- like it wouldn't have mattered if we had like 17 different car models because they won't need the airbag module, so it's irrelevant.
So the -- in order for Cybertruck and Semi to scale to volume that's meaningful for customer deliveries, we've got to solve the chip shortage or working with our suppliers and people just want to say, ""Why don't you just build a chip fab?"" Okay, well, okay, that would take us, even moving like lightning, 12 to 18 months. So it's not like you can just whip out a chip fab, just like, yes, I'll just make a quick chip fab.
So some of these things are -- yes, anyway. It is quite a trial dealing with all of the constraints of scaling a large manufactured object. I think it may be the case that Tesla is scaling. It's -- I think we might be the fastest in history ever for scaling a large manufactured object. I think maybe the Model T would have been comparable back in the day, the Ford Model T. Probably, the Internet knows the answer. But I think we may be scaling large manufactured object at the fastest rate in history. Or I'd like to know who did it faster, so we can learn from them. So it's worth just noting that, and in the grand scheme of things, it's not bad.
So yes, so Cybertruck and Semi, actually both are heavy users of cell capacity. So we've got to make sure we have the cell capacity for those 2 vehicles or it's kind of pointless. We can make a small number of vehicles, but the effective cost if you make a small number of vehicles is the same. Like they literally cost like $1 million a piece or more. There's a reason why you do things at volume production, which is to get the economies of scale that get us down.
So we are looking at a pretty massive increase in cell availability next year, but it's not like in January 1. It comes through -- it ramps up through the course of next year. But even without Tesla -- Tesla's [Technical Difficulty] Hello? Okay. Even without Tesla cell production, we believe our suppliers will be able to deliver about twice as much cell output in next year as this year. And Drew, do you want to talk more about that?"

So if there is some calamity in the world that it drops the supply chain, then it will be less. But the contracts that we have with cell suppliers quote roughly a doubling of cell supply to Tesla in 2022.  
And we have to juggle these exponential -- there's a whole bunch of exponential graphs sort of overlay on top of each other, and small changes in where you are on the X axis of time can quite substantially change the area under the curve. So what we're thinking of doing is like depending on -- it's basically overshooting on cell supply for vehicles, and then as we have, say, excess cell supply in 1 month or another, then routing that cell output to the Megapack and Powerwall. Oh by the -- if we're -- prior to [ taking ] vehicle production, if there's a shortage of cell output, for some reason, then we will throttle down Megapack and Powerwall production.

As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest part of the entire supply chain, which goes all the way back to raw materials, lithium and nickel and that kind of thing.

As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest part of the entire supply chain, which goes all the way back to raw materials, lithium and nickel and that kind of thing. And there's sometimes perception that Tesla uses a lot of cobalt, but we actually don't. Apple uses, I think, almost 100% cobalt in their batteries in cellphones, laptops. But Tesla uses no cobalt in the iron phosphate packs and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries. So on a weighted average basis, we might use 2% cobalt compared to the Apple's 100% cobalt. 
Anyway, so it's just -- it's really just not a fact. We expect to basically have 0 cobalt in the future. So I do -- maybe with -- I think probably there is a long-term shift more in the direction of iron-based lithium-ion cells over nickel. As the energy density of sort of iron ore or the iron phosphate -- might as well just call it iron. The phosphate is taken for granted. But iron-based cells, lithium-ion cells and nickel-based lithium-ion cells, I think probably we'll see a shift. My guess is probably to 2/3 iron, 1/3 nickel or something on that order.
And this is actually good because there's plenty of iron in the world. There's an insane amount of iron. But nickel is -- there's much less nickel, and there's way less cobalt. So it is good for relieving the long-term scaling to move to iron-based cells mostly. And I think long term, possibly all -- there's a good chance that all stationary storage, that is Powerwall and Megapack, moves iron, which is most likely the case since you do not need to transport it and there's [ less volume that match ] constraint for stationary storage. So then nickel would be for -- really for long-range road transport, ships and aircraft, that kind of thing."

There will be a time constraint. So if the charge rate is super slow, then somebody will be charged more because the biggest constraint at the Superchargers is time, how occupied is the stall. And we'll also be smarter with how we charge for electricity at the Superchargers.

So when you put a factory in a new geography, in order for that factory to be efficient, you have to localize the supply chain. So there's no such thing as cut and paste. It does not exist.
And it obviously be insane to do vehicle production in Europe but send vast numbers of parts from North America. That would be -- that would make the producing in Europe, for example, just crazy. You've got to localize the supply chain to have efficiency and then you're moving as fast as your least lucky, least good supplier.
Yes. It's only supply chains where you go like 3 or 4 layers deep. It's frankly -- I feel at times that we are inheriting all force majeure or -- so if anything goes wrong anywhere on Earth, something happens to mess up the supply chain. So yes. Yes."

At scale, we think we'll have [ billions ] of miles of travel to be able to show that it is the safety of the car with autopilot on is 100% or 200% or more safer than the average human driver. At that point, I think it would be unconscionable to -- not to allow autopilot because the car just comes way less safe. 
It will be sort of like if you take the elevator analogy. Back in the day, you used to have elevator operators with like a big sort of switch that operates the elevator and moves between floors. But they get tired or maybe drunk or something or distracted, and every time and again, somebody would be kind of sheared in half between floors. That's kind of the situation we have with cars. Autonomy will become so safe that it will be unsafe to manually operate the car, relatively speaking.
And today, obviously, we just get in an elevator. We press the button for which floor we want, and it just takes us there safely. And it would be quite alarming if elevators were operated by a person with a giant switch. That's how we'll be with cars."

Sometimes I get questions from our cell suppliers of like are we just going to make all the cells ourselves and we're like no. Please make as many as you possibly can and supply them to us. We have a significant unmet demand in stationary storage.
Megapack is basically sold out until the end of next year, I believe. We have a massive backlog in Powerwall demand. The demand of Powerwall versus production is an insane mismatch. Now part of that problem is also the semiconductor issue. So we use a lot of the same chips in the Powerwall as you do in a car. So it's like which one do you want to make? Cars or Powerwalls? So we need to make cars, so therefore, Powerwall production has been reduced.
But as that semiconductor shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up Powerwall production. I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of 1 million units of Powerwall next year maybe towards -- on the order of 20,000 a week but again, dependent on cell supply and semiconductors.
But in terms of demand, I think there's probably demand for in excess of 1 million Powerwalls per year and actually -- and just a vast amount of Megapacks for utilities. As the world transitions to a sustainable energy production, solar and wind are intermittent and, by their nature, really need battery packs in order to provide a steady flow of electricity. And when you look at all of the utilities in the world, this is a vast amount of batteries that are needed. That's why long term, we really think sort of, combined, Tesla and suppliers need to produce at least 1,000 gigawatt hours a year and maybe 2,000 gigawatt hours a year."

We're continuing to make great progress as a company, setting new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3. Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter and 70% higher than the same",872,"Yes. Thanks, Martin. We're continuing to make great progress as a company, setting new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3. Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter and 70% higher than the same quarter last year. We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter. The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory. 
Additionally, we have made great progress increasing production volumes of Model S and have recently started the ramp and deliveries of Model X. It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes, but based on demand, we are targeting to exceed historical production levels. 
We have also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub. This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe. Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity. It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally difficult to achieve. I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive flexibility as we make adjustments real-time. This team's expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference when managing through these challenges. 
Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible. I also want to thank our suppliers for their dedication and partnership to Tesla. Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending. The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our existing production lines, which is where we are focused. 
Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts and cells allow us to do so. Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program, and we're excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers. 
Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29% excluding regulatory credits, which is our strongest yet. This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes. The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin, and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X. 
As was the case in Q2, there was some net benefit from pricing actions. However, this remains small in the context of other contributors. Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our financials. Note that we are also not yet recognizing additional revenue from the FSD beta program. 
Supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds as was also the case with FX this quarter. While we are seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjusting pricing which should help to compensate. Overall, as I mentioned in our last call, our P&L continues to benefit from the marginal profitability of each incremental unit with higher fixed cost absorption. 
As a result of the great progress on margins, volume and appropriate management of overhead costs, we were able to achieve an operating margin of just under 15%, exceeding the long-term guidance we've laid out previously. 
On cash, we generated record operating cash flows of $3.1 billion and continue to invest heavily in the build-out of manufacturing, supercharging and service capacity. We also continue to retire high interest rate debt including the early settlement of our 2025 senior notes of $1.8 billion during the quarter. As we look forward, we are clearly quite a bit ahead of the pacing required to achieve our target annual growth rate of 50% this year. Q4 production will depend heavily on availability of parts but we are driving for continued growth. 
We are also nearing assembly of our first production cars in Austin and Berlin. It's important to stress, while the first production car is an important milestone, the hardest work lies ahead in the ramp. Please keep in mind that we are pushing the boundaries on new product and manufacturing technologies at these factories, which makes it difficult to predict the exact pace of the ramp. These factories will also partially weigh on our margins as we work towards volume production. 
Overall, I'm very proud of what the team has accomplished, and I'm excited for our next phase of growth into Q4 and into 2022. The team has done a tremendous job improving our financial health in a short period of time while also continuing to improve our precision and pace of execution. Thank you."

While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin, Berlin, ramping S and X further in Fremont to restore to past levels while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont and Shanghai. As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck. And that timing, of course, depends on increasing cell capacity both from our suppliers and through our in-house cell as well as many other headwinds we face in the supply chain and completing our currently full plate of products on the table."

There may be some periods of time in which we're well ahead of that. There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower than that. But that remains the long-term goal of the company. 
In Fremont, we're continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible there. Over the last 12 months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production. And based upon everything that we know in the factory, where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we're targeting to increase that another 50%. I think that will be a difficult goal but that's the goal that the internal team has, and they're going to continue to push on that. 
As we look towards Shanghai, we're continuing to push the boundaries there and we continue to ramp production there as well. So most recently, the ramp-up of the Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3, we'll continue to ramp that factory. And our plans there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory. 
Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y. But we've intentionally set these factories in locations in which they have quite a significant amount of land and ability to expand. And so we'll take Model Y at these factories, we're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can. And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories. And then we'll add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there. 
So our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years, and then ultimately, in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year. We're going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a 50% annual growth rate."

During these investigations, my team, myself, are always cooperative as much as possible. We expect and embrace the scrutiny of these products and know that the truth about their performance and the innovations our products have will ultimately be all that matters. In the end and as I've said on previous calls, we take safety as a top priority in all our designs. This is because our primary motivation is coming from a team of incredible engineers designing software and hardware that saves lives and prevents injuries.

And our goal in developing safety-oriented software around the car is to continue to go beyond what the hardware is able to provide. If you can prevent a crash from happening, that's the safest way to manage this. 
And I think at a macro level here, what we're seeing, and this is entirely understandable and expected, is that the automotive industry is going through a transition from the traditional car as we know it to more of a computer, software-oriented sensor suites around them that can manage things beyond just what the driver manages. And regulatory bodies are, understandably so, are interested in understanding how to regulate in this environment, and NHTSA is no exception to that.

We have seen an increase in service wait times throughout the summer. And there's a couple of things that have contributed to that based upon the information that we have. The first is that, and I think this is kind of not -- this is not unique to us, is that the return to some sense of normalcy in a post-pandemic world has happened, I think, more quickly than most people expected. 
And what we're seeing here is that the number of miles that people are driving has increased. There may have been some demand for service during 2020 or in the early parts of 2021 that customers put off, and so there's a bit of a catch-up that's occurring. That has increased demand for service. 
At the same time, in the macro environment here, logistics, moving parts, sourcing parts has become increasingly more difficult, which is a well-known issue in the world right now, as well as challenges in the labor market. And so this kind of the simultaneous increase in demand for service, where the ability to supply that service, has been impacted for the reasons I mentioned. 
And so we saw an uptick, primarily in Europe and North America in service wait times over the course of the summer. And we've been working extremely hard since then to address this. And we've seen our wait times come down. So this is not the case in every location, but if you think about it from a regional average perspective, we are seeing improvements there. 
We remain super-focused on adding locations. And so over the last year, we've grown our physical footprint of service centers by 35%. We've grown our footprint of mobile repair by over 40%. We're also adding staffing as quickly as we can in the areas that are most impacted by the imbalance of supply and demand for service. But I think the most important part about all of this is, and we've said this on calls before, where the best service is no service. 
And so we have been incredibly focused as a company both on the initial quality of our vehicles and reliability of our vehicles. And we've seen pretty substantial improvements in both of those metrics over the long term and over the last couple of quarters. So it is something that remains on our minds. We monitor this very closely. But hopefully, that's a helpful explanation into the context and what we're doing."

We won't be providing any kind of forward-looking commentary on our pricing strategy or what may happen here over the near term. With respect to the first part of the question, it has been an interesting theme for us to unpack within the company. 
I mean, what I'll say just as a general statement before I make a couple of specific comments is that the things that we learn on FSD subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant. This is really more of a platform for when FSD beta goes into a wide release and the features and functionality become more accessible to more customers. 
The second thing that I'll note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing of FSD subscription and then you compare that to the cost of either rolling FSD option into your lease or your loan, then on a monthly basis, the most economical way for a customer to enjoy the features of full self-driving is through purchasing it upfront and rolling it through their financing. 
And as a result of that, what we've seen in the data is not -- we're unable to detect a change in the upfront take rate of FSD when people purchase cars. We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks curious to experience what the software has to offer and subscribing to it and enjoying it through that route. But again, as I said at the beginning, I think what we've seen so far on FSD subscription is not terribly relevant. We'll see how that plays out in the future as we continue to release more features."

That money can then be applied towards the purchase of a new car. 
So I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit. We see it on social media. We see it in the forums, et cetera.

We have a terrific team here at Tesla of folks who have been spending a lot of time developing this and probably listening to the call. So we're pretty excited so far, Pierre. 
So I mean, at the highest level here, we entered the insurance market kind of unintentionally, I would say. Our customers were coming to us complaining that the price of traditional insurance was too high, and it was reducing the affordability of a Tesla. And part of our journey here at Tesla is we want as many people as possible to be able to afford our products. That's extremely important to achieving the mission of the company. 
And if you look at the price of insurance as a percentage of what somebody's monthly payment is, it's quite high. And we spend extreme amounts of effort in manufacturing to take $5 of BOM cost out here or $10 out somewhere else. If we can get $5, $10, $20, $30 out on a monthly payment, you can calculate what that means in terms of reduction of the price of the car, if you finance it, and the leverage of improving insurance cost is huge in terms of affordability. 
And so that's kind of the context by which we stepped into this. As we started to do more research, essentially, the tools by which the insurance is traditionally calculated are optimized based upon the existing data, but the existing data is limited. So there's a focus on things like marital status or age or other attributes like that. Accident history is a good one, et cetera. 
But what essentially happens here is customers who are low risk and don't actually file many claims end up overpaying on their insurance relative to their cost. That overpayment then goes to riskier customers who are essentially being subsidized. And as we looked at this and we looked at the data, we thought this just doesn't seem like it's fair. At Tesla, because our cars are connected, because they are essentially computers on wheels, there's enormous amounts of data that we have available to us to be able to assess the attributes of a driver who's operating that car and whether those attributes correlate with safety because we do get a signal when a car has been in an accident. 
So we've been spending our time looking at hundreds of different variables and also looking at billions of miles of driving history. And we've been able to fit a model that is able to predict, with decent accuracy, the probability of collision over a period of time. And the model is not perfect, right? The model is a function of the data that we have available. That data set continues to grow. We continue to experiment with new variables, but we do have a model that works pretty well so far. 
And from that model, being able to predict frequency of collision, we can then align that against the price curve. And we can have individualized pricing integrated into the car, integrated into the app, integrated into that customer's experience with a feedback loop back to the customer on how they are driving after every drive, the attributes that they were successful on or unsuccessful on and the tips of things that they can do to improve their safety. So that's what we've developed. 
We then included the safety score as part of the FSD beta enrollment program, where we have almost 150,000 cars currently using the safety score. And I believe the latest data is over 100 million miles of driving, so we've been able to go back and analyzed that data. And we've learned 2 things coming from that. The first is that the probability of collision for a customer using a safety score versus not is 30% lower. It's a pretty big difference. It means that the product is working and customers are responding to it. 
The second thing that we've looked at is what is the probability of collision based upon actual data as a function of a driver safety score. And that is aligning with our models. Most notably, if you're in the top tier of safety compared to lower tiers, there's multiple X difference in probability of collision based upon actual data. So this is a very new and very exciting frontier for us. I know that was long-winded, but I -- we spent a lot of time on this and we put a lot of thought into it. 
Specifically with respect to the rollout, the insurance industry in the U.S. is intensely regulated and it's regulated on a state-by-state level. That means that we require regulatory approvals from each individual Department of Insurance at each individual state. Texas is the first state that we launched in. I do want to thank the Texas insurance regulators here. You have been great to work with. We have a road map of additional states. We will launch the product in those states as we receive regulatory approvals. And our goal is to be in every major market in which we have cars in. 
We did a soft launch in Texas, was it last week? Yes. And what we're seeing in initial take rate data is that if you compare that to what we're seeing in California, we're off to a good start here. So we're very excited about it. We're excited about individual risk-based pricing. We're excited about the ability for folks to become safer and, as a result, save money. And it feeds into our priority of a company of building the safest products in the world."

And as we look out over the next quarter and the next year, there's kind of -- there's a number of puts and takes financially for the company. 
The launch of Austin and Berlin, we'll have ramp inefficiencies there for some period of time until we get those factories up and running. And so that's likely to put some downward pressure on our margins as those factories ramp. Our goals are to ramp those as quickly as possible. But as Drew mentioned earlier, there are a number of unknown unknowns that we'll need to work through. 
We are kind of also in this uncertain environment with respect to cost structure, so we are seeing cost increase on the commodity side. We're getting feedback from our suppliers, as we are seeing ourselves, the impact of labor shortage. And then logistics and expedite costs just continue to be a part of our story here. And it's uncertain how that will unfold. It's our hope that these things stabilize. Exactly when that happens is difficult to predict. And we have been adjusting pricing in line with those changes in cost. And so we'll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year. So it's difficult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons. 
With respect to operating margin, we've been very focused as a company on managing our overhead expenses and operating expenses. And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has been declining, and I expect that trend to continue to happen. And I think the net of all of this is hopefully that we continue to make progress on operating margin over the next 4 or 5 quarters. 
As we think kind of forward, the business up until this point has kind of largely been a hardware automotive business with a little bit of software on top of that. As full self-driving matures, as take rates increase, if we are to raise pricing on that, there's considerable upside both on gross margins and operating margin as that comes to light as the business starts to become more of a mix of a hardware-based company and a software-based company. 
So we feel optimistic about the journey, very optimistic about the journey as we look over into the long term. Just a little bit difficult over the next 4 to 5 quarters. We'll continue to update on earnings calls as we learn more information. There's just a lot of uncertainty in the world right now."

Some materials we contract directly and we have full exposure to price fluctuations. We do have a number of long-term commitments -- long-term contracts in place. We also have contracts where there's some amount of cost sharing based upon the movement of indexes. 
And so as these have been moving, some of those costs have been flowing through to us. It's not a substantial amount of cost but it's not small. As we look towards the next year, I certainly hope it doesn't play out this way, but it's possible that we continue to see more of cost headwind as a result of these movements. It's difficult to say precisely but the volatility and the increases are just substantial, so substantial. And there are certain suppliers that, maybe up to a certain point, have been absorbing some of the increase. And as contracts expire there or we have to renew and extend them, we'll have to return to negotiations. 
And so what we have to do as a company and what we are intensely focused on is we need to be continuing to drive down the cost of our products, which we have been doing. And we have to overcome cost increases that are outside of our control. So whether that's resourcing components or redesigning components or finding ways to be more efficient in manufacturing, we have no choice but to continue on that path and be even more aggressive in the light of the macroeconomics here."

I don't know that I'm going to get into too many specifics, but I guess first, 1 thing I would say is unlike the commodities discussion we just had, like the anode materials are not really in the same situation just in terms of what their constituent components are. So there's less of a focus on like rapidly changing them 1 way or the other because they're generally stable commodities. 
There isn't exactly like a tit for tat where like get a better anode, use less cathode, like there's a fundamental ratio that you need to maintain for the cell to function. So I guess zooming out, the primary focus on the anode side that we have is just ensuring that it doesn't, in any way, that we are able to continue to reduce the cost of the anode without impeding on the long-term cyclability of the product. 
It can also help with energy density as you like sort of improve the energy density of the anode, you improve the energy density of the cell, not directly 1:1 because you have to pack more cathode in as the anode gets better. And that's a focus as well but the trade space is just sort of cycling versus day 1 cost."

Pricing has been a really difficult thing for us over the last couple of quarters. And we're -- part of the challenge is, well, I mean, the great thing that we're seeing in the space right now is there appears to just be quite a profound awakening of the desirability for electric vehicles. And I mean, to be totally frank, it's caught us a little bit offguard. 
And that kind of awakening and changing consumer sentiment, I'm sure there's lots of reasons that go into it, but folks want to buy an electric car and folks want to buy a Tesla right now. It's very exciting for us. At the same time, we have installed capacity to build more cars but we're constrained by a number of dynamics, as we've talked about in great detail. And we are putting an extreme effort to build as many cars as we possibly can. 
It's hard to overstate how extreme the efforts are. It's quite the grind. We're trying as hard as we can to maximize that capacity and to be able to meet the demand that we're receiving. But the net-net of all of this is that we're not able to increase production capacity fast enough. So at the same time we are seeing macroeconomic cost impacts on our structure, as we've discussed previously on the call, so we're trying to think through if somebody orders a car now, it'll -- it could be delivered, in some cases, depending upon the car and which factory, could be a couple of months, could be a couple of quarters. And the timing in which we build that car will be just before that car gets delivered. 
And what will the world look like at that point? And so we're trying to think through how the cost structure is evolving? How does pricing need to change with that? What are the supply dynamics in the space? The other thing that I'll just note on pricing is that companies change pricing all the time. The difference is that when Tesla changes pricing, it's extremely transparent where that's not always the case otherwise. 
And sometimes our pricing will increase, sometimes our pricing will reduce. Sometimes, to the public, our pricing changes may not seem to make logical sense. But there is a strategy that we work behind the scenes as we're balancing supply and demand, as we're also trying to balance very shortages on parts, as we're trying to manage wait times, all of that goes into the optimization here."

Yet we look at the progress in FSD and some of the issues you see on YouTube, and it looks very much like a Level 2, 2+ system that requires vigilances, in fact, your disclaimers cite. 
So I guess, 3 questions. Kind of, one, what is the timetable to get to Level 4 at least capability? We can deal with the regulatory stuff later. Two, what is the criteria, for Zach, for you to release revenue -- deferred revenue around FSD? And is having a Level 2 system that needs monitoring enough to release that deferred revenue? And then three, maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you plan to work with the folks at NHTSA who appear to be asking some questions?

And for those who don't have it in their cars, social media is excellent at getting a sense for how that's progressing. And the team is moving quickly with every iteration, with every update, and they're working very hard on that. 
On your second question about the criteria to release deferred revenue, the way that this works is we have made certain commitments as to what this product can offer at the time that a customer has purchased that. And so what we have to assess is, have we met those commitments? And is the software widely available to folks that we've made those commitments to within a certain geography? And given that FSD is still currently in the beta phase, it's invitation-only and it's limited, we have not deemed that to be appropriate for recognition of deferred revenue. And we'll continue to evolve this. We'll continue to monitor it within the finance team to see when we get to the milestones in which we're comfortable releasing. On the NHTSA question, Lars, do you want to take that?"

As you guys may know, we released updates to our airbag and restraint system last week to Model Y using our fleet data. We worked closely with NHTSA on that, and they were fully in the loop before we did it.

So it remains our target in both Austin and Berlin to be able to build our first production cars before the end of the year. We've talked about this a bit, the unknown unknowns, new factories, new vehicle designs, new technologies, new locations, new teams. So there is quite an execution journey ahead of us. But that remains our target and all of our plans are oriented around that. 
We should not expect for us to deliver cars by the end of 2021 from these factories even if we do produce them, so homologation, regulatory reasons. And we'll want to make sure that we build up some number of cars that we're confident in the quality and the customer experience around them. 
The second thing that I'll say, and I mentioned this in my opening remarks, is because of the newness here, it's extremely difficult for us to be precise in what the ramp will look like. And it's possible things -- the stars align and things move quickly, it's possible that we're spending the bulk of next year working on ramping these factories. It's just very hard to say, and we'll continue to update you all through these calls and through other forums. 
As to how that then impacts our margins, that is also difficult because that is a function of the ramp, which is uncertain. So the benefit here, which is different in the ramp of these factories compared to other factories, is if you think about the percentage of our total cost structure in any given quarter that is associated with new ramps, we have the Fremont factory that's running, generating stable and growing margins there. The same is also true in Shanghai. So I expect we'll see some amount of headwind on margin from these ramps. It's just entirely dependent on how quickly we're able to ramp and what uncertainties come up during the process."

We're continuing to make great progress as a company, setting new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3. Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter and 70% higher than the same",870,"Yes. Thanks, Martin. We're continuing to make great progress as a company, setting new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3. Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter and 70% higher than the same quarter last year. We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter. 
The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory. Additionally, we have made great progress increasing production volumes of Model S and have recently started the ramp and deliveries of Model X. It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes, but based on demand, we are targeting to exceed historical production levels. We have also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub. This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe. 
Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity. It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally difficult to achieve. I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive flexibility as we make adjustments real-time. This team's expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference when managing through these challenges. Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible. I also want to thank our suppliers for their dedication and partnership to Tesla. 
Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending. The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our existing production lines, which is where we are focused.  
Similar dynamics are also playing out on our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts and cells allow us to do so. Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program, and we're excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.  
Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29% excluding regulatory credits, which is our strongest yet. This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes. The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin, and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X.  
As was the case in Q2, there was some net benefit from pricing actions. However, this remains small in the context of other contributors. Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our financials. Note that we are also not yet recognizing additional revenue from the FSD beta program. Supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds as was also the case with FX this quarter. While we are seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjusting pricing, which should help to compensate. 
Overall, as I mentioned in our last call, our P&L continues to benefit from the marginal profitability of each incremental unit with higher fixed cost absorption. As a result of the great progress on margins, volume and appropriate management of overhead costs, we were able to achieve an operating margin of just under 15%, exceeding the long-term guidance we've laid out previously.  
On cash, we generated record operating cash flows of $3.1 billion and continue to invest heavily in the build-out of manufacturing, supercharging and service capacity. We also continue to retire high-interest-rate debt, including the early settlement of our 2025 senior notes of $1.8 billion during the quarter. 
As we look forward, we are clearly quite a bit ahead of the pacing required to achieve our target annual growth rate of 50% this year. Q4 production will depend heavily on availability of parts, but we are driving for continued growth. We are also nearing assembly of our first production cars in Austin and Berlin. It's important to stress, while the first production car is an important milestone, the hardest work lies ahead in the ramp. Please keep in mind that we are pushing the boundaries on new product and manufacturing technologies at these factories, which makes it difficult to predict the exact pace of the ramp. These factories will also partially weigh on our margins as we work towards volume production.  
Overall, I'm very proud of what the team has accomplished and I'm excited for our next phase of growth into Q4 and into 2022. The team has done a tremendous job improving our financial health in a short period of time while also continuing to improve our precision and pace of execution. Thank you."

We're working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible. I think Zach spoke to that well. And we're doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexity to the business. We don't want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we're generally in a cell-constrained world. While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin, Berlin, ramping S and X further in Fremont to restore to past levels while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont and Shanghai. As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck. And that timing, of course, depends on increasing cell capacity both from our suppliers and through our in-house cell as well as many other headwinds we face in the supply chain and completing our currently full plate of products on the table."

There may be some periods of time in which we're well ahead of that. There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower than that. But that remains the long-term goal of the company.  
In Fremont, we're continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible there. Over the last 12 months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production. And based upon everything that we know in the factory, where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we're targeting to increase that another 50%. I think that will be a difficult goal but that's the goal that the internal team has, and they're going to continue to push on that.  
As we look towards Shanghai, we're continuing to push the boundaries there and we continue to ramp production there as well, so most recently the ramp-up of the Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3. We'll continue to ramp that factory. And our plans there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.  
Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y, but we've intentionally set these factories in locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and ability to expand. And so we'll take Model Y at these factories. We're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can. And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories. And then we'll add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.  
So our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years and then ultimately, in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year. We're going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a 50% annual growth rate."

During these investigations, my team, myself are always cooperative as much as possible. We expect and embrace the scrutiny of these products and know that the truth about their performance and the innovations our products have will ultimately be all that matters. 
In the end and as I've said on previous calls, we take safety as a top priority in all our designs. This is because our primary motivation is from -- coming from a team of incredible engineers designing software and hardware that saves lives and prevents injuries. In doing so, we'll continue to be transparent to the public on how our technology is both developing from an Autopilot safety data, the latest of which we just shared in the shareholder update, and you can also see and review a wide variety of customer post FSD videos on social media.

It's the right thing to do. And if you look at various independent testing and regulatory testing of our products, you can see the work of incredibly talented engineers in the results of those tests. And our goal in developing safety-oriented software around the car is to continue to go beyond what the hardware is able to provide. If you can prevent a crash from happening, that's the safest way to manage this.  
And I think at a macro level here, what we're seeing -- and this is entirely understandable and expected, is that the automotive industry is going through a transition from the traditional car as we know it to more of a computer, software-oriented, sensor suites around them that can manage things beyond just what the driver manages. And regulatory bodies are -- understandably so, are interested in understanding how to regulate in this environment, and NHTSA is no exception to that. So as Lars mentioned here, I think this is a great thing. We're excited to partner and we'll work collaboratively with all regulatory bodies who want -- to go on the journey to the transition to a software-oriented vehicle."

We have seen an increase in service wait times throughout the summer. And there's a couple of things that have contributed to that based upon the information that we have. The first is that -- and I think this is kind of not -- this is not unique to us, is that the return to some sense of normalcy in a post-pandemic world has happened, I think, more quickly than most people expected. And what we're seeing here is that the number of miles that people are driving has increased. There may have been some demand for service during 2020 or in the early parts of 2021 that customers put off, and so there's a bit of a catch-up that's occurring. That has increased demand for service. At the same time, in the macro environment here, logistics, moving parts, sourcing parts has become increasingly more difficult, which is a well-known issue in the world right now, as well as challenges in the labor market. 
And so this kind of the simultaneous increase in demand for service with the ability to supply that service has been impacted for the reasons I mentioned. And so we saw an uptick primarily in Europe and North America in service wait times over the course of the summer. And we've been working extremely hard since then to address this, and we've seen our wait times come down. So this is not the case in every location, but if you think about it from regional average perspective, we are seeing improvements there.  
We remain super-focused on adding locations. And so over the last year, we've grown our physical footprint of service centers by 35%. We've grown our footprint of mobile repair by over 40%. We're also adding staffing as quickly as we can in the areas that are most impacted by the imbalance of supply and demand for service. 
But I think the most important part about all of this is -- and we've said this on calls before, where the best service is no service. And so we have been incredibly focused as a company both on the initial quality of our vehicles and reliability of our vehicles. And we've seen pretty substantial improvements in both of those metrics over the long term and over the last couple of quarters. So it is something that remains on our minds. We monitor this very closely. But hopefully, that's a helpful explanation into the context and what we're doing."

And on the Supercharger side, the supercharging team monitors congestion and plans expansion to ensure customer experience with minimal wait times alongside the growth in our vehicle fleet.

We are executing accelerating expansion plans globally. The network has doubled in the last 18 months, and we are planning to triple it over the next 2 years. And even so on an individual-site basis to combat existing congestion more quickly where it is isolated and problematic, we expedite local relief sites, deploy mobile Superchargers, and we try to introduce pricing strategies that encourage more off-peak usage to avoid the waiting."

We won't be providing any kind of forward-looking commentary on our pricing strategy or what may happen here over the near term. With respect to the first part of the question, it has been an interesting thing for us to unpack within the company. I mean what I'll say just as a general statement before I make a couple of specific comments is that the things that we learn on FSD subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant. This is really more of a platform for when FSD beta goes into wide release and the features and functionality become more accessible to more customers.  
The second thing that I'll note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing of FSD subscription, and then you compare that to the cost of either rolling FSD option into your lease or your loan, on a monthly basis, the most economical way for a customer to enjoy the features of full self-driving is through purchasing it upfront and rolling it through their financing. And as a result of that, what we've seen in the data is not -- we're unable to detect a change in the upfront take rate of FSD when people purchase cars. We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks curious to experience what the software has to offer and subscribing to it and enjoying it through that route. But again, as I said at the beginning, I think what we've seen so far on FSD subscription is not terribly relevant. We'll see how that plays out in the future as we continue to release more features."

27444752,1684730799,2408388,"Tesla, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Tesla, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Thank you, Pierre. I'm extremely passionate about our insurance product. We have a terrific team here at Tesla of folks who have been spending a lot of time developing this and probably listening to the call. So we're pretty excited so far, Pierre.",954,"Yes. Thank you, Pierre. I'm extremely passionate about our insurance product. We have a terrific team here at Tesla of folks who have been spending a lot of time developing this and probably listening to the call. So we're pretty excited so far, Pierre. 
So I mean at the highest level here, we entered the insurance market kind of unintentionally, I would say. Our customers were coming to us, complaining that the price of traditional insurance was too high and it was reducing the affordability of a Tesla. And part of our journey here at Tesla is we want as many people as possible to be able to afford our products. That's extremely important to achieving the mission of the company. And if you look at the price of insurance as a percentage of what somebody's monthly payment is, it's quite high. And we spend extreme amounts of effort in manufacturing to take $5 of BOM cost out here or $10 out somewhere else. If we can get $5, $10, $20, $30 out on a monthly payment, you can calculate what that means in terms of reduction of the price of the car if you finance it, and the leverage of improving insurance cost is huge in terms of affordability. 
And so that's kind of the context by which we stepped into this. As we started to do more research, essentially, the tools by which the insurance is traditionally calculated are optimized based upon the existing data, but the existing data is limited. So they -- there's a focus on things like marital status or age or other attributes like that. Accident history is a good one, et cetera. But what essentially happens here is customers who are low risk and don't actually file many claims end up overpaying on their insurance relative to their cost. That overpayment then goes to riskier customers who are essentially being subsidized. And as we looked at this and we looked at the data, we thought this just doesn't seem like it's fair. 
At Tesla, because our cars are connected, because they are essentially computers on wheels, there's enormous amounts of data that we have available to us to be able to assess the attributes of a driver who's operating that car and whether those attributes correlate with safety because we do get a signal when a car has been in an accident. So we've been spending our time looking at hundreds of different variables and also looking at billions of miles of driving history. And we've been able to fit a model that is able to predict, with decent accuracy, the probability of collision over a period of time. 
And the model is not perfect, right? The model is a function of the data that we have available. That data set continues to grow. We continue to experiment with new variables, but we do have a model that works pretty well so far. And from that model, being able to predict frequency of collision, we can then align that against the price curve. And we can have individualized pricing integrated into the car, integrated into the app, integrated into that customer's experience with a feedback loop back to the customer on how they are driving after every drive, the attributes that they were successful on or unsuccessful on, in the tips of things that they can do to improve their safety. So that's what we've developed. 
We then included the safety score as part of the FSD beta enrollment program, where we have almost 150,000 cars currently using a safety score. And I believe the latest data is over 100 million miles of driving. So we've been able to go back and analyze that data. And we've learned 2 things coming from that. The first is that the probability of collision for a customer using a safety score versus not is 30% lower. It's a pretty big difference. It means that the product is working and customers are responding to it. The second thing that we've looked at is what is the probability of collision based upon actual data as a function of a driver safety score. And that is aligning with our models. Most notably, if you're in the top tier of safety compared to lower tiers, there's multiple X difference in probability of collision based upon actual data. So this is a very new and very exciting frontier for us. I know that was long-winded, but I -- we spent a lot of time on this and we put a lot of thought into it. 
Specifically with respect to the rollout, the insurance industry in the U.S. is intensely regulated and it's regulated on a state-by-state level. That means that we require regulatory approvals from each individual department of insurance at each individual state. Texas is the first state that we launched in. I do want to thank the Texas insurance regulators here. You have been great to work with. We have a road map of additional states. We will launch the product in those states as we receive regulatory approvals. And our goal is to be in every major market in which we have cars in. 
The -- we did a soft launch in Texas. Was it last week? Yes. And what we're seeing in initial take rate data is that if you compare that to what we're seeing in California, we're off to a good start here. So we're very excited about it. We're excited about individual risk-based pricing. We're excited about the ability for folks to become safer and, as a result, save money. And it feeds into our priority of a company -- of building the safest products in the world."

We have achieved -- we've actually exceeded our long-term guidance on our operating margin target. So we're very pleased to see that. And as we look out over the next quarter and the next year, there's kind of -- there's a number of puts and takes financially for the company. The launch of Austin and Berlin, we'll have ramp inefficiencies there for some period of time until we get those factories up and running. And so that's likely to put some downward pressure on our margins as those factories ramp. Our goals are to ramp those as quickly as possible. But as Drew mentioned earlier, there are a number of unknown unknowns that we'll need to work through. 
We are kind of also in this uncertain environment with respect to cost structure. So we are seeing cost increase on the commodity side. We're getting feedback from our suppliers, as we are seeing ourselves, the impact of labor shortage. And then logistics and expedite costs just continue to be a part of our story here, and it's uncertain how that will unfold. It's our hope that these things stabilize. Exactly when that happens is difficult to predict, and we have been adjusting pricing in line with those changes in cost. And so we'll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year. So it's difficult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons. 
With respect to operating margin, we've been very focused as a company on managing our overhead expenses and operating expenses. And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has been declining, and I expect that trend to continue to happen. And I think the net of all of this is hopefully that we continue to make progress on operating margin over the next 4 or 5 quarters. 
As we think kind of forward, the business up until this point has kind of largely been a hardware automotive business with a little bit of software on top of that. As full self-driving matures, as take rates increase, if we are to raise pricing on that, there's considerable upside both on gross margins, and operating margin as that comes to light as the business starts to become more of a mix of a hardware-based company and a software-based company. So we feel optimistic about the journey -- very optimistic about the journey as we look over into the long term, just a little bit difficult over the next 4 to 5 quarters. We'll continue to update on earnings calls as we learn more information. There's just a lot of uncertainty in the world right now."

Our primary exposure right now is around nickel and aluminum, nickel on the cell, aluminum on non-cell. And we have a mixture of contracts with various suppliers. Some materials, we contract directly and we have full exposure to price fluctuations. We do have a number of long-term commitments -- long-term contracts in place. We also have contracts where there's some amount of cost-sharing based upon the movement of indexes. And so as these have been moving, some of those costs have been flowing through to us. It's not a substantial amount of cost but it's not small. 
As we look towards the next year, I certainly hope it doesn't play out this way, but it's possible that we continue to see more of cost headwind as a result of these movements. It's difficult to say precisely, but the volatility and the increases are just substantial -- so substantial. And there are certain suppliers that, maybe up to a certain point, have been absorbing some of the increase. And as contracts expire there or we have to renew and extend them, we'll have to return to negotiations. 
And so what we have to do as a company and what we are intensely focused on is we need to be continuing to drive down the cost of our products, which we have been doing. And we have to overcome cost increases that are outside of our control. So whether that's resourcing components or redesigning components or finding ways to be more efficient in manufacturing, we have no choice but to continue on that path and be even more aggressive in the light of the macroeconomics here."

I don't know that I'm going to get into too many specifics, but I guess first, one thing I would say is unlike the commodities discussion we just had, like the anode materials are not really in the same situation just in terms of what their constituent components are. So there's less of a focus on like rapidly changing them one way or the other because they're generally stable commodities. There isn't exactly like a tit for tat where like get a better anode, use less cathode. Like there's a fundamental ratio that you need to maintain for the cell to function. 
So I guess zooming out, the primary focus on the anode side that we have is just ensuring that it doesn't, in any way -- that we are able to continue to reduce the cost of the anode without impeding on the long-term cyclability of the product. It can also help with energy density. As you like sort of improve the energy density of the anode, you improve the energy density of the cell, not directly 1:1 because you have to pack more cathode in as the anode gets better. And that's a focus as well but the trade space is just sort of cycling versus day 1 cost."

Pricing has been a really difficult thing for us over the last couple of quarters. And we're -- part of the challenge is -- well, I mean the great thing that we're seeing in the space right now is there appears to just be quite a profound awakening of the desirability for electric vehicles. And I mean to be totally frank, it's caught us a little bit off guard. And that kind of awakening and changing consumer sentiment, I'm sure there's lots of reasons that go into it, but folks want to buy an electric car and folks want to buy a Tesla right now. It's very exciting for us. 
At the same time, we have installed capacity to build more cars but we're constrained by a number of dynamics, as we've talked about in great detail. And we are putting an extreme effort to build as many cars as we possibly can. It's hard to overstate how extreme the efforts are. It's quite the grind. We're trying as hard as we can to maximize that capacity and to be able to meet the demand that we're receiving. But the net-net of all of this is that we're not able to increase production capacity fast enough. 
So at the same time, we are seeing macroeconomic cost impacts on our structure, as we've discussed previously on the call. So what we're trying to think through -- if somebody orders a car now, it will -- it could be delivered, in some cases, depending upon the car and which factory, could be a couple of months, could be a couple of quarters. And the timing in which we build that car will be just before that car gets delivered. And what will the world look like at that point? And so we're trying to think through, how the cost structure is evolving, how does pricing need to change with that, what are the supply dynamics in the space. 
The other thing that I'll just note on pricing is that companies change pricing all the time. The difference is that when Tesla changes pricing, it's extremely transparent, where that's not always the case otherwise. And sometimes, our pricing will increase. Sometimes, our pricing will reduce. Sometimes, to the public, our pricing changes may not seem to make logical sense. But there is a strategy that we work behind the scenes as we're balancing supply and demand, as we're also trying to balance various shortages on parts, as we're trying to manage wait times. All of that goes into the optimization here."

Two, what is the criteria, for Zach, for you to release revenue -- deferred revenue around FSD? And is having a Level 2 system that needs monitoring enough to release that deferred revenue?

So when you're using full self-driving and you're going through the iterations, you can feel the progress. And for those who don't have it in their cars, social media is excellent at getting a sense for how that's progressing. And the team is moving quickly with every iteration, with every update, and they're working very hard on that. 
On your second question about the criteria to release deferred revenue, the way that this works is we have made certain commitments as to what this product can offer at the time that a customer has purchased that. And so what we have to assess is, have we met those commitments? And is the software widely available to folks that we've made those commitments to within a certain geography? And given that FSD is still currently in the beta phase, it's invitation-only and it's limited, we have not deemed that to be appropriate for recognition of deferred revenue.

I mean as I said earlier, we always cooperate fully with NHTSA and other regulatory bodies in any sort of investigation they may have, particularly related to ADAS systems. When they came out with the standing general order in July, we were quick to respond to that and one of the first and only companies capable of actually meeting the needs of that report. We continue to send that information to them as required, weekly and as incidents occur. 
And with the additional investigations, as I said, we meet that with great sincerity. And we'll work through them one by one to make sure that all the facts come out and that NHTSA is well informed about our strategies for both active safety in this case but also passive safety. As you guys may know, we released updates to our airbag and restraint system last week to Model Y using our fleet data. We worked closely with NHTSA on that, and they were fully in the loop before we did it. So I think these kinds of things will continue to happen in the new regulatory space that Zach discussed as we move towards a software-based vehicle. And we're happy to be a part of that journey."

We have made some early sourcing decisions in that, but I think we'll keep that one internal, and we've already began the first casting-ins of that. Rolling stainless isn't so different from pulling any other material. It's just about how hard the rollers are to get to that hardness level. And just like every manufacturing process we put in for every new vehicle, we'll work with our suppliers and vendors to make sure those time lines and supply meet the need and demand of our customers."

So it remains our target in both Austin and Berlin to be able to build our first production cars before the end of the year. We've talked about this a bit, the unknown unknowns, new factories, new vehicle designs, new technologies, new locations, new teams. So there is quite an execution journey ahead of us. But that remains our target and all of our plans are oriented around that. We -- for -- we should not expect for us to deliver cars by the end of 2021 from these factories even if we do produce them -- so homologation, regulatory reasons. And we'll want to make sure that we build up some number of cars that we're confident in the quality and the customer experience around them. 
The second thing that I'll say -- and I mentioned this in my opening remarks, is because of the newness here, it's extremely difficult for us to be precise in what the ramp will look like. And it's possible things -- the stars align and things move quickly. It's possible that we're spending the bulk of next year working on ramping these factories. It's just very hard to say, and we'll continue to update you all through these calls and through other forums. 
As to how that then impacts our margins, that is also difficult because that is a function of the ramp, which is uncertain. So the benefit here, which is different in the ramp of these factories compared to other factories, is if you think about the percentage of our total cost structure in any given quarter that is associated with new ramps, we have the Fremont factory that's running, generating stable and growing margins there. The same is also true in Shanghai. So I expect we'll see some amount of headwind on margin from these ramps. It's just entirely dependent on how quickly we're able to ramp and what uncertainties come up during the process."

We're continuing to make great progress as a company, setting new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3. Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter and 70% higher than the same",870,"Yes. Thanks, Martin. We're continuing to make great progress as a company, setting new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3. Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter and 70% higher than the same quarter last year. We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter. 
The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory. Additionally, we have made great progress increasing production volumes of Model S and have recently started the ramp and deliveries of Model X. It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes, but based on demand, we are targeting to exceed historical production levels. We have also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub. This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe. 
Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity. It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally difficult to achieve. I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive flexibility as we make adjustments real-time. This team's expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference when managing through these challenges. Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible. I also want to thank our suppliers for their dedication and partnership to Tesla. 
Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending. The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our existing production lines, which is where we are focused.  
Similar dynamics are also playing out on our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts and cells allow us to do so. Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program, and we're excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.  
Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29% excluding regulatory credits, which is our strongest yet. This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes. The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin, and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X.  
As was the case in Q2, there was some net benefit from pricing actions. However, this remains small in the context of other contributors. Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our financials. Note that we are also not yet recognizing additional revenue from the FSD beta program. Supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds as was also the case with FX this quarter. While we are seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjusting pricing, which should help to compensate. 
Overall, as I mentioned in our last call, our P&L continues to benefit from the marginal profitability of each incremental unit with higher fixed cost absorption. As a result of the great progress on margins, volume and appropriate management of overhead costs, we were able to achieve an operating margin of just under 15%, exceeding the long-term guidance we've laid out previously.  
On cash, we generated record operating cash flows of $3.1 billion and continue to invest heavily in the build-out of manufacturing, supercharging and service capacity. We also continue to retire high-interest-rate debt, including the early settlement of our 2025 senior notes of $1.8 billion during the quarter. 
As we look forward, we are clearly quite a bit ahead of the pacing required to achieve our target annual growth rate of 50% this year. Q4 production will depend heavily on availability of parts, but we are driving for continued growth. We are also nearing assembly of our first production cars in Austin and Berlin. It's important to stress, while the first production car is an important milestone, the hardest work lies ahead in the ramp. Please keep in mind that we are pushing the boundaries on new product and manufacturing technologies at these factories, which makes it difficult to predict the exact pace of the ramp. These factories will also partially weigh on our margins as we work towards volume production.  
Overall, I'm very proud of what the team has accomplished and I'm excited for our next phase of growth into Q4 and into 2022. The team has done a tremendous job improving our financial health in a short period of time while also continuing to improve our precision and pace of execution. Thank you."

There may be some periods of time in which we're well ahead of that. There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower than that. But that remains the long-term goal of the company.  
In Fremont, we're continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible there. Over the last 12 months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production. And based upon everything that we know in the factory, where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we're targeting to increase that another 50%. I think that will be a difficult goal but that's the goal that the internal team has, and they're going to continue to push on that.  
As we look towards Shanghai, we're continuing to push the boundaries there and we continue to ramp production there as well, so most recently the ramp-up of the Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3. We'll continue to ramp that factory. And our plans there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.  
Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y, but we've intentionally set these factories in locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and ability to expand. And so we'll take Model Y at these factories. We're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can. And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories. And then we'll add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.  
So our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years and then ultimately, in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year. We're going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a 50% annual growth rate."

As we have been for years, we always engage with NHTSA and other worldwide regulatory bodies to share our knowledge and to work with them on our approaches on both active and passive safety. There are ongoing regulatory inquiries taking place all the time and especially on the subjects like FSD that are at the cutting edge of technology development. During these investigations, my team, myself are always cooperative as much as possible. We expect and embrace the scrutiny of these products and know that the truth about their performance and the innovations our products have will ultimately be all that matters. 
In the end and as I've said on previous calls, we take safety as a top priority in all our designs. This is because our primary motivation is from -- coming from a team of incredible engineers designing software and hardware that saves lives and prevents injuries. In doing so, we'll continue to be transparent to the public on how our technology is both developing from an Autopilot safety data, the latest of which we just shared in the shareholder update, and you can also see and review a wide variety of customer post FSD videos on social media. Back to you."

It's the right thing to do. And if you look at various independent testing and regulatory testing of our products, you can see the work of incredibly talented engineers in the results of those tests. And our goal in developing safety-oriented software around the car is to continue to go beyond what the hardware is able to provide. If you can prevent a crash from happening, that's the safest way to manage this.  
And I think at a macro level here, what we're seeing -- and this is entirely understandable and expected, is that the automotive industry is going through a transition from the traditional car as we know it to more of a computer, software-oriented, sensor suites around them that can manage things beyond just what the driver manages. And regulatory bodies are -- understandably so, are interested in understanding how to regulate in this environment, and NHTSA is no exception to that. So as Lars mentioned here, I think this is a great thing. We're excited to partner and we'll work collaboratively with all regulatory bodies who want -- to go on the journey to the transition to a software-oriented vehicle."

We have seen an increase in service wait times throughout the summer. And there's a couple of things that have contributed to that based upon the information that we have. The first is that -- and I think this is kind of not -- this is not unique to us, is that the return to some sense of normalcy in a post-pandemic world has happened, I think, more quickly than most people expected. And what we're seeing here is that the number of miles that people are driving has increased. There may have been some demand for service during 2020 or in the early parts of 2021 that customers put off, and so there's a bit of a catch-up that's occurring. That has increased demand for service. At the same time, in the macro environment here, logistics, moving parts, sourcing parts has become increasingly more difficult, which is a well-known issue in the world right now, as well as challenges in the labor market. 
And so this kind of the simultaneous increase in demand for service with the ability to supply that service has been impacted for the reasons I mentioned. And so we saw an uptick primarily in Europe and North America in service wait times over the course of the summer. And we've been working extremely hard since then to address this, and we've seen our wait times come down. So this is not the case in every location, but if you think about it from regional average perspective, we are seeing improvements there.  
We remain super-focused on adding locations. And so over the last year, we've grown our physical footprint of service centers by 35%. We've grown our footprint of mobile repair by over 40%. We're also adding staffing as quickly as we can in the areas that are most impacted by the imbalance of supply and demand for service. 
But I think the most important part about all of this is -- and we've said this on calls before, where the best service is no service. And so we have been incredibly focused as a company both on the initial quality of our vehicles and reliability of our vehicles. And we've seen pretty substantial improvements in both of those metrics over the long term and over the last couple of quarters. So it is something that remains on our minds. We monitor this very closely. But hopefully, that's a helpful explanation into the context and what we're doing."

We are executing accelerating expansion plans globally. The network has doubled in the last 18 months, and we are planning to triple it over the next 2 years. And even so on an individual-site basis to combat existing congestion more quickly where it is isolated and problematic, we expedite local relief sites, deploy mobile Superchargers, and we try to introduce pricing strategies that encourage more off-peak usage to avoid the waiting."

We won't be providing any kind of forward-looking commentary on our pricing strategy or what may happen here over the near term. With respect to the first part of the question, it has been an interesting thing for us to unpack within the company. I mean what I'll say just as a general statement before I make a couple of specific comments is that the things that we learn on FSD subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant. This is really more of a platform for when FSD beta goes into wide release and the features and functionality become more accessible to more customers.  
The second thing that I'll note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing of FSD subscription, and then you compare that to the cost of either rolling FSD option into your lease or your loan, on a monthly basis, the most economical way for a customer to enjoy the features of full self-driving is through purchasing it upfront and rolling it through their financing. And as a result of that, what we've seen in the data is not -- we're unable to detect a change in the upfront take rate of FSD when people purchase cars. We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks curious to experience what the software has to offer and subscribing to it and enjoying it through that route. But again, as I said at the beginning, I think what we've seen so far on FSD subscription is not terribly relevant. We'll see how that plays out in the future as we continue to release more features."

I'm extremely passionate about our insurance product. We have a terrific team here at Tesla of folks who have been spending a lot of time developing this and probably listening to the call. So we're pretty excited so far, Pierre.",954,"Yes. Thank you, Pierre. I'm extremely passionate about our insurance product. We have a terrific team here at Tesla of folks who have been spending a lot of time developing this and probably listening to the call. So we're pretty excited so far, Pierre. 
So I mean at the highest level here, we entered the insurance market kind of unintentionally, I would say. Our customers were coming to us, complaining that the price of traditional insurance was too high and it was reducing the affordability of a Tesla. And part of our journey here at Tesla is we want as many people as possible to be able to afford our products. That's extremely important to achieving the mission of the company. And if you look at the price of insurance as a percentage of what somebody's monthly payment is, it's quite high. And we spend extreme amounts of effort in manufacturing to take $5 of BOM cost out here or $10 out somewhere else. If we can get $5, $10, $20, $30 out on a monthly payment, you can calculate what that means in terms of reduction of the price of the car if you finance it, and the leverage of improving insurance cost is huge in terms of affordability. 
And so that's kind of the context by which we stepped into this. As we started to do more research, essentially, the tools by which the insurance is traditionally calculated are optimized based upon the existing data, but the existing data is limited. So they -- there's a focus on things like marital status or age or other attributes like that. Accident history is a good one, et cetera. But what essentially happens here is customers who are low risk and don't actually file many claims end up overpaying on their insurance relative to their cost. That overpayment then goes to riskier customers who are essentially being subsidized. And as we looked at this and we looked at the data, we thought this just doesn't seem like it's fair. 
At Tesla, because our cars are connected, because they are essentially computers on wheels, there's enormous amounts of data that we have available to us to be able to assess the attributes of a driver who's operating that car and whether those attributes correlate with safety because we do get a signal when a car has been in an accident. So we've been spending our time looking at hundreds of different variables and also looking at billions of miles of driving history. And we've been able to fit a model that is able to predict, with decent accuracy, the probability of collision over a period of time. 
And the model is not perfect, right? The model is a function of the data that we have available. That data set continues to grow. We continue to experiment with new variables, but we do have a model that works pretty well so far. And from that model, being able to predict frequency of collision, we can then align that against the price curve. And we can have individualized pricing integrated into the car, integrated into the app, integrated into that customer's experience with a feedback loop back to the customer on how they are driving after every drive, the attributes that they were successful on or unsuccessful on, in the tips of things that they can do to improve their safety. So that's what we've developed. 
We then included the safety score as part of the FSD beta enrollment program, where we have almost 150,000 cars currently using a safety score. And I believe the latest data is over 100 million miles of driving. So we've been able to go back and analyze that data. And we've learned 2 things coming from that. The first is that the probability of collision for a customer using a safety score versus not is 30% lower. It's a pretty big difference. It means that the product is working and customers are responding to it. The second thing that we've looked at is what is the probability of collision based upon actual data as a function of a driver safety score. And that is aligning with our models. Most notably, if you're in the top tier of safety compared to lower tiers, there's multiple X difference in probability of collision based upon actual data. So this is a very new and very exciting frontier for us. I know that was long-winded, but I -- we spent a lot of time on this and we put a lot of thought into it. 
Specifically with respect to the rollout, the insurance industry in the U.S. is intensely regulated and it's regulated on a state-by-state level. That means that we require regulatory approvals from each individual department of insurance at each individual state. Texas is the first state that we launched in. I do want to thank the Texas insurance regulators here. You have been great to work with. We have a road map of additional states. We will launch the product in those states as we receive regulatory approvals. And our goal is to be in every major market in which we have cars in. 
The -- we did a soft launch in Texas. Was it last week? Yes. And what we're seeing in initial take rate data is that if you compare that to what we're seeing in California, we're off to a good start here. So we're very excited about it. We're excited about individual risk-based pricing. We're excited about the ability for folks to become safer and, as a result, save money. And it feeds into our priority of a company -- of building the safest products in the world."

We have achieved -- we've actually exceeded our long-term guidance on our operating margin target. So we're very pleased to see that. And as we look out over the next quarter and the next year, there's kind of -- there's a number of puts and takes financially for the company. The launch of Austin and Berlin, we'll have ramp inefficiencies there for some period of time until we get those factories up and running. And so that's likely to put some downward pressure on our margins as those factories ramp. Our goals are to ramp those as quickly as possible. But as Drew mentioned earlier, there are a number of unknown unknowns that we'll need to work through. 
We are kind of also in this uncertain environment with respect to cost structure. So we are seeing cost increase on the commodity side. We're getting feedback from our suppliers, as we are seeing ourselves, the impact of labor shortage. And then logistics and expedite costs just continue to be a part of our story here, and it's uncertain how that will unfold. It's our hope that these things stabilize. Exactly when that happens is difficult to predict, and we have been adjusting pricing in line with those changes in cost. And so we'll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year. So it's difficult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons. 
With respect to operating margin, we've been very focused as a company on managing our overhead expenses and operating expenses. And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has been declining, and I expect that trend to continue to happen. And I think the net of all of this is hopefully that we continue to make progress on operating margin over the next 4 or 5 quarters. 
As we think kind of forward, the business up until this point has kind of largely been a hardware automotive business with a little bit of software on top of that. As full self-driving matures, as take rates increase, if we are to raise pricing on that, there's considerable upside both on gross margins, and operating margin as that comes to light as the business starts to become more of a mix of a hardware-based company and a software-based company. So we feel optimistic about the journey -- very optimistic about the journey as we look over into the long term, just a little bit difficult over the next 4 to 5 quarters. We'll continue to update on earnings calls as we learn more information. There's just a lot of uncertainty in the world right now."

Our primary exposure right now is around nickel and aluminum, nickel on the cell, aluminum on non-cell. And we have a mixture of contracts with various suppliers. Some materials, we contract directly and we have full exposure to price fluctuations. We do have a number of long-term commitments -- long-term contracts in place. We also have contracts where there's some amount of cost-sharing based upon the movement of indexes. And so as these have been moving, some of those costs have been flowing through to us. It's not a substantial amount of cost but it's not small. 
As we look towards the next year, I certainly hope it doesn't play out this way, but it's possible that we continue to see more of cost headwind as a result of these movements. It's difficult to say precisely, but the volatility and the increases are just substantial -- so substantial. And there are certain suppliers that, maybe up to a certain point, have been absorbing some of the increase. And as contracts expire there or we have to renew and extend them, we'll have to return to negotiations. 
And so what we have to do as a company and what we are intensely focused on is we need to be continuing to drive down the cost of our products, which we have been doing. And we have to overcome cost increases that are outside of our control. So whether that's resourcing components or redesigning components or finding ways to be more efficient in manufacturing, we have no choice but to continue on that path and be even more aggressive in the light of the macroeconomics here."

I don't know that I'm going to get into too many specifics, but I guess first, one thing I would say is unlike the commodities discussion we just had, like the anode materials are not really in the same situation just in terms of what their constituent components are. So there's less of a focus on like rapidly changing them one way or the other because they're generally stable commodities. There isn't exactly like a tit for tat where like get a better anode, use less cathode. Like there's a fundamental ratio that you need to maintain for the cell to function. 
So I guess zooming out, the primary focus on the anode side that we have is just ensuring that it doesn't, in any way -- that we are able to continue to reduce the cost of the anode without impeding on the long-term cyclability of the product. It can also help with energy density. As you like sort of improve the energy density of the anode, you improve the energy density of the cell, not directly 1:1 because you have to pack more cathode in as the anode gets better. And that's a focus as well but the trade space is just sort of cycling versus day 1 cost."

And we're -- part of the challenge is -- well, I mean the great thing that we're seeing in the space right now is there appears to just be quite a profound awakening o",429,"Yes. Pricing has been a really difficult thing for us over the last couple of quarters. And we're -- part of the challenge is -- well, I mean the great thing that we're seeing in the space right now is there appears to just be quite a profound awakening of the desirability for electric vehicles. And I mean to be totally frank, it's caught us a little bit off guard. And that kind of awakening and changing consumer sentiment, I'm sure there's lots of reasons that go into it, but folks want to buy an electric car and folks want to buy a Tesla right now. It's very exciting for us. 
At the same time, we have installed capacity to build more cars but we're constrained by a number of dynamics, as we've talked about in great detail. And we are putting an extreme effort to build as many cars as we possibly can. It's hard to overstate how extreme the efforts are. It's quite the grind. We're trying as hard as we can to maximize that capacity and to be able to meet the demand that we're receiving. But the net-net of all of this is that we're not able to increase production capacity fast enough. 
So at the same time, we are seeing macroeconomic cost impacts on our structure, as we've discussed previously on the call. So what we're trying to think through -- if somebody orders a car now, it will -- it could be delivered, in some cases, depending upon the car and which factory, could be a couple of months, could be a couple of quarters. And the timing in which we build that car will be just before that car gets delivered. And what will the world look like at that point? And so we're trying to think through, how the cost structure is evolving, how does pricing need to change with that, what are the supply dynamics in the space. 
The other thing that I'll just note on pricing is that companies change pricing all the time. The difference is that when Tesla changes pricing, it's extremely transparent, where that's not always the case otherwise. And sometimes, our pricing will increase. Sometimes, our pricing will reduce. Sometimes, to the public, our pricing changes may not seem to make logical sense. But there is a strategy that we work behind the scenes as we're balancing supply and demand, as we're also trying to balance various shortages on parts, as we're trying to manage wait times. All of that goes into the optimization here."

Yet we look at the progress in FSD and some of the issues you see on YouTube, and it looks very much like a Level 2, 2 plus system that requires vigilances, in fact, your disclaimers cite. So I guess 3 questions, kind of one, what is the timetable to get to Level 4 at least capability? We can deal with the regulatory stuff later. 
Two, what is the criteria, for Zach, for you to release revenue -- deferred revenue around FSD? And is having a Level 2 system that needs monitoring enough to release that deferred revenue?

And for those who don't have it in their cars, social media is excellent at getting a sense for how that's progressing. And the team is moving quickly with every iteration, with every update, and they're working very hard on that. 
On your second question about the criteria to release deferred revenue, the way that this works is we have made certain commitments as to what this product can offer at the time that a customer has purchased that. And so what we have to assess is, have we met those commitments? And is the software widely available to folks that we've made those commitments to within a certain geography? And given that FSD is still currently in the beta phase, it's invitation-only and it's limited, we have not deemed that to be appropriate for recognition of deferred revenue. And we'll continue to evolve this. We'll continue to monitor it within the finance team to see when we get to the milestones in which we're comfortable releasing.

We continue to send that information to them as required, weekly and as incidents occur. 
And with the additional investigations, as I said, we meet that with great sincerity. And we'll work through them one by one to make sure that all the facts come out and that NHTSA is well informed about our strategies for both active safety in this case but also passive safety. As you guys may know, we released updates to our airbag and restraint system last week to Model Y using our fleet data. We worked closely with NHTSA on that, and they were fully in the loop before we did it. So I think these kinds of things will continue to happen in the new regulatory space that Zach discussed as we move towards a software-based vehicle. And we're happy to be a part of that journey."

We -- for -- we should not expect for us to deliver cars by the end of 2021 from these factories even if we do produce them -- so homologation, regulatory reasons. And we'll want to make sure that we build up some number of cars that we're confident in the quality and the customer experience around them. 
The second thing that I'll say -- and I mentioned this in my opening remarks, is because of the newness here, it's extremely difficult for us to be precise in what the ramp will look like. And it's possible things -- the stars align and things move quickly. It's possible that we're spending the bulk of next year working on ramping these factories. It's just very hard to say, and we'll continue to update you all through these calls and through other forums. 
As to how that then impacts our margins, that is also difficult because that is a function of the ramp, which is uncertain. So the benefit here, which is different in the ramp of these factories compared to other factories, is if you think about the percentage of our total cost structure in any given quarter that is associated with new ramps, we have the Fremont factory that's running, generating stable and growing margins there. The same is also true in Shanghai. So I expect we'll see some amount of headwind on margin from these ramps. It's just entirely dependent on how quickly we're able to ramp and what uncertainties come up during the process."

We also actually saw a very similar dynamic to this when we were launching Model S earlier in the year. So when a product starts launching and then cost of goods sold starts to activate, depreciation starts to activate, there's a bit of a movement in the P&L as to where that cost resides, so yes, assuming to some extent Brandenburg and Austin costs are already flowing through our P&L. But we still need to continue staffing and ramping and incurring all the operating costs associated with the factory that we're not spending right now."
