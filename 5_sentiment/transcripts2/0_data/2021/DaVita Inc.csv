Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call today to discuss our 2020 performance and thoughts on 2021. For DaVita, 2020 showcase our caregivers and their commitment to patients with kidney disease. COVID created challenges that we could never have imagined 1 year ago. These challenges clinical, operational and financial, led to opportunities for us to harness the strength of our teams and our platform to support our patients and our community. 
When I reflect on the year, 3 things particularly stand out. First, our caregivers team's focus on health and safety of our patients; second, the creativity and innovation showed by our organization to adopt to the changing landscape; and third, the love, empathy and dedication of our teams to each other and to our patients. Despite the good work in 2020, the challenges of COVID remain. The latest search has been particularly difficult for our patients and our care teams. The disproportionate impact COVID has on patients with underlying health issues and the elderly continues to manifest itself in the dialysis community. The higher rates of patient mortality that we talked about last quarter unproportionately accelerated in November and continued through January. We estimate that our patient census at the end of 2020 was approximately 7,000 less than what it would have been otherwise absent COVID. 
As we look to the future, some leading indicators such as fewer new COVID cases, fewer hospitalizations and the recent vaccination efforts give us hope. This leads me to our clinical focus on vaccine. Over the past few months, we've been engaging with the federal government with state agencies and the CDC to identify ways for our caregivers and patients to gain access to the vaccine. We are uniquely positioned to administer vaccine safely and efficiently in our clinics, given our infrastructure, our clinical expertise delivering flu vaccines each year and our ability to monitor patients' health each week. Our conversations with the CDC and federal government are ongoing, and we're getting set up in their direct vaccine distribution system to be ready to start the moment we get the green light. In states like Minnesota and several large counties across California, where we have been able to secure direct allocation, vaccination rates are as high as 70%, both because we have access but also because general acceptance rates are higher when patients see other patients receiving the vaccine. Across much of the rest of the country, the logistics are signing up and the access at separate vaccine sites has been challenging for many patients. Therefore, our ultimate goal remains to obtain direct allocation from the federal government. 
Now on to our financial performance. Despite the challenges of Covet, we significantly outperformed our original financial guidance for 2020. And we knew it would be a tough year to deliver profit growth given the headwinds from [ Calcimetrics ] revenue decline and the cost of [ FID ] in the ballot initiative in California. When COVID hit, the challenging delivered growth only increased as COVID created significant uncertainty on our financial results. Despite this uncertainty, we grew our [ adjusted ] operating absent the impact of [ Casmed ], valid cost and net COVID impact. 
We delivered growth in adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of 34% and generated free cash flow from continuing operations of almost $1.2 billion, while returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders through our share buyback. In Q4 specifically, we experienced a net COVID impact of approximately $60 million which was higher than we expected. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, the net COVID impact was reduced as the increased costs associated with COVID were offset by lower benefits, travel and G&A spend. 
In Q4, we saw an accelerated impact of higher mortality coming out of the holiday season, combined with fewer offsets in benefits and G&A expenses. The result was a negative COVID impact that was roughly $35 million higher than what we anticipated, bringing our Q4 earnings below the guidance range we provided last quarter. Excluding this increased COVID impact in Q4, our earnings would have been in the middle of our guidance range. 
As we look ahead to the coming year, our guidance range will be $7.75 to $8.75 per share, which incorporates our expected impact of COVID and demonstrates our belief in the underlying earnings growth of our business. We believe that our core performance in 2020 creates a solid foundation for us to deliver on the long-term financial goals. Before I hand it over to Joel to cover our quarter and our outlook in greater detail, let me touch briefly on our recent Medicare Advantage Enrollment. As a reminder, 2021 is the first year in which existing dialysis patients have the option to enroll in the Medicare Advantage plan. 
Previously, MA coverage for ESRD had been limited only to patients already enrolled in MA plans before kidney failure or to certain patients in MA special need plans. By the end of 2020, the percentage of our Medicare patients who were enrolled in MA plant was approaching 30%. And based on our preliminary enrollment data, we now expect our percentage of MA patients among Medicare care patients to be in the mid-30s in 2021, which is still below the national average. As you would expect, the new enrollment was predominantly for Medicare patients previously without secondary coverage because these patients will benefit from the expanded benefit of MA and the cap on out-of-pocket expenses. 
The growth in the ESR DMA population creates opportunities for us to build additional momentum toward value-based care that we've been investing. This is an exciting trend, and we're eager to lead the way with our payer and nephrology partners to deliver comprehensive care to our patients, which we believe will help lead to better clinical outcomes and lower overall cost of care. Our 2021 guidance range reflects our expected cost and investments to build our model of care for our value-based agreement. 
Now let me hand it over to Joel."
35644,702692257,2206986,"DaVita Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Javier. I'll begin with some additional color on our Q4 results and then focus on our 2021 guidance. Our full year 2020 results exceeded our initial expectations and the core earnings power of the business remains strong. However, our Q4 results r",806,"Thanks, Javier. I'll begin with some additional color on our Q4 results and then focus on our 2021 guidance. Our full year 2020 results exceeded our initial expectations and the core earnings power of the business remains strong. However, our Q4 results reflect the strong headwinds from the latest COVID surge. Operating income was $382 million and earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.67, below the guidance from our last earnings call. The middle of our adjusted EPS guidance range contemplated to the net headwind from COVID of approximately $25 million. However, as Javier referenced, the actual impact was approximately $60 million. Excluding the impact of COVID, our EPS from continuing operations would have been in the middle of our adjusted guidance range. 
Relative to Q3, we experienced changes in first mortality which has had a compounding effect throughout the year; second, a reduction in expense offsets in the quarter, particularly related to the healthcare costs for our teammates which have helped to temper the net financial impact of COVID in Q2 and in Q3; and third, higher direct costs related to COVID, including certain benefits to help our frontline teammates with the hardships of COVID and higher PPE costs. 
Other than COVID, notable factors for the quarter include: non-acquired growth of negative 0.3% due to the monthly mortality trend worsening during the quarter; revenue per treatment was up in the quarter as a result of normal fluctuations in Medicare reimbursement and seasonality; patient care costs increased sequentially primarily due to various impacts of COVID that I previously mentioned; g&A decreased sequentially, primarily due to the elimination of ballot cost; and we saw continued core profit in our international business, offset by a [ $6 million ] foreign exchange loss. In the fourth quarter, we purchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock. And additionally, to date, in 2021, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares. So our share count as of today is approximately $109 million. When estimating our diluted share count in your models, you need to consider the dilutive impact of EPS of outstanding equity awards, which, in the fourth quarter, was approximately 4.3 million shares. 
Looking forward to 2021. As you can see in the press release, our guidance for adjusted operating income is $1.675 billion to $1.825 billion, adjusted earnings per share is $7.75 to $8.75, and free cash flow is $900 million, $1.15 billion. Our guidance ranges are wider than in a typical year. This is the result of the wide range of potential impact of COVID on our 2021 results. 
At the midpoint of our range, we have incorporated an estimate of the net cost associated with COVID of approximately $200 million. Declining treatment volume as a result of higher mortality is the primary driver of the growing impact relative to 2020. Our guidance assumes that the higher mortality will continue for the first half of 2021 and return closer to pre-COVID level in the second half of the year as a result of widespread use of effective vaccine. However, COVID does introduce a significantly higher level of uncertainty in our forecast, and there are certain scenarios that could result in our performing outside this range. 
Looking through the impact of COVID, we believe that 2021 will be another year of solid underlying operating income growth with strong free cash flow, and we expect to continue to invest in our strategy and in innovation. 
Let me now provide a few additional details on our outlook. Ballad cost should be a significant year-over-year tailwind we spent approximately $67 million in 2020 to defeat the ballot initiative in California. As 2021 is not a general election year, we do not expect this expense to occur. Calcimimetics should be relatively flat year-over-year, although the quarterly contribution will be evenly spread throughout 2021 rather than the declining trend we experienced in 2020. Now that calcimimetics has become a permanent component of our Medicare run rate, we will no longer call out the financial impact going forward. 
Other swing factors include the benefit from increasing Medicare Advantage Enrollment, offset by our investment in our value-based program. These investments include G&A costs associated with enhancing our model of care and start-up costs associated with new contracts. A few more quick notes on 2021. We expect our capital expenditures in 2021 to be similar to our 2020 spend. A reminder that our current run rate interest expense is $60 million to $65 million per quarter. We expect tax rates to remain between 26% and 28%, absent any material changes from the new administration. And as usual, Q1 has 2 fewer treatment days in Q4 and higher bad debt and payroll taxes. Year-over-year, Q1 will have 0.6 fewer treatment days than last year because of the leap year. 
With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

And we think about the upside from that 3%, and that's in the same range as the excess spending we're doing in 2021 related to the growth of our value-based contract business, what we call IKC or Integrated Kidney care. 
So a positive from that extra 3% and an investment related to Integrated Kidney Care and those 2 things are roughly in the same ballpark. So think of those as a wash in terms of impact on 2021 OI growth."

And then secondly, can you help us understand like -- it's really helpful $140 million, but how much revenue you're losing there so we can kind of try to understand the decremental margin on that loss business and maybe think about as things normalize, what that could be going forward?"

Let me clear up how we're thinking about the $200 million. And in many ways, mimics what we saw in 2020. I would bucket our COVID impact into 3 categories. One is the direct costs associated",421,"Sure. So first, let me just clear up -- you keep using the 140. Let me clear up how we're thinking about the $200 million. And in many ways, mimics what we saw in 2020. I would bucket our COVID impact into 3 categories. One is the direct costs associated with COVID and think of enhanced benefits we're giving to teammates to help them with the hardship associated with COVID. Think of increased PPE spend. So that's bucket one. Bucket 2 are the offsets, lower T&E, the Medicare sequestration revenue, lower benefits as a self insured employer. And what we saw in 2020 is those were big numbers, but they generally offset each other. It wasn't true quarter-to-quarter, and that's why you see some of the big swing from Q3 to Q4. 
But if you look at the full year, those 2 numbers offset each other, and the net impact in 2020 was the result to this accumulating loss treatments associated with some of our patients passing away as a result of COVID. So you can think of $60 million as the impact in 2020 associated with mortality. That $60 million in the scenario we laid out grows to $200 million next year. And again, in 2021, we're anticipating more or less that the increased costs will be offset -- by the offsets, although the costs will come down and the offsets will come down. And the nature of the cost will be a little bit different. 
PPE, we anticipate will remain elevated as the unit cost of some of the PPE stays high. Obviously, we'll keep the sequestration for Q1, but that will go away. We think T&E will remain low, but the health benefits associated with team mates will come down. So again, direct costs and offsets blend to roughly 0, and the $200 million is the impact from mortality. 
Now let me get to your fundamental question. Two things. Yes, the patients who are passing away from COVID are older on average than our average patient. And as a result, they're more likely to have Medicare and the commercial mix there is lower. In terms of thinking about the -- how it impacts our cost structure, it's tough to model. It depends on where these patients are, how long it takes, over what period this extends but it is safe to say that our G&A, you can think of it as relatively fixed and our patient care costs are -- a majority of our patient costs are variable."

That, though, the lost treatments associated with those patients who unfortunately have passed away early, that remains through the back half of the year. And unfortunately, will remain through 2022. So those treatments are lost. And what you would see in the back half of the year is you'd hopefully you'd see MAG bottoming out and starting to increase in the back half of the year, but it will take some time for the lost treatments to play through the system. So I don't think you can say the back half of the year will not be impacted by COVID, it certainly will be impacted by COVID."

So if you think about all the other factors that impact NAG in terms of treatment and volume -- in terms of transplant volume and new to ESRD admits, that stuff has largely returned to normal. So we're not anticipating much impact of that. So the NAG",426,"Yes. So if you think about all the other factors that impact NAG in terms of treatment and volume -- in terms of transplant volume and new to ESRD admits, that stuff has largely returned to normal. So we're not anticipating much impact of that. So the NAG story for 2021 is largely around the mortality question. If you think about Q1, and I'll talk in terms of the NAG, we see NAG continuing to decline in Q1 and then again in Q2. And this is really driven by the of increasing mortality. And then it's hard to know where it will bottom out. Again, there's a lot of uncertainty here. But in terms of trying to see what the NAG might be in Q2, you could anticipate something as low as negative 2% or even negative 3% for that 1 quarter and that it will start to recover from there. 
If you thought about the full year 2021 NAG, again, we're not guiding to NAG, but just to help you all think about this. I think it's safe to think of a negative NAG for the full year, certainly, probably -- I think it's reasonable to model it as somewhere in the negative 1% and negative 2%. And then turn [indiscernible] number, so you wouldn't see it return to normal until mid-2022. 
And then the one other thing I'd point out about NAG is once the mortality has worked its way through the system in terms of -- on a quarterly basis, we're not seeing excess mortality and once you've had a full year for the lagging effect of NAG to play through, then you would anticipate us having a bit of a tailwind associated with NAG. The unfortunate mortality that we've seen as a result of COVID should lead to a lower mortality over the next few years as a result of some of the patients who passed away of COVID would have otherwise passed away in 2022 or 2023, et cetera. So you'll certainly see a real headwind on NAG in 2021, and you'd expect a bit of a hangover from that in 2022. 
But going forward from the back half of 2022. And again, this is all caveated on our scenario, whereby the vaccines work and our patients get access to them, you'd start seeing a NAG that would be higher than normal in the back half of 2022. And I apologize for how many numbers I'm throwing around than how confusing this can be. So if anything wasn't clear, please follow-up."

PPE costs are something that remain a relatively dynamic issue, less in terms of volume utilization and more in terms of price additional government assistance is certainly a possibility extending the sequestration halt or something like that.

And specifically, as we think about the shift to home, whether it's PD or HD.

And to me, 4%, it's a solid, stable year of the core with this very challenging, very uncertain calcimimetic Covid on top of it. The 4%, it's kind of what our normal year would look like, low to mid single-digit revenue growth, stable margins, again, driven by RPT increases below inflation. Good cost management.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call today to discuss our 2020 performance and thoughts on 2021. For DaVita, 2020 showcased our caregivers and their commitment to patients with kidney disease. COVID created challenges that we could never have imagined 1 year ago. These challenges, clinical, operational and financial, led to opportunities for us to harness the strength of our teams and our platforms to support our patients and our community. When I reflect on the year, 3 things particularly stand out.
First, our caregivers team's focus on health and safety of our patients; second, the creativity and innovation showed by our organization to adopt to the changing landscape; and third, the love, empathy and dedication of our teams to each other and to our patients.
Despite the good work in 2020, the challenges of COVID remain. The latest search has been particularly difficult for our patients and our care teams. The disproportionate impact COVID has on patients with underlying health issues and the elderly continues to manifest itself in the dialysis community. The higher rates of patient mortality that we talked about last quarter unfortunately accelerated in November and continued through January. We estimate that our patient census at the end of 2020 was approximately 7,000 less than what it would have been otherwise absent COVID.
As we look to the future, some leading indicators such as fewer new COVID cases, fewer hospitalizations and the recent vaccination efforts give us hope.
This leads me to our clinical focus on vaccine. Over the past few months, we've been engaging with the federal government with state agencies and the CDC to identify ways for our caregivers and patients to gain access to the vaccine. We are uniquely positioned to administer vaccine safely and efficiently in our clinics, given our infrastructure, our clinical expertise delivering flu vaccines each year and our ability to monitor patients' health each week. Our conversations with the CDC and federal government are ongoing, and we're getting set up in their direct vaccine distribution system to be ready to start the moment we get the green light.
In states like Minnesota and several large counties across California, where we have been able to secure direct allocation, vaccination rates are as high as 70%, both because we have access but also because general acceptance rates are higher when patients see other patients receiving the vaccine. Across much of the rest of the country, the logistics are signing up and the access at separate vaccine sites has been challenging for many patients. Therefore, our ultimate goal remains to obtain direct allocation from the federal government.
Now on to our financial performance. Despite the challenges of COVID, we significantly outperformed our original financial guidance for 2020. And we knew it would be a tough year to deliver profit growth given the headwinds from calcimimetic revenue decline and the cost of [ fighting ] in the ballot initiative in California. When COVID hit, the [ challenging ] delivered growth only increased as COVID created significant uncertainty on our financial results. Despite this uncertainty, we grew our adjusted operating income by double digits, absent the impact of calcimimetics, ballot cost and net COVID impact.
We delivered growth in adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of 34% and generated free cash flow from continuing operations of almost $1.2 billion, while returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders through our share buyback. In Q4 specifically, we experienced a net COVID impact of approximately $60 million which was higher than we expected. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, the net COVID impact was reduced as the increased costs associated with COVID were offset by lower benefits, travel and G&A spend. 
In Q4, we saw an accelerated impact of higher mortality coming out of the holiday season, combined with fewer offsets in benefits and G&A expenses. The result was a negative COVID impact that was roughly $35 million higher than what we anticipated, bringing our Q4 earnings below the guidance range we provided last quarter. Excluding this increased COVID impact in Q4, our earnings would have been in the middle of our guidance range.  
As we look ahead to the coming year, our guidance range will be $7.75 to $8.75 per share, which incorporates our expected impact of COVID and demonstrates our belief in the underlying earnings growth of our business. We believe that our core performance in 2020 creates a solid foundation for us to deliver on the long-term financial goals.
Before I hand it over to Joel to cover our quarter and our outlook in greater detail, let me touch briefly on our recent Medicare Advantage enrollment.
As a reminder, 2021 is the first year in which existing dialysis patients have the option to enroll in the Medicare Advantage plan. Previously, MA coverage for ESRD had been limited only to patients already enrolled in MA plans before kidney failure or to certain patients in MA Special Needs Plans. By the end of 2020, the percentage of our Medicare patients who were enrolled in MA plans was approaching 30%. And based on our preliminary enrollment data, we now expect our percentage of MA patients among Medicare care patients to be in the mid-30s in 2021, which is still below the national average.
As you would expect, the new enrollment was predominantly for Medicare patients previously without secondary coverage because these patients will benefit from the expanded benefit of MA and the cap on out-of-pocket expenses.
The growth in the ESRD MA population creates opportunities for us to build additional momentum toward value-based care that we've been investing. This is an exciting trend, and we're eager to lead the way with our payer and nephrology partners to deliver comprehensive care to our patients, which we believe will help lead to better clinical outcomes and lower overall cost of care. Our 2021 guidance range reflects our expected cost and investments to build our model of care for our value-based agreement.
Now let me hand it over to Joel."

I'll begin with some additional color on our Q4 results and then focus on our 2021 guidance. Our full year 2020 results exceeded our initial expectations, and the core earnings power of the business remains strong. However, our Q4 results",805,"Thanks, Javier. I'll begin with some additional color on our Q4 results and then focus on our 2021 guidance. Our full year 2020 results exceeded our initial expectations, and the core earnings power of the business remains strong. However, our Q4 results reflect the strong headwinds from the latest COVID surge. Operating income was $382 million and earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.67, below the guidance from our last earnings call.
The middle of our adjusted EPS guidance range contemplated to the net headwind from COVID of approximately $25 million. However, as Javier referenced, the actual impact was approximately $60 million. Excluding the impact of COVID, our EPS from continuing operations would have been in the middle of our adjusted guidance range.
Relative to Q3, we experienced changes in first mortality which has had a compounding effect throughout the year; second, a reduction in expense offsets in the quarter, particularly related to the healthcare costs for our teammates, which have helped to temper the net financial impact of COVID in Q2 and then in Q3; and third, higher direct costs related to COVID, including certain benefits to help our frontline teammates with the hardships of COVID and higher PPE costs.  
Other than COVID, notable factors for the quarter include non-acquired growth of negative 0.3% due to the monthly mortality trend worsening during the quarter. Revenue per treatment was up in the quarter as a result of normal fluctuations in Medicare reimbursement and seasonality. Patient care costs increased sequentially primarily due to various impacts of COVID that I previously mentioned; G&A decreased sequentially, primarily due to the elimination of ballot cost; and we saw continued core profit in our international business, offset by a $6 million foreign exchange loss.
In the fourth quarter, we purchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock. And additionally, to date, in 2021, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares. So our share count as of today is approximately 109 million. When estimating our diluted share count in your models, you need to consider the dilutive impact of EPS of outstanding equity awards, which, in the fourth quarter, was approximately 4.3 million shares. 
Looking forward to 2021. As you can see in the press release, our guidance for adjusted operating income is $1.675 billion to $1.825 billion, adjusted earnings per share is $7.75 to $8.75, and free cash flow is $900 million, $1.15 billion. Our guidance ranges are wider than in a typical year. This is the result of the wide range of potential impact of COVID on our 2021 results.
At the midpoint of our range, we have incorporated an estimate of the net cost associated with COVID of approximately $200 million. Declining treatment volume as a result of higher mortality is the primary driver of the growing impact relative to 2020. Our guidance assumes that the higher mortality will continue for the first half of 2021 and return closer to pre-COVID levels in the second half of the year as a result of widespread use of effective vaccine. 
However, COVID does introduce a significantly higher level of uncertainty in our forecast, and there are certain scenarios that could result in our performing outside this range. 
Looking through the impact of COVID, we believe that 2021 will be another year of solid underlying operating income growth with strong free cash flow, and we expect to continue to invest in our strategy and in innovation. 
Let me now provide a few additional details on our outlook. Ballot cost should be a significant year-over-year tailwind we spent approximately $67 million in 2020 to defeat the ballot initiative in California. As 2021 is not a general election year, we do not expect this expense to occur.
Calcimimetics should be relatively flat year-over-year, although the quarterly contribution will be evenly spread throughout 2021 rather than the declining trend we experienced in 2020. Now that calcimimetics has become a permanent component of our Medicare run rate, we will no longer call out the financial impact going forward.  
Other swing factors include the benefit from increasing Medicare Advantage enrollment, offset by our investment in our value-based program. These investments include G&A costs associated with enhancing our model of care and start-up costs associated with new contracts.
A few more quick notes on 2021. We expect our capital expenditures in 2021 to be similar to our 2020 spend. A reminder that our current run rate interest expense is $60 million to $65 million per quarter. We expect tax rates to remain between 26% and 28%, absent any material changes from the new administration. And as usual, Q1 has 2 fewer treatment days in Q4 and higher bad debt and payroll taxes. Year-over-year, Q1 will have 0.6 fewer treatment days than last year because of the leap year.
With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

So first, let me just clear up -- you keep using the $140 million. Let me clear up how we're thinking about the $200 million. And in many ways, mimics what we saw in 2020. I would bucket our COVID impact into 3 categories. One is the direct costs as",419,"Sure. So first, let me just clear up -- you keep using the $140 million. Let me clear up how we're thinking about the $200 million. And in many ways, mimics what we saw in 2020. I would bucket our COVID impact into 3 categories. One is the direct costs associated with COVID and think of enhanced benefits we're giving to teammates to help them with the hardship associated with COVID. Think of increased PPE spend. So that's bucket one.
Bucket 2 are the offsets, lower T&E, the Medicare sequestration revenue, lower benefits as a self-insured employer. And what we saw in 2020 is those were big numbers, but they generally offset each other. It wasn't true quarter-to-quarter, and that's why you see some of the big swing from Q3 to Q4. But if you look at the full year, those 2 numbers offset each other, and the net impact in 2020 was the result to this accumulating loss treatments associated with some of our patients passing away as a result of COVID.
So you can think of $60 million as the impact in 2020 associated with mortality. That $60 million in the scenario we laid out grows to $200 million next year. And again, in 2021, we're anticipating more or less that the increased costs will be offset by the offsets, although the costs will come down and the offsets will come down. And the nature of the cost will be a little bit different.
PPE, we anticipate will remain elevated as the unit cost of some of the PPE stays high. Obviously, we'll keep the sequestration for Q1, but that will go away. We think T&E will remain low, but the health benefits associated with teammates will come down. So again, direct costs and offsets blend to roughly 0, and the $200 million is the impact from mortality.  
Now let me get to your fundamental question. Two things. Yes, the patients who are passing away from COVID are older on average than our average patient. And as a result, they're more likely to have Medicare and the commercial mix there is lower in terms of thinking about the -- how it impacts our cost structure, it's tough to model. It depends on where these patients are, how long it takes, over what period this extends but it is safe to say that our G&A, you can think of it as relatively fixed and our patient care costs are -- a majority of our patient costs are variable."

So let me clarify what we meant by the front half of the year. What we were saying in the scenario we're painting there is that the lost -- the increased mortality that we are seeing in our patient population as a result of COVID would be highly concentrated in the front half of the year. That, though, the lost treatments associated with those patients who unfortunately have passed away early, that remains through the back half of the year. And unfortunately, will remain through 2022. So those treatments are lost.
And what you would see in the back half of the year is you'd hopefully you'd see NAG bottoming out and starting to increase in the back half of the year, but it will take some time for the lost treatments to play through the system. So I don't think you can say the back half of the year will not be impacted by COVID, it certainly will be impacted by COVID."

So if you think about all the other factors that impact NAG in terms of treatment and volume -- in terms of transplant volume and new to ESRD admits, that stuff has largely returned to normal. So we're not anticipating much impact of that. So the NAG",439,"Yes. So if you think about all the other factors that impact NAG in terms of treatment and volume -- in terms of transplant volume and new to ESRD admits, that stuff has largely returned to normal. So we're not anticipating much impact of that. So the NAG story for 2021 is largely around the mortality question.
If you think about Q1, and I'll talk in terms of the NAG, we see NAG continuing to decline in Q1 and then again in Q2. And this is really driven by this scenario we painted of increasing mortality. And then it's hard to know where it will bottom out. Again, there's a lot of uncertainty here. But in terms of trying to see what the NAG might be in Q2, you could anticipate something as low as negative 2% or even negative 3% for that 1 quarter and that it will start to recover from there. 
If you thought about the full year 2021 NAG, again, we're not guiding to NAG, but just to help you all think about this, I think it's safe to think of a negative NAG for the full year, certainly, probably -- I think it's reasonable to model it as somewhere in the negative 1% and negative 2%. And then you don't see NAG really return -- remember NAG is a year-over-year number, so you wouldn't see it return to normal until mid-2022.
And then the one other thing I'd point out about NAG is once the mortality has worked its way through the system in terms of -- on a quarterly basis, we're not seeing excess mortality and once you've had a full year for the lagging effect of NAG to play through, then you would anticipate us having a bit of a tailwind associated with NAG. The unfortunate mortality that we've seen as a result of COVID should lead to a lower mortality over the next few years as a result of some of the patients who passed away of COVID would have otherwise passed away in 2022 or 2023, et cetera.
So you'll certainly see a real headwind on NAG in 2021, and you'd expect a bit of a hangover from that in 2022. But going forward from the back half of 2022. And again, this is all caveated on our scenario, whereby the vaccines work and our patients get access to them, you'd start seeing a NAG that would be higher than normal in the back half of 2022. And I apologize for how many numbers I'm throwing around than how confusing this can be. So if anything wasn't clear, please follow-up."

So this -- so [ 19 50, ] you'd get about a 4% growth rate. And that's how I think about how is the core doing year-over-year.
And to me, 4%, it's a solid, stable year of the core with this very challenging, very uncertain calcimimetic COVID on top of it. The 4%, it's kind of what our normal year would look like, low to mid single-digit revenue growth, stable margins, again, driven by RPT increases below inflation. Good cost management. I talked about the MA and the IKC offsetting themselves. So that's how I think about the 4% growth. It's just -- it's a stable, steady year masked by COVID."

So if you're going to average 35% in 2021, that's quite a pickup. I know you're saying it's more or like 28% and some would always happen to be incremental, but it's obviously very well understood that MA payers paid above fee-for-service. I can understand why you don't want to disclose that differential, but we all had estimates of it.
So if we were going to see MA penetration go to 35%, we had estimates of what that meant to you in terms of incremental rate and EBITDA. So I guess the question is, has the movement making all dialysis patients eligible for MA, has that created some price compression in that historic MA book? Because it doesn't sound like with capitation being so small that the related investments to that would be enough to offset our estimates of your incremental rate pickup. So any color around that would be helpful."

When I reflect on the year, 3 things particularly stand out. First, our caregivers team's focus on health and safety of our patients; second, the creativity and innovation showed by our organization to adapt to the changing landscape; and third, the love, empathy and dedication of our teams to each other and to our patients.
Despite the good work in 2020, the challenges of COVID remain. The latest search has been particularly difficult for our patients and our care teams. The disproportionate impact COVID has on patients with underlying health issues and the elderly continues to manifest itself in the dialysis community. The higher rates of patient mortality that we talked about last quarter unfortunately accelerated in November and continued through January. We estimate that our patient census at the end of 2020 was approximately 7,000 less than what it would have been otherwise absent COVID.
As we look to the future, some leading indicators such as fewer new COVID cases, fewer hospitalizations and the recent vaccination efforts give us hope.
This leads me to our clinical focus on vaccines. Over the past few months, we've been engaging with the federal government with state agencies and the CDC to identify ways for our caregivers and patients to gain access to the vaccine. We are uniquely positioned to administer vaccines safely and efficiently in our clinics, given our infrastructure, our clinical expertise delivering flu vaccines each year and our ability to monitor patients' health each week. Our conversations with the CDC and federal government are ongoing, and we're getting set up in their direct vaccine distribution system to be ready to start the moment we get the green light.
In states like Minnesota and several large counties across California, where we have been able to secure direct allocation, vaccination rates are as high as 70%, both because we have access but also because general acceptance rates are higher when patients see other patients receiving the vaccine. Across much of the rest of the country, the logistics are signing up and the access at separate vaccine sites has been challenging for many patients. Therefore, our ultimate goal remains to obtain direct allocation from the federal government.
Now onto our financial performance. Despite the challenges of COVID, we significantly outperformed our original financial guidance for 2020. We knew it would be a tough year to deliver profit growth given the headwinds from calcimimetic revenue decline and the cost of fighting in the ballot initiative in California. When COVID hit, the challenge to deliver growth only increased as COVID created significant uncertainty on our financial results. Despite this uncertainty, we grew our adjusted operating income by double digits, absent the impact of calcimimetics, ballot cost and net COVID impact.
We delivered growth in adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of 34% and generated free cash flow from continuing operations of almost $1.2 billion, while returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders through our share buyback. In Q4 specifically, we experienced a net COVID impact of approximately $60 million which was higher than we expected. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, the net COVID impact was reduced as the increased costs associated with COVID were offset by lower benefits, travel and G&A spend. In Q4, we saw an accelerated impact of higher mortality coming out of the holiday season, combined with fewer offsets in benefits and G&A expenses. The result was a negative COVID impact that was roughly $35 million higher than what we anticipated, bringing our Q4 earnings below the guidance range we provided last quarter. Excluding this increased COVID impact in Q4, our earnings would have been in the middle of our guidance range.  
As we look ahead to the coming year, our guidance range will be $7.75 to $8.75 per share, which incorporates our expected impact of COVID and demonstrates our belief in the underlying earnings growth of our business. We believe that our core performance in 2020 creates a solid foundation for us to deliver on the long-term financial goals.
Before I hand it over to Joel to cover our quarter and our outlook in greater detail, let me touch briefly on our recent Medicare Advantage enrollment.
As a reminder, 2021 is the first year in which existing dialysis patients have the option to enroll in the Medicare Advantage plan. Previously, MA coverage for ESRD had been limited only to patients already enrolled in MA plans before kidney failure or to certain patients in MA Special Needs Plans. By the end of 2020, the percentage of our Medicare patients who were enrolled in MA plans was approaching 30%. And based on our preliminary enrollment data, we now expect our percentage of MA patients among Medicare patients to be in the mid-30s in 2021, which is still below the national average.
As you would expect, the new enrollment was  predominantly for Medicare patients previously without secondary coverage because these patients will benefit from the expanded benefit of MA and the cap on out-of-pocket expenses.
The growth in the ESRD MA population creates opportunities for us to build additional momentum toward value-based care that we've been investing. This is an exciting trend, and we're eager to lead the way with our payer and nephrology partners to deliver comprehensive care to our patients, which we believe will help lead to better clinical outcomes and lower overall cost of care. Our 2021 guidance range reflects our expected cost and investments to build our model of care for our value-based agreement.
Now let me hand it over to Joel."

I'll begin with some additional color on our Q4 results and then focus on our 2021 guidance. Our full year 2020 results exceeded our initial expectations, and the core earnings power of the business remains strong. However, our Q4 results",804,"Thanks, Javier. I'll begin with some additional color on our Q4 results and then focus on our 2021 guidance. Our full year 2020 results exceeded our initial expectations, and the core earnings power of the business remains strong. However, our Q4 results reflect the strong headwinds from the latest COVID surge. Operating income was $382 million and earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.67, below the guidance from our last earnings call.
The middle of our adjusted EPS guidance range contemplated a net headwind from COVID of approximately $25 million. However, as Javier referenced, the actual impact was approximately $60 million. Excluding the impact of COVID, our EPS from continuing operations would have been in the middle of our adjusted guidance range.
Relative to Q3, we experienced changes in first mortality which has had a compounding effect throughout the year; second, a reduction in expense offsets in the quarter, particularly related to the healthcare costs for our teammates, which have helped to temper the net financial impact of COVID in Q2 and then in Q3; and third, higher direct costs related to COVID, including certain benefits to help our frontline teammates with the hardships of COVID and higher PPE costs.  
Other than COVID, notable factors for the quarter include non-acquired growth of negative 0.3% due to the monthly mortality trend worsening during the quarter. Revenue per treatment was up in the quarter as a result of normal fluctuations in Medicare reimbursement and seasonality. Patient care costs increased sequentially primarily due to various impacts of COVID that I previously mentioned; G&A decreased sequentially, primarily due to the elimination of ballot cost; and we saw continued core profit in our international business, offset by a $6 million foreign exchange loss.
In the fourth quarter, we purchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock. And additionally, to date, in 2021, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares, so our share count as of today is approximately 109 million. When estimating our diluted share count in your models, you need to consider the dilutive impact of EPS of outstanding equity awards, which, in the fourth quarter, was approximately 4.3 million shares. 
Looking forward to 2021. As you can see in the press release, our guidance for adjusted operating income is $1.675 billion to $1.825 billion, adjusted earnings per share is $7.75 to $8.75, and free cash flow is $900 million, $1.15 billion. Our guidance ranges are wider than in a typical year. This is the result of the wide range of potential impacts of COVID on our 2021 results.
At the midpoint of our range, we have incorporated an estimate of the net cost associated with COVID of approximately $200 million. Declining treatment volume as a result of higher mortality is the primary driver of the growing impact relative to 2020. Our guidance assumes that the higher mortality will continue for the first half of 2021 and return closer to pre-COVID levels in the second half of the year as a result of widespread use of effective vaccine. However, COVID does introduce a significantly higher level of uncertainty in our forecast, and there are certain scenarios that could result in our performing outside this range. 
Looking through the impact of COVID, we believe that 2021 will be another year of solid underlying operating income growth with strong free cash flow, and we expect to continue to invest in our strategy and in innovation. 
Let me now provide a few additional details on our outlook. Ballot cost should be a significant year-over-year tailwind we spent approximately $67 million in 2020 to defeat the ballot initiative in California. As 2021 is not a general election year, we do not expect this expense to occur.
Calcimimetics should be relatively flat year-over-year, although the quarterly contribution will be evenly spread throughout 2021 rather than the declining trend we experienced in 2020. Now that calcimimetics has become a permanent component of our Medicare run rate, we will no longer call out the financial impact going forward.  
Other swing factors include the benefit from increasing Medicare Advantage enrollment, offset by our investment in our value-based program. These investments include G&A costs associated with enhancing our model of care and start-up costs associated with new contracts.
A few more quick notes on 2021. We expect our capital expenditures in 2021 to be similar to our 2020 spend. A reminder that our current run rate interest expense is $60 million to $65 million per quarter. We expect tax rates to remain between 26% and 28%, absent any material changes from the new administration. And as usual, Q1 has 2 fewer treatment days in Q4 and higher bad debt and payroll taxes. Year-over-year, Q1 will have 0.6 fewer treatment days than last year because of the leap year.
With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

And then secondly, can you help us understand like -- it's really helpful, the $140 million, but how much revenue you're losing there so we can kind of try to understand the decremental margin on that lost business and maybe think about, as things normalize, what that could be going forward?"

So first, let me just clear up on the -- you keep using the $140 million. Let me clear up how we're thinking about the $200 million. And it in many ways, mimics what we saw in 2020. I would bucket our COVID impact into 3 categories. One is the direc",422,"Sure. So first, let me just clear up on the -- you keep using the $140 million. Let me clear up how we're thinking about the $200 million. And it in many ways, mimics what we saw in 2020. I would bucket our COVID impact into 3 categories. One is the direct costs associated with COVID, and think of enhanced benefits we're giving to teammates to help them with the hardship associated with COVID, think of increased PPE spend. So that's bucket one.
Bucket 2 are the offsets, lower T&E, the Medicare sequestration revenue, lower benefits as a self-insured employer. And what we saw in 2020 is those were big numbers, but they generally offset each other. It wasn't true quarter-to-quarter, and that's why you see some of the big swing from Q3 to Q4. But if you look at the full year, those 2 numbers offset each other, and the net impact in 2020 was the result of this accumulating loss treatments associated with some of our patients passing away as a result of COVID.
So you can think of $60 million as the impact in 2020 associated with mortality. That $60 million in the scenario we laid out grows to $200 million next year. And again, in 2021, we're anticipating more or less that the increased costs will be offset by the offsets, although the costs will come down and the offsets will come down. And the nature of the cost will be a little bit different.
PPE, we anticipate will remain elevated as the unit cost of some of the PPE stays high. Obviously, we'll keep the sequestration for Q1, but that will go away. We think T&E will remain low, but the health benefits associated with teammates will come down. So again, direct costs and offsets blend to roughly 0, and the $200 million is the impact from mortality.  
Now let me get to your fundamental question. Two things. Yes, the patients who are passing away from COVID are older on average than our average patient. And as a result, they're more likely to have Medicare and the commercial mix there is lower. In terms of thinking about the -- how it impacts our cost structure, it's tough to model. It depends on where these patients are, how long it takes, over what period this extends, but it is safe to say that our G&A, you can think of it as relatively fixed and our patient care costs are -- a majority of our patient costs are variable."

That, though, the lost treatments associated with those patients who unfortunately have passed away early, that remains through the back half of the year and unfortunately, will remain through 2022. So those treatments are lost.
And what you would see in the back half of the year is you'd -- hopefully, you'd see NAG bottoming out and starting to increase in the back half of the year, but it will take some time for the lost treatments to play through the system. So I don't think you can say the back half of the year will not be impacted by COVID, it certainly will be impacted by COVID."

So if you think about all the other factors that impact NAG in terms of treatment and volume -- in terms of transplant volume and new-to-ESRD admits, that stuff has largely returned to normal. So we're not anticipating much impact of that. So the NAG",436,"Yes. So if you think about all the other factors that impact NAG in terms of treatment and volume -- in terms of transplant volume and new-to-ESRD admits, that stuff has largely returned to normal. So we're not anticipating much impact of that. So the NAG story for 2021 is largely around the mortality question.
If you think about Q1, and I'll talk in terms of the NAG, we see NAG continuing to decline in Q1 and then again in Q2. And this is really driven by this scenario we painted of increasing mortality. And then, it's hard to know where it will bottom out. Again, there's a lot of uncertainty here. But in terms of trying to see what the NAG might be in Q2, you could anticipate something as low as negative 2% or even negative 3% for that 1 quarter and then it will start to recover from there. 
If you thought about the full year 2021 NAG, again, we're not guiding to NAG, but just to help you all think about this, I think it's safe to think of a negative NAG for the full year, certainly, probably -- I think it's reasonable to model it as somewhere in the negative 1% to negative 2%. And then you don't see NAG really return -- remember NAG is a year-over-year number, so you wouldn't see it return to normal until mid-2022.
And then the one other thing I'd point out about NAG is once the mortality has worked its way through the system in terms of -- on a quarterly basis, we're not seeing excess mortality and once you've had a full year for the lagging effect of NAG to play through, then you would anticipate us having a bit of a tailwind associated with NAG. The unfortunate mortality that we've seen as a result of COVID should lead to a lower mortality over the next few years as a result of some of the patients who passed away of COVID would have otherwise passed away in 2022 or 2023, et cetera.
So you'll certainly see a real headwind on NAG in 2021, you'd expect a bit of a hangover from that in 2022. But going forward from the back half of 2022, and again, this is all caveated on our scenario, whereby the vaccines work and our patients get access to them, you'd start seeing a NAG that would be higher than normal in the back half of 2022. And I apologize for how many numbers I'm throwing around than how confusing this can be. So if anything wasn't clear, please follow-up."

We've been very pleased with the resiliency our patients have shown in terms of maintaining their coverage, but I think you can't lose sight of that PPE costs are something that remain a relatively dynamic issue, less in terms of volume utilization and more in terms of price.

I'm just trying to understand where this incremental cost savings is coming from because you've been a pretty sort of lean organization for a long time. So just trying to understand sort of what are the additional levers there, especially when you do expect NAG to be potentially even slightly down for the year?
And then second question, just on home modalities. Obviously, you have to just do what's best for each patient. But have you seen increased interest in home modality since the pandemic hit? And specifically, as we think about the shift to home, whether it's PD or HD. Are you catching these patients early enough that it makes a difference in terms of whether they stay employed, potentially keep their private insurance where they otherwise would have dropped their job and either gone into COBRA for a period of time or just switched directly into Medicare?

And to me, 4%, it's a solid, stable year of the core with this very challenging, very uncertain calcimimetic COVID on top of it. The 4%, it's kind of what our normal year would look like, low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, stable margins, again, driven by RPT increases below inflation. Good cost management.

I can understand why you don't want to disclose that differential, but we all had estimates of it.
So if we were going to see MA penetration go to 35%, we had estimates of what that meant to you in terms of incremental rate and EBITDA. So I guess the question is, has the movement making all dialysis patients eligible for MA, has that created some price compression in that historic MA book?

Over the last several months, we have made incredible progress in our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over the last several months, we have made incredible progress in our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. And it's with continued optimism that I provide several updates today, starting with vaccination followed by a summary of the first quarter performance then an update on our improved outlook for the year and finally, an overview of our ongoing commitment to ESG. 
Q1 brought a lot of smiles as the Kidney Care community administered hundreds of thousands of vaccines to its patients. Providers worked closely with the Biden Administration, the CDC and state government so the dialysis patients could be vaccinated in a trusted and convenient side of care. We knew that this would help our patients overcome transportation and other access challenges getting to third-party sites. And we had confidence that the hesitancy rate would decline when they received education from a trusted caretaker. Thanks to all the hard work by our teams and the government partners, I'm proud to say that as of yesterday, 72% of our patients nationwide have received at least 1 vaccine dose. 
We also saw an opportunity to positively impact health equity by administering COVID vaccine in our clinics. Similar to the early results in the broader U.S. population, in the first few weeks of the vaccine rollout, we saw the vaccination rate for Black and Hispanic were approximately 40% below that of White and Asian American. This did not fit well with us. We've got to work and mobilized our care teams, including social workers, dietitians and medical directors to have one-on-one conversations with patients to address common causes of hesitancy. Our Hispanic patients have now been vaccinated at nearly the same rate as white patients and the gap for our black patients has been reduced to 10%. We are not done. Our pursuit for health equity continues. 
On to our first quarter financial results. We delivered solid performance in Q1 as our operating margins returned to 15.7% in the quarter, while we continue to lead through the continued challenges presented by the pandemic. As we covered on our last call, treatment volumes declined in Q1. Our treatments per day hit a low point in mid-February, including the impact of approximately 25,000 missed treatments from the winter storm. Since then, our daily treatment trends have steadily improved. As these trends continue, absent any further infection surges, we believe that our sequential patient census growth through the end of the year could return to pre-COVID levels, which is what we incorporated in our guidance ranges we provided last quarter. 
Let me provide a bit more detail on volume that supports our outlook. First, since our update in Q1, COVID case counts and new infections within our dialysis population have continued to decline. As of last Friday, the number of active cases amongst our patients across the country decreased approximately 85% from peak prevalence on January 6, 2021 and the last 7-day incidence rate for new cases decreased approximately 91% from the week ending January 9, 2021. Second, we're grateful that we're seeing a dramatic decline in the mortality rates associated with COVID. We've previously shared that the unfortunate incremental mortality associated with COVID was approximately 7,000 in 2020. In 2021, both our patient mortality count and mortality count in the general population peaked in January. In the first quarter, incremental mortality associated with COVID was approximately 3,300 lives, with more than half of that number occurring in January, decreasing to approximately 600 in March. It is too early to provide an estimate for April, but we expect the results will improve versus March. 
Shifting to full year outlook, our view of core operation performance for the year remains largely unchanged from our original guidance. However, now that the likelihood of some downside scenarios have decreased due to the trends I've previously mentioned, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $8.20 to $9 per share and our adjusted operating income guidance range to $1.75 billion to $1.875 billion. At the midpoint of our revised adjusted operating income guidance, this would represent approximately a 4% growth year-over-year. These revised ranges assume no further major disruption from the virus strain. 
My final topic is our ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance matters or ESG. ESG has become a more significant topic of conversation in the investment community over the last couple of years. These are not new areas of focus for us at DaVita. Our beliefs are incorporated into our stated vision of social responsibility that has 3 components: caring for our patients, caring for each other and caring for the world around us, including both our communities and our environment. DaVita continues to execute against this vision, providing top quality clinical care for our patients is at the core of what we do and because I've already spoken at length about our patient care and our efforts to vaccinated patients, I would like to highlight a few of our achievements in caring for our teammates and caring for the world around us. 
I believe that fostering an environment rich in diversity and where we all feel that we belong is imperative to our culture and how we connect with each other and how we connect with our patients every day. And our commitment to cultivating diversity is evident throughout the organization. It starts with the Board of Directors, currently made up of 9 leaders, of whom 67% are diverse, including 4 women and 3 people of color. The diversity of our team extends to the leaders who run the core operations in our clinics up to 52% are female and 27% are people of color. These results have been achieved through thoughtful and deliberate practices to create a diverse pipeline of talent. 
In 2021, we published our first report on diversity and belonging, disclosing many of our company's diversity metrics and our ongoing efforts to cultivate a diverse organization in which everyone feels that he or she belong. We also recently published our 14th Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report and our first ESG Report. These reports disclose the progress we made in 2020 and lay out our ambitious ESG goals for 2025, including goals to reduce carbon emissions by 50% and to have vendors representing 70% of emissions set by climate change goals and to achieve engagement scores of 84% or higher among our teammate population. We are pleased with our progress to date on diversity and ESG. And as you can see by our goal, we have a lot more we hope to accomplish. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joel."

For the quarter, we recorded revenue of approximately $2.8 billion, operating income of $443 million and earnings per share of $2.09. As Javier referenced, treatment volum",717,"Thanks, Javier. Q1 was a strong start to the year with solid financial performance. For the quarter, we recorded revenue of approximately $2.8 billion, operating income of $443 million and earnings per share of $2.09. As Javier referenced, treatment volume was a large headwind and our nonacquired growth was negative 2.2% compared to negative 0.3% in Q4. While COVID presented the main challenge to NAG in Q1, winter storms, particularly Uri, were responsible for about 30 basis points of the NAG decline. Treatments per day bottomed out during the first quarter, so we expect to start seeing quarter-over-quarter growth in Q2. We continue to expect that NAG will be negative for the year, although we expect to see an acceleration of NAG in 2022 and 2023 as mortality rates may be lower than the pre-COVID levels for a few years. 
U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment grew sequentially by almost $3 this quarter as a result of the Medicare rate increase, higher enrollment in MA plans, a slight improvement in commercial mix and higher volume from our hospital services business, partially offset by the seasonal impact of coinsurance and deductible. U.S. dialysis patient care costs declined sequentially by approximately $6 per treatment. Although we continue to experience elevated costs due to the pandemic, such as higher PPE and certain clinical level expenses from continued infection control protocols, our Q1 patient care costs included a nearly $2 per treatment benefit from our power purchase agreement, a benefit that we do not expect to persist through the rest of the year. 
For the quarter, the net headwind related to COVID was approximately $35 million, consisting primarily of higher PPE costs and the compounding effect of patient mortality associated with COVID, partially offset by the benefit from the sequestration suspension with a number of other items that largely offset each other. For fiscal year 2021, we now estimate the net negative impact from COVID to be approximately $50 million lower than our guidance last quarter. This is the result of lower COVID impact in Q1, the recently passed extension of the Medicare sequestration relief through the end of the year and lower other offsets, including T&E in the back half of the year. At the middle of our guidance range, this would equate to $150 million negative impact from COVID in 2021. 
Our DSO increased by approximately 7 days in Q1 versus Q4, primarily due to temporary billing holds related to the winter storms and the changes in calcimimetics reimbursement. In certain circumstances, we hold claims to make sure we have complete and accurate charge information for payments. This quarter, we had more of these holes and the single largest driver was related to winter storm Uri, which impacted more than 600 of our centers until right in the middle of the quarter. This has the effect of pushing a significant amount of cash flow from this quarter to the next and caused the corresponding DSO increase in the interim. While claim holds shifted cash flow between quarters, they have no negative impact on what we ultimately expect to collect. We've already seen a significant increase in cash collections in April and expect a corresponding positive impact on both cash flow and DSOs over the next 2 quarters. 
A couple of final points. In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock. And to date, in April, we repurchased approximately 1 million additional shares. Debt expense was $67 million for the quarter. We expect quarterly debt expenses to increase to approximately $75 million beginning next quarter as a result of the $1 billion of notes issued in late February. 
Before we open up the line for Q&A, let me share some reflections. Over the past year, our teams and our business experienced unusual volatility and challenges due to the pandemic. We have weathered this very difficult period because of our dedication of our people, our scale, our innovation and our holistic platform and approach to patient care. As I look forward, our organization is stronger. Our relationships with patients have deepened and have even more resolve that our comprehensive Kidney Care platform is well positioned to deliver a best-in-class value proposition to our patients, physicians in hospitals and payer partners. 
Now let's open it up for Q&A."

We also had a pickup in Q1 over Q4 as a result of Calcimimetics. I'll remind you, Calcimimetics OI in 2021 will be similar to 2020, but the seasonal pattern will be very different. So we picked up $2 -- about $2 of RPT in Q1 over Q4 from that. 
In terms of looking forward about what RPT will look like, we've moved away from guiding on RPT, as you'll remember.

But we'll have more to say on 2022 RPT, obviously, later in the year. 
I'm sorry, operator, Pito, just to jump in on that. That -- my comment, obviously, you'd have to adjust for sequestration, which would go away, presumably between '22 and '21, and that would be a big number."

Remember, the mortality we've seen as a result of COVID was disproportionate in the older population, as you would expect, and our older population is disproportionately Medicare. So as you see, the unwind happened from COVID over the next X number of years, we think that would lead to a lower kind of our commercial mix trending down a bit. 
In terms of the implications for margin, there's an offset to that, recognizing that these new patients will be filling unused capacity, and that would have a tendency to drive margins up. How those 2 -- those countervailing forces play forth remains to be seen. And it's a tough number to predict. It's dependent on a lot of the -- some of the underlying assumptions."

Over the last several months, we have made incredible progress in our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. And it's with continued optimism that I provide several updates today, starting with vaccination followed by a summary of the first quarter performance then an update on our improved outlook for the year and finally, an overview of our ongoing commitment to ESG. 
Q1 brought a lot of smiles as the Kidney Care community administered hundreds of thousands of vaccines to its patients. Providers worked closely with the Biden Administration, the CDC and state government so that dialysis patients could be vaccinated in a trusted and convenient side of care. We knew that this would help our patients overcome transportation and other access challenges getting to third-party sites. And we had confidence that the hesitancy rate would decline when they received education from a trusted caretaker. Thanks to all the hard work by our teams and the government partners, I'm proud to say that as of yesterday, 72% of our patients nationwide have received at least one vaccine dose. 
We also saw an opportunity to positively impact health equity by administering COVID vaccine in our clinics. Similar to the early results in the broader U.S. population, in the first few weeks of the vaccine rollout, we saw the vaccination rate for Black and Hispanic were approximately 40% below that of White and Asian American. This did not sit well with us. We've got to work and mobilized our care teams, including social workers, dietitians and medical directors to have one-on-one conversations with patients to address common causes of hesitancy. Our Hispanic patients have now been vaccinated at nearly the same rate as white patients and the gap for our black patients has been reduced to 10%. We are not done. Our pursuit for health equity continues. 
On to our first quarter financial results. We delivered solid performance in Q1 as our operating margins returned to 15.7% in the quarter, while we continue to lead through the continued challenges presented by the pandemic. As we covered on our last call, treatment volumes declined in Q1. Our treatments per day hit a low point in mid-February, including the impact of approximately 25,000 missed treatments from the winter storm. Since then, our daily treatment trends have steadily improved. As these trends continue, absent any further infection surges, we believe that our sequential patient census growth through the end of the year could return to pre-COVID levels, which is what we incorporated in our guidance ranges we provided last quarter. 
Let me provide a bit more detail on volume that supports our outlook. First, since our update in Q1, COVID case counts and new infections within our dialysis population have continued to decline. As of last Friday, the number of active cases amongst our patients across the country decreased approximately 85% from peak prevalence on January 6, 2021, and the last 7-day incidence rate for new cases decreased approximately 91% from the week ending January 9, 2021. Second, we're grateful that we're seeing a dramatic decline in the mortality rates associated with COVID. We've previously shared that the unfortunate incremental mortality associated with COVID was approximately 7,000 in 2020. In 2021, both our patient mortality count and mortality count in the general population peaked in January. In the first quarter, incremental mortality associated with COVID was approximately 3,300 lives, with more than half of that number occurring in January, decreasing to approximately 600 in March. It is too early to provide an estimate for April, but we expect the results will improve versus March.
Shifting to full year outlook, our view of core operation performance for the year remains largely unchanged from our original guidance. However, now that the likelihood of some downside scenarios have decreased due to the trends I've previously mentioned, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $8.20 to $9 per share and our adjusted operating income guidance range to $1.75 billion to $1.875 billion. At the midpoint of our revised adjusted operating income guidance, this would represent approximately a 4% growth year-over-year. These revised ranges assume no further major disruption from the virus strain. 
My final topic is our ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance matters or ESG. ESG has become a more significant topic of conversation in the investment community over the last couple of years, but these are not new areas of focus for us at DaVita. Our beliefs are incorporated into our stated vision of social responsibility that has 3 components: caring for our patients, caring for each other and caring for the world around us, including both our communities and our environment. DaVita continues to execute against this vision, providing top quality clinical care for our patients is at the core of what we do and because I've already spoken at length about our patients care and our efforts to vaccinate our patients, I would like to highlight a few of our achievements in caring for our teammates and caring for the world around us. 
I believe that fostering an environment rich in diversity and where we all feel that we belong is imperative to our culture and how we connect with each other and how we connect with our patients every day. And our commitment to cultivating diversity is evident throughout the organization. It starts with the Board of Directors, currently made up of 9 leaders, of whom 67% are diverse, including 4 women and 3 people of color. The diversity of our team extends to the leaders who run the core operations in our clinics of whom 52% are female and 27% are people of color. These results have been achieved through thoughtful and deliberate practices to create a diverse pipeline of talent.
In 2021, we published our first report on diversity and belonging, disclosing many of our company's diverse metrics and our ongoing efforts to cultivate a diverse organization in which everyone feels that he or she belongs. We also recently published our 14th Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report and our first ESG Report. These reports disclose the progress we made in 2020 and lay out our ambitious ESG goals for 2025, including goals to reduce carbon emissions by 50% and to have vendors representing 70% of emissions set by climate change goals and to achieve engagement scores of 84% or higher among our teammate population. We are pleased with our progress to date on diversity and ESG. And as you can see by our goal, we have a lot more we hope to accomplish. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joel."

For the quarter, we recorded revenue of approximately $2.8 billion, operating income of $443 million and earnings per share of $2.09. As Javier referenced, treatment volum",609,"Thanks, Javier. Q1 was a strong start to the year with solid financial performance. For the quarter, we recorded revenue of approximately $2.8 billion, operating income of $443 million and earnings per share of $2.09. As Javier referenced, treatment volume was a large headwind and our nonacquired growth was negative 2.2% compared to negative 0.3% in Q4. While COVID presented the main challenge to NAG in Q1, winter storms, particularly Uri, were responsible for about 30 basis points of the NAG decline. Treatments per day bottomed out during the first quarter, so we expect to start seeing quarter-over-quarter growth in Q2. We continue to expect that NAG will be negative for the year, although we expect to see an acceleration of NAG in 2022 and 2023 as mortality rates may be lower than the pre-COVID levels for a few years. 
U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment grew sequentially by almost $3 this quarter as a result of the Medicare rate increase, higher enrollment in MA plans, a slight improvement in commercial mix and higher volume from our hospital services business, partially offset by the seasonal impact of coinsurance and deductible. U.S. dialysis patient care costs declined sequentially by approximately $6 per treatment. Although we continue to experience elevated costs due to the pandemic, such as higher PPE and certain clinical level expenses from continued infection control protocols, our Q1 patient care costs included a nearly $2 per treatment benefit from our power purchase agreement, a benefit that we do not expect to persist through the rest of the year. 
For the quarter, the net headwind related to COVID was approximately $35 million, consisting primarily of higher PPE costs and the compounding effect of patient mortality associated with COVID, partially offset by the benefit from the sequestration suspension with a number of other items that largely offset each other. For fiscal year 2021, we now estimate the net negative impact from COVID to be approximately $50 million lower than our guidance last quarter. This is the result of lower COVID impact in Q1, the recently passed extension of the Medicare sequestration relief through the end of the year and lower other offsets, including T&E in the back half of the year. At the middle of our guidance range, this would equate to $150 million negative impact from COVID in 2021.
Our DSO increased by approximately 7 days in Q1 versus Q4, primarily due to temporary billing holds related to the winter storm and the changes in calcimimetics reimbursement. In certain circumstances, we hold claims to make sure we have complete and accurate charge information for payments. This quarter, we had more of these holes and the single largest driver was related to winter storm Uri, which impacted more than 600 of our centers until right in the middle of the quarter. This has the effect of pushing a significant amount of cash flow from this quarter to the next and caused the corresponding DSO increase in the interim. While claim holds shift cash flow between quarters, they have no negative impact on what we ultimately expect to collect. We've already seen a significant increase in cash collections in April and expect a corresponding positive impact on both cash flow and DSOs over the next 2 quarters. 
A couple of final points. In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock. And to date, in April, we repurchased approximately 1 million additional shares. Debt expense was $67 million for the quarter. We expect quarterly debt expenses to increase to approximately $75 million beginning next quarter as a result of the $1 billion of notes issued in late February."

In terms of looking forward about what RPT will look like, we've moved away from guiding on RPT, as you'll remember. In terms of what's a reasonable number, is 2% reasonable? I wouldn't say it's unreasonable, but it might be a little on the high end of the range that I'd probably think about. But we'll have more to say on 2022 RPT, obviously, later in the year.

So start with NAG, add excess mortality then adjust for what could be a challenge to the pipeline, if you want to assume there's any CKD 4 impact. We don't have data on that. But if we look at what we see in terms of new admits, we don't see any impact there that -- we don't see any impact from that right now, but you'd have to incorporate that. And then we see a tailwind coming up as patients who otherwise would have died in the next quarter or 2, passed away as a result of COVID. And that's a hard one to measure. So that's how I'd model it. If you want to get kind of simplistic, and I realize I'm throwing a lot of numbers in a complicated story at you, I think you start with that math, you add back the tailwind associated with lower mortality post-COVID. And that's how you start modeling what NAG looks like going forward."

We are excited to talk to you today about our strong Q2 performance, our 2021 financial outlook and recent developments on our efforts to transform Kidney Care.

We are excited to talk to you today about our strong Q2 performance, our 2021 financial outlook and recent developments on our efforts to transform Kidney Care. First, let me start the conversation with a clinical highlight.
A kidney transplant is the best treatment option for eligible patients with kidney failure. DaVita has worked hard over the years to help our patients gain access to transplant through education and direct support for patients to get on and stay on the transplantation waitlist. The cumulative impact is meaningful. Last December, we announced a milestone of 100,000 DaVita patients who have received a transplant since the year 2000.
To further advance the cause of transplantation, DaVita and the National Kidney Foundation are collaborating on a year-long pilot aimed at improving health equity in kidney transplantation with a focus on living donors. Increasing living donor transplant expands access to transplantation by increasing the availability of Oregon, which has been the limiting factor in the number of transplants performed annually. This pilot provides high touch and customized information to patients and families seeking a kidney transplantation from a living donor. We look forward to learning more from this pilot, improving the health equity of kidney transplant and continuing to be the leader in supporting our patients to receive kidney transplants.
Shifting to the latest update on COVID. We have made incredible progress in our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic over the past several months. New COVID infections among our patients continue to drop significantly through the last week of June, down more than 95% from the peak in early January. However, similar to the rest of the country, we have started to see an uptick over the last few weeks. As of last week, on a rolling 7-day average basis, new infections are still down more than 90% from the peak. Thus far, our mortality continues to remain low on an absolute basis as we believe that our vaccinated patients are more protected from severe cases of COVID. We continue to educate our patients about the benefits of vaccine to reduce vaccine hesitancy and we remain confident in our policies and procedures designed to keep our patients and our teammates safe while they're in our care.
Now let me turn to our financial performance in the second quarter. We delivered strong results in both operating income and earnings per share. Our margins expanded as we continue to manage costs while delivering quality care. As a result, we delivered 6% year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income and 35% year-over-year growth in our adjusted earnings per share. Our free cash flow was particularly strong this quarter, and we continue to return cash to our shareholders through our stock buybacks. With the first half of the year behind us, we are now increasing the midpoint of guidance for the full year.
Let me transition to update our progress in our Integrated Kidney Care efforts, otherwise known as IKC. Value-based care for our patients with kidney disease is gaining momentum and appear to have reached an inflection point. We have always believed that coordinating dialysis care with the broader health care needs of CKD and ESKD patients could simultaneously improve outcomes and reduce total health care costs.
For years, we've been participating in a variety of small programs and pilots to build our integrated care capability and better understand the economics. We believe we are at that point now where we are ready to shift to the next stage of the evolution of integrated care.
You might be wondering why now? The trend towards value-based care is not new either in Kidney Care or other segments of health care. So what's changed to make the developments of scale business viable today? There's a couple of reasons. First, with the growth of Medicare Advantage, payers are looking for innovative ways to manage the increasing number of ESKD patients choosing MA plans. These patients tend to be more complex than most MA patients and should benefit from tailored care management.
Second, CMS recently initiated the payment model in Kidney Care. We're preparing to partner with nephrologists in up to 12 markets beginning in January of next year to participate in CKCC voluntary program. Our participation in CKCC model will also provide us with operational scale in more geographies to enter into other value-based arrangements.
Lastly, we've increased our confidence in our capabilities to deliver clinical and economic value at scale and have leaned in on our willingness to take risk. We believe we're well positioned to win in integrated care because of our strong partnership with nephrologists, our regular and consistent interactions with patients, a broad Kidney Care platform that spans various modalities of care settings and a clinical data set and analytics that we use to create, develop clinical intervention to support our patient holistically.
We have a demonstrated track record of improving patient outcomes, coordinating care and lowering costs for patients in risk arrangements. For example, in our ESCOs, we were able to generate non-dialysis cost savings in the high single digits, which translated into more than double the average savings rates compared to the rest of the industry over the life of the program. With our special needs plan, we have been able to lower mortality by 23% relative to other patients within the same center and county. 
To give you a better sense of the scale of the business, as of today, approximately 10% of our U.S. dialysis patients are in value-based care arrangements in which DaVita is responsible for managing the total cost of care. This represents almost $2 billion of annual medical costs under management. In addition, we have various other forms of value-based care arrangements with payers in which we have economic incentives for improving quality and lowering costs.
In 2022, we expect our Integrated Kidney Care business to double in size, both the number of patients and risk arrangements and the dollars under management. We also expect to see a dramatic increase in the number of CKD lives we have under risk in 2022.
To prepare for this growth, we are currently scaling up our clinical team and furthering building out our support function. Because of the investment as well as the delays in cost savings impacts of our model of care and revenue recognition, we expect to incur a net operating loss of $120 million in 2021 in our U.S. ancillary segment. This outcome is consistent with the OI headwinds from IKC growth we called out at the beginning of the year and is, of course, included in our full year guidance. The doubling of the business next year could result in an incremental operating loss in our ancillary segment of $50 million in 2022. We expect significant improvement in our financial performance beginning in 2023 as we begin to recognize savings from the new contract that we entered in 2021 and 2022.
Over the 5-plus year horizon, we believe that our IKC business could become a sustainable driver of significant operating income growth. Currently, we serve approximately 200,000 dialysis patients across the country. We utilized over $12 billion in health care services outside of the dialysis facility, including the cost of hospitalization, outpatient procedures and physician services. In addition, we see an opportunity to manage the care of upstream CKD patients who currently do not dialyze in our centers. Assuming that we are managing the total cost of care for more than half of our dialysis patients as well as other CKD patients at low to single digit margin, we believe that this could be a meaningful financial opportunity.
In summary, all of health care has been talking about value-based for years. We are excited for DaVita to lead the way.
With that, I will turn the call over to Joel."
35644,1674696259,2361299,"DaVita Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Javier. We had a strong quarter despite the continuing operational challenges presented by COVID, primarily as a result of strong RPT performance and continued discipline on costs.For the quarter, operating income was $490 million and earnings p",808,"Thanks, Javier. We had a strong quarter despite the continuing operational challenges presented by COVID, primarily as a result of strong RPT performance and continued discipline on costs.
For the quarter, operating income was $490 million and earnings per share were $2.64. Our Q2 results include a net COVID headwind of approximately $35 million, similar to what we saw in Q1. Primarily the impact of excess mortality on volumes and elevated PPE costs, partially offset by sequestration relief and reduced travel and meeting expenses.
Turning to volume. In Q2, treatments per day increased by 0.4% compared to Q1. Excess mortality declined significantly in Q2 from approximately 3,000 in Q1 to fewer than 500 in Q2. At this point, we are cautiously optimistic that the worst is behind us but we're closely monitoring the potential impact of the Delta variant, especially within pockets of the country that have lower vaccination rates. Longer term, we continue to believe that we will return to prepandemic treatment growth levels with an additional tailwind from lower than normal mortality rates.
Our U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment grew sequentially by almost $6 this quarter, primarily due to normal seasonal improvements from patients meeting their coinsurance and deductible obligations. We also saw favorable changes in government rate and mix, including the continued growth in the percentage of patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Patient care costs and G&A expense per treatment in total were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Our patient care costs decreased sequentially, primarily due to reductions in labor costs. Our G&A increased slightly primarily due to charitable contributions and increases in personnel costs.
As expected, our U.S. dialysis and lab DSOs decreased by approximately 6 days in Q2 versus Q1, primarily due to collections on the temporary billing holds related to the winter storms in the first quarter. The majority of the impact of the storms on DSO and cash flow will reverse in Q2 but we may see an ongoing smaller benefit through the balance of the year.
During the second quarter, we generated a gain of approximately $9 million on one of our DaVita Venture Group investments, which hit the other income line on our P&L. We have a small investment in MiroMatrixMedical that recently went public. The value of this investment at quarter end was $23 million. Going forward, we will market to market every quarter.
Now turning to some updates on the rest of this year and some initial thoughts on 2022. As Javier mentioned, we are raising our guidance ranges for 2021 as follows: adjusted earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.40, adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion to $1.875 billion and free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Also, we now expect our 2021 effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita to be between 24% and 26% lower than the 26% to 28% range that we had communicated at the beginning of the year. These new guidance ranges exclude the potential impact of a significant fourth COVID surge later this year.
I'll call out 2 notable potential headwinds during the second half of the year. First is COVID. We continue to expect the impact of excess mortality will be higher in the back half of the year than in the first half of the year due to the compounding impact of mortality through 2021. We're also expecting an uptick on costs related to testing, vaccinations and teammate support as a result of the Delta variance. As a result, we're increasing the middle of the range of COVID impact for the full year to $170 million from $150 million. That implies a $30 million headwind from COVID in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. As a reminder, this is the middle of what is a wide range of possible impacts depending on the impact of the Delta or other variants and any additional COVID mandates.
Second, we expect to experience losses in our U.S. ancillary segment of approximately $70 million in the second half of the year compared to $50 million in the first half of the year. This incremental loss is due primarily to new value-based care arrangements and start-up costs associated with the CKCC program that launches in 2022.
Looking forward to 2022, we do not expect anything unusual among the primary drivers of the business, including RPT, cost per treatment or capital expenditures. However, we expect pressure on OI growth from the increased spend on growing our IKC business, the possibility of union activity in 2022 that we did not face in 2021 and the first year of depreciation expense associated with our new clinical IT platform that we have been developing for the past several years. We will provide more specific 2022 guidance on a future earnings call.

I hope I got all that, but please jump in if I didn't catch it. So starting off, in terms of where it is on the P&L, we've got a segment of our strategic initiatives, which breaks down between U.S. and international. The U.S. component of strategic initiatives is an excellent proxy for our IKC P&L. We've simplified what exists in that segment over the last few years as we've exited some of the strategic initiatives. And other than a couple of small things, it's everything related to IKC through that line. So I think as you think about both revenue and operating income, using the U.S. component of SIs as a proxy for our IKC business is a really good way to look at it. So that's number one.
In terms of where this can go over time, look, there are a lot of questions around how many members we can enroll here, what our savings rate can be, how much of that will ultimately capture. I think a reasonably simple way to model it would be to start with something like 1/3 of our ESKD population in this, use a spend per patient especially if you're looking out a few years of $100,000 per patient and that will give you a medical cost under management. And then the question is what percent of medical costs under management do we think can turn into OI? And I would say a reasonable number would be something in the low single digits, something equivalent to what a typical MA plan would drive as margin. So 1%, 2%, 3% maybe 4% in that range as a percentage of medical cost under management, I think, is the right way to think about what the potential for this is in the out years.
Sorry, Peter, I think you had a third question, which I didn't catch."

So we don't feel any pressure there right now.
In terms of Q2 over Q1, Q2 did benefit from the storms in Q1. So you'll remember the storms in -- from Yuri led to lower treatment volume in Q1. And so the comparison in Q2 was a positive there. That said, there are a few things weighing on the quarter. First, acute volumes are down, as you would expect with the pandemic getting better in Q2 over Q1. Second, excess mortality remained above normal. It was well below what we saw in Q1. It came down from 3,000 approximate less than 500, but it still remained above normal. And finally, the mix of treatment days in Q2 was unfavorable. We do fewer treatments on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday than we do on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays and that had about a 50 basis -- that was about a 50 basis point headwind in Q2 over Q1.
So just to summarize, the good news is we're back to a situation where treatments are growing quarter-over-quarter. The new to dialysis admissions remain strong. That said, there continues to be a bit of noise in the numbers."

A couple of other things, Justin, while you were asking about the value-based care and how do we calculate it with dialysis and non-dialysis. I think it's important to do the math you're doing. You subtract the dialysis, and then you have to put in there that the payer/government have a participation in the savings, the nephrologist then has a participation in the savings. And that's how you trickle down to the percentage of the 1, 2 or 3 percentage roughly that Joel talked about."

So we don't think those dynamics will change much other than during COVID, of course, the PPE has gone up dramatically, and we hope that, that stabilizes over time.
As it relates to the wage inflation, we have nothing really particular to say about it. We are another player in this really dynamic marketplace, and it feels like it's shifting quite aggressively right now. Is that a short period or does that sustain itself? So I don't think I can comment on the multiyear. It is fair to say that we are aggressively looking at all the pharmaceutical and all the options to make sure that our physicians have the choice of their pharmaceutical but at the best price possible. So I don't know if I got to all of your question.
I think the last part of it was around capacity utilization. And of course, we are watching it very aggressively. We went from a time where we were very aggressive on the de novo build, too, as you can see, we really tapered that back and we're building a lot more home centers, which are a lot more capital efficient. We will keep that sort of balance in check because we know that patients need the interplay between the home and the center. And so there needs to be that capacity available.

We are excited to talk to you today about our strong Q2 performance, our 2021 financial outlook and recent developments on our efforts to transform Kidney Care. First, let me start the conversation with a clinical highlight.
A kidney transplant is the best treatment option for eligible patients with kidney failure. DaVita has worked hard over the years to help our patients gain access to transplant through education and direct support for patients to get on and stay on the transplantation waitlist. The cumulative impact is meaningful. Last December, we announced a milestone of 100,000 DaVita patients who have received a transplant since the year 2000.
To further advance the cause of transplantation, DaVita and the National Kidney Foundation are collaborating on a year-long pilot aimed at improving health equity in kidney transplantation with a focus on living donors. Increasing living donor transplant expands access to transplantation by increasing the availability of organs, which has been the limiting factor in the number of transplants performed annually. This pilot provides high touch and customized information to patients and families seeking a kidney transplantation from a living donor. We look forward to learning more from this pilot, improving the health equity of kidney transplant and continuing to be the leader in supporting our patients to receive kidney transplants.
Shifting to the latest update on COVID. We have made incredible progress in our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic over the past several months. New COVID infections among our patients continue to drop significantly through the last week of June, down more than 95% from the peak in early January. However, similar to the rest of the country, we have started to see an uptick over the last few weeks. As of last week, on a rolling 7-day average basis, new infections are still down more than 90% from the peak. Thus far, our mortality continues to remain low on an absolute basis as we believe that our vaccinated patients are more protected from severe cases of COVID. We continue to educate our patients about the benefits of vaccine to reduce vaccine hesitancy and we remain confident in our policies and procedures designed to keep our patients and our teammates safe while they're in our care.
Now let me turn to our financial performance in the second quarter. We delivered strong results in both operating income and earnings per share. Our margins expanded as we continue to manage costs while delivering quality care. As a result, we delivered 6% year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income and 35% year-over-year growth in our adjusted earnings per share. Our free cash flow was particularly strong this quarter, and we continue to return cash to our shareholders through our stock buybacks. With the first half of the year behind us, we are now increasing the midpoint of guidance for the full year.
Let me transition to update our progress in our Integrated Kidney Care efforts, otherwise known as IKC. Value-based care for our patients with kidney disease is gaining momentum and appear to have reached an inflection point. We have always believed that coordinating dialysis care with the broader health care needs of CKD and ESKD patients could simultaneously improve outcomes and reduce total health care costs.
For years, we've been participating in a variety of small programs and pilots to build our integrated care capability and better understand the economics. We believe we are at that point now where we are ready to shift to the next stage of the evolution of integrated care.
You might be wondering why now? The trend towards value-based care is not new either in Kidney Care or other segments of health care. So what's changed to make the developments of scale business viable today? There's a couple of reasons. First, with the growth of Medicare Advantage, payers are looking for innovative ways to manage the increasing number of ESKD patients choosing MA plans. These patients tend to be more complex than most MA patients and should benefit from tailored care management.
Second, CMS recently initiated the payment models in Kidney Care. We're preparing to partner with nephrologists in up to 12 markets beginning in January of next year to participate in CKCC voluntary programs. Our participation in CKCC model will also provide us with operational scale in more geographies to enter into other value-based arrangements.
Lastly, we've increased our confidence in our capabilities to deliver clinical and economic value at scale and have leaned in on our willingness to take risk. We believe we're well positioned to win in integrated care because of our strong partnership with nephrologists, our regular and consistent interactions with patients, a broad Kidney Care platform that spans various modalities of care settings and a clinical data set and analytics that we use to create, develop clinical interventions to support our patient holistically.
We have a demonstrated track record of improving patient outcomes, coordinating care and lowering costs for patients in risk arrangements. For example, in our ESCOs, we were able to generate non-dialysis cost savings in the high single digits, which translated into more than double the average savings rates compared to the rest of the industry over the life of the program. With our special needs plan, we have been able to lower mortality by 23% relative to other patients within the same center and county.
To give you a better sense of the scale of the business, as of today, approximately 10% of our U.S. dialysis patients are in value-based care arrangements in which DaVita is responsible for managing the total cost of care. This represents almost $2 billion of annual medical costs under management. In addition, we have various other forms of value-based care arrangements with payers in which we have economic incentives for improving quality and lowering costs.
In 2022, we expect our Integrated Kidney Care business to double in size, both the number of patients and risk arrangements and the dollars under management. We also expect to see a dramatic increase in the number of CKD lives we have under risk in 2022.
To prepare for this growth, we are currently scaling up our clinical team and furthering building out our support function. Because of the investment as well as the delays in cost savings impacts of our model of care and revenue recognition, we expect to incur a net operating loss of $120 million in 2021 in our U.S. ancillary segment. This outcome is consistent with the OI headwinds from IKC growth we called out at the beginning of the year and is, of course, included in our full year guidance.
The doubling of the business next year could result in an incremental operating loss in our ancillary segment of $50 million in 2022. We expect significant improvement in our financial performance beginning in 2023 as we begin to recognize savings from the new contract that we entered in 2021 and 2022.
Over the 5-plus year horizon, we believe that our IKC business could become a sustainable driver of significant operating income growth. Currently, we serve approximately 200,000 dialysis patients across the country. We utilized over $12 billion in health care services outside of the dialysis facility, including the cost of hospitalization, outpatient procedures and physician services. In addition, we see an opportunity to manage the care of upstream CKD patients who currently do not dialyze in our centers. Assuming that we are managing the total cost of care for more than half of our dialysis patients as well as other CKD patients at low to single digit margin, we believe that this could be a meaningful financial opportunity.
In summary, all of health care has been talking about value-based for years. We are excited for DaVita to lead the way. With that, I will turn the call over to Joel."
35644,1674696259,2361617,"DaVita Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Javier. We had a strong quarter despite the continuing operational challenges presented by COVID, primarily as a result of strong RPT performance and continued discipline on costs.For the quarter, operating income was $490 million and earnings p",810,"Thanks, Javier. We had a strong quarter despite the continuing operational challenges presented by COVID, primarily as a result of strong RPT performance and continued discipline on costs.
For the quarter, operating income was $490 million and earnings per share were $2.64. Our Q2 results include a net COVID headwind of approximately $35 million, similar to what we saw in Q1. Primarily the impact of excess mortality on volumes and elevated PPE costs, partially offset by sequestration relief and reduced travel and meeting expenses.
Turning to volume. In Q2, treatments per day increased by 0.4% compared to Q1. Excess mortality declined significantly in Q2 from approximately 3,000 in Q1 to fewer than 500 in Q2. At this point, we are cautiously optimistic that the worst is behind us, but we're closely monitoring the potential impact of the Delta variant, especially within pockets of the country that have lower vaccination rates. Longer term, we continue to believe that we will return to pre-pandemic treatment growth levels with an additional tailwind from lower than normal mortality rates.
Our U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment grew sequentially by almost $6 this quarter, primarily due to normal seasonal improvements from patients meeting their coinsurance and deductible obligations. We also saw favorable changes in government rate and mix, including the continued growth in the percentage of patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Patient care costs and G&A expense per treatment in total were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Our patient care costs decreased sequentially, primarily due to reductions in labor costs. Our G&A increased slightly primarily due to charitable contributions and increases in personnel costs.
As expected, our U.S. dialysis and lab DSOs decreased by approximately 6 days in Q2 versus Q1, primarily due to collections on the temporary billing holds related to the winter storms in the first quarter. The majority of the impact of the storms on DSO and cash flow will reverse in Q2, but we may see an ongoing smaller benefit through the balance of the year.
During the second quarter, we generated a gain of approximately $9 million on one of our DaVita Venture Group investments, which hit the other income line on our P&L. We have a small investment in Miromatrix Medical that recently went public. The value of this investment at quarter end was $23 million. Going forward, we will be market to market every quarter.
Now turning to some updates on the rest of this year and some initial thoughts on 2022. As Javier mentioned, we are raising our guidance ranges for 2021 as follows: adjusted earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.40; adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion to $1.875 billion; and free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Also, we now expect our 2021 effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita to be between 24% and 26%, lower than the 26% to 28% range that we had communicated at the beginning of the year. These new guidance ranges exclude the potential impact of a significant fourth COVID surge later this year.
I'll call out 2 notable potential headwinds during the second half of the year. First is COVID. We continue to expect the impact of excess mortality will be higher in the back half of the year than in the first half of the year due to the compounding impact of mortality through 2021. We're also expecting an uptick on costs related to testing, vaccinations and teammate support as a result of the Delta variants. As a result, we're increasing the middle of the range of COVID impact for the full year to $170 million from $150 million. That implies a $30 million headwind from COVID in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. As a reminder, this is the middle of what is a wide range of possible impacts depending on the impact of the Delta or other variants and any additional COVID mandate.
Second, we expect to experience losses in our U.S. ancillary segment of approximately $70 million in the second half of the year compared to $50 million in the first half of the year. This incremental loss is due primarily to new value-based care arrangements and start-up costs associated with the CKCC program that launches in 2022.
Looking forward to 2022, we do not expect anything unusual among the primary drivers of the business, including RPT, cost per treatment or capital expenditures. However, we expect pressure on OI growth from the increased spend on growing our IKC business, the possibility of union activity in 2022 that we did not face in 2021 and the first year of depreciation expense associated with our new clinical IT platform that we have been developing for the past several years. We will provide more specific 2022 guidance on a future earnings call.

I hope I got all that, but please jump in if I didn't catch it. So starting off, in terms of where it is on the P&L, we've got a segment of our strategic initiatives, which breaks down between U.S. and international. The U.S. component of strategic initiatives is an excellent proxy for our IKC P&L. We've simplified what exists in that segment over the last few years as we've exited some of the strategic initiatives. And other than a couple of small things, it's everything related to IKC through that line. So I think as you think about both revenue and operating income, using the U.S. component of SIs as a proxy for our IKC business is a really good way to look at it. So that's number one.
In terms of where this can go over time, look, there are a lot of questions around how many members we can enroll here, what our savings rate can be, how much of that will ultimately capture. I think a reasonably simple way to model it would be to start with something like 1/3 of our ESKD population in this -- use a spend per patient especially if you're looking out a few years of $100,000 per patient and that will give you a medical cost under management.
And then the question is what percent of medical costs under management do we think can turn into OI? And I would say a reasonable number would be something in the low single digits, something equivalent to what a typical MA plan would drive as margin. So 1%, 2%, 3%, maybe 4% in that range as a percentage of medical cost under management, I think, is the right way to think about what the potential for this is in the out years.
Sorry, Peter, I think you had a third question, which I didn't catch."

So look, I think the right number to look at is not patients, but treatments per day. And the good news, let me try and walk you through. First, the good news is treatments per day grew in Q2 over Q1. And I think a sequential view of it will get you a better model than a year-over-year view. So sequentially, treatments per day grew in Q2 over Q1 about 400 treatments per day. There's a bunch of things going on in there. And so let me try and break it down for you.
First, the good news is the new-to-dialysis treatment starts remain strong. So the question that we've gotten in the past about what has happened within the CKD population as a result of COVID, we continue to see strong new-to-dialysis treatment -- admissions. So we don't feel any pressure there right now.
In terms of Q2 over Q1, Q2 did benefit from the storms in Q1. So you'll remember the storms in -- from Uri led to lower treatment volume in Q1. And so the comparison in Q2 was a positive there. That said, there are a few things weighing on the quarter. First, acute volumes are down, as you would expect, with the pandemic getting better in Q2 over Q1. Second, excess mortality remained above normal. It was well below what we saw in Q1. It came down from 3,000 approximately to less than 500, but it still remained above normal. And finally, the mix of treatment days in Q2 was unfavorable. We do fewer treatments on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturdays than we do on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays and that had about a 50 basis -- that was about a 50 basis point headwind in Q2 over Q1.
So just to summarize, the good news is we're back to a situation where treatments are growing quarter-over-quarter. The new-to-dialysis admissions remain strong. That said, there continues to be a bit of noise in the numbers."

A couple of other things, Justin, while you were asking about the value-based care and how do we calculate it with dialysis and non-dialysis. I think it's important to do the math you're doing. You subtract the dialysis, and then you have to put in there that the payer/government have a participation in the savings, the nephrologist then has a participation in the savings. And that's how you trickle down to the percentage of the 1, 2 or 3 percentage roughly that Joel talked about."

If you do our CAGR over the last 5 years or so, I believe we're right at 1% or so, slightly below. And so we view the levers quite thoughtfully over time in there. We're managing in essence pharmaceuticals, we're managing productivity and, of course, wage rate when there's other things like supplies and other miscellaneous items, which we are very diligent on. So we don't think those dynamics will change much other than during COVID. Of course, the PPE has gone up dramatically, and we hope that, that stabilizes over time.
As it relates to the wage inflation, we have nothing really particular to say about it. We are another player in this really dynamic marketplace, and it feels like it's shifting quite aggressively right now. Is that a short period or does that sustain itself? So I don't think I can comment on the multiyear. It is fair to say that we are aggressively looking at all the pharmaceutical and all the options to make sure that our physicians have the choice of their pharmaceutical, but at the best price possible. So I don't know if I got to all of your questions.
I think the last part of it was around capacity utilization. And of course, we are watching it very aggressively. We went from a time where we were very aggressive on the de novo build, too. As you can see, we really tapered that back and we're building a lot more home centers, which are a lot more capital efficient. We will keep that sort of balance in check because we know that patients need the interplay between the home and the center. And so there needs to be that capacity available. And as we lost here, roughly 5% of our patients during COVID, we are aggressively taking a look at our portfolio to make sure that our patients have access and that we are not having centers that are not at the right capacity."

We are excited to talk to you today about our strong Q2 performance, our 2021 financial outlook and recent developments on our efforts to transform Kidney Care. First, let me start the conversation with a clinical highl",1308,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon. We are excited to talk to you today about our strong Q2 performance, our 2021 financial outlook and recent developments on our efforts to transform Kidney Care. First, let me start the conversation with a clinical highlight.
A kidney transplant is the best treatment option for eligible patients with kidney failure. DaVita has worked hard over the years to help our patients gain access to transplant through education and direct support for patients to get on and stay on the transplantation waitlist. The cumulative impact is meaningful. Last December, we announced a milestone of 100,000 DaVita patients who have received a transplant since the year 2000.
To further advance the cause of transplantation, DaVita and the National Kidney Foundation are collaborating on a year-long pilot aimed at improving health equity in kidney transplantation with a focus on living donors. Increasing living donor transplant expands access to transplantation by increasing the availability of organs, which has been the limiting factor in the number of transplants performed annually. This pilot provides high touch and customized information to patients and families seeking a kidney transplantation from a living donor. We look forward to learning more from this pilot, improving the health equity of kidney transplant and continuing to be the leader in supporting our patients to receive kidney transplants.
Shifting to the latest update on COVID. We have made incredible progress in our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic over the past several months. New COVID infections among our patients continue to drop significantly through the last week of June, down more than 95% from the peak in early January. However, similar to the rest of the country, we have started to see an uptick over the last few weeks. As of last week, on a rolling 7-day average basis, new infections are still down more than 90% from the peak. Thus far, our mortality continues to remain low on an absolute basis as we believe that our vaccinated patients are more protected from severe cases of COVID. We continue to educate our patients about the benefits of vaccine to reduce vaccine hesitancy and we remain confident in our policies and procedures designed to keep our patients and our teammates safe while they're in our care.
Now let me turn to our financial performance in the second quarter. We delivered strong results in both operating income and earnings per share. Our margins expanded as we continue to manage costs while delivering quality care. As a result, we delivered 6% year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income and 35% year-over-year growth in our adjusted earnings per share. Our free cash flow was particularly strong this quarter, and we continue to return cash to our shareholders through our stock buybacks. With the first half of the year behind us, we are now increasing the midpoint of guidance for the full year.
Let me transition to update our progress in our Integrated Kidney Care efforts, otherwise known as IKC. Value-based care for our patients with kidney disease is gaining momentum and appear to have reached an inflection point. We have always believed that coordinating dialysis care with the broader health care needs of CKD and ESKD patients could simultaneously improve outcomes and reduce total health care costs.
For years, we've been participating in a variety of small programs and pilots to build our integrated care capability and better understand the economics. We believe we are at that point now where we are ready to shift to the next stage of the evolution of integrated care.
You might be wondering why now? The trend towards value-based care is not new either in Kidney Care or other segments of health care. So what's changed to make the developments of scale business viable today? There's a couple of reasons. First, with the growth of Medicare Advantage, payers are looking for innovative ways to manage the increasing number of ESKD patients choosing MA plans. These patients tend to be more complex than most MA patients and should benefit from tailored care management.
Second, CMS recently initiated the payment models in Kidney Care. We're preparing to partner with nephrologists in up to 12 markets beginning in January of next year to participate in CKCC voluntary programs. Our participation in CKCC model will also provide us with operational scale in more geographies to enter into other value-based arrangements.
Lastly, we've increased our confidence in our capabilities to deliver clinical and economic value at scale and have leaned in on our willingness to take risk. We believe we're well positioned to win in integrated care because of our strong partnership with nephrologists, our regular and consistent interactions with patients, a broad Kidney Care platform that spans various modalities of care settings and a clinical data set and analytics that we use to create, develop clinical interventions to support our patient holistically.
We have a demonstrated track record of improving patient outcomes, coordinating care and lowering costs for patients in risk arrangements. For example, in our ESCOs, we were able to generate non-dialysis cost savings in the high single digits, which translated into more than double the average savings rates compared to the rest of the industry over the life of the program. With our special needs plan, we have been able to lower mortality by 23% relative to other patients within the same center and county.
To give you a better sense of the scale of the business, as of today, approximately 10% of our U.S. dialysis patients are in value-based care arrangements in which DaVita is responsible for managing the total cost of care. This represents almost $2 billion of annual medical costs under management. In addition, we have various other forms of value-based care arrangements with payers in which we have economic incentives for improving quality and lowering costs.
In 2022, we expect our Integrated Kidney Care business to double in size, both the number of patients and risk arrangements and the dollars under management. We also expect to see a dramatic increase in the number of CKD lives we have under risk in 2022.
To prepare for this growth, we are currently scaling up our clinical team and furthering building out our support function. Because of the investment as well as the delays in cost savings impacts of our model of care and revenue recognition, we expect to incur a net operating loss of $120 million in 2021 in our U.S. ancillary segment. This outcome is consistent with the OI headwinds from IKC growth we called out at the beginning of the year and is, of course, included in our full year guidance.
The doubling of the business next year could result in an incremental operating loss in our ancillary segment of $50 million in 2022. We expect significant improvement in our financial performance beginning in 2023 as we begin to recognize savings from the new contract that we entered in 2021 and 2022.
Over the 5-plus year horizon, we believe that our IKC business could become a sustainable driver of significant operating income growth. Currently, we serve approximately 200,000 dialysis patients across the country. We utilized over $12 billion in health care services outside of the dialysis facility, including the cost of hospitalization, outpatient procedures and physician services. In addition, we see an opportunity to manage the care of upstream CKD patients who currently do not dialyze in our centers. Assuming that we are managing the total cost of care for more than half of our dialysis patients as well as other CKD patients at low to single digit margin, we believe that this could be a meaningful financial opportunity.
In summary, all of health care has been talking about value-based for years. We are excited for DaVita to lead the way. With that, I will turn the call over to Joel."
35644,1674696259,2361620,"DaVita Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","DaVita Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Javier. We had a strong quarter despite the continuing operational challenges presented by COVID, primarily as a result of strong RPT performance and continued discipline on costs.For the quarter, operating income was $490 million and earnings p",810,"Thanks, Javier. We had a strong quarter despite the continuing operational challenges presented by COVID, primarily as a result of strong RPT performance and continued discipline on costs.
For the quarter, operating income was $490 million and earnings per share were $2.64. Our Q2 results include a net COVID headwind of approximately $35 million, similar to what we saw in Q1. Primarily the impact of excess mortality on volumes and elevated PPE costs, partially offset by sequestration relief and reduced travel and meeting expenses.
Turning to volume. In Q2, treatments per day increased by 0.4% compared to Q1. Excess mortality declined significantly in Q2 from approximately 3,000 in Q1 to fewer than 500 in Q2. At this point, we are cautiously optimistic that the worst is behind us, but we're closely monitoring the potential impact of the Delta variant, especially within pockets of the country that have lower vaccination rates. Longer term, we continue to believe that we will return to pre-pandemic treatment growth levels with an additional tailwind from lower than normal mortality rates.
Our U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment grew sequentially by almost $6 this quarter, primarily due to normal seasonal improvements from patients meeting their coinsurance and deductible obligations. We also saw favorable changes in government rate and mix, including the continued growth in the percentage of patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Patient care costs and G&A expense per treatment in total were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Our patient care costs decreased sequentially, primarily due to reductions in labor costs. Our G&A increased slightly primarily due to charitable contributions and increases in personnel costs.
As expected, our U.S. dialysis and lab DSOs decreased by approximately 6 days in Q2 versus Q1, primarily due to collections on the temporary billing holds related to the winter storms in the first quarter. The majority of the impact of the storms on DSO and cash flow will reverse in Q2, but we may see an ongoing smaller benefit through the balance of the year.
During the second quarter, we generated a gain of approximately $9 million on one of our DaVita Venture Group investments, which hit the other income line on our P&L. We have a small investment in Miromatrix Medical that recently went public. The value of this investment at quarter end was $23 million. Going forward, we will be market to market every quarter.
Now turning to some updates on the rest of this year and some initial thoughts on 2022. As Javier mentioned, we are raising our guidance ranges for 2021 as follows: adjusted earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.40; adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion to $1.875 billion; and free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Also, we now expect our 2021 effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita to be between 24% and 26%, lower than the 26% to 28% range that we had communicated at the beginning of the year. These new guidance ranges exclude the potential impact of a significant fourth COVID surge later this year.
I'll call out 2 notable potential headwinds during the second half of the year. First is COVID. We continue to expect the impact of excess mortality will be higher in the back half of the year than in the first half of the year due to the compounding impact of mortality through 2021. We're also expecting an uptick on costs related to testing, vaccinations and teammate support as a result of the Delta variants. As a result, we're increasing the middle of the range of COVID impact for the full year to $170 million from $150 million. That implies a $30 million headwind from COVID in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. As a reminder, this is the middle of what is a wide range of possible impacts depending on the impact of the Delta or other variants and any additional COVID mandate.
Second, we expect to experience losses in our U.S. ancillary segment of approximately $70 million in the second half of the year compared to $50 million in the first half of the year. This incremental loss is due primarily to new value-based care arrangements and start-up costs associated with the CKCC program that launches in 2022.
Looking forward to 2022, we do not expect anything unusual among the primary drivers of the business, including RPT, cost per treatment or capital expenditures. However, we expect pressure on OI growth from the increased spend on growing our IKC business, the possibility of union activity in 2022 that we did not face in 2021 and the first year of depreciation expense associated with our new clinical IT platform that we have been developing for the past several years. We will provide more specific 2022 guidance on a future earnings call.

I hope I got all that, but please jump in if I didn't catch it. So starting off, in terms of where it is on the P&L, we've got a segment of our strategic initiatives, which breaks down between U.S. and international. The U.S. component of strategic initiatives is an excellent proxy for our IKC P&L. We've simplified what exists in that segment over the last few years as we've exited some of the strategic initiatives. And other than a couple of small things, it's everything related to IKC through that line. So I think as you think about both revenue and operating income, using the U.S. component of SIs as a proxy for our IKC business is a really good way to look at it. So that's number one.
In terms of where this can go over time, look, there are a lot of questions around how many members we can enroll here, what our savings rate can be, how much of that will ultimately capture. I think a reasonably simple way to model it would be to start with something like 1/3 of our ESKD population in this -- use a spend per patient especially if you're looking out a few years of $100,000 per patient and that will give you a medical cost under management.
And then the question is what percent of medical costs under management do we think can turn into OI? And I would say a reasonable number would be something in the low single digits, something equivalent to what a typical MA plan would drive as margin. So 1%, 2%, 3%, maybe 4% in that range as a percentage of medical cost under management, I think, is the right way to think about what the potential for this is in the out years.
Sorry, Peter, I think you had a third question, which I didn't catch."

So look, I think the right number to look at is not patients, but treatments per day. And the good news, let me try and walk you through. First, the good news is treatments per day grew in Q2 over Q1. And I think a sequential view of it will get you a better model than a year-over-year view. So sequentially, treatments per day grew in Q2 over Q1 about 400 treatments per day. There's a bunch of things going on in there. And so let me try and break it down for you.
First, the good news is the new-to-dialysis treatment starts remain strong. So the question that we've gotten in the past about what has happened within the CKD population as a result of COVID, we continue to see strong new-to-dialysis treatment -- admissions. So we don't feel any pressure there right now.
In terms of Q2 over Q1, Q2 did benefit from the storms in Q1. So you'll remember the storms in -- from Uri led to lower treatment volume in Q1. And so the comparison in Q2 was a positive there. That said, there are a few things weighing on the quarter. First, acute volumes are down, as you would expect, with the pandemic getting better in Q2 over Q1. Second, excess mortality remained above normal. It was well below what we saw in Q1. It came down from 3,000 approximately to less than 500, but it still remained above normal. And finally, the mix of treatment days in Q2 was unfavorable. We do fewer treatments on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturdays than we do on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays and that had about a 50 basis -- that was about a 50 basis point headwind in Q2 over Q1.
So just to summarize, the good news is we're back to a situation where treatments are growing quarter-over-quarter. The new-to-dialysis admissions remain strong. That said, there continues to be a bit of noise in the numbers."

If you do our CAGR over the last 5 years or so, I believe we're right at 1% or so, slightly below. And so we view the levers quite thoughtfully over time in there. We're managing in essence pharmaceuticals, we're managing productivity and, of course, wage rate when there's other things like supplies and other miscellaneous items, which we are very diligent on. So we don't think those dynamics will change much other than during COVID. Of course, the PPE has gone up dramatically, and we hope that, that stabilizes over time.
As it relates to the wage inflation, we have nothing really particular to say about it. We are another player in this really dynamic marketplace, and it feels like it's shifting quite aggressively right now. Is that a short period or does that sustain itself? So I don't think I can comment on the multiyear. It is fair to say that we are aggressively looking at all the pharmaceutical and all the options to make sure that our physicians have the choice of their pharmaceutical, but at the best price possible. So I don't know if I got to all of your questions.
I think the last part of it was around capacity utilization. And of course, we are watching it very aggressively. We went from a time where we were very aggressive on the de novo build, too. As you can see, we really tapered that back and we're building a lot more home centers, which are a lot more capital efficient. We will keep that sort of balance in check because we know that patients need the interplay between the home and the center. And so there needs to be that capacity available. And as we lost here, roughly 5% of our patients during COVID, we are aggressively taking a look at our portfolio to make sure that our patients have access and that we are not having centers that are not at the right capacity."

Q3 was another strong quarter for DaVita in the face of a challenging operating environment. Despite another rise in COVID case counts across the United States, in an increasingly challenging labor market, we continue to provide quality of care to our patients and execute on our strategic objectives. 
I want to begin my remarks by highlighting an exciting milestone. We surpassed 15% of our patients dialyzing at home. This means that approximately 30,000 of our patients received a clinical and lifestyle benefits of home dialysis. As we've explained before, to be sustainable provider of home dialysis, it requires a comprehensive infrastructure, including convenient and easy access to a home center for training sessions and recurring visits with our care teams. 
Our current network of centers provides that easy access, such that 80% of our dialysis patients live within 10 miles of a DaVita home center. In addition, we continue to innovate on our platform to help make home dialysis an easier choice for patients and their physicians and to extend the duration on home dialysis once patients have made that choice. 
A few highlights of note. First, we recently rolled out an enhanced education program along with supporting technology for our new patients to ensure that they receive timely and comprehensive modality education, which is tailored to each patient's individual needs. 
We also continue to work on additional enhancements and customization to our education process for different communities, such as Black and Hispanic patients to improve their chance of selecting this modality and therefore, improve health equity; second, we developed a patient portal and telemedicine platform that supports remote monitoring and communications between DaVita caregivers, our nephrologist partners and our home patients; third, we developed a team of industry-leading home physicians to create an expert network, which works closely with practicing physicians and practice leaders to help them understand the benefits of home modalities, troubleshooting complex clinical issues and elevate their home clinical skills. 
Last, we're testing out our AI and other technology to optimize PD prescription, alerting physicians in real time when an update prescription might be needed. We will discuss the strategic advantages of our platform in greater detail on November 16 on our virtual Capital Markets Day. On to our Q3 results. Our business model continues to prove resilient in face of operating challenges. Q3 operating income grew approximately 9% year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share grew by more than 31% over the same period. 
However, the ongoing COVID pandemic continues to take its toll on too many human lives in the world at large and amongst our patients. Across the broad U.S. population, the current surge driven by the Delta variant appears to have peaked in early September with new case counts reaching approximately 2/3 of the peak during the past winter. 
Fortunately, within our dialysis patient population, the new case counts peaked approximately 1/3 of the winter peak and mortality rates were relatively lower, likely due to the vaccination rates amongst our patients. Incremental mortality increased from fewer than 500 in Q2 to approximately 2,000 in Q3. 
After quarter end, COVID infections continue to decline with our new case count during the week ending October 16, down by approximately 60% relative to the recent Delta peak. Switching to vaccines. Approximately 73% of our patients have now been vaccinated. In addition, we've started to roll out vaccine boosters for eligible patients in accordance with CDC guidelines. We're hopeful that any future COVID surges and breakthrough infections will be more limited relative to what we saw in the peak of last winter. 
Shifting to cost. Cost management continues to be strong in the quarter, although we are facing the same competitive dynamics in the market for health care workers as other companies have mentioned. Despite these challenges, I'm pleased with how our frontline leadership team has been responding. It has long been a key part of our mission to be the employer of choice. How we live this aspect of our mission has been evident throughout the pandemic, as our team has retained relentless focus on the safety and care of our patients as well as one another. 
As we have discussed in past calls, we continue to offer a safe and fulfilling work environment and have provided incremental pay and benefits to help our frontline caregivers during this challenging time. These efforts are ongoing. 
Given the current environment, we expect to provide our teammates with higher annual compensation increases than in typical years. This will put additional pressure on our cost structure, but we believe this will help us attract and retain the talent needed to achieve our long-term objectives. Just as critical and aligned with our mission and build on our history of investing in our people. 
Finally, I would like to say a few words about Integrated Kidney Care or IKC. Last quarter, we shared details on our planned investment in IKC and long-term opportunity this creates for patients, payers and our shareholders. At the end of Q3, we now have over 22,000 patients in some form of integrated care arrangements, representing $1.7 billion of value-based care contracts. 
Next year, we expect to approximately double the size of our IKC business, driven primarily by our participation in the federal government's new CKCC program. While it is still early and contingent on successful execution, we believe that the investing in IKC represents a new and potentially meaningful earnings opportunity for us in the coming years. 
This is another area we plan to discuss in detail at our upcoming Virtual Capital Markets Day. With that, I will turn it over to Joe for more details on the quarter."

Despite the operating challenges, Javier referenced, we delivered another quarter of strong results. Operating income was $475 million and earnings per share was $2.36. Our Q3 results include a net COVID headwind of approximately $55 mil",1158,"Thanks, Javier. Despite the operating challenges, Javier referenced, we delivered another quarter of strong results. Operating income was $475 million and earnings per share was $2.36. 
Our Q3 results include a net COVID headwind of approximately $55 million, an increase relative to the quarterly impact that we experienced in the first half of the year. As Javier mentioned, the latest COVID surge resulted in excess mortality in the quarter of approximately 2,000 compared to fewer than 500 in Q2. We're also anticipating the mortality in Q4 to be higher than it was in Q2, although we've seen a decrease in the last few weeks that we hope continues. 
Our current view of the OI impact of COVID for the year is worse by approximately $40 million compared to our expectations from last quarter. For 2021, we now expect total net COVID impact of approximately $210 million. Treatments per day were down by [ $536 ] or 0.6% in Q3 compared to Q2. The primary headwind was the increase in our estimated excess mortalities and higher missed treatments as a result of the COVID surge. 
In addition, the quarter had a higher ratio of Tuesday, Thursdays, Saturdays, which lowered treatments per day for the quarter by approximately [ $300 ]. In light of the current Delta surge and the compounding impact of mortalities on our year-over-year growth, we believe that the timing of a return to positive NAG will now be delayed into 2022. 
Revenue per treatment was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Patient care cost per treatment was up approximately $5 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher teammate compensation and benefit expenses. This is the result of higher wages, additional training costs associated with an increase in our new hires and seasonality in health care benefit expenses, which we expect to continue into Q4. Our Integrated Kidney Care business saw an improvement in its operating loss in the quarter, which is due primarily to positive prior period development in our special needs plan. 
We continue to expect increased cost in Q4, especially in our projected CKCC markets as we ramp up staffing in preparation for 2022. DSOs for our U.S. dialysis and lab business increased by approximately 3 days quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to fluctuations in the timing of billing and collections. Other loss for the quarter was $7.6 million, primarily due to a $9 million decline in the mark-to-market of our investment in Miromatrix. The value of this investment at quarter end was $14 million. 
Now turning to some updates for the rest of the year and beyond. As I mentioned on the Q2 earnings call, we excluded any impact of a significant surge in COVID from the Delta variant in our revised guidance, but noted that a wider range of outcomes was possible depending in part on how a fourth surge would develop. Now that we've seen the impact of the Delta surge, we are increasing our estimate of COVID impact for the year by $40 million. 
Given where we are in the year, we are now incorporating this COVID impact into our revised adjusted OI guidance of $1.76 billion to $1.81 billion. We are also narrowing our guidance for adjusted EPS to $8.80 to $9.15 per share, and we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, although there is some chance that our free cash flow may fall below the bottom end of the range, depending on the timing of our DSO recovery. 
Our revised OI guidance implies a decline in our Q4 financial performance relative to Q3. This is partially explained by the incremental COVID mortality impact and by expected higher salaries and wages for existing frontline teammates. Our guidance anticipates Q4 operating income to be negatively impacted by approximately $75 million of seasonally high or onetime items, including certain compensation expenses, elevated training costs, higher health benefit expenses and G&A. 
Looking ahead to 2022, the 3 expected headwinds I talked about on the Q2 earnings call remain. As a reminder, we expect to have added expense related to the [indiscernible] portion of the industry effort to counter the ballot initiative in California. We anticipate a year-over-year incremental investment in the range of $50 million as we continue to grow our IKC business. And we will also begin depreciating our new clinical IT platform, which we expect to be approximately $40 million. 
A few additional things to help you with our thinking about 2022. COVID remains a big uncertainty. We are anticipating the end of the temporary sequestration suspension, which would be a $70 million headwind for the full year. We also expect that some of the costs that spiked during COVID, in particular, PPE may not return as quickly to pre-COVID levels due to the challenges of the global supply chain. 
Finally, COVID's impact on mortality next year remains a large swing factor. Another winter surge would negatively impact treatment volume and could delay the timing of achieving positive NAG. 
However, if the recent surge proves to be the last significant COVID surge then we would expect a tailwind from lower than typical mortality, which could result in treatment growth higher than pre-COVID level. In 2022, we expect net labor costs will increase more than in typical years as a result of market pressures. Our current estimate is a net headwind of $50 million to $75 million. 
We expect to offset a significant amount of these incremental costs with continuing MA penetration growth above historical levels and strong management of nonlabor patient care costs. From an operating income growth perspective, we expect 2022 will be a transition year with some significant but largely temporary headwinds to get through, after which we expect our platform to continue to support strong profit growth. 
While the range of potential outcomes for 2022 is broad, a reasonable scenario could result in an OI decline of $150 million from our 2021 guidance. This includes the impact from the expected ballot initiative, IKC and the increased depreciation. This scenario also includes a modest headwind from COVID, although there are scenarios where the impact of COVID could be significantly worse. 
Looking forward to 2023, we anticipate a reversal of the net impact of these 2022 headwinds plus incremental operating income growth such that we expect 2023 operating income to show a low to mid-single-digit CAGR from the midpoint of our updated 2021 guidance, which would be in line with the multiyear outlook we have shared historically. We expect this to be the result of the lack of ballot initiative related costs, the recognition of savings in IKC, an improved COVID situation and continued growth of the core business. 
We'll have more to say about long-term guidance at our Capital Markets Day in a couple of weeks. Finally, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our stock and in October to date, we repurchased an additional 1.2 million shares. Operator, please open the call for Q&A."

So what we've seen in mortality is a pickup in Q3 to about 2,000 excess mortality. Remember, we were below 500 in Q2.

So if you look at -- if you're trying to triangulate in on growth, what you see for the quarter, Q3 over Q2 is treatment growth per day, that's down a bit. That's largely the result of the excess mortality. There are also -- there were more Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and that was about a 300 treatment per day headwind in the quarter as well. 
So that's the -- those are the numbers behind it. In terms of the financial impact from COVID, what you're seeing is definitely, the excess mortality that hits in Q3. It hits even harder in Q4. You're also seeing some increase in miss treatments, which we've seen in prior surges, and we're anticipating in Q4 again. And then you also see some increased labor costs associated with cohorting and stuff like that. So that's how I lay out the impact of mortality and other things on COVID in Q3 and Q4."

Those are things we tend to see in most years, and they're a bit exaggerated this year as a result of the patterns resulting from COVID. 
But to get to your fundamental question of what's a good jumping off point for next year. I think the full year number for 2021 is a reasonable baseline off of which to jump off for next year.

So I'll start with the caveat that 2023 is a long way away, and we're even cautious about talking about '22 given the uncertainty.

So I'll start with the caveat that 2023 is a long way away, and we're even cautious about talking about '22 given the uncertainty. So I wouldn't think of this as guidance, but just some reasonable estimates to help you think things through. So on IKC, I think a $50 million reversal of the headwind we're seeing in '22 is a reasonable way to think about '23. 
So basically winding up in '23 about where we are in '21. COVID is really, really hard to think about. That said, if you assume that COVID disappears at some point next year, I think the right way to think about it, and now I'm bridging basically from '21 to '23 is we've got a $70 million sequestration suspension that becomes a tailwind, right? We're getting all of that in '21. That goes away in '22 and stays away forever. 
So there's a $70 million headwind there. We've got roughly a comparable number of net expenses associated with COVID. Think about labor, think about the increased spend on PPE with some offset related to T&E primarily. And that net number is a $70 million number today. So as that dissipates what you've really got is effectively a tailwind from that, that offsets the headwind from sequestration and what you're left with is mortality. 
And mortality today is on a run rate basis, somewhere in the $240 million number. And what we would expect is over some long period of time, 4, 5, 6, 7 years for that number to go to zero. So as that $240 million headwind we've got today dissipates, then you would see that coming back into earnings over time. So that's the COVID story."

If the ballot initiative is similar to what we've seen historically, it plays out largely in Q3, although there can be pieces in other quarters. 
The depreciation number I've talked about is probably likely to be more of a back half of the year event. You might see some in Q2, but it will be back-end loaded. And COVID is complicated. It will -- the sequestration, assuming it goes away, will happen on 1/1, so there'll be a big hit related to that starting in January, how exactly the other costs roll out hard to predict, although net-net, you'd probably see that improving as the year goes on, although not that big a number. 
And I'm not sure how to even help you with the mortality figure. Historically, even when mortality comes down, it still accumulates. Next year, if there is no winter wave and COVID overall begins to go away, I think you'd expect to see that starting to improve over the course of the year. I hope that helps."

First, in case it's useful. Medicare has a basket update. And the way it's calculated is not looking at pure dialysis and what's happening to cost either retrospective or prospectively, rather, there's an economic firm that forecast inflation and then they subtract what they call a productivity adjustment, which, in essence, is a 10-year average that's trying to measure the efficiency of the economy. 
So as you can imagine, that's got some complexity. As it relates to the commercial business, the way it's done is usually through a negotiated way. And so every single one of them is negotiated individually and the timing tends to be effective whenever the contract was shy. And so if you think of a contract that was signed in February, usually, the annual escalator would be done in February of the next year. That's the most traditional way of doing it. 
Of course, there can be other ways that have a pay-for-performance or other mechanisms. But in general, that's how that works. As it relates to your second question on CKCC. The short answer is we don't know. For right now, it's a CMMI pilot. And so it's authorized for 2 years. Of course, the intent to try it out and see if it's effective and if it works for the system and if we're doing well by the patients, and then I would assume that then Medicare would try to extend it, we try to think of a world where hopefully, you get to somewhere in the 30,000 patients in one way or another being through MA or a CMMI vehicle, but we will see."

The best way to think of the ESCO is actually not that they were profitable, but what non-dialysis savings were actually quite good. But then, of course, you have to apply the operating model and then you have to load the G&A. And now in the models that we have, we also have to share with partners. 
And so that's how the numbers sort of trickles down. And you have to get to scale. And so a good way of thinking is that once you do all that and you go through all those iterations, you probably will get to a low single-digit OI number. And depending if you're grabbing non-dialysis, I would think of it somewhere in the 3-ish percent or so if you're thinking of the entire number, it's 1.5% or so because it's roughly half dialysis and half the other non-dialysis costs. But in the ESCOs, when you fully load them, we didn't make money, rather people were measuring whether it was effective at reducing nondialysis costs."

Q3 was another strong quarter for DaVita in the face of a challenging operating environment. Despite another rise in COVID case counts across the United States and an increasingly challenging labor market, we continue t",948,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon. Q3 was another strong quarter for DaVita in the face of a challenging operating environment. Despite another rise in COVID case counts across the United States and an increasingly challenging labor market, we continue to provide quality of care to our patients and execute on our strategic objectives. 
I want to begin my remarks by highlighting an exciting milestone. We surpassed 15% of our patients dialyzing at home. This means that approximately 30,000 of our patients received a clinical and lifestyle benefits of home dialysis. As we've explained before, to be sustainable provider of home dialysis, it requires a comprehensive infrastructure, including convenient and easy access to a home center for training sessions and recurring visits with our care teams. 
Our current network of centers provides that easy access, such that 80% of our dialysis patients live within 10 miles of the DaVita home center. In addition, we continue to innovate on our platform to help make home dialysis an easier choice for patients and their physicians and to extend the duration on home dialysis once patients have made that choice. 
A few highlights of note. First, we recently rolled out an enhanced education program along with supporting technology for our new patients to ensure that they receive timely and comprehensive modality education, which is tailored to each patient's individual needs. 
We also continue to work on additional enhancements and customization to our education process for different communities such as Black and Hispanic patients to improve their chance of selecting this modality and therefore, improve health equity; second, we developed a patient portal and telemedicine platform that supports remote monitoring and communications between DaVita caregivers, our nephrologist partners and our home patients; third, we developed a team of industry-leading home physicians to create an expert network, which works closely with practicing physicians and practice leaders to help them understand the benefits of home modalities, troubleshooting complex clinical issues and elevate their home clinical skills. 
Last, we're testing out our AI and other technology to optimize PD prescription, alerting physicians in real time when an update prescription might be needed. We will discuss the strategic advantages of our platform in greater detail on November 16 on our virtual Capital Markets Day. 
On to our Q3 results. Our business model continues to prove resilient in face of operating challenges. Q3 operating income grew approximately 9% year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share grew by more than 31% over the same period. 
However, the ongoing COVID pandemic continues to take its toll on too many human lives in the world at large and amongst our patients. Across the broad U.S. population, the current surge driven by the Delta variant appears to have peaked in early September with new case counts reaching approximately 2/3 of the peak during the past winter. 
Fortunately, within our dialysis patient population, the new case counts peaked approximately 1/3 of the winter peak and mortality rates were relatively lower, likely due to the vaccination rates amongst our patients. Incremental mortality increased from fewer than 500 in Q2 to approximately 2,000 in Q3. 
After quarter end, COVID infections continue to decline with our new case count during the week ending October 16, down by approximately 60% relative to the recent Delta peak. Switching to vaccines. Approximately 73% of our patients have now been vaccinated. In addition, we've started to roll out vaccine boosters for eligible patients in accordance with CDC guidelines. We're hopeful that any future COVID surges and breakthrough infections will be more limited relative to what we saw in the peak of last winter. 
Shifting to cost. Cost management continues to be strong in the quarter, although we are facing the same competitive dynamics in the market for health care workers as other companies have mentioned. Despite these challenges, I'm pleased with how our frontline leadership team has been responding. It has long been a key part of our mission to be the employer of choice. How we live this aspect of our mission has been evident throughout the pandemic, as our team has retained relentless focus on the safety and care of our patients as well as one another. 
As we have discussed in past calls, we continue to offer a safe and fulfilling work environment and have provided incremental pay and benefits to help our frontline caregivers during this challenging time. These efforts are ongoing. 
Given the current environment, we expect to provide our teammates with higher annual compensation increases than in typical years. This will put additional pressure on our cost structure, but we believe this will help us attract and retain the talent needed to achieve our long-term objectives. Just as critical and aligned with our mission and build on our history of investing in our people. 
Finally, I would like to say a few words about Integrated Kidney Care or IKC. Last quarter, we shared details on our planned investment in IKC and long-term opportunity this creates for patients, payers and our shareholders. At the end of Q3, we now have over 22,000 patients in some form of integrated care arrangements, representing $1.7 billion of value-based care contracts. 
Next year, we expect to approximately double the size of our IKC business, driven primarily by our participation in the federal government's new CKCC program. While it is still early and contingent on successful execution, we believe that the investing in IKC represents a new and potentially meaningful earnings opportunity for us in the coming years. 
This is another area we plan to discuss in detail at our upcoming virtual Capital Markets Day. With that, I will turn it over to Joel for more details on the quarter."

Despite the operating challenges Javier referenced, we delivered another quarter of strong results. Operating income was $475 million and earnings per share was $2.36. Our Q3 results include a net COVID headwind of approximately $55 mill",1154,"Thanks, Javier. Despite the operating challenges Javier referenced, we delivered another quarter of strong results. Operating income was $475 million and earnings per share was $2.36. 
Our Q3 results include a net COVID headwind of approximately $55 million, an increase relative to the quarterly impact that we experienced in the first half of the year. As Javier mentioned, the latest COVID surge resulted in excess mortality in the quarter of approximately 2,000 compared to fewer than 500 in Q2. We're also anticipating the mortality in Q4 to be higher than it was in Q2, although we've seen a decrease in the last few weeks that we hope continues. 
Our current view of the OI impact of COVID for the year is worse by approximately $40 million compared to our expectations from last quarter. For 2021, we now expect a total net COVID impact of approximately $210 million. Treatments per day were down by 536 or 0.6% in Q3 compared to Q2. The primary headwind was the increase in our estimated excess mortalities and higher missed treatments as a result of the COVID surge. 
In addition, the quarter had a higher ratio of Tuesday, Thursdays, Saturdays, which lowered treatments per day for the quarter by approximately 300. In light of the current Delta surge and the compounding impact of mortalities on our year-over-year growth, we believe that the timing of a return to positive NAG will now be delayed into 2022. 
Revenue per treatment was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Patient care cost per treatment was up approximately $5 quarter-over-quarter primarily due to higher teammate compensation and benefit expenses. This is the result of higher wages, additional training costs associated with an increase in our new hires and seasonality in health care benefit expenses, which we expect to continue into Q4. Our Integrated Kidney Care business saw an improvement in its operating loss in the quarter, which is due primarily to positive prior period development in our special needs plan. 
We continue to expect increased cost in Q4, especially in our projected CKCC markets as we ramp up staffing in preparation for 2022. DSOs for our U.S. dialysis and lab business increased by approximately 3 days quarter-over-quarter primarily due to fluctuations in the timing of billing and collections. Other loss for the quarter was $7.6 million primarily due to a $9 million decline in the mark-to-market of our investment in Miromatrix. The value of this investment at quarter end was $14 million. 
Now turning to some updates for the rest of the year and beyond. As I mentioned on the Q2 earnings call, we excluded any impact of a significant surge in COVID from the Delta variant in our revised guidance, but noted that a wider range of outcomes was possible depending in part on how a fourth surge would develop. Now that we've seen the impact of the Delta surge, we are increasing our estimate of COVID impact for the year by $40 million. 
Given where we are in the year, we are now incorporating this COVID impact into our revised adjusted OI guidance of $1.76 billion to $1.81 billion. We are also narrowing our guidance for adjusted EPS to $8.80 to $9.15 per share, and we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, although there is some chance that our free cash flow may fall below the bottom end of the range, depending on the timing of our DSO recovery. 
Our revised OI guidance implies a decline in our Q4 financial performance relative to Q3. This is partially explained by the incremental COVID mortality impact and by expected higher salaries and wages for existing frontline teammates. Our guidance anticipates Q4 operating income to be negatively impacted by approximately $75 million of seasonally high or onetime items, including certain compensation expenses, elevated training costs, higher health benefit expenses and G&A. 
Looking ahead to 2022, the 3 expected headwinds I talked about on the Q2 earnings call remain. As a reminder, we expect to have added expense related to DaVita's portion of the industry effort to counter the ballot initiative in California. We anticipate a year-over-year incremental investment in the range of $50 million as we continue to grow our IKC business. And we will also begin depreciating our new clinical IT platform, which we expect to be approximately $40 million. 
A few additional things to help you with our thinking about 2022. COVID remains a big uncertainty. We are anticipating the end of the temporary sequestration suspension, which would be a $70 million headwind for the full year. We also expect that some of the costs that spiked during COVID, in particular, PPE may not return as quickly to pre-COVID levels due to the challenges of the global supply chain. 
Finally, COVID's impact on mortality next year remains a large swing factor. Another winter surge would negatively impact treatment volume and could delay the timing of achieving positive NAG. However, if the recent surge proves to be the last significant COVID surge, then we would expect a tailwind from lower than typical mortality which could result in treatment growth higher than pre-COVID level. 
In 2022, we expect net labor costs will increase more than in typical years as a result of market pressures. Our current estimate is a net headwind of $50 million to $75 million. We expect to offset a significant amount of these incremental costs with continuing MA penetration growth above historical levels and strong management of nonlabor patient care costs. From an operating income growth perspective, we expect 2022 will be a transition year with some significant but largely temporary headwinds to get through, after which we expect our platform to continue to support strong profit growth. 
While the range of potential outcomes for 2022 is broad, a reasonable scenario could result in an OI decline of $150 million from our 2021 guidance. This includes the impact from the expected ballot initiative, IKC and the increased depreciation. This scenario also includes a modest headwind from COVID, although there are scenarios where the impact of COVID could be significantly worse. 
Looking forward to 2023, we anticipate a reversal of the net impact of these 2022 headwinds plus incremental operating income growth such that we expect 2023 operating income to show a low to mid-single-digit CAGR from the midpoint of our updated 2021 guidance, which would be in line with the multiyear outlook we have shared historically. We expect this to be the result of the lack of ballot initiative related costs, the recognition of savings in IKC, an improved COVID situation and continued growth of the core business. 
We'll have more to say about long-term guidance at our Capital Markets Day in a couple of weeks. Finally, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our stock and in October to date, we repurchased an additional 1.2 million shares. Operator, please open the call for Q&A."

So what we've seen in mortality is a pickup in Q3 to about 2,000 excess mortality. Remember, we were below 500 in Q2.

So if you look at -- if you're trying to triangulate in on growth, what you see for the quarter, Q3 over Q2 is treatment growth per day, that's down a bit. That's largely the result of the excess mortality. There are also -- there were more Tuesday, Thursday, Saturdays and Monday, Wednesday, Fridays, and that was about a 300 treatment per day headwind in the quarter as well. 
So that's the -- those are the numbers behind it. In terms of the financial impact from COVID, what you're seeing is definitely, the excess mortality that hits in Q3, it hits even harder in Q4. You're also seeing some increase in missed treatments, which we've seen in prior surges, and we're anticipating in Q4 again. And then you also see some increased labor costs associated with cohorting and stuff like that. So that's how I'd lay out the impact of mortality and other things on COVID in Q3 and Q4."

Those are things we tend to see in most years, and they're a bit exaggerated this year as a result of the patterns resulting from COVID. 
But to get to your fundamental question of what's a good jumping off point for next year, I think the full year number for 2021 is a reasonable baseline off of which to jump off for next year. If you took Q4 and adjusted for the $75 million, you'd get to about the same spot."

So I'll start with the caveat that 2023 is a long way away, and we're even cautious about talking about '22 given the uncertainty.

So I'll start with the caveat that 2023 is a long way away, and we're even cautious about talking about '22 given the uncertainty. So I wouldn't think of this as guidance, but just some reasonable estimates to help you think things through. So on IKC, I think a $50 million reversal of the headwind we're seeing in '22 is a reasonable way to think about '23. 
So basically winding up in '23 about where we are in '21. COVID is really, really hard to think about. That said, if you assume that COVID disappears at some point next year, I think the right way to think about it, and now I'm bridging basically from '21 to '23 is we've got a $70 million sequestration suspension that becomes a tailwind, right? We're getting all of that in '21. That goes away in '22 and stays away forever. 
So there's a $70 million headwind there. We've got roughly a comparable number of net expenses associated with COVID. Think about labor, think about the increased spend on PPE with some offset related to T&E primarily. And that net number is a $70 million number today. So as that dissipates, what you've really got is effectively a tailwind from that, that offsets the headwind from sequestration and what you're left with is mortality. 
And mortality today is, on a run rate basis, somewhere in the $240 million number. And what we would expect is over some long period of time, 4, 5, 6, 7 years for that number to go to zero. So as that $240 million headwind we've got today dissipates, then you would see that coming back into earnings over time. So that's the COVID story."

The depreciation number I've talked about is probably likely to be more of a back half of the year event. You might see some in Q2, but it will be back-end loaded. And COVID is complicated. It will -- the sequestration, assuming it goes away, will happen on 1/1, so there'll be a big hit related to that starting in January. How exactly the other costs roll out, hard to predict, although net-net, you'd probably see that improving as the year goes on, although not that big a number. 
And I'm not sure how to even help you with the mortality figure. Historically, even when mortality comes down, it still accumulates.

First, in case it's useful. Medicare has a basket update. And the way it's calculated is not looking at pure dialysis and what's happening to cost either retrospective or prospectively, rather, there's an economic firm that forecast inflation and then they subtract what they call a productivity adjustment, which, in essence, is a 10-year average that's trying to measure the efficiency of the economy. 
So as you can imagine, that's got some complexity. As it relates to the commercial business, the way it's done is usually through a negotiated way. And so every single one of them is negotiated individually and the timing tends to be effective whenever the contract was shy. And so if you think of a contract that was signed in February, usually, the annual escalator would be done in February of the next year. That's the most traditional way of doing it. 
Of course, there can be other ways that have a pay-for-performance or other mechanisms. But in general, that's how that works. As it relates to your second question on CKCC, the short answer is we don't know. For right now, it's a CMMI pilot. And so it's authorized for 2 years. Of course, the intent to try it out and see if it's effective and if it works for the system and if we're doing well by the patients. And then I would assume that then Medicare would try to extend it. We try to think of a world where hopefully, you get to somewhere in that 30,000 patients in one way or another being through MA or a CMMI vehicle, but we will see."

And so that's how the numbers sort of trickles down. And you have to get to scale. And so a good way of thinking is that once you do all that and you go through all those iterations, you probably will get to a low single-digit OI number. And depending if you're grabbing non-dialysis, I would think of it somewhere in the 3-ish percent or so. If you're thinking of the entire number, it's 1.5% or so because it's roughly half dialysis and half the other non-dialysis costs. But in the ESCOs, when you fully load them, we didn't make money, rather people were measuring whether it was effective at reducing nondialysis costs."

And the thing I would remind you is in -- the costs all come upfront. You're paying for the model of care to deliver the savings, you're paying for the G&A, you're building capabilities. The revenue is delayed, and we won't see any revenue in year 1. 
Year 2, we'll start to see some but the number will grow over time as the effectiveness of the shared savings continues to grow. So there is not a good matching of revenue and cost, especially in years. So part of it is the investment and the scale that Javier talked about. Part of it is the delay in the revenue."
