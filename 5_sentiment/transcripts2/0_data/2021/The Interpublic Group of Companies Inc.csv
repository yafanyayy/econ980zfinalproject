I'll begin with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter and for the full year. Ellen will then provide additional details. I'll conclude with some updates on our agencies to be followed by our usual Q&A. 
First and foremost, I hope that you and your families continue to remain safe and healthy during the pandemic. As we all know, across much of the globe, the virus is still very much a presence in our daily lives. As such, our first priority continues to be to mitigate the impact of the health crisis on our colleagues and our clients as well as in our business. 
It's important to acknowledge the fact that over the past year, across IPG, our people have been subject to a range of extraordinary challenges. Their achievements have been remarkable, and I want to very clearly express our admiration for their resilience and our appreciation for their ongoing commitment and effort. 
Moving now to our results. We are pleased to report a solid fourth quarter under conditions that continue to be challenging and full year performance that once again should place us at the top of our sector. In the fourth quarter, our organic growth change of net revenue was negative 5.4%. You will recall that our Q4 2019 result was organic growth of 2.9%, which included significant headwinds from certain client losses. So for context, it's worth noting that our continuing book of business from last year's fourth quarter, which we were essentially lapping in Q4 2020, was a 5.6% growth number. 
In the U.S., the organic decrease in the quarter was 1.8% against a similarly challenging underlying U.S. comp of 6.4% growth in Q4 '19. In international markets, our organic decrease for fourth quarter 2020 was 10.5%. For the full year, our organic net revenue decrease was 4.8%. 
As you'd expect, those results continue to reflect the effect of the pandemic, which has had widely varying impacts on our businesses and clients. Our event companies, in particular, which are typically strong in the fourth quarter, continue to bear the brunt of the health situation given that restrictions on public gatherings remained in place in most markets around the world. 
Conversely, during the quarter, we continued to build positive momentum in disciplines such as media planning and investment. Additionally, client sectors such as health care and retail, which have been our growth leaders for the duration of the health crisis, continued to perform strongly in the fourth quarter. 
With respect to operating expenses, our teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline. As a result, we're pleased to report that our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which excludes a charge for restructuring, increased 70 basis points from a year ago from 21.1% to 21.8%. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share was $0.28 as reported and was $0.86 as adjusted for restructuring and other items. 
As is evident in our results this morning, we also continue to execute through to the close of the year with respect to our restructuring program. We had previously mentioned to you that our focus would be on driving strategic, long-term actions and expense reductions as we evolve our business model to new operating realities. A key component of that thinking is moving to a hybrid workplace environment with a reduced need for real estate and an increased role for work from home in the delivery of our services. 
During the year, our team was diligent in identifying a wide range of restructuring opportunities and related savings so as to better position the business going forward into 2021 and beyond. As you can see, this led to a fourth quarter charge that was significant, though it is largely noncash. We now expect that our restructuring actions for the full year will yield permanent annual operating expense reductions in the range of $160 million. 
While remaining very disciplined with respect to our expense structure, it's important to point out that we continue to invest in our business during the year in order to accelerate strategic development in areas of strongest secular opportunity and growth. That investment continues to result in differentiated capabilities and offerings, which are in demand and are driving success in the marketplace. 
We're aware of that, as a result of the pandemic, the velocity of change picked up even further last year in the digital space. That's where consumers increasingly interact with the brands and businesses. We're encouraged that our ability to create marketing and media solutions that bring together creativity, technology and data is resulting in growth with existing clients as well as new client wins. 
For some time now, we have spoken about the importance of our culture in making IPG a destination for top industry talent. This includes our commitment to strong agency brands with clearly defined identities and core capabilities. In recent years, we have developed very strong and differentiated data resources and data management capabilities. We bring these offerings together on behalf of clients in customized integrated solutions through our open architecture platform, which has been evolving over a period of many years. 
Another key pillar of our culture is our commitment to doing better when it comes to equity and inclusion. This is something I will remain focused on personally in my new role. It also bears mention that IPG has taken a strong position when it comes to transparency and ethics in all of our business practices, well ahead of the current scrutiny on the digital media ecosystem and growing concerns regarding consumer privacy. These are our strategic priorities going forward. And at this point, I thought it might be helpful to provide a few highlights of how they are coming together in the work we do on behalf of our clients. 
As you know, in May of last year, we launched Matterkind, an innovative offering that optimizes client media investment holistically and in real time across all addressable media channels. With access to unique data resources at Acxiom and patented algorithmic software created at Kinesso, Matterkind played a role in several new account wins and client retentions during the back half of last year. 
In the auto sector, a leading global OEM awarded an Open Architecture team several multiyear contracts to oversee their CRM activity, the first in North America as well as 2 others in some of Asia's largest national markets. This resulted from a pitch that included teams from our global ad networks and digital specialty agencies as well as capabilities from Acxiom, Kinesso and our global production studio. 
In the creative arena, we had a sizable health care win with an existing global client in Q4, which brought together a number of our specialist health care and consumer advertising agencies, again, backed by Acxiom, in an open architecture pitch. Also within the creative space in the CPG sector, we expanded our remit and doubled the size of our client relationship by using data-driven insights to generate creative ideas tailored to specific audiences. 
In tech and telecom, we proactively proposed an integrated solution to an existing domestic client of one of our large PR and one of our independent advertising agencies. This resulted in adding responsibility from media as well as a data layer to inform all marketing decision-making, again, nearly doubling our projected annualized revenue on this engagement. 
The common denominator in each of these examples is our ability to broaden the range of business issues that we can help clients address. Our goal is to become a more strategic partner, supporting client needs as they seek to derive more value from connecting marketing and technology to power their businesses. Over time, we believe this should also have the effect of opening new performance and IP-based revenue streams for us. Another
 key area of focus for us is e-commerce and connected commerce, where we deliver on the promise of digital business transformation by bringing together marketplace analysis, data services, tech-enabled creative and customer experience work, systems integration and performance media offerings. This is another area where Open Architecture is a vital approach since those capabilities reside within a range of our digital and media specialist agencies. It's also an area that has seen significant acceleration as a result of the health crisis. 
Heading into 2021, we are confident of the strength and competitiveness of our offerings and the talent within our group. The range of services we provide is growing in terms of the potential impact it has for our clients and their businesses. This means that looking ahead, we remain well positioned to fully participate in a global economic recovery. 
There remains, however, significant uncertainty driven by macro conditions that are beyond any of our control because the timing and magnitude of economic recovery clearly hinges on the resolution of the health crisis. We fully expect to return to positive organic growth over the course of this year and to post full year 2021 growth consistent with the industry, on top of our relatively stronger 2020 performance. But from our vantage point today, based on our bottom-up approach to building a financial plan as well as conversations with clients, it's fair to say that visibility to the full year 2021 remains challenged. 
To be clear, this is a question of timing and a function of the macro situation and not of the caliber or relevance of our offering, which we feel are both strong and complete. We will, of course, continue to align expenses with realized revenue in the disciplined way you've come to expect of us. Further, we will see the benefit of significant expense savings from our restructuring. 
As always, during our quarterly calls, we will regularly review our perspective and provide details on the year as it unfolds. Underscoring our confidence in our longer term prospects, we are pleased to announce this morning our Board's decision to raise IPG's quarterly dividend by 6% to $0.27 per share. This marks our ninth consecutive year of dividend increases over which time our quarterly dividend per share has more than quadrupled. 
In summary, we believe that the drivers of long-term value for all of IPG's stakeholders are in place, namely the quality of our people and our resources, our operating capabilities, and that together, these will continue to fuel our collective success. 
On that note, I'll now hand things over to Ellen for a more in-depth view of our results."

I want to reiterate Philippe's comments and hoping that everyone is safe and healthy. As a reminder, my remarks will track to the presentation slides that accompany our website.

As a reminder, my remarks will track to the presentation slides that accompany our website. 
Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation, our organic net revenue change was negative 5.4% in the quarter. In the U.S., our organic decrease improved sequentially and was only 1.8%, while in our international markets, that decrease was 10.5%. The U.S. outperformed international due to a mix of client sectors and offerings in the U.S. that were less impacted by the current macroeconomic environment and with the effects of the pandemic and lockdowns in the U.K., Europe and in some parts of Asia Pacific, which weighed on revenue. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.8% before restructuring charges compared to 21.1% a year ago. Our EBITDA was $244.9 million and was $498.8 million before the restructuring charge compared with $512.7 million a year ago. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.28 as reported, while our adjusted diluted earnings per share is $0.86. The adjustments exclude the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles, the charge for restructuring and nonoperating losses on the sales of certain small nonstrategic businesses. 
Our cash flow from operations was strong for the year at $1.8 billion, and our liquidity continues to be solid at $4.5 billion of cash and committed credit facilities at quarter end. Our restructuring program resulted in charges of $413.8 million during the year, which we expect will result in annualized permanent expense savings of approximately $160 million. We've concluded our actions under the program. This morning, as Philippe noted, our Board approved a 6% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.27 per share. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. 
Turning to Q4 revenue on Slide 4. Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.28 billion. Compared to Q4 2019, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 10 basis points. Net divestitures were negative 80 basis points, which is the impact of the disposition of certain small nonstrategic businesses over the past 12 months. Our reviews are ongoing, and we expect to continue to have additional small dispositions as we move forward. 
Our organic net revenue change was a decrease of 5.4%. As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, that brings our organic change for the full year to negative 4.8%. At the bottom of this slide, we break out our segments. The organic change in our EM segment was a decrease of 3.8%. As a reminder, EM includes our global and domestic creatively-led integrated agencies; our media, data and technology offerings; and our digital specialists. 
IPG Dextra, the rebranded CMG, is our global group of highly collaborative marketing service specialists. The organic change in the quarter was negative 15.1%, which reflects the disproportionate weight of live events and sports marketing within the segment, which has been most significantly impacted by the pandemic. 
Moving on to Slide 5, organic revenue change by region. In the U.S., which was 61% of our fourth quarter net revenue, our organic decrease was 1.8% against challenging comparisons from a year ago. The international markets, which make up 39% of our net revenue in the quarter, declined organically 10.5%. By region, our organic change to net revenue was negative 17.4% in Asia Pac; negative 9.7% in the U.K.; negative 7.3% in Continental Europe; and negative 14% in our other markets group; LatAm increased 2.3% organically. 
Moving on to Slide 6 and operating expenses in the quarter. Our net operating expenses decreased 7% from a year ago when excluding the restructuring charge in amortization, which was more than our decrease in revenue, and as a result, our adjusted margin expanded by 70 basis points. As you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue was 58.9%, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Underneath that, our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax in absolute dollar terms decreased by 4.6%, although the ratio increased due to lower net revenue. We have very significant leverage on our expense for performance-based incentive compensation, which was 3.3% of net revenue, compared with 4.7% a year ago. And we delivered on our expense for severance and temporary labor. At quarter end, total worldwide headcount was approximately 50,200, a 7.6% decrease from a year ago as a result of our restructuring, regular severance and attrition and business dispositions. 
Also on this slide, our office and other direct expenses decreased 130 basis points to 16% of net revenue. We continue to have a significant decrease in our expense for occupancy and T&A. Our SG&A expense was 1% of net revenue, which is the same as a year ago. As you can see on the lower right-hand side of the slide, our charge to restructure headcount and real estate was 11.1% of net revenue in the quarter. 
Slide 7 is a summary of the restructuring program we executed in order to make structural changes to our real estate footprint and headcount over the last 9 months. As you've seen, the total charge was $413.8 million, of which $265.6 million was noncash. As we went through the year, our teams continue to identify opportunities, and we were ultimately able to reduce our real estate footprint by 15%. Between our real estate and headcount actions, we expect to realize a significant level of permanent annual savings of approximately $160 million. 
Turning to Slide 8, which present detail on adjustments to our reported fourth quarter results in order to give you better transparency and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left-hand side with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA, excluding restructuring and adjusted diluted EPS. 
Our expense for amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.5 million. The restructuring charge was $253.9 million and the related tax benefit was $56.9 million. Below operating expenses, in column 4, we had a loss in the quarter of $15.2 million in other expense due to the disposition of a few small nonstrategic businesses. At the foot of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact or diluted share of these adjustments, which bridges our diluted EPS as reported at $0.28 to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.86. 
Slide 9 depicts similar adjustments for the full year, again, for continuity and comparability. Our amortization expense was $85.9 million. Full year restructuring charges were $413.8 million. Dispositions over the course of the year resulted in a book loss of $67 million. The impact of the discrete items was a benefit of $122.6 million. The result is adjusted full year diluted EPS of $1.73. Note that our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was 26.5%, which is at the low end of the range we had targeted. 
On Slide 10, we turn to cash flow for the full year. Cash from operations was $1.8 billion, which is the highest level in our company's history. That compares to $1.5 billion a year ago. The comparison includes to $900 million generated from working capital in 2020 compared with $443 million in 2019. 
While working capital can be volatile, as we pointed out in the past, a couple of factors drove a particularly strong result for the year. One was a return to growth in areas of our business that with growth typically generate cash from working capital, notably in our seasonally strong fourth quarter. On the other hand, some of our businesses that use working capital with growth have yet to fully recover from the ongoing impact of the pandemic. We continue to focus on and invest in insight and management of this area. 
Our investing activities used $216 million in the year, mainly reflecting our CapEx of $168 million. Our financing activities increased $346 million. You'll recall that we raised $646 million in March with the issuance of our new long-term debt, that prefunded the repayment of $504 million of long-term debt that matured in October. We used $398 million over the course of the year for our common stock dividend. Our net increase in cash was $1.3 billion. 
Slide 11 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the year with $2.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Our $500 million, 3.75% senior note matures in October of this year and is reflected under current liabilities. We plan on repaying these notes with cash on hand. 
Slide 12 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt and our diversified maturity schedule. Having paid off October maturity, our total debt at year-end was $3.5 billion. 
In summary, on Slide 13, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment. And I would like to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Philippe."

As you know, a hallmark of our long-term strategy has been to invest behind our people and our agency brands and to embed digital across the portfolio so as to create a level of expertise that allows for greater collaboration when we activate integrated teams to address client opportunities. During the quarter and for the year, we continue to see evidence of the vibrancy of our brands and the evolution of our talent strategy. 
Highlights at our creative integrated networks were led by FCB, which was named Global Agency of the year by Adweek in recognition of the agency's bold creative work and highly collaborative model as well as its embedded data and CRM capabilities. The health operations at FCB continued to be the key driver of growth for the network, and we saw both FCB Health New York and FCB Cure named 2020 Best Places to Work by health care industry publication M M&M. 
MullenLowe Group closed the year with a number of new business wins, notably at Media Hub with the addition of the NBA account after a very competitive pitch. The group was also named Network of the Year at the U.K.'s IPA Effectiveness Awards. And MullenLowe Group U.K. was recognized by Campaign in its 2020 agency new business rankings as the market's top performer with net new billings that were 2.5x those of its nearest competitors. 
At McCann Worldgroup, we implemented a succession plan that sees a long-term executive with broad experience across the company step into the CEO role, and the elevation of key team members into leadership roles in executive management as well as senior strategy and client leadership roles. 
At MRM, the agency's CEO added the title of Global Chairwoman, and she brought in a highly regarded Global Chief Creative Officer to the agency. At Mediabrands, we saw the launch of the Mediabrands content studio, which pulls together creative capabilities from agencies in 12 key markets, ranging from long-form documentaries and branded content at UM and Initiative, the dynamic digital content from Reprise. This offering meets the increasing need we're seeing in the market for custom multiform content that's strategically integrated with media and brand purpose. 
In January, Initiative continued the new business streak that has seen it named as Remo fastest growing media agency with a notable addition of T Mobile. Our view is that culture drives commercial success, so it's also worth noting that the agency was named a Best Place to Work by Ad Age. 
In LatAm, Initiative took Home Agency Network of the Year honors in that region's festival of media awards competition. And at EM, it was recently announced that the agency had won a major automakers and European Media Planning and buying duties after a highly competitive review. 
At Acxiom, as I indicated earlier, the company's tools, expertise and data assets continue to play a role in an increasingly wide range of our offerings. Acxiom provides the foundational data layer for our holding company. And along with Kinesso, which is the technology applications layer, these are becoming core to our Open Architecture model with existing clients as well as in much of our new business activity. 
RGA added a number of new business wins in Q4, including Uber and Beam Suntory. At CES, in partnership with IPG, the agency hosted a virtual leadership innovation lounge, featuring top women leaders from clients like Allied Bank, Mitu and Reddit. 
At Huge, the agency secured further global CRM business for Sk-II and announced work with Verizon, and to launch full transparency, which is a blockchain verification system that has the potential of transforming the way in which companies disseminate news for their principal audiences. Huge and RGA were listed among the top 30 agencies for clients to work with in 2021 by R3 Worldwide, the independent consultancy which also cited both agencies in the top 3 spots in its latest U.S. new business league rankings. MRM, RGA and Huge also earned a place in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for global marketing agencies based on their ability to serve as key strategic business partners for clients and to execute on critical marketing priorities. 
The Martin Agency was named U.S. Agency of the Year by Adweek. And its open for delivery campaign for DoorDash was recognized as s of the best creative work of 2020. Ad Age also named Carmichael Lynch and Campbell Ewald to its industry list of Best Places to Work. 
Turning to our IPG Dexter segment. During the quarter, Weber Shandwick unveiled a permanent hybrid model for its global workforce called Juice, which puts employee flexibility at the core. The agency also announced new ways of existing clients, including work with the CDC to promote immunization across the lifespan of all Americans. Rolan named a new global chairwoman and added General Mills and Roche to its client roster. The agency was also recognized at the 2020 ANA Multicultural Excellence awards, along with FCB Canada, IW Group and the Martin Agency. 
Turning to the holding companies. For many years, we have made ESG, including diversity, equity and inclusion, a key area of focus. As a leader in marketing services and a citizen of the communities where our employees live, work and vote, we welcome the responsibility to operate sustainably, contributing to a healthier society and a healthier planet. We are working to build on and more fully live into this commitment, including by reassessing how we hire, train and promote a diverse workforce as well as further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions around the world. 
In recent years, we've made steady progress in sustainability planning, action and reporting. As a result, during the quarter and for the second year in a row, IPG was named to the FTSE for Good Index, the global index that identifies top public companies with strong ESG practices. We were also included on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in North America, which recognizes the top quintile of sustainability performers among the 600 largest U.S. and Canadian companies. In just this past month, we were recognized with 2 further ESG honors, including the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the second consecutive year and the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index for the 12th year running. 
As a business in which attracting top talent is vital to our success, whether in creative services or growing technology capabilities, an intentional approach to ESG is an important part of our strategy. Another aspect of our strategy going back several years has to do with our decision to incorporate data expertise into the core of the company. 
Understanding data and its power is absolutely essential to the current and future success of every company. As is an ethical and conscious approach that respects consumer privacy and promotes brand safety, all of which will be crucial as we look ahead to increased regulation in the digital media space. Going forward, we'll continue to enhance the technology layer within our offerings and to build tech-enabled marketing solutions, informed by a holistic understanding of audiences. This is what will allow us to deliver personalized user experiences and more accountable marketing for brands. 
Ultimately, our vision for IPG is to be the key partner in ensuring that clients' businesses thrive in the digital economy. This is what makes us confident in our long-term prospects. Looking at the year ahead, we know IPG is well positioned to participate in the global economic recovery. As I stated earlier, we fully expect to return to positive organic growth over the course of the year, in line with a macroeconomic recovery, and to deliver growth for the full year that's consistent with the industry on top of our outperformance in 2020 relative to our peer group. 
The timing of our progress during the year does remain an open question. And this is in part due to the fact that last year's first quarter was largely unaffected by the pandemic while this year has remained burdened by COVID, but it's especially true given the significant variable that we all face related to public health and economic policy decisions in major world markets. As we get better visibility to these larger issues as well as the rate of recovery in industry sectors that have been most impacted by the pandemic, the pace of our progress will become clearer. As always, as the year unfolds, we will regularly review our perspective with you on our quarterly call and we'll keep you updated on our expectations. We will, of course, continue to invest behind the growth of our businesses and in developing our people just to further differentiate our offerings, which is what ultimately creates value for clients and has helped us establish a position of leadership in our sector. 
In keeping with our long-standing focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, we intend to continue to pay down debt. Our ongoing commitment to the dividend is clear in the action announced by our Board today, which also speaks to confidence in the longer-term prospects for our company. And return of capital remains a priority for us, so we look forward to being in a position to return to share repurchase as part of a balanced approach to sustain value creation. 
Thanks again for your time. We look forward to you questions."

So first and foremost, I'd point out that health care was our strongest performer all year and that skews very heavily to the U.S. by a factor probably of about 2:1. And that's just a function of how Interpublic was built over time. And I think it's also reflective of the fact that direct-to-consumer advertising, obviously, is not something that exists in most world markets. So I would think of health care as a place where we had much more sail to the wind in the U.S. than elsewhere in around the globe in what is clearly one of our strongest client sectors. And health care also is -- has a lot of Q4 project revenue. So we saw more of that realized here. 
The second a piece of how I would think about that split is media was a strong performer for us in Q4. So we talked when the pandemic hit about the fact that, that had been dialed back in Q2, clients reacted to what was going on with the economic situation by shutting down largely the digital media. So we started to see that come back in Q3. It came back stronger in Q4. And so again, there by virtue of the fact that the U.S. is our largest market, there was more upside. 
And then the other 2 factors that I think have to do with this are Acxiom has a significantly larger business in the U.S. than in rest of world. It's clearly a less cyclical business so it was much less susceptible to what, I guess you could call it kind of a Q4 project squeeze than were the project-based businesses. And then lastly, on a couple of our calls as we went through the year last year, we did call out the fact that the pandemic was probably going to have an impact and there was a risk to  Q4 project spend, right? And that definitely played out, and it played out to a much greater degree on the international side of things. And I think that there were clearly more pandemic restrictions on  gatherings, on holiday-themed events, even actually on kind of retail level activation. So experiential and events, where, as we said to you, about 5% of our business, and it was clearly impacted throughout the year. Ex U.S., the impact of that was again about 2:1 outside of the U.S., and clearly, not in anybody's favor. So hopefully, that will sort of get you a sense of -- and then in terms of -- one of the things that's good about a succession that has a lot of continuity to it is that our clients and our people feel comfortable. I think one of the things that may be not so good is that I still have to tell you that we don't -- we're not planning on kind of reporting on a quarter-by-quarter -- on a month-by-month basis. Sorry about that. So what we're seeing in the very early stages of '21 is it's a very limited, small sample size and that's something we're likely to give anybody insight into."

And then I also think that the fact of the matter is that, that confluence of marketing and technology is having an impact in every company. And I think that, as you said, the pandemic has brought forward the need for companies in a very broad range of spaces, including companies and industries that are probably not as data-rich or that were not as reliant on certain mechanisms to be reaching consumers or to be thinking about sort of lifetime customer value with consumers, things of that nature. So it's definitely something that we're very focused on. And it was one of the reasons I wanted to call out in the opening remarks, give some sort of detail and color into the kinds of engagements and how, when you have media that allows you to really understand audiences and engage with them and then when you bring data into the core and it informs everything from the insights that lead to the ideation, all of the ways in which the messages are served out, and then you begin to have kind of essentially the capacity to optimize not just in some of the traditionally sort of digital capabilities where you could do that. Everything clearly is becoming more and more addressable. So that's definitely an area of focus for us and then for the management teams at the bulk of our agencies."

First of all, I have to say that our teams did an amazing job with the program. All throughout the year, they continue to look for opportunities to really take the learnings from this time period and take actions against it that would result in the permanent savings that we're projecting. So we do expect to see savings, both on the SRS line and on occupancy as a result of it. The accounting for leases is neither intuitive or linear, so you will see some savings in 2021 but you'll see more thereafter as the leases start to get subleased. So -- and leases, as you imagined, have longer paybacks, right, because they're over several years. So hopefully -- but again, we're very confident that we'll realize these permanent savings and are really grateful for all the efforts of our teams in undertaking it."

So I think media has been an area where, by virtue of the fact that you have very sizable budgets that are being invested and by virtue of the fact that the shift to digital in recent years has allowed there to be greater precision and a degree of accountability, because I think that it's also fair to say that it is an opaque ecosystem and that some of the expectation of accountability that people had. It took a while for us to really understand what was going on there. But I think what we've had is we've had the ability to have conversations with clients in the media space that are about more than perhaps just the marketing side of their business. They really  -- their business conversations around the ROI around those investments. And so I think that across most of the groups, there's been investment behind that. We've taken a different approach perhaps than our peers. As you know, when it comes to building a model that was much more consultative in nature, and it was not really one that was predicated on volume. And so what we tend to define was that again, there was a lot of interest in what we were able to do by pulling together understanding of audiences, by launching initially our own programmatic platform or at least our own programmatic trading desk and then the data stack that we began to develop ourselves prior to the investment that we made into Acxiom. So I think that those are all the logical reasons why media has been a growth driver and just the huge fragmentation that we've seen and the complexity that has come with the media channels and as we all remember, Michael always used to say, complexity is good. Complexity definitely created opportunity for us to provide consultative services to clients. 
Now on sector disclosure, that's a tougher one for me to -- I understand and respect that the question from your point of view is if I'm trying to analyze the space and to model performance, I clearly would want to bucket and quantify the sectors. And then hopefully, I think you'll understand and respect that my answer is not going to conform directly to that because it's not actually how we run the business. So as I mentioned initially, and as we were just discussing on the prior question, increasingly, we engage with clients by bringing multiple agencies and competencies to the table. That's the integrated approach with Open Architecture. We now ground those solutions in a layer of data and/or technology services. Clearly, media is an important part of that. So the performance of the disciplines is tied very closely together. And one of the things that I think the operators get tired of hearing me say is the word interdependence. So there's that, there's the fact that for many years, we've embedded digital into all of the agencies. And I think that it makes the specific agency's offerings more relevant, but it also does give us that common language for working together, right? And so going back quite a few years now, when the industry was becoming much more digitized, the number of our peers started to highlight this percentage of digital revenue, and we didn't, and we believe that the best barometer to see whether the strategy is working and to gauge our performance is organic growth, right? You look at the last 4 to 5 years, for last 5 to 6 years even, and you have an average of 4% to 5% per year organic growth. So this is pre pandemic, right? So I think you conclude from that, that the performance of all of the agencies is quite solid. And we do highlight the strong performers. So media, health care in recent years clearly have to be north of that range. But I would point out that during that time frame, during that 5 to 6-year time frame, the creative agencies have posted growth, right? And you -- when you look at a sector like health care, it's positively impacting not just our health care specialist agencies, but it's an important driver in media. It's in some of the ad agencies, right? It's in the PR space. So the focus for us is the client, their consumers, supporting the brands and then driving to this collaboration. So starting to pick the pieces apart, I think, runs counter to philosophically what we're trying to build."

Look, I mean, I think that in the U.S., knowing that we came into the year comping against the year last year where there was growth. And we had those 3 pretty sizable client losses as you say, there has been -- it's been remarkably resilient. And obviously, that might be because there's been a little bit less in the way of restrictions on certain kinds of behavior. And I think that there may be other extenuating factors. But I would think that what we're seeing here and what we're seeing in Europe vis-à-vis changes in behavior goes to people are definitely moving faster to trying to understand what does e-com do for them. What is connected commerce, sort of to what extent can you take social and other channels. And I think you probably just saw today TikTok kind of clearly making any number of things sort of shoppable on the platform. And so I think that it's fairly intuitive what's going on, which is that clients are either looking at ways to use digital channels to drive commerce or they're looking at ways to use their first-party data and to do much more CRM-like activity. I mean, there's no kind of magic wand on this one. It's pretty much what you'd expect. 
And then in terms of the psychology of it, I think it's part of what is contributing to the -- just the caution that people have as they look to this year. I mean, I would bet you that there isn't anybody I know, and I'm sure that these are pretty extraordinary circumstances, right? So would any of us have thought that we'd still be working from home or in lockdown a year after the pandemic began, right? So that's just informing the fact that people are being deliberate. I don't think people are reacting quite as there isn't as much of a pullback as there was when the initial shock hit. But now there's the sense of, even though we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel, are we really going to get there on the time line that we are hoping for or might there be some forks in the road on the way to that. So I think that psychologically, that's -- it's just about people being thoughtful and a bit cautious but people are still engaged."

So if you look at again, not that for us, the sectors are how we're running the business. But if you looked at what the CMG sector had and then you think about where our overall performance was, you can see that that's where a disproportionate amount of the drag was. And then on a country-by-country basis, in a market like Europe, when you think about the fact that the continent for us is 8% of total revenue, it's down 7.3%. Some of those markets are actually not really all that big for us. And so what you have happening there, I think, is less kind of a macro or a secular trend, and it's really, really very sector specific. So it really comes down to client mix in some of those markets where if you have exposure to certain areas, it hurts you more than others."

I'll begin with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter and for the full year. Ellen will then provide additional details. I'll conclude with some updates on our agencies to be followed by our usual Q&A. 
First and foremost, I hope that you and your families continue to remain safe and healthy during the pandemic. As we all know, across much of the globe, the virus is still very much a presence in our daily lives. As such, our first priority continues to be to mitigate the impact of the health crisis on our colleagues and our clients as well as in our business. 
It's important to acknowledge the fact that over the past year, across IPG, our people have been subject to a range of extraordinary challenges. Their achievements have been remarkable, and I want to very clearly express our admiration for their resilience and our appreciation for their ongoing commitment and effort.
Moving now to our results. We are pleased to report a solid fourth quarter under conditions that continue to be challenging and full year performance that once again should place us at the top of our sector. In the fourth quarter, our organic growth change of net revenue was negative 5.4%. You will recall that our Q4 2019 result was organic growth of 2.9%, which included significant headwinds from certain client losses. So for context, it's worth noting that our continuing book of business from last year's fourth quarter, which we were essentially lapping in Q4 2020, was a 5.6% growth number.
In the U.S., the organic decrease in the quarter was 1.8% against a similarly challenging underlying U.S. comp of 6.4% growth in Q4 '19. In international markets, our organic decrease for fourth quarter 2020 was 10.5%. For the full year, our organic net revenue decrease was 4.8%.
As you'd expect, those results continue to reflect the effect of the pandemic, which has had widely varying impacts on our businesses and clients. Our event companies, in particular, which were typically strong in the fourth quarter, continue to bear the brunt of the health situation given that restrictions on public gatherings remained in place in most markets around the world. 
Conversely, during the quarter, we continued to build positive momentum in disciplines such as media planning and investment. Additionally, client sectors such as health care and retail, which have been our growth leaders for the duration of the health crisis, continued to perform strongly in the fourth quarter. 
With respect to operating expenses, our teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline. As a result, we're pleased to report that our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which excludes a charge for restructuring, increased 70 basis points from a year ago from 21.1% to 21.8%. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share was $0.28 as reported and was $0.86 as adjusted for restructuring and other items. 
As is evident in our results this morning, we also continue to execute through to the close of the year with respect to our restructuring program. We had previously mentioned to you that our focus would be on driving strategic, long-term actions and expense reductions as we evolve our business model to new operating realities. A key component of that thinking is moving to a hybrid workplace environment with a reduced need for real estate and an increased role for work from home in the delivery of our services. 
During the year, our team was diligent in identifying a wide range of restructuring opportunities and related savings so as to better position the business going forward into 2021 and beyond. As you can see, this led to a fourth quarter charge that was significant, though it is largely noncash. We now expect that our restructuring actions for the full year will yield permanent annual operating expense reductions in the range of $160 million. 
While remaining very disciplined with respect to our expense structure, it's important to point out that we continue to invest in our business during the year in order to accelerate strategic development in areas of strongest secular opportunity and growth. That investment continues to result in differentiated capabilities and offerings, which are in demand and are driving success in the marketplace. 
We're aware of that, as a result of the pandemic, the velocity of change picked up even further last year in the digital space. That's where consumers increasingly interact with the brands and businesses. We're encouraged that our ability to create marketing and media solutions that bring together creativity, technology and data is resulting in growth with existing clients as well as new client wins. 
For some time now, we have spoken about the importance of our culture in making IPG a destination for top industry talent. This includes our commitment to strong agency brands with clearly defined identities and core capabilities. In recent years, we have developed very strong and differentiated data resources and data management capabilities. We bring these offerings together on behalf of clients in customized integrated solutions through our open architecture platform, which has been evolving over a period of many years. 
Another key pillar of our culture is our commitment to doing better when it comes to equity and inclusion. This is something I will remain focused on personally in my new role. It also bears mention that IPG has taken a strong position when it comes to transparency and ethics in all of our business practices, well ahead of the current scrutiny on the digital media ecosystem and growing concerns regarding consumer privacy. These are our strategic priorities going forward. And at this point, I thought it might be helpful to provide a few highlights of how they are coming together in the work we do on behalf of our clients. 
As you know, in May of last year, we launched Matterkind, an innovative offering that optimizes client media investment holistically and in real time across all addressable media channels. With access to unique data resources at Acxiom and patented algorithmic software created at Kinesso, Matterkind played a role in several new account wins and client retentions during the back half of last year. 
In the auto sector, a leading global OEM awarded an Open Architecture team several multiyear contracts to oversee their CRM activity, the first in North America as well as 2 others in some of Asia's largest national markets. This resulted from a pitch that included teams from our global ad networks and digital specialty agencies as well as capabilities from Acxiom, Kinesso and our global production studio.
In the creative arena, we had a sizable health care win with an existing global client in Q4, which brought together a number of our specialist health care and consumer advertising agencies, again, backed by Acxiom, in an open architecture pitch. Also within the creative space in the CPG sector, we expanded our remit and doubled the size of our client relationship by using data-driven insights to generate creative ideas tailored to specific audiences.
In tech and telecom, we proactively proposed an integrated solution to an existing domestic client of one of our large PR and one of our independent advertising agencies. This resulted in adding responsibility from media as well as a data layer to inform all marketing decision-making, again, nearly doubling our projected annualized revenue on this engagement. 
The common denominator in each of these examples is our ability to broaden the range of business issues that we can help clients address. Our goal is to become a more strategic partner, supporting client needs as they seek to derive more value from connecting marketing and technology to power their businesses. Over time, we believe this should also have the effect of opening new performance and IP-based revenue streams for us. 
Another key area of focus for us is e-commerce and connected commerce, where we deliver on the promise of digital business transformation by bringing together marketplace analysis, data services, tech-enabled creative and customer experience work, systems integration and performance media offerings. This is another area where Open Architecture is a vital approach since those capabilities reside within a range of our digital and media specialist agencies. It's also an area that has seen significant acceleration as a result of the health crisis.
Heading into 2021, we are confident of the strength and competitiveness of our offerings and the talent within our group. The range of services we provide is growing in terms of the potential impact it has for our clients and their businesses. This means that looking ahead, we remain well positioned to fully participate in a global economic recovery.
There remains, however, significant uncertainty driven by macro conditions that are beyond any of our control because the timing and magnitude of economic recovery clearly hinges on the resolution of the health crisis. We fully expect to return to positive organic growth over the course of this year and to post full year 2021 growth consistent with the industry, on top of our relatively stronger 2020 performance. But from our vantage point today, based on our bottom-up approach to building a financial plan as well as conversations with clients, it's fair to say that visibility to the full year 2021 remains challenged.
To be clear, this is a question of timing and a function of the macro situation and not of the caliber or relevance of our offering, which we feel are both strong and complete. We will, of course, continue to align expenses with realized revenue in the disciplined way you've come to expect of us. Further, we will see the benefit of significant expense savings from our restructuring. 
As always, during our quarterly calls, we will regularly review our perspective and provide details on the year as it unfolds. Underscoring our confidence in our longer term prospects, we are pleased to announce this morning our Board's decision to raise IPG's quarterly dividend by 6% to $0.27 per share. This marks our ninth consecutive year of dividend increases over which time our quarterly dividend per share has more than quadrupled. 
In summary, we believe that the drivers of long-term value for all of IPG's stakeholders are in place, namely the quality of our people and our resources, our operating capabilities, and that together, these will continue to fuel our collective success. 
On that note, I'll now hand things over to Ellen for a more in-depth view of our results."

I want to reiterate Philippe's comments and hoping that everyone is safe and healthy. As a reminder, my remarks will track to the presentation slides that accompany our website. Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation, our organic net revenu",1519,"Thank you. I want to reiterate Philippe's comments and hoping that everyone is safe and healthy. As a reminder, my remarks will track to the presentation slides that accompany our website. 
Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation, our organic net revenue change was negative 5.4% in the quarter. In the U.S., our organic decrease improved sequentially and was only 1.8%, while in our international markets, that decrease was 10.5%. The U.S. outperformed international due to a mix of client sectors and offerings in the U.S. that were less impacted by the current macroeconomic environment and with the effects of the pandemic and lockdowns in the U.K., Europe and in some parts of Asia Pacific, which weighed on revenue. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.8% before restructuring charges compared to 21.1% a year ago. Our EBITDA was $244.9 million and was $498.8 million before the restructuring charge compared with $512.7 million a year ago. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.28 as reported, while our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.86. The adjustments exclude the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles, the charge for restructuring and nonoperating losses on the sales of certain small nonstrategic businesses. 
Our cash flow from operations was strong for the year at $1.8 billion, and our liquidity continues to be solid at $4.5 billion of cash and committed credit facilities at quarter end. Our restructuring program resulted in charges of $413.8 million during the year, which we expect will result in annualized permanent expense savings of approximately $160 million. We've concluded our actions under the program. This morning, as Philippe noted, our Board approved a 6% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.27 per share.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. 
Turning to Q4 revenue on Slide 4. Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.28 billion. Compared to Q4 2019, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 10 basis points. Net divestitures were negative 80 basis points, which is the impact of the disposition of certain small nonstrategic businesses over the past 12 months. Our reviews are ongoing, and we expect to continue to have additional small dispositions as we move forward. 
Our organic net revenue change was a decrease of 5.4%. As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, that brings our organic change for the full year to negative 4.8%. At the bottom of this slide, we break out our segments. The organic change in our IAN segment was a decrease of 3.8%. As a reminder, IAN includes our global and domestic creatively-led integrated agencies; our media, data and technology offerings; and our digital specialists.
IPG DXTRA, the rebranded CMG, is our global group of highly collaborative marketing service specialists. The organic change in the quarter was negative 15.1%, which reflects the disproportionate weight of live events and sports marketing within the segment, which has been most significantly impacted by the pandemic.
Moving on to Slide 5, organic revenue change by region. In the U.S., which was 61% of our fourth quarter net revenue, our organic decrease was 1.8% against challenging comparisons from a year ago. The international markets, which make up 39% of our net revenue in the quarter, declined organically 10.5%. By region, our organic change to net revenue was negative 17.4% in Asia Pac; negative 9.7% in the U.K.; negative 7.3% in Continental Europe; and negative 14% in our other markets group; LatAm increased 2.3% organically. 
Moving on to Slide 6 and operating expenses in the quarter. Our net operating expenses decreased 7% from a year ago when excluding the restructuring charge in amortization, which was more than our decrease in revenue, and as a result, our adjusted margin expanded by 70 basis points. As you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue was 58.9%, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Underneath that, our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax in absolute dollar terms decreased by 4.6%, although the ratio increased due to lower net revenue. We have very significant leverage on our expense for performance-based incentive compensation, which was 3.3% of net revenue, compared with 4.7% a year ago. And we delivered on our expense for severance and temporary labor. At quarter end, total worldwide headcount was approximately 50,200, a 7.6% decrease from a year ago as a result of our restructuring, regular severance and attrition and business dispositions.
Also on this slide, our office and other direct expenses decreased 130 basis points to 16% of net revenue. We continue to have a significant decrease in our expense for occupancy and T&A. Our SG&A expense was 1% of net revenue, which is the same as a year ago. As you can see on the lower right-hand side of the slide, our charge to restructure headcount and real estate was 11.1% of net revenue in the quarter. 
Slide 7 is a summary of the restructuring program we executed in order to make structural changes to our real estate footprint and headcount over the last 9 months. As you've seen, the total charge was $413.8 million, of which $265.6 million was noncash. As we went through the year, our teams continue to identify opportunities, and we were ultimately able to reduce our real estate footprint by 15%. Between our real estate and headcount actions, we expect to realize a significant level of permanent annual savings of approximately $160 million.
Turning to Slide 8, which present detail on adjustments to our reported fourth quarter results in order to give you better transparency and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left-hand side with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA, excluding restructuring and adjusted diluted EPS. 
Our expense for amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.5 million. The restructuring charge was $253.9 million and the related tax benefit was $56.9 million. Below operating expenses, in column 4, we had a loss in the quarter of $15.2 million in other expense due to the disposition of a few small nonstrategic businesses. At the foot of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact or diluted share of these adjustments, which bridges our diluted EPS as reported at $0.28 to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.86. 
Slide 9 depicts similar adjustments for the full year, again, for continuity and comparability. Our amortization expense was $85.9 million. Full year restructuring charges were $413.8 million. Dispositions over the course of the year resulted in a book loss of $67 million. The impact of the discrete items was a benefit of $122.6 million. The result is adjusted full year diluted EPS of $1.73. Note that our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was 26.5%, which is at the low end to the range we had targeted. 
On Slide 10, we turn to cash flow for the full year. Cash from operations was $1.8 billion, which is the highest level in our company's history. That compares to $1.5 billion a year ago. The comparison includes the $900 million generated from working capital in 2020 compared with $443 million in 2019. 
While working capital can be volatile, as we pointed out in the past, a couple of factors drove a particularly strong result for the year. One was a return to growth in areas of our business that with growth typically generate cash from working capital, notably in our seasonally strong fourth quarter. On the other hand, some of our businesses that use working capital with growth have yet to fully recover from the ongoing impact of the pandemic. We continue to focus on and invest in insight and management of this area. 
Our investing activities used $216 million in the year, mainly reflecting our CapEx of $168 million. Our financing activities used $346 million. You'll recall that we raised $646 million in March with the issuance of our new long-term debt, that prefunded the repayment of $504 million of long-term debt that matured in October. We used $398 million over the course of the year for our common stock dividend. Our net increase in cash was $1.3 billion.
Slide 11 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the year with $2.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Our $500 million, 3.75% senior note matures in October of this year and is reflected under current liabilities. We plan on repaying these notes with cash on hand.
Slide 12 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt and our diversified maturity schedule. Having paid off October maturity, our total debt at year-end was $3.5 billion. 
In summary, on Slide 13, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment. And I would like to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people, the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Philippe."

As you know, a hallmark of our long-term strategy has been to invest behind our people and our agency brands and to embed digital across the portfolio so as to create a level of expertise that allows for greater collaboration when we activate integrated teams to address client opportunities. During the quarter and for the year, we continue to see evidence of the vibrancy of our brands and the evolution of our talent strategy.
Highlights at our creative integrated networks were led by FCB, which was named Global Agency of the Year by Adweek in recognition of the agency's bold creative work and highly collaborative model as well as its embedded data and CRM capabilities. The health operations at FCB continued to be the key driver of growth for the network, and we saw both FCB Health New York and FCB Cure named 2020 Best Places to Work by health care industry publication, MM&M.
MullenLowe Group closed the year with a number of new business wins, notably at Mediahub with the addition of the NBA account after a very competitive pitch. The group was also named Network of the Year at the U.K.'s IPA Effectiveness Awards. And MullenLowe Group U.K. was recognized by Campaign in its 2020 agency new business rankings as the market's top performer with net new billings that were 2.5x those of its nearest competitors. 
At McCann Worldgroup, we implemented a succession plan that sees a long-term executive with broad experience across the company step into the CEO role and the elevation of key team members into leadership roles in executive management as well as senior strategy and client leadership roles. 
At MRM, the agency's CEO added the title of Global Chairwoman, and she brought in a highly regarded Global Chief Creative Officer to the agency. At Mediabrands, we saw the launch of the Mediabrands content studio, which pulls together creative capabilities from agencies in 12 key markets, ranging from long-form documentaries and branded content at UM and Initiative with dynamic digital content from Reprise. This offering meets the increasing need we're seeing in the market for custom multiform content that's strategically integrated with media and brand purpose.
In January, Initiative continued the new business streak that has seen it named as RECMA's fastest growing media agency with a notable addition of T-Mobile. Our view is that culture drives commercial success, so it's also worth noting that the agency was named a Best Place to Work by Ad Age. 
In LatAm, Initiative took Home Agency Network of the Year honors in that region's Festival of Media awards competition. And at UM, it was recently announced that the agency had won a major automakers and European media planning and buying duties after a highly competitive review. 
At Acxiom, as I indicated earlier, the company's tools, expertise and data assets continue to play a role in an increasingly wide range of our offerings. Acxiom provides the foundational data layer for our holding company. And along with Kinesso, which is the technology applications layer, these are becoming core to our Open Architecture model with existing clients as well as in much of our new business activity. 
R/GA added a number of new business wins in Q4, including Uber and Beam Suntory. At CES, in partnership with IPG, the agency hosted a virtual leadership innovation lounge, featuring top women leaders from clients like Ally Bank, Mitu and Reddit. 
At Huge, the agency secured further global CRM business for SK-II and announced work with Verizon to launch full transparency, which is a blockchain verification system that has the potential of transforming the way in which companies disseminate news for their principal audiences. Huge and R/GA were listed among the top 30 agencies for clients to work with in 2021 by R3 Worldwide, the independent consultancy, which also cited both agencies in the top 3 spots in its latest U.S. New Business League rankings. MRM, R/GA and Huge also earned a place in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for global marketing agencies based on their ability to serve as key strategic business partners for clients and to execute on critical marketing priorities. 
The Martin Agency was named U.S. Agency of the Year by Adweek, and its open for delivery campaign for DoorDash was recognized as some of the best creative work of 2020. Ad Age also named Carmichael Lynch and Campbell Ewald to its industry list of Best Places to Work. 
Turning to our IPG DXTRA segment. During the quarter, Weber Shandwick unveiled a permanent hybrid model for its global workforce called Juice, which puts employee flexibility at the core. The agency also announced new ways of existing clients, including work with the CDC to promote immunization across the lifespan of all Americans. Rolan named a new global chairwoman and added General Mills and Roche to its client roster. The agency was also recognized at the 2020 ANA Multicultural Excellence awards, along with FCB Canada, IW Group and the Martin Agency. 
Turning to the holding companies. For many years, we have made ESG, including diversity, equity and inclusion a key area of focus. As a leader in marketing services and a citizen of the communities where our employees live, work and vote, we welcome the responsibility to operate sustainably, contributing to a healthier society and a healthier planet. We are working to build on and more fully live into this commitment, including by reassessing how we hire, train and promote a diverse workforce as well as further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions around the world. 
In recent years, we've made steady progress in sustainability planning, action and reporting. As a result, during the quarter and for the second year in a row, IPG was named to the FTSE4Good Index, the global index that identifies top public companies with strong ESG practices. We were also included on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in North America, which recognizes the top quintile of sustainability performers among the 600 largest U.S. and Canadian companies. In just this past month, we were recognized with 2 further ESG honors, including the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the second consecutive year and the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index for the 12th year running. 
As a business in which attracting top talent is vital to our success, whether in creative services or our growing technology capabilities, an intentional approach to ESG is an important part of our strategy. Another aspect of our strategy going back several years has to do with our decision to incorporate data expertise into the core of the company.
Understanding data and its power is absolutely essential to the current and future success of every company. As is an ethical and conscious approach that respects consumer privacy and promotes brand safety, all of which will be crucial as we look ahead to increased regulation in the digital media space. Going forward, we'll continue to enhance the technology layer within our offerings and to build tech-enabled marketing solutions, informed by a holistic understanding of audiences. This is what will allow us to deliver personalized user experiences and more accountable marketing for brands. 
Ultimately, our vision for IPG is to be the key partner in ensuring that clients' businesses thrive in the digital economy. This is what makes us confident in our long-term prospects. Looking at the year ahead, we know IPG is well positioned to participate in the global economic recovery. As I stated earlier, we fully expect to return to positive organic growth over the course of the year, in line with a macroeconomic recovery, and to deliver growth for the full year that's consistent with the industry on top of our outperformance in 2020 relative to our peer group. 
The timing of our progress during the year does remain an open question. And this is in part due to the fact that last year's first quarter was largely unaffected by the pandemic while this year has remained burdened by COVID, but it's especially true given the significant variable that we all face related to public health and economic policy decisions in major world markets. 
As we get better visibility to these larger issues as well as the rate of recovery in industry sectors that have been most impacted by the pandemic, the pace of our progress will become clearer. As always, as the year unfolds, we will regularly review our perspective with you on our quarterly call and we'll keep you updated on our expectations. We will, of course, continue to invest behind the growth of our businesses and in developing our people just to further differentiate our offerings, which is what ultimately creates value for clients and has helped us establish a position of leadership in our sector. 
In keeping with our long-standing focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, we intend to continue to pay down debt. Our ongoing commitment to the dividend is clear in the action announced by our Board today, which also speaks to confidence in the longer-term prospects for our company. And return of capital remains a priority for us, so we look forward to being in position to return to share repurchase as part of a balanced approach to sustain value creation. 
Thanks again for your time. We look forward to you questions now."

But I think it's rea",622,"Alexia, thank you for the question. Look, I think that the delta that you saw in the fourth quarter when it came to international vis-à-vis U.S. was really just a continuation of a trend that we've seen during the course of the year. But I think it's really just a matter of degree and not something that's indicative of what we're going to be looking at or expecting. I wouldn't project that into 2021. And so in terms of sort of getting underneath that for you, I'd say that the key driver of that was really sector mix, right? So first and foremost, I'd point out that health care was our strongest performer all year and that skews very heavily to the U.S. by a factor probably of about 2:1. And that's just a function of how Interpublic was built over time. 
And I think it's also reflective of the fact that direct-to-consumer advertising, obviously, is not something that exists in most world markets. So I would think of health care as a place where we had much more sail to the wind in the U.S. than elsewhere in -- around the globe in what is clearly one of our strongest client sectors. And health care also is -- has a lot of Q4 project revenue. So we saw more of that realized here.
The second piece of how I would think about that split is media was a strong performer for us in Q4. So we talked, when the pandemic hit, about the fact that, that had been dialed back in Q2, clients reacted to what was going on with the economic situation by shutting down largely the digital media. So we started to see that come back in Q3. It came back stronger in Q4. And so again, there by virtue of the fact that the U.S. is our largest market, there was more upside. 
And then the other 2 factors that I think have to do with this are Acxiom has a significantly larger business in the U.S. than in rest of world. It's clearly a less cyclical business so it was much less susceptible to what, I guess you could call it kind of a Q4 project squeeze than were the project-based businesses. 
And then lastly, on a couple of our calls as we went through the year last year, we did call out the fact that the pandemic was probably going to have an impact and there was a risk to Q4 project spend, right? And that definitely played out, and it played out to a much greater degree on the international side of things. And I think that there were clearly more pandemic restrictions on gatherings, on holiday-themed events, even actually on kind of retail level activation. So experiential and events, where, as we said to you, it's about 5% of our business, and it was clearly impacted throughout the year. 
Ex U.S., the impact of that was again about 2:1 outside of the U.S., and clearly, not in anybody's favor. So hopefully, that will sort of get you a sense of -- and then in terms of -- one of the things that's good about a succession that has a lot of continuity to it is that our clients and our people feel comfortable. I think one of the things that may be not so good is that I still have to tell you that we don't -- we're not planning on kind of reporting on a quarter-by-quarter -- on a month-by-month basis. Sorry about that. So what we're seeing in the very early stages of '21 is it's a very limited, small sample size and that's something we're likely to give anybody insight into."

And that's something that we would like to see more of, obviously, because there, it's a smarter way to grow than to be reliant on reviews and things of that nature. 
And then I also think that the fact of the matter is that, that confluence of marketing and technology is having an impact in every company. And I think that, as you said, the pandemic has brought forward the need for companies in a very broad range of spaces, including companies and industries that are probably not as data-rich or that were not as reliant on certain mechanisms to be reaching consumers or to be thinking about sort of lifetime customer value with consumers, things of that nature. 
So it's definitely something that we're very focused on. And it was one of the reasons I wanted to call out in the opening remarks, give some sort of detail and color into the kinds of engagements and how, when you have media that allows you to really understand audiences and engage with them and then when you bring data into the core and it informs everything from the insights that lead to the ideation, all of the ways in which the messages are served out, and then you begin to have kind of essentially the capacity to optimize not just in some of the traditionally sort of digital capabilities where you could do that. Everything clearly is becoming more and more addressable. So that's definitely an area of focus for us and then for the management teams at the bulk of our agencies."

First of all, I have to say that our teams did an amazing job with the program. All throughout the year, they continue to look for opportunities to really take the learnings from this time period and take actions against it that would result in the permanent savings that we're projecting. So we do expect to see savings, both on the SRS line and on occupancy as a result of it. 
The accounting for leases is neither intuitive or linear, so you will see some savings in 2021 but you'll see more thereafter as the leases start to get subleased. So -- and leases, as you imagined, have longer paybacks, right, because they're over several years. So hopefully -- but again, we're very confident that we'll realize these permanent savings and are really grateful for all the efforts of our teams in undertaking it."

And then the last question is, I mean, if I had a dollar every time the client told me that you don't need an agency because you can go straight to Google and Facebook, I'd be retired by now. So media has been one of the best business of the agency space. And I wanted to explain us -- if you could explain to us why that is?

I'm trying to figure out which -- maybe I'll go from the back to the front. So I think media has been an area where, by virtue of the fact that you have very sizable budgets that are being invested and by virtue of the fact that the shift to digital in recent years has allowed there to be greater precision and a degree of accountability, because I think that it's also fair to say that it is an opaque ecosystem and that some of the expectation of accountability that people had, it took a while for us to really understand what was going on there. 
But I think what we've had is we've had the ability to have conversations with clients in the media space that are about more than perhaps just the marketing side of their business. They really  -- their business conversations around the ROI, around those investments. And so I think that across most of the groups, there's been investment behind that. We've taken a different approach perhaps than our peers, as you know, when it comes to building a model that was much more consultative in nature, and it was not really one that was predicated on volume. 
And so what we tend to define was that again, there was a lot of interest in what we were able to do by pulling together understanding of audiences, by launching initially our own programmatic platform or at least our own programmatic trading desk and then the data stack that we began to develop ourselves prior to the investment that we made into Acxiom. So I think that -- those are all the logical reasons why media has been a growth driver and just the huge fragmentation that we've seen and the complexity that has come with the media channels. And as we all remember, Michael always used to say complexity is good. Complexity definitely created opportunity for us to provide consultative services to clients. 
Now on sector disclosure, that's a tougher one for me to -- I understand and respect the question from your point of view is if I'm trying to analyze the space and to model performance, I clearly would want to bucket and quantify the sectors. And then hopefully, I think you'll understand and respect that my answer is not going to conform directly to that because it's not actually how we run the business. So as I mentioned initially, and as we were just discussing on the prior question, increasingly, we engage with clients by bringing multiple agencies and competencies to the table. That's the integrated approach with Open Architecture. We now ground those solutions in a layer of data and/or technology services. Clearly, media is an important part of that. So the performance of the disciplines is tied very closely together. 
And one of the things that I think the operators get tired of hearing me say is the word interdependence. So there's that, there's the fact that for many years, we've embedded digital into all of the agencies. And I think that it makes the specific agency's offerings more relevant, but it also does give us that common language for working together, right? And so going back quite a few years now, when the industry was becoming much more digitized, the number of our peers started to highlight this percentage of digital revenue, and we didn't, and we believe that the best barometer to see whether the strategy is working and to gauge our performance is organic growth, right? 
You look at the last 4 to 5 years or last 5 to 6 years even, you have an average of 4% to 5% per year organic growth. So this is pre-pandemic, right? So I think you conclude from that, that the performance of all of the agencies is quite solid. And we're -- we do highlight the strong performers. So media, health care in recent years clearly have to be north of that range. But I would point out that during that time frame, during that 5 to 6-year time frame, the creative agencies have posted growth, right? And you -- when you look at a sector like health care, it's positively impacting not just our health care specialist agencies, but it's an important driver in media. It's in some of the ad agencies, right? It's in the PR space. 
So the focus for us is the client, their consumers, supporting the brands and then driving to this collaboration. So starting to pick the pieces apart, I think, runs counter to philosophically what we're trying to build."

Look, I mean, I think that in the U.S., knowing that we came into the year comping against the year last year where there was growth. And we had those 3 pretty sizable client losses. As you say, there has been -- it's been really -- it's been remarkably resilient. And obviously, that might be because there's been a little bit less in the way of restrictions on certain kinds of behavior. And I think this -- there may be other extenuating factors. But I would think that what we're seeing here and what we're seeing in Europe vis-à-vis changes in behavior goes to -- people are definitely moving faster to trying to understand what does e-com do for them. What is connected commerce, sort of to what extent can you take, social and other channels. And I think you probably just saw today TikTok kind of clearly making any number of things sort of shoppable on the platform. 
And so I think that it's fairly intuitive what's going on, which is that clients are either looking at ways to use digital channels to drive commerce or they're looking at ways to use their first-party data and to do much more CRM-like activity. I mean, there's no kind of magic wand on this one. It's pretty much what you'd expect. 
And then in terms of the psychology of it, I think it's part of what is contributing to the -- just the caution that people have as they look to this year. I mean, I would bet you that there isn't anybody I know, and I'm sure that these are pretty extraordinary circumstances, right? 
So would any of us have thought that we'd still be working from home or in lockdown a year after the pandemic began, right? So that's just informing the fact that people are being deliberate. I don't think people are reacting quite as -- there isn't as much of a pullback as there was when the initial shock hit. But now there's the sense of, even though we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel, are we really going to get there on the timeline that we are hoping for or might there be some forks in the road on the way to that. So I think that psychologically, that's -- it's just about people being thoughtful and a bit cautious but people are still engaged."

But the project-based businesses, as we pointed out, were the ones that were most impacted. And so I think if you look at where the decline in the quarter was felt most -- what dragged. So if you look at again, not just for us, the sectors or how we're running the business, but if you looked at what the CMG sector had and then you think about where our overall performance was, you can see that that's where a disproportionate amount of the drag was. 
And then on a country-by-country basis, in a market like Europe, when you think about the fact that the continent for us is 8% of total revenue, it's down 7.3%. Some of those markets are actually not really all that big for us. And so what you have happening there, I think, is less kind of a macro or a secular trend, and it's really, really very sector specific. So it really comes down to client mix in some of those markets where if you have exposure to certain areas, it hurts you more than others."

I'll start with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter. Ellen will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with updates on the highlights at our agencies to be followed by Q&A. 
First and foremost, as Jerry said, I hope that you and your families are keeping well. As we all know, around the world, the pandemic is still with us to a significant degree. With all that entails, it bears mention that our people continue to navigate the many challenges, both personal and professional, presented by the health crisis. Their extraordinary resilience and capacity for innovation as well as their care for one another and their commitment to our clients are inspiring. Against business conditions that continue to be demanding, our people have driven the solid growth and the high level of first quarter profitability that we are reporting today. 
Turning to those results, beginning with revenue. We are pleased with our start to the year. First quarter organic net revenue growth was 1.9%. That reflects solid performance in the U.S., an organic decrease of 20 basis points and strong international growth of 6.3% with increases in every world region. In the U.S., you'll recall that we are comparing to very strong underlying performance in the first quarter of 2020 when we face headwinds of nearly 4% due to certain 2019 client losses that we previously identified. 
Domestically, during this year's first quarter, we saw increases in areas such as media, data services and technology and our health care specialist agencies. Our international performance was paced by 12.4% growth in Continental Europe, where we had a strong start to the year by our media, data and tech offerings as well as McCann Worldgroup. Worldwide, our health care and retail client sectors, which were consistent outperformers last year were again our growth leaders in the first quarter. 
From the standpoint of our operating segments, Our IAN segment grew 3.2% organically led by media, data and technology and by the health care specialty agencies. As expected, in comparison to last year's largely prepandemic first quarter, global conditions in Q1 continued to weigh most heavily on the events and sports marketing disciplines and on certain project-driven businesses in both IAN and DXTRA. Nonetheless, while the environment understandably retains a strong note of caution across our offerings and client sectors, the lows were generally not as low. Clients are finding their footing amid a global economy that's increasingly showing signs of recovery. As better days ahead begin to come into focus, conversations with clients have generally become more positive and constructive. 
Turning to operating expense and profitability. Our teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline. Given the uncertainty that prevailed in 2020, we made decisions and took a series of actions during the year necessary, but in many cases, no less difficult to ensure the long-term health of the overall business. Our expenses in the quarter reflect much of the benefits of the strategic restructuring executed over the course of last year. most notably in our expenses for base payroll and occupancy. We continue to be highly confident that, over time, we are well positioned to realize the full level of permanent operating expense savings that we've talked about previously. which, as a reminder, annualized at $160 million. 
Along with a return to growth and the benefits of our restructuring actions, our Q1 results were further helped by variable expense categories that continue to run at very low level, given that many of our activities are still restricted by the pandemic. These include significantly lower expenses for business travel and meetings as well as their associated costs. 
Our first quarter net income as reported was $92 million, which includes the expense of certain nonoperating items. Our adjusted EBITDA was $266 million, a level which is approximately 2.5x the first quarters of recent years. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.1%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and was $0.45 as adjusted mainly for our loss on the early extinguishment of debt, the disposition of certain small nonstrategic agencies. both of which are nonoperating expenses, and our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
During the quarter, we refinanced a portion of our outstanding debt on very favorable terms while extending our debt maturity profile. This level of financial flexibility positions us well in the event there is volatility as the global economy moves through a recovery. 
We're pleased to be able to share with you the strong set of results, which build on our company's long-term record of industry outperformance and consistent margin expansion. It bears mention that we continue to invest in our people and our capabilities and, as a result, to further differentiate our offerings in the areas of strongest opportunity and growth. This has been particularly relevant since we are seeing growing client demand for technology and data services and the accelerating transformational change in marketing and media. Our ability to create marketing and media solutions that bring together creativity, technology and data in order to solve for higher order client opportunities are what drove growth in the first quarter. Given the complexity of the media and consumer landscape, marketers are looking for partners who can help them build their businesses through more precise, personalized and accountable engagements with individuals. With the deprecation of third-party cookies, all businesses are increasingly focused on realizing value from their first-party data. We're finding partners with whom they can pool data assets. As important, this needs to be done in a way that's respectful of people's privacy and anticipates likely regulatory development. We remain well positioned to benefit from those opportunities. 
Of course, our first quarter is seasonally our smallest, and most of the year still remains ahead of us. We also appreciate the heightened degree of business uncertainty as part of the current reality facing all companies, to a business like ours translates into more challenging visibility to the full year. As a result, we're staying very close to our people and our clients. asking our teams for frequent financial updates and continuing to carefully manage expenses. 
To date, we're seeing cautious optimism from clients, and the tone of business has firmed in the last few months. Reopenings, fiscal stimulus and vaccination programs in a number of our largest markets of providing a tangible lift to economic activity and marketing demand. 
As we mentioned to you on our last call, we remain confident in those areas we can control, namely the strength and competitiveness of our offerings and the people and talent within our group. We are seeing that the most contemporary services we provide are growing in terms of the receptivity from clients and prospects. Given our strong start to the year and based on the assumption that there'll continue to be a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery, we believe that we can deliver organic growth for the full year in the range of 5% to 6%. With that level of growth, we would expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 15.5%. As such, we see this as another year of strong value creation for all our stakeholders. We will, of course, keep you apprised of our progress as the year develops. On that note, I'll hand the call over to Ellen for a more in-depth view on our results."

Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation, our first quarter net revenue increased 2.8% from a year ago with organic growth of 1.9%. First quarter adjusted EBITDA before a small restructuring adjustment was $265.9 million and margin was 13.1%. These are levels that compare very favorably against any previous first quarter. We returned to growth with variable expenses that are lagging the recovery in revenue, and we are additionally seeing the structural benefits of last year's restructuring program. 
Diluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and $0.45 as adjusted. The adjustments exclude the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles, a small restructuring refinement, nonoperating losses on sales of certain small nonstrategic businesses and the nonoperating loss on the early extinguishment of debt. 
During the quarter, we refinanced $1 billion of senior notes that had been scheduled to mature over the next few years. We placed $1 billion in new notes maturing in 10- and 20-year tranches. The timing of those transactions initiated in mid-February was favorable in light of the subsequent rise in market rates. We appreciate and value the support and the reception that we received. As you may have seen in late March, we also received upgrades to our outlook from both S&P and Fitch. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. 
Turning to Q1 revenue on Slide 4. Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.03 billion, an increase of $55.6 million. Compared to Q1 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 1.5% with the dollar weaker against currencies in most of our largest markets. Net divestitures were negative 60 basis points. Our organic net revenue increase was 1.9%. 
At the bottom of this slide, we break out segment revenue in the quarter. Our EM segment was -- grew 3.2% organically, a terrific result against last year largely non-COVID first quarter. We saw solid growth by our offerings in media, data and tech at FCB and at McCann Worldgroup. At IPG DXTRA, the organic change in the quarter was negative 4.8%, which reflects the weight of live events and sports marketing within the segment, the disciplines that have been most significantly impacted by the pandemic. With that, DXTRA's performance was a sharp sequential improvement from the fourth quarter, especially in the public relations disciplines. 
Moving on to Slide 5, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region. In the U.S., which was 65% of net revenue in the quarter, our organic decrease was 20 basis points against the challenging comparisons underlying our headline number from a year ago. Compared to Q1 2020, we did see continued pressure on events and sports as well as certain project work, as has been the case throughout the pandemic. 
International markets were 35% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 6.3% organically. We grew in every international region, which is a notable improvement from Q4. Continental Europe grew 12.4%, with increases in every major national markets, including Spain, Germany, Italy and France, driven by increased spend from existing clients. With double-digit growth, there are a number of operating highlights in the region, including strong increases at media and tech and at McCann. The U.K. increased 3.5% organically, and again, this is net of continuing headwinds in the events discipline We had solid growth at McCann at our media, data and tech offerings and at MullenLowe. Asia Pac grew 3.4% organically. Among our largest regional markets, we had strong gains in Australia and Singapore, while China and India's revenue declined. Our organic growth in LatAm was 5% with particularly strong results across Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Chile. Our Other Markets group grew 7.3% with notably strong performance in the Middle East. 
Moving on to Slide 6 and operating expenses in the quarter. Our net operating expenses, excluding billable expenses and the amortization of acquired intangibles decreased 6% from a year ago and to 2.8% growth of our net revenue. The result was first quarter margin expansion to 13.1% from 4.9% a year ago. We have significant year-on-year expense savings in a number of different categories, most notably our restructuring savings in payroll and occupancy and a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses In the latter category, I would call out specifically the sharply lower travel and related expenses for the obvious reasons and significantly reduced bad debt expense which was at an increased level in the first quarter of 2020. 
As you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue improved by 340 basis points to 68.7% compared with 72.1% a year ago. Underneath that, we drove very strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which improved by 360 basis points. We had a lower severance expense ratio, which was only 30 basis points of net revenue compared to 120 basis points in Q1 2020. 
At quarter end, total worldwide head count was approximately 51,200, a decrease of 6.1% from a year ago, as a result of our restructuring and regular severance actions taken over the course of last year as well as our business dispositions. Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue by 480 basis points to 14.4%. We continue to have significant decreases in our expenses for occupancy driving year-on-year leverage of 110 basis points. We leverage all other office and other direct expense by 370 basis points, which includes the decreased expense for travel and bad debt. Our SG&A expense was 1.4% of net revenue, an increase of 30 basis points. 
On Slide 7, we present detail on adjustments to our reported first quarter results in order to provide better transparency and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left-hand side with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS. Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.6 million. The restructuring charges were $1.3 million. To be clear, these are small adjustments to estimates related to our 2020 restructuring program that we concluded at the end of last year. 
Below operating expenses, in column 3, we had a pretax loss in the quarter of $12.5 million in other expenses due to the disposition of a few small nonstrategic businesses. To the right of that, our pretax loss due to the early extinguishment of debt was $74 million, which relates to the refinancing and extending the maturities of $1 billion of our senior notes. At the front of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of each of these adjustments, which bridges our diluted EPS as reported at $0.23 to adjusted earnings of $0.45 per diluted share. 
On Slide 8, we turn to cash flow in the quarter. Cash used in operations was $249.8 million compared with the use of $277.1 million in Q1 2020. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is highly seasonal. We typically generate significant cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and use cash in the first quarter. During this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital was $496.9 million and follows our fourth quarter of last year, where we generated over $1 billion from working capital. 
In our investing activities, we used $28 million for CapEx in the quarter, which was essentially offset by the net proceeds from the sales of investments. Our financing activities in the quarter is $212.7 million, which reflects the redemption and issuance of long-term debt and our common stock dividends. Our net decrease in cash for the quarter was $492.7 million. 
Slide 9 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.02 billion of cash and equivalents compared with $1.55 billion a year ago. Under current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refer to our $500 million, 3.75% senior notes, which matures in October of this year. We plan on repaying these notes from cash on hand. 
Slide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt and our diversified and extended maturity schedule following our activity in the first quarter. Again, we have the maturity in October this year and then only $250 million due in April 2024. Thereafter, our next maturity is not until 2028. 
In summary, on Slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment. And I would like to reiterate our pride in, and gratitude for, the efforts of our people. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity means that we remain well positioned both financially and commercially And with that, I'll turn it back to Philippe."

It's worth repeating that Q1 is our smallest seasonal quarter, but nonetheless, we are pleased by our start to the year. The return to organic revenue growth is a signed that our clients have begun to pivot to an investment mindset as they look to build their brands and grow their businesses in line with the broader economic recovery. Our performance is also a reflection of the strength of our people, our offerings and of long-term strategies that have helped us drive consistently strong performance over time. 
We all know that the pandemic has accelerated a range of underlying trends, whether in business or society at large. As a result, many of our clients are undertaking meaningful transformation of their companies. This means adopting new ways in which they go to market in order to keep pace with rapid digitization of consumer behavior and economic activity. 
In a world that's more cluttered than ever with messages and channel all vying for our attention, the most critical challenge is to combine great ideas that come from the human storytelling side of our business with strategies and insights that can be generated by our technology and data capabilities. 
We've increasingly seen the amounts of time people spend online, picking up content that's engaging informative, entertaining or some combination of all 3. Content is undoubtedly more important than ever, and that's what makes the creative side of our business so vital. Equally important is getting those messages to people in ways that are relevant, respectful of their privacy and ultimately connect with them in meaningful ways. It's also key to take the information flow that results from all those digital interactions and apply it at every step along the process from audience definition to creative ideation in order to better understand the impact that our clients' communications are having on their businesses. 
Our differentiated capabilities include a range of data-driven offerings that can do this both at scale and at speed. As you know, we've been developing a data and tech infrastructure that underpins the full portfolio of our agencies and deliver solutions to a broad range of business problems through what we call the open architecture model. All of our major clients are seeing the benefits of this integrated approach as our prospective clients. During the quarter, it was gratifying to see that the Kinesso behavioral sciences teams are engaging with more of our advertising and marketing services agencies than at any time since we launched those offerings. 
Despite the challenging external circumstances that we continue to deal with in the quarter, certain key elements of our business remain constant. We will always succeed by adapting rapidly in our ways of working and how we are meeting the needs of clients. Since the start of the year, we onboarded or promoted top talent across the organization, once again received high levels of industry recognition and saw solid new business performance, where we remain net positive for the past 12 months. 
As you've seen in our results, growth in the quarter was driven by contemporary offerings in which we've consistently invested, including media, data and tech, health care and digital user experience. Another area where IPG has invested significant resources is in our environmental, social and governance programs. For some time, we focused on building a culture of high ethical standards by adhering to a set of values centered around respect for every individual as a company responsible for creating some of the world's most well-known marketing campaign. We have an obligation to ensure that the work we do as well as how we deliver it supports the long-term well-being of our communities. 
This quarter, IPG released its sixth annual sustainability report using the global reporting initiative standards framework. The report can be found on our website, and it represents another step forward for us in our commitment to ESG. In terms of climate action, we track IPG's global energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions across our entire portfolio. Next month, we plan to announce several strategic priorities focused on tackling climate change including a science-based target for reducing our emissions globally. The report also aligns with the UN Global Compact and focuses on human capital disclosures. Further, we make clear that we operate with a core expectation that individuals deserve control over their data and that we are responsible for promoting high ethical standards in terms of data privacy and security. 
Equity and inclusion also remain areas of focus for us. Our agencies are attuned to this priority, and they are held accountable because we have to show further progress when it comes to diversity in our ranks. IPG's latest MSCI ESG ratings report, which is a key ESG data provider for our various stakeholders, saw an increase in our company's score to an A rating. Our improvement was the result of increased disclosure when it comes to human capital management, our position and capabilities related to data privacy and certain governance enhancements. 
More recently, we joined Civic Alliance, as well as many of our clients, in calling for the protection of voting access here in the United States. We continue to be committed to promoting democracy, and we'll work to support safe, accessible and fair elections as well as to encourage our employees to participate in civic life. As a business in which attracting top talent and advising clients is crucial to our success, a robust approach to ESG is a key part of our long-term strategy and important to all stakeholders. 
Turning now to highlights from our portfolio. During the quarter, we issued our second media responsibility audit, addressing in a structured and consistent manner one of the most topical issues in the digital media ecosystem. This framework and the principle it sets forth continue to be well received by clients as well as key industry groups. Mediabrands' MAGNA unit also hosted a first-of-its-kind equity upfront, a week-long event intended to raise visibility and receptivity for black owned media and media that serves Black audiences. In addition, the network announced that it would be joining forces with TikTok for a creator and content accelerator. 
Two of our most dynamic units were in the media space. where we continue to leverage our deep data resources and capabilities. We're seeing strong growth in Matterkind, which is customizing addressable media activation at scale for more of our clients. At Reprise commerce we have rapidly scaled operations on a global basis as we address growing needs in e-commerce, particularly for insight, content and analytics. 
Following on a series of new business wins, Initiative elevated its U.S. leader to global CEO, where we believe she will have an even greater impact on the network success. At UM during the quarter, we added a global rental car client as well as an auto OEM in EMEA and HBO Max in LatAm. UM was also named an outstanding company for working mothers, and 3 of its executives were named Adweek Media All Stars. a distinction that was also earned by leaders of Reprise and Mediahub. 
At our creative integrated global agencies, both McCann Worldgroup and FCB were named to the top 5 most awarded networks of 2020 in the Drum's world creative rankings. Both also had work in the Super Bowl that was well received in a number of polls and rankings. 
Following the implementation of our succession plan, at the end of 2020, McCann Worldgroup posted a solid first quarter. Along with most awarded networks of 2020 in the Drum rankings, McCann New York came in at #4 on that list In terms of the top 100 agencies worldwide. At MRM, the agency was again named a leader in Gartner's 2021 Magic Quadrant for global marketing agencies based on their ability to serve as key strategic business partners for clients and to execute on critical marketing priorities. Huge and R/GA also featured on that list. 
The health operations at McCann and FCB performed strongly in the quarter and continue to take share in the marketplace. The notable program I'd like to call out was FCB Health's launch of the trial for #clinicalequality to shine a light on racial bias in clinical oncology trial. 
In MullenLowe Group, Mediahub continued on its new business streak for the addition of Global wins Slack and -- as well as New Balance in the U.K. Mediahub also introduced its inaugural diversity own Media Day and revamped its U.S. leadership team with a series of internal promotions. The MullenLowe advertising network continues to be a leader in purpose-driven work. Partnering with several independent casting agencies, The agency recently launched a campaign for Unilever's Dove to promote inclusivity in commercial testing. In the U.K., the agency has continued to do important work on behalf of the government to inform and educate the British public concerning the pandemic. 
The campaign U.S. Agency of the Year awards, the Martin Agency was recognized with multiple honors. And the agency also teamed with Mediahub for an integrated win of Terminix in Q1. Huge posted strong results during the quarter and saw 2 big wins, adding Coppertone and Wakefern to its client roster. The agency also announced the return of its Huge XD school with a renewed equity centered purpose that seeks to use education to increase the participation of underrepresented identities in the design industry. And in R/GA, the agency's Venture Studio program announced the launch of a new coalition venture studio with a mission to support Black start-up founders. IPG DXTRA companies continue to deliver specialized capabilities and integrated solutions for clients in our evolving world. 
Bowen was once again a standout in new business arena. Weber Shandwick was named PR Agency of the Year of the Campaign U.S. Awards, and the agency also launched the planned VX open playbook, a communications program that draws on extensive vaccination and public health communications expertise to help companies play a role in getting America vaccinated. At Octagon, leader in sports marketing, we recently promoted a longtime executive to the role of CEO. 
Performance at Acxiom was consistent with our expectations and in line for a year of solid growth in 2021. The company continues to carve out a position as an authority in the integration of marketing and advertising technology. During the quarter, Acxiom expanded its partnership to better manage and measure campaign execution through the cloud in order to provide tangible improvements in campaign efficiency and speed. Acxiom is also accelerating its development in client verticals where it sees opportunities. Recently, Fortune named Acxiom one of 2021's Best Workplaces in Technology. 
Working closely with the Acxiom data teams, Kinesso deployed its enhanced identity solution with half a dozen large clients. This has already driven double-digit lifts in campaign efficiency. Kinesso also expanded its range of direct data integrations with prominent platforms and ad tech companies. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased to see the Kinesso API connecting data and analytics capabilities across more of the IPG portfolio. Since we see this as a growth driver for our business and a source of potential new revenue streams. 
Acxiom, Kinesso and Matterkind, are working together to bring end-to-end data and identity solutions to clients in collaboration with a number of IPG agencies, We've seen the impact of this recently in new wins and expanded assignments in the telecom, auto, health care and financial services sectors. Looking forward, we will stay focused on unlocking the enormous opportunities that exist due to the changes and disruptions that have accelerated during these past 12 months. 
We worked over the years to embed digital capabilities throughout our organization and build a foundational layer of tech and data infrastructure that informs all our work. As a result, we have a deep understanding of audiences at the individual level based on the strong legacy of ethical data practices. Personalization, privacy and accountability are only going to grow in importance and value going forward. Our vision is, therefore, for IPG to become a key partner in ensuring that clients businesses thrive in the digital economy. 
The success we have seen at the start of the year is thanks to the talent, efforts and commitment of our people. As you'd expect, we are focused on supporting their physical and mental well-being and listening to them in planning a return to office. That likely is to begin the meaningful degree in September, dependent on continued progress and matters related to resolving the public health crisis. It will be a gradual and iterative process in which we obviously were going to have test and learn as we go. 
As such, on the cost drivers that go hand-in-hand with live collaboration with colleagues as well as calling on clients in person, which have, of course, been reduced as a result of lockdowns, we'll begin to work their way back into our ways of working as well as our operating results. We've already shared with you our perspective on the balance of the year, which is based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of macro recovery. As is clear, we view our current performance and long-term strategy as significant factors that will continue to enhance shareholder value. 
As always, we're committed to sound financial fundamentals, including debt reduction as well as continuing to grow our dividend. We also remain focused on getting back to our share repurchase program when appropriate. We will, of course, keep you apprised of progress as the year develops. As always, we very much want to thank our clients and our people who are the key drivers of our success. Thank you all for the time this morning. And with that, let's open the call for questions."

And so as you know, sports and events are actually a fairly small part of the portfolio. I think we're talking about sub 5% of overall revenue. And so in essence, we do believe that there's going to be some resumption in that area probably towards the third quarter, definitely in the fourth quarter, but I don't think that's a significant factor that impacted where and how we got to that expectation about what we think the year looks like. I think Ellen and I both mentioned in our remarks the frequency with which we meet with the operators to discuss financial forecast, that was way up last year. We've largely kept to that cadence So that and client conversations is what's really informed our belief of what we can discover -- sorry, what we can deliver for the full year. I think that's really the function of it and then, obviously, the underlying revenue trends which we talked about, whether it's geographic, whether it's client driven or the progression over the course of the first few months of the year. 
And then in terms of new business, I think that there is a general consensus that last year, there was, as you say, kind of a damping down in that regard just because, obviously, going through that process, whether you're either going through it in a kind of lockdown purely virtual setting or whether it's just not a disruption that clients were really, I think, particularly open to given that there was so much uncertainty. So I think we have begun to see an increase, an uptick in that regard, and it's to be seen whether that continues, I think that, at the moment, that's the expectation. We're seeing some indications of that, but there may be more to come."

I would sort of say we've been clear that, that $160 million is a commitment that we, as a management team, have signed up for. So that's definitely the case. You see growth in Q1. So the strategic structural actions are beginning to kind of, in essence, get leverage, and so that's clearly very encouraging. And then we also talked about the fact that a lot of that $160 million would be evident in the '21 results and that real estate actions would not all be realized that we'd see some in '22 depending on the pace of the subleases, right? So the stated objective of we want to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company, it feels to me like we have early indications given the quarterly results that, that's clearly what we're doing. 
And then there are clearly other factors at play. So the ins and the outs of -- independent of the restructuring over a bunch of years, we've demonstrated the ability to grow margins with revenue growth. So there's growth now. So there's -- some of what's in the results just shows what Ellen and her team and what our operators are able to do in terms of discipline and focus on operating leverage, And then we're also starting to get into some higher value services and revenue streams. And the tailwind that is -- I think the unknown is that growth has come back prior to normalization of what, I guess, we'd call kind of pre-pandemic business travel meetings and all the costs that are associated with that. And I think that, over time, that's going to reverse. We go back to office, we go back to in-person interactions. And those are positives. I think there will be things that come out of those ways of working that will be good for the business and for what we're able to do with clients. And as some of those then costs come back into the model, then real estate savings materialize as we go into '22. So on all of those moving parts, I think we've got more detail in the various categories that had significant positive impact on margin. I think Ellen can probably unpack some of that with a lot of specificity for us."

I mean if you look at the first quarter, again, I think it illustrates and demonstrates how confident we are that we can drive margins. If you look at -- we gained 480 basis points between base payroll, benefits and tax and the occupancy, and that was largely due to the restructuring. As Philippe has mentioned and as I've said, real estate is not linear. So some of that benefit will accrue to next year as well and beyond as the subleases take hold. But unpacking some of the more variable costs like T&E, I mean it did benefit us 150 basis points for the quarter. How quickly that comes back is really some things that are largely out of our control depending upon the health crisis, But I do believe there will be learnings from this period of time in the pandemic that we will benefit from in the future. And will it ever come back to the extent that we travel previously? Probably not. The other one-off I would call, last year, we had elevated bad debt expense in the first quarter. So that really created a tailwind this quarter of about 130 basis points. And lastly, I would add, not only do we have a track record of managing margin, but we're incentivized to do so. All of our incentive plans are aligned with this objective, which gives us even that more confidence that we'll get there."

I think that international is interesting because the impact of the pandemic is so disparate and sector-driven. So I would look at a couple of things internationally that do give us comfort and give us reason to feel that there's something that's consistent here. So the decision of top-tier clients, so if you look at Europe, for example, we saw strength from a number of large clients in food and beverage, in CPG, in health care and in financial services. And so in a sense, I almost think -- and this is anecdotal, but you said is there anything you're hearing on the ground. I think even round 2 of lockdowns comes with less uncertainty in a sense. whether that's because clients have already pivoted to a better sense of how they're going to connect to consumers and drive demand through, say, e-com or it comes with somewhat less uncertainty because the vaccines are out there. And even though the pace at which vaccinations are proceeding in a number of countries, again, thinking about Europe where we had a lot of strength, people do have a sense that they're on a path to something, whereas the first time around, there was a lot of uncertainty, and so you could understand where clients we were wary of making any kind of commitment. So in a sense, I do think that, that gives us a sense that internationally, we can continue to deliver. And then the other thing is if you look at the offerings that are driving that strong international performance, there's consistent contributions, whether it's media tech, whether it's on the advertising side of things, McCann or whether it's the health care agencies."

And then secondly -- the question Alexia asked about buybacks is even return to buybacks, there's a good amount of cash cushion that you guys will build.

So I guess on the latter, Michael, I'd say to you that for quite some time, what we clearly believed was the right course of action was to invest in talent and to build the capabilities and embed them across the portfolio. And so I think that, largely speaking, we're pretty -- we're confident in what we can control. And so we don't see gaps in the portfolio. We see that we've got a full suite of offerings. We like the assets of those offerings, and we think we've got great people. And then integration, open architecture feels like it's always going to be a work in progress, but relatively, we see it as a strength. And then underlying that now, we have kind of data and tech powering all of that. So I would assume that we will get back to an M&A posture that is more what you would have anticipated for us -- from us in the past. And we'll definitely look for areas where the technical skills that are required or the rates of growth we're seeing are such that we do want to make bets to supplement what we've got going on. And it could be that an area like e-com is one of them. But I don't see some of the need for something really dramatic and significant at this point. And a few years from now, we'll ask again. 
In terms of kind of the first question, we are compounding kind of a number of years of consistent outperformance, and clearly, we're seeing a shift in where the demand is. But to answer the question about whether we can get to these consistently kind of next level or higher growth numbers this early in the stages of kind of an economic recovery feels like it is probably premature to make that determination, right? I mean it's clearly, aspirationally, we see that, as I said, higher value services are definitely something we want to lean into. But everything works well because it's part of an integrated whole, right? And so we've been successful because we've evolved the offerings, not because we've kind of tried to jump to a whole other model of how we serve clients and how do we deliver value for clients. So I think that we'll see that play out over time."

What has changed in terms of your thinking regarding margin? The new full year '21 guidance is quite ahead of consensus. Could it be that return to work is taking longer, so the savings are there for longer in 2021? And if that is the main explanation, could margin fall next year? Or would they be at least flat?

So I do think that there's something that's happening that's underlying here.

And then in a sense, the underlying book of business in the U.S. with plus 8, which is maybe, I think, probably 300 basis points better than kind of the other end of the spectrum for Q1 last year and then those '19 losses, so the underlying book of business in the U.S. grew about 4.5-ish this quarter. International, you've seen and we talked a bit and unpacked a bit about what's driving that. And then I'd say that there's improved tone in terms of conversations with clients and operators as the quarter progressed. But we don't manage quarter-to-quarter, so I'm not sure I can tell you precisely. I think that, as I said, we're going to see recovery, and then there's -- it's not going to be linear."

I'll start with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter. Ellen will then provide additional details. Then I'll conclude with updates on the highlights at our agencies, to be followed by Q&A. First and foremost, as Jerry said, I hope that you and your families are keeping well. As we all know, around the world, the pandemic is still with us to a significant degree. 
With all that entails, it bears mention that our people continue to navigate the many challenges, both personal and professional, presented by the health crisis. Their extraordinary resilience and capacity for innovation, as well as their care for one another and their commitment to our clients, are inspiring. Against business conditions that continue to be demanding, our people have driven the solid growth and the high level of first quarter profitability that we are reporting today. 
Turning to those results, beginning with revenue, we are pleased with our start to the year. First quarter organic net revenue growth was 1.9%. That reflects solid performance in the U.S., an organic decrease of 20 basis points, and strong international growth of 6.3%, with increases in every world region. 
In the U.S., you'll recall that we are comparing to very strong underlying performance in the first quarter of 2020 when we faced headwinds of nearly 4% due to certain 2019 client losses that we previously identified. Domestically, during this year's first quarter, we saw increases in areas such as media, data services and technology and our health care specialist agencies. 
Our international performance was paced by 12.4% growth in Continental Europe, where we had a strong start to the year by our media, data and tech offerings as well as McCann Worldgroup. Worldwide, our health care and retail client sectors, which were consistent outperformers last year, were again our growth leaders in the first quarter. 
From the standpoint of our operating segments, Our IAN segment grew 3.2% organically, led by media, data and technology and by the health care specialty agencies. As expected, in comparison to last year's largely pre-pandemic first quarter, global conditions in Q1 continued to weigh most heavily on the events and sports marketing disciplines and on certain project-driven businesses in both IAN and DXTRA. 
Nonetheless, while the environment understandably retained a strong note of caution across our offerings and client sectors, the lows were generally not as low. Clients are finding their footing amid a global economy that's increasingly showing signs of recovery. As better days ahead begin to come into focus, conversations with clients have generally become more positive and constructive. 
Turning to operating expense and profitability. Our teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline. Given the uncertainty that prevailed in 2020, we made decisions and took a series of actions during the year, necessary, but in many cases, no less difficult, to ensure the long-term health of the overall business. 
Our expenses in the quarter reflect much of the benefits of the strategic restructuring executed over the course of last year, most notably, in our expenses for base payroll and occupancy. We continue to be highly confident that, over time, we are well positioned to realize the full level of permanent operating expense savings that we've talked about previously, which, as a reminder, annualized at $160 million. 
Along with a return to growth and the benefits of our restructuring actions, our Q1 results were further helped by variable expense categories that continue to run at very low level, given that many of our activities are still restricted by the pandemic. These include significantly lower expenses for business travel and meetings as well as their associated costs. Our first quarter net income as reported was $92 million, which includes the expense of certain nonoperating items. 
Our adjusted EBITA was $266 million, a level which is approximately 2.5x the first quarters of recent years. Our adjusted EBITA margin was 13.1%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and was $0.45 as adjusted mainly for our loss on the early extinguishment of debt, the disposition of certain small nonstrategic agencies, both of which are nonoperating expenses, and our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
During the quarter, we refinanced a portion of our outstanding debt on very favorable terms, while extending our debt maturity profile. This level of financial flexibility positions us well in the event there is volatility as the global economy moves through a recovery. We're pleased to be able to share with you these strong set of results, which build on our company's long-term record of industry outperformance and consistent margin expansion. 
It bears mention that we continue to invest in our people and our capabilities and, as a result, to further differentiate our offerings in the areas of strongest opportunity and growth. This has been particularly relevant since we are seeing growing client demand for technology and data services and amid accelerating transformational change in marketing and media. Our ability to create marketing and media solutions that bring together creativity, technology and data in order to solve for higher order client opportunities are what drove growth in the first quarter. 
Given the complexity of the media and consumer landscape, marketers are looking for partners who can help them build their businesses through more precise, personalized and accountable engagements with individuals. With the deprecation of third-party cookies, all businesses are increasingly focused on realizing value from their first-party data, who are finding partners with whom they can pool data assets. 
As important, this needs to be done in a way that's respectful of people's privacy and anticipates likely regulatory development. We remain well positioned to benefit from those opportunities. Of course, our first quarter is seasonally our smallest, and most of the year still remains ahead of us. We also appreciate the heightened degree of business uncertainty as part of the current reality facing all companies until a business like ours translates into more challenging visibility to the full year. 
As a result, we're staying very close to our people and our clients, asking our teams for frequent financial updates and continuing to carefully manage expenses. To date, we're seeing cautious optimism from clients, and the tone of business has firmed in the last few months. Reopenings, fiscal stimulus and vaccination programs in a number of our largest markets are providing a tangible lift to economic activity and marketing demand. 
As we mentioned to you on our last call, we remain confident in those areas we can control, namely the strength and competitiveness of our offerings and the people and talent within our group. We are seeing that the most contemporary services we provide are growing in terms of the receptivity from clients and prospects. 
Given our strong start to the year, and based on the assumption that there'll continue to be a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery, we believe that we can deliver organic growth for the full year in the range of 5% to 6%. With that level of growth, we would expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 15.5%. As such, we see this as another year of strong value creation for all our stakeholders. We will, of course, keep you apprised of our progress as the year develops. 
On that note, I'll hand the call over to Ellen for a more in-depth view on our results."

Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation, our first quarter net revenue increased 2.8% from a year ago, with organic growth of 1.9%. First quarter adjusted EBITDA, before a small restructuring adjustment, was $265.9 million and margin was 13.1%. These are levels that compare very favorably against any previous first quarter. We returned to growth with variable expenses that are lagging the recovery in revenue, and we are additionally seeing the structural benefits of last year's restructuring program. 
Diluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and $0.45 as adjusted. The adjustments exclude the after-tax impacts of the amortization of acquired intangibles, a small restructuring refinement, nonoperating losses on sales of certain small nonstrategic businesses and the nonoperating loss on the early extinguishment of debt. 
During the quarter, we refinanced $1 billion of senior notes that had been scheduled to mature over the next few years. We placed the $1 billion in new notes maturing in 10- and 20-year tranches. The timing of those transactions initiated in mid-February was favorable in light of the subsequent rise in market rates. We appreciate and value the support and the reception that we received. 
As you may have seen in late March, we also received upgrades to our outlook from both S&P and Fitch. Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. 
Turning to Q1 revenue on Slide 4. Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.03 billion, an increase of $55.6 million. Compared to Q1 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 1.5%, with the dollar weaker against currencies in most of our largest markets. Net divestitures were negative 60 basis points. Our organic net revenue increase was 1.9%. 
At the bottom of this slide, we break out segment revenue in the quarter. Our IAN segment was -- grew 3.2% organically, a terrific result against last year, largely non-COVID first quarter. We saw solid growth by our offerings in media, data and tech at FCB and at McCann Worldgroup. 
At IPG DXTRA, the organic change in the quarter was negative 4.8%, which reflects the weight of live events and sports marketing within the segment, the disciplines that have been most significantly impacted by the pandemic. With that, DXTRA's performance was a sharp sequential improvement from the fourth quarter, especially in the public relations disciplines. 
Moving on to Slide 5, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region. In the U.S., which was 65% of net revenue in the quarter, our organic decrease was 20 basis points against the challenging comparisons underlying our headline number from a year ago. Compared to Q1 2020, we did see continued pressure on events and sports as well as certain project work, as has been the case throughout the pandemic. 
International markets were 35% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 6.3% organically. We grew in every international region, which is a notable improvement from Q4. Continental Europe grew 12.4%, with increases in every major national markets, including Spain, Germany, Italy and France, driven by increased spend from existing clients. 
With double-digit growth, there are a number of operating highlights in the region, including strong increases at media and tech and at McCann. The U.K. increased 3.5% organically and, again, this is net of continuing headwinds in the events discipline We had solid growth at McCann at our media, data and tech offerings and at MullenLowe. 
Asia Pac grew 3.4% organically. Among our largest regional markets, we had strong gains in Australia and Singapore, while China and India's revenues declined. Our organic growth in LatAm was 5%, with particularly strong results across Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Chile. Our Other Markets group grew 7.3%, with notably strong performance in the Middle East. 
Moving on to Slide 6 and operating expenses in the quarter. Our net operating expenses, excluding billable expenses and the amortization of acquired intangibles, decreased 6% from a year ago and to 2.8% growth of our net revenue. The result was first quarter margin expansion to 13.1% from 4.9% a year ago. 
We have significant year-on-year expense savings in a number of different categories, most notably our restructuring savings in payroll and occupancy and a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses. In the latter category, I would call out specifically the sharply lower travel and related expenses, for the obvious reasons, and significantly reduced bad debt expense, which was at an increased level in the first quarter of 2020. 
As you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue improved by 340 basis points to 68.7% compared with 72.1% a year ago. Underneath that, we drove very strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which improved by 360 basis points. We had a lower severance expense ratio, which was only 30 basis points of net revenue compared to 120 basis points in Q1 2020. 
At quarter end, total worldwide headcount was approximate 51,200, a decrease of 6.1% from a year ago as a result of our restructuring and regular severance actions taken over the course of last year as well as our business dispositions. Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue by 480 basis points to 14.4%. 
We continue to have significant decreases in our expenses for occupancy, driving year-on-year leverage of 110 basis points. We leveraged all other office and other direct expense by 370 basis points, which includes the decreased expense for travel and bad debt. Our SG&A expense was 1.4% of net revenue, an increase of 30 basis points. 
On Slide 7, we present detail on adjustments to our reported first quarter results in order to provide better transparency and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left-hand side with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS. 
Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.6 million. The restructuring charges were $1.3 million. To be clear, these are small adjustments to estimates related to our 2020 restructuring program that we concluded at the end of last year. 
Below operating expenses, in column 3, we had a pretax loss in the quarter of $12.5 million in other expenses due to the disposition of a few small nonstrategic businesses. To the right of that, our pretax loss due to the early extinguishment of debt was $74 million, which relates to the refinancing and extending the maturities of $1 billion of our senior notes. At the front of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of each of these adjustments, which bridges our diluted EPS as reported at $0.23 to adjusted earnings of $0.45 per diluted share. 
On Slide 8, we turn to cash flow in the quarter. Cash used in operations was $249.8 million compared with the use of $277.1 million in Q1 2020. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is highly seasonal. We typically generate significant cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and use cash in the first quarter. During this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital was $496.9 million and follows our fourth quarter of last year, where we generated over $1 billion from working capital. 
In our investing activities, we used $28 million for CapEx in the quarter, which was essentially offset by the net proceeds from the sales of investments. Our financing activities in the quarter is $212.7 million, which reflects the redemption and issuance of long-term debt and our common stock dividends. Our net decrease in cash for the quarter was $492.7 million. 
Slide 9 shows the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.02 billion of cash and equivalents compared with $1.55 billion a year ago. Under current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refer to our $500 million, 3.75% senior notes, which matures in October of this year. We plan on repaying these notes from cash on hand. 
Slide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt and our diversified and extended maturity schedule following our activity in the first quarter. Again, we have the maturity in October this year and then only $250 million due in April 2024. Thereafter, our next maturity is not until 2028. 
In summary, on Slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment. And I would like to reiterate our pride in, and gratitude for, the efforts of our people. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity means that we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Philippe."

It's worth repeating that Q1 is our smallest seasonal quarter, but nonetheless, we are pleased by our start to the year.

It's worth repeating that Q1 is our smallest seasonal quarter, but nonetheless, we are pleased by our start to the year. The return to organic revenue growth is a sign that our clients have begun to pivot to an investment mindset as they look to build their brands and grow their businesses in line with the broader economic recovery. Our performance is also a reflection of the strength of our people, our offerings and our long-term strategies that have helped us drive consistently strong performance over time. 
We all know that the pandemic has accelerated a range of underlying trends, whether in business or society at large. As a result, many of our clients are undertaking meaningful transformation of their companies. This means adopting new ways in which they go to market in order to keep pace with rapid digitization of consumer behavior and economic activity. 
In a world that's more cluttered than ever with messages and channel all vying for our attention, the most critical challenge is to combine great ideas that come from the human storytelling side of our business with strategies and insights that can be generated by our technology and data capabilities. We've increasingly seen the amounts of time people spend online, picking out content that's engaging, informative, entertaining, or some combination of all 3. Content is undoubtedly more important than ever, and that's what makes the creative side of our business so vital. 
Equally important is getting those messages to people in ways that are relevant, respectful of their privacy and ultimately connect with them in meaningful ways. It's also key to take the information flow that results from all those digital interactions and apply it at every step along the process, from audience definition to creative ideation, in order to better understand the impact that our clients' communications are having on their businesses. 
Our differentiated capabilities include a range of data-driven offerings that can do this both at scale and at speed. As you know, we've been developing a data and tech infrastructure that underpins the full portfolio of our agencies and deliver solutions to a broad range of business problems through what we call the Open Architecture model. 
All of our major clients are seeing the benefits of this integrated approach as our prospective clients. During the quarter, it was gratifying to see that the Kinesso behavioral sciences teams are engaging with more of our advertising and marketing services agencies than at any time since we launched those offerings. 
Despite the challenging external circumstances that we continue to deal with in the quarter, certain key elements of our business remain constant. We will always succeed by adapting rapidly in our ways of working and how we are meeting the needs of clients. Since the start of the year, we onboarded or promoted top talents across the organization, once again received high levels of industry recognition and saw solid new business performance, where we remain net positive for the past 12 months. 
As you've seen in our results, growth in the quarter was driven by contemporary offerings in which we've consistently invested, including media, data and tech, health care and digital user experience. Another area where IPG has invested significant resources is in our environmental, social and governance programs. For some time, we focused on building a culture of high ethical standards by adhering to a set of values centered around respect for every individual. 
As a company responsible for creating some of the world's most well-known marketing campaign, we have an obligation to ensure that the work we do as well as how we deliver it supports the long-term well-being of our communities. This quarter, IPG released its sixth annual sustainability report using the Global Reporting Initiative Standards framework. The report can be found on our website, and it represents another step forward for us in our commitment to ESG. 
In terms of climate action, we track IPG's global energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions across our entire portfolio. Next month, we plan to announce several strategic priorities focused on tackling climate change, including a science-based target for reducing our emissions globally. The report also aligns with the UN Global Compact and focuses on human capital disclosures. Further, we make clear that we operate with a core expectation that individuals deserve control over their data, and that we are responsible for promoting high ethical standards in terms of data privacy and security. 
Equity and inclusion also remain areas of focus for us. Our agencies are attuned to this priority, and they are held accountable because we have to show further progress when it comes to diversity in our ranks. IPG's latest MSCI ESG Ratings report, which is a key ESG data provider for our various stakeholders, saw an increase in our company's score to an A rating. Our improvement was the result of increased disclosure when it comes to human capital management, our position and capabilities related to data privacy and certain governance enhancements. 
More recently, we joined Civic Alliance, as well as many of our clients, in calling for the protection of voting access here in the United States. We continue to be committed to promoting democracy, and we'll work to support safe, accessible and fair elections, as well as to encourage our employees to participate in civic life. As a business in which attracting top talent and advising clients is crucial to our success, a robust approach to ESG is a key part of our long-term strategy and important to all stakeholders. 
Turning now to highlights from our portfolio. During the quarter, we issued our second Media Responsibility Audit, addressing in a structured and consistent manner one of the most topical issues in the digital media ecosystem. This framework and the principle it sets forth continue to be well received by clients as well as key industry groups. 
Mediabrands' MAGNA unit also hosted a first-of-its-kind equity upfront, a week-long event intended to raise visibility and receptivity for black-owned media and media that serves black audiences. In addition, the network announced that it would be joining forces with TikTok for a creator and content accelerator. 
Two of our most dynamic units were in the media space, where we continue to leverage our deep data resources and capabilities. We're seeing strong growth in Matterkind, which is customizing addressable media activation at scale for more of our clients. At Reprise commerce, we have rapidly scaled operations on a global basis as we address growing needs in e-commerce, particularly for insight, content and analytics. 
Following on a series of new business wins, Initiative elevated its U.S. leader to global CEO, where we believe she will have an even greater impact on the network's success. At UM during the quarter, we added a global rental car client as well as an auto OEM in EMEA and HBO Max in LatAm. UM was also named an outstanding company for working mothers, and 3 of its executives were named Adweek Media All-Stars, a distinction that was also earned by leaders of Reprise and Mediahub. 
At our creative integrated global agencies, both McCann Worldgroup and FCB were named to the top 5 most awarded networks of 2020 in The Drum's World Creative Rankings. Both also had work in the Super Bowl that was well received in a number of viewer polls and rankings. 
Following the implementation of our succession plan, at the end of 2020, McCann Worldgroup posted a solid first quarter. Along with most awarded networks of 2020 in the Drum rankings, McCann New York came in at #4 on that list in terms of the top 100 agencies worldwide. 
At MRM, the agency was again named a leader in Gartner's 2021 Magic Quadrant for global marketing agencies based on their ability to serve as key strategic business partners for clients and to execute on critical marketing priorities. Huge and R/GA also featured on that list. 
The health operations at McCann and FCB performed strongly in the quarter and continue to take share in the marketplace. The notable program I'd like to call out was FCB Health's launch of the trial for #clinicalequality to shine a light on racial bias in clinical oncology trial. 
In MullenLowe Group, Mediahub continued on its new business streak with the addition of global wins in Slack and [ Telly ] as well as New Balance in the U.K. Mediahub also introduced its inaugural Diversity-Owned Media Day and revamped its U.S. leadership team with a series of internal promotions. 
The MullenLowe advertising network continues to be a leader in purpose-driven work. Partnering with several independent casting agencies, the agency recently launched a campaign for Unilever's Dove to promote inclusivity in commercial casting. In the U.K., the agency has continued to do important work on behalf of the government to inform and educate the British public concerning the pandemic. 
In the campaign U.S. Agency of the Year awards, the Martin Agency was recognized with multiple honors. And the agency also teamed with Mediahub for an integrated win of Terminix in Q1. 
Huge posted strong results during the quarter and saw 2 big wins, adding Coppertone and Wakefern to its client roster. The agency also announced the return of its Huge XD School, with a renewed equity-centered purpose that seeks to use education to increase the participation of underrepresented identities in the design industry. 
And in R/GA, the agency's Venture Studio program announced the launch of a new Coalition Venture Studio with a mission to support Black start-up founders. IPG DXTRA companies continue to deliver specialized capabilities and integrated solutions for clients in our evolving world. 
[ Cone ] was once again a standout in new business arena. Weber Shandwick was named PR Agency of the Year of the Campaign U.S. Awards. And the agency also launched the Plan Vx open playbook, a communications program that draws on extensive vaccination and public health communications expertise to help companies play a role in getting America vaccinated. At Octagon, leader in sports marketing, we recently promoted a long-time executive to the role of CEO. 
Performance at Acxiom was consistent with our expectations and in line for a year of solid growth in 2021. The company continues to carve out a position as an authority in the integration of marketing and advertising technology. During the quarter, Acxiom expanded its partnership to better manage and measure campaign execution through the cloud in order to provide tangible improvements in campaign efficiency and speed. 
Acxiom is also accelerating its development in client verticals where it sees opportunities. Recently, Fortune named Acxiom one of 2021's Best Workplaces in Technology. Working closely with the Acxiom data teams, Kinesso deployed its enhanced identity solution with half a dozen large clients. This has already driven double-digit lifts in campaign efficiency. 
Kinesso also expanded its range of direct data integrations with prominent platforms and ad tech companies. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased to see the Kinesso API connecting data and analytics capabilities across more of the IPG portfolio, since we see this as a growth driver for our business and a source of potential new revenue streams. 
Acxiom, Kinesso and Matterkind, are working together to bring end-to-end data and identity solutions to clients, in collaboration with a number of IPG agencies. We've seen the impact of this recently in new wins and expanded assignments in the telecom, auto, health care and financial services sectors. Looking forward, we will stay focused on unlocking the enormous opportunities that exist due to the changes and disruptions that have accelerated during these past 12 months. 
We worked over the years to embed digital capabilities throughout our organization and build a foundational layer of tech and data infrastructure that informs all our work. As a result, we have a deep understanding of audiences at the individual level based on the strong legacy of ethical data practices. Personalization, privacy and accountability are only going to grow in importance and value going forward. Our vision is, therefore, for IPG to become a key partner in ensuring that clients businesses thrive in the digital economy. 
The success we have seen at the start of the year is thanks to the talent, efforts and commitment of our people. As you'd expect, we are focused on supporting their physical and mental well-being and listening to them in planning a return to office. That's likely is to begin to a meaningful degree in September, dependent on continued progress on matters related to resolving the public health crisis. It will be a gradual and iterative process in which we obviously were going to have to test and learn as we go. 
As such, on the cost drivers that go hand-in-hand with live collaboration with colleagues as well as calling on clients in person, which have, of course, been reduced as a result of lockdowns, we'll begin to work their way back into our ways of working as well as our operating results. We've already shared with you our perspective on the balance of the year, which is based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of macro recovery. As is clear, we view our current performance and long-term strategy as significant factors that will continue to enhance shareholder value. 
As always, we're committed to sound financial fundamentals, including debt reduction as well as continuing to grow our dividend. We also remain focused on getting back to our share repurchase program, when appropriate. We will, of course, keep you apprised on progress as the year develops. As always, we very much want to thank our clients and our people who are the key drivers of our success. Thank you all for the time this morning. 
And with that, let's open the call for questions."

I think you mentioned -- I think Philippe has mentioned sort of a steady recovery is the assumption behind it. But I'm wondering if you're anticipating things like sports and events come back later in the year sort of the -- in your assumptions for that guide? 
And then just a follow-up question is really on the new business activity. I'm wondering if there was maybe a low in 2020 and that has created kind of a pent-up demand or backlog, a more robust pipeline potentially for 2021, which could ultimately have an outsized influence to the full year organic growth?"

And so, as you know, sports and events are actually a fairly small part of the portfolio. I think we're talking about sub 5% of overall revenue. And so, in essence, we do believe that there's going to be some resumption in that area, probably towards the third quarter, definitely in the fourth quarter. 
But I don't think that's a significant factor that impacted where and how we got to that expectation about what we think the year looks like. I think Ellen and I both mentioned in our remarks the frequency with which we meet with the operators to discuss financial forecast. That was way up last year. We've largely kept to that cadence. 
So that and client conversations is what's really informed our belief of what we can discover -- sorry, what we can deliver for the full year. I think that's really the function of it, and then, obviously, the underlying revenue trends, which we talked about, whether it's geographic, whether it's client driven or the progression over the course of the first few months of the year. 
And then in terms of new business, I think that there is a general consensus that, last year, there was, as you say, kind of a damping down in that regard just because, obviously, going through that process, whether you're either going through it in a kind of lockdown purely virtual setting or whether it's just not a disruption that clients were really, I think, particularly open to given that there was so much uncertainty. 
So I think we have begun to see an increase, an uptick in that regard, and it's to be seen whether that continues. I think that, at the moment, that's the expectation. We're seeing some indications of that, but there may be more to come."

I would sort of say we've been clear that, that $160 million is a commitment that we, as a management team, have signed up for. So that's definitely the case. You see growth in Q1. So the strategic structural actions are beginning to kind of, in essence, get leverage. And so that's clearly very encouraging. 
And then we also talked about the fact that a lot of that $160 million would be evident in the '21 results. And that real estate actions would not all be realized, that we'd see some in '22 depending on the pace of the subleases, right? So the stated objective of we want to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company, it feels to me like we have early indications given the quarterly results that, that's clearly what we're doing. 
And then there are clearly other factors at play. So the ins and the outs of -- independent of the restructuring over a bunch of years, we've demonstrated the ability to grow margins with revenue growth. So there's growth now. So there's -- some of what's in the results just shows what Ellen and her team and what our operators are able to do in terms of discipline and focus on operating leverage. 
And then we're also starting to get into some higher-value services and revenue streams. And the tailwind that is -- I think the unknown is that growth has come back prior to normalization of what, I guess, we'd call kind of pre-pandemic business travel meetings and all the costs that are associated with that. And I think that, over time, that's going to reverse. If we go back to office, we go back to in-person interactions. And those are positives. 
I think there will be things that come out of those ways of working that will be good for the business and for what we're able to do with clients. And as some of those then costs come back into the model, then real estate savings materialize as we go into '22. So on all of those moving parts, I think we've got more detail in the various categories that had significant positive impacts on margin. I think Ellen can probably unpack some of that with a lot of specificity for us."

I mean if you look at the first quarter, again, I think it illustrates and demonstrates how confident we are that we can drive margins. If you look at -- we gained 480 basis points between base payroll, benefits and tax and the occupancy, and that was largely due to the restructuring. 
As Philippe has mentioned and as I've said, real estate is not linear. So some of that benefit will accrue to next year as well and beyond as the subleases take hold. But unpacking some of the more variable costs like T&E, I mean, it did benefit us 150 basis points for the quarter. How quickly that comes back is really some things that are largely out of our control, depending upon the health crisis. 
But I do believe there will be learnings from this period of time and the pandemic that we will benefit from in the future. And will it ever come back to the extent that we travel previously? Probably not. 
The other one-off I would call, last year, we had elevated bad debt expense in the first quarter. So that really created a tailwind this quarter of about 130 basis points. And lastly, I would add, not only do we have a track record of managing margin, but we're incentivized to do so. All of our incentive plans are aligned with this objective, which gives us even that more confidence that we'll get there."

And so in a sense, I almost think -- and this is anecdotal, but you said is there anything you're hearing on the ground. I think even round 2 of lockdowns comes with less uncertainty in a sense, whether that's because clients have already pivoted to a better sense of how they're going to connect to consumers and drive demand through, say, e-com. Or it comes with somewhat less uncertainty because the vaccines are out there. 
And even though the pace at which vaccinations are proceeding in a number of countries, again, thinking about Europe, where we had a lot of strength. People do have a sense that they're on a path to something, whereas the first time around, there was a lot of uncertainty. And so you could understand where clients were wary of making any kind of commitment. 
So in a sense, I do think that, that gives us a sense that internationally, we can continue to deliver. And then the other thing is, if you look at the offerings that are driving that strong international performance, there's consistent contributions, whether it's media tech, whether it's on the advertising side of things, McCann or whether it's the health care agencies."

I wonder, given your view of the future, all the moving pieces on e-commerce and changes in consumption, do you think your company's growth will stay at that level? Or can you see acceleration structurally from some of the decisions you've made to reposition the company for maybe a faster-growing segment? So I want to know that. 
And then secondly -- the question Alexia asked about buybacks. Even if you return to buybacks, there's a good amount of cash cushion that you guys will build. So can you talk a bit about your philosophy on M&A? I know you were the architect to the Acxiom deal. But do you favor small tuck-ins? Or should we expect, down the road, maybe another large acquisition to further reposition the company? So those are my questions."

So I guess, on the latter, Michael, I'd say to you that, for quite some time, what we clearly believed was the right course of action was to invest in talent and to build the capabilities and embed them across the portfolio. And so I think that, largely speaking, we're pretty -- we're confident in what we can control. 
And so we don't see gaps in the portfolio. We see that we've got a full suite of offerings. We like the assets of those offerings, and we think we've got great people. 
And then integration, Open Architecture feels like it's always going to be a work in progress. But relatively, we see it as a strength. And then underlying that now, we have kind of data and tech powering all of that. So I would assume that we will get back to an M&A posture that is more what you would have anticipated for us -- from us in the past. 
And we'll definitely look for areas where the technical skills that are required or the rates of growth we're seeing are such that we do want to make bets to supplement what we've got going on. And it could be that an area like e-com is one of them. But I don't see some of the need for something really dramatic and significant at this point. And a few years from now, we'll ask again. 
In terms of kind of the first question, we are compounding kind of a number of years of consistent outperformance. And clearly, we're seeing a shift in where the demand is. But to answer the question about whether we can get to these consistently kind of next level or higher growth numbers this early in the stages of kind of an economic recovery, it feels like it is probably premature to make that determination, right? 
I mean it's clearly, aspirationally, we see that, as I said, higher-value services are definitely something we want to lean into. But everything works well because it's part of an integrated whole, right? And so we've been successful because we've evolved the offerings, not because we've kind of tried to jump to a whole other model of how we serve clients and how do we deliver value for clients. So I think that we'll see that play out over time."

So about 2%, 2-year run rate, which would put Q2 up about 12%, following last year minus 10%. So is 12% or better relative in Q2? That's my first question. 
And then the second one is on the margin. What has changed in terms of your thinking regarding margin? The new full year '21 guidance is quite ahead of consensus. Could it be that return to work is taking longer, so the savings are there for longer in 2021? And if that is the main explanation, could margin fall next year? Or would they be at least flat? So some more color on the significant upgrade in the margin perspective."

They were about how do we make our companies nimbler? How do we make them able to provide services to clients but in a way that is more contemporary. 
So I do think that there's something that's happening that's underlying here. But as I think I mentioned, when Alexia asked the question, it's -- with so many ins and outs, you're asking a very fair question. You're asking a question we're asking ourselves. But I don't know that we've got a clear line of sight as to when are those costs going to start coming back in. 
As Ellen said earlier, what's going to be new normal in terms of in-person engagement, travel, things of that nature.

Now on your revenue question, I think there's just -- there's a lot of kind of -- from a quarter-to-quarter basis, there's a lot of noise in the system in a sense. So obviously, our -- not that I would trade out of the position we're in, but our comps are quite challenging relative to peers. But we still feel strong enough that we're saying to you what we think the year looks like. 
And then the thing that is maybe masking the strength of the U.S. finishes rolling off at the end of Q2. But sequentially, every region, U.S. included, saw improvement. And then in a sense, the underlying book of business in the U.S., with a plus 8%, which is maybe, I think, probably 300 basis points better than kind of the other end of the spectrum for Q1 last year and then those '19 losses. So the underlying book of business in the U.S. grew about 4.5-ish this quarter. 
International, you've seen, and we talked a bit and unpacked a bit about what's driving that, and then I'd say that there's improved tone in terms of conversations with clients and operators as the quarter progressed. But we don't manage quarter-to-quarter, so I'm not sure I can tell you precisely. I think that, as I said, we're going to see recovery, and then there's -- it's not going to be linear."

As always, I'll start with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter. Ellen will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with updates on key developments at our agencies, to be followed by Q&A. 
I'd like to begin once again by thanking our 53,000 fellow employees around the world for the professionalism and dedication that continue to see us through the many challenges of COVID. These include the transition to work from home and now are planning for a return to office in many parts of the world as well as the significant personal difficulties presented by the long course of the pandemic. It's due to the efforts of our people, their commitment to their craft, our clients and to each other that we can share with you today these very strong results. Performance that demonstrates our resilience represents a remarkable rebound from the impact of the pandemic and is also the largest second quarter in our company's history. 
Our strong results in the quarter build on IPG's consistent record of industry outperformance and margin expansion. Our growth across regions, disciplines and client sectors speaks to more than a recovering global economy. It underscores the elevated value that marketing and media partners can deliver. And the integration of creativity, technology and data at scale made the significantly increased velocity of digital transformation. At  Interpublic, we're confident that we are attuned to the powerful currents that are transforming consumer behavior and are required for business relevance, and that we are increasingly delivering differentiated and higher-end solutions that help our clients win in a world of accelerated technological and societal change. That takes creativity and precision, data and accountability, all of which we're able to bring together and customized teams that drive talent from across our portfolio. Ultimately, our growth speaks to our ability to drive outstanding business results for our clients. 
Our net organic revenue growth in the second quarter was 19.8%. That's against the second quarter of 2020 when, as you will recall, our organic change was negative 9.9%, which, while well ahead of our peer group, did mark our steepest decrease of the recession. It's also important to note that our 7.9% organic increase this quarter relative to the pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019. Compared to last year, our organic growth was at double-digit rates around the world. In the U.S., it was 17.4%. Growth in our international markets ranged from 14% in the Asia Pacific region to 49% in Latin America. We also had a very broad contribution from our operating segments and disciplines. 
Our IAN segment grew 20.5% organically with increases led by media, data and technology and with solid contributions from our global integrated networks. There was also strength across most of our disciplines led by health care. 
In our DXTRA segment, organic growth was 15.1%, with strong increases from last year's heavily impacted Q2 across Octagon sports and entertainment and Jack Morton's experiential offerings. 
Looking at client sectors, the picture is also one of comprehensive acceleration. Each of our 8 major sectors had double-digit increases from a year ago. The auto, retail and other sectors were up more than 20%. Consumer goods, tech and telecom and health care increased in the mid- to high teens. Food and Beverage and Financial Services were up in the low double-digit range. 
Turning to operating expense and profitability, our teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline. And while remaining focused on appropriate cost control, we're also continuing to invest to support accelerating growth. We continue to see the benefits of cost improvements from strategic restructuring actions taken last year, notably in our payroll expense and our expense for occupancy. 
We also continue to see the benefits of low variable expenses as a result of the highly restrictive global travel environment and from the cost efficiencies of a largely remote workforce. As we look ahead to post-pandemic work life, it's worth noting that we can, of course, expect that expenses for travel, meetings, office utilities and the like will begin to return in the second half of this year, most notably in Q4 and, of course, into next year. 
Our second quarter net income was $263.3 million as reported. Adjusted EBITDA was $405.8 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue was 17.9%. Our results reflect significant operating leverage compared to both last year and the 2019 period on our expense for base payroll and our office and other expenses. We delevered on our expense accrual for our performance-based incentive compensation plans, but our operating performance tracking well ahead of planned target. 
Diluted earnings per share was $0.66 as reported and was $0.70 as adjusted for the after-tax expense of the amortization-required intangibles. As we look to the balance of the year, you'll recall that in April, we shared a full year 2021 performance outlook based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery. At that time, we outlined our view towards full year organic growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 15.5%. In light of our very strong second quarter and also having recently refreshed our bottom-up outlook for the second half of the year based on conversations with our clients and operating teams, we believe it's appropriate at the midpoint of this quite unusual year, unprecedented, in fact, to upgrade those expectations. Of course, we do sadly need to recognize that the COVID pandemic and the related risk to the macro environment are not yet behind us. 
In particular, as we look ahead, we all understand the lagging vaccination rates in many parts of the world and the emergence of new variants may entail a higher COVID risk. That's something we'll watch closely as we enter the second half of the year, especially our seasonally important fourth quarter. But predicated on the continued progress on public health issues, we believe that we can deliver organic growth for the full year of 9% to 10%. And with that level of growth, we would expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 16%. As such, we see this as another year of strong value creation for all of our stakeholders. We'll, of course, keep you apprised of progress as the year develops, and we look forward to those conversations. 
On that note, I'd like to hand over the call to Ellen now for a more in-depth view of our results."

Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation, second quarter net revenue increased 22.5% from a year ago with organic growth of 19.8%. Adjusted EBITDA before a small restructuring adjustment was $405.8 million and margin was 17.9%. These are levels that compare very favorably against any previous second quarter. With growth having accelerated, certain variable expenses continue to lag, and we are additionally seeing the structural benefits of last year's restructuring program. 
Diluted earnings per share was $0.66 as reported and $0.70 as adjusted for the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. 
Turning to second quarter revenue on Slide 4. Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.27 billion, an increase of $416.2 million from a year ago. Compared to Q2 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 3.1%, with the U.S. dollar weaker against currencies in most of our largest markets. Net divestitures were negative 40 basis points. Our organic net revenue increase was 19.8%, which brings us to 10.6% organic growth for the 6 months. At the bottom of this slide, we break out segment revenue in the quarter. 
Our IAN segment grew 20.5% organically. We had notably strong growth across our offerings in media, data and tech, McCann, FCB with health care a significant driver, MullenLowe, R/GA. At IPG DXTRA, organic growth was 15.1%, which reflects some recovery of the events and sports marketing offerings within the segment, the disciplines that have been most significantly impacted by the pandemic. Our public relations offering also had solid growth in the quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 5, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region. In the U.S., which was 63% of net revenue in the quarter, organic growth was 17.4%. Revenue decreased a year ago in the same period by 8%. Year-on-year performance was very strong across media, data and tech, FCB driven by health care, IPG DXTRA, McCann, MullenLowe and Huge. International markets were 37% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 24.4% organically. You'll recall that the same market decreased 13.1% a year ago in the second quarter, which ranged by region between negative 10% and negative 15%. 
Continental Europe grew 27.9%, with notably strong growth in Germany, Spain and France. There were a number of operating highlights in the region, led by media, data and tech, McCann, R/GA and DXTRA. The U.K. increased 18.7% organically, led by McCann, DXTRA, media, data and tech and R/GA. 
Asia Pac grew 14% organically. Our organic growth was paced by Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and India, while China and Japan decreased. 
Our organic growth in LatAm was 49%, with exceptional results across the region, including Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Our Other Markets group grew 29.2% with notably strong performance in the Middle East and Canada. 
Moving on to Slide 6 and operating expenses in the quarter. Our operating expenses, excluding billable expenses, the amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring charges, increased only 11% from a year ago and [ did ] 22.5% growth of net revenue. The result was second quarter margin expansion to 17.9% from 9.4% a year ago. We continue to see efficiencies in a number of different expense categories as we had it in this year's first quarter, and these were both structural and variable. In the structural category, we are seeing the benefit of the strategic restructuring actions, which we initiated in the second quarter of last year and continue to execute over the second half. As a reminder, these actions involve the elimination of certain positions and resulting headcount reduction that will not return with revenue growth. 
We also reduced our real estate footprint by 15% last year. We are currently seeing the benefit of most of these actions. And at a full run rate, they will generate $160 million in annual cost savings. We've also had, over the course of the pandemic, a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses. I would call out specifically lower travel and related expenses, which was the case in the second quarter of 2020 and has continued through Q2 2021. 
As you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue was 65.4%, which has significantly improved from the second quarter of 2020 when revenue had decreased sharply. Underneath that, we drove very strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which was 53% of net revenue in the quarter. That reflects the benefit of last year's restructuring and the fact that the pace of new hiring lags our significant revenue growth, as has been the case in past business cycles. Our severance expense ratio also decreased sharply to only 40 basis points of net revenue compared to 3% in Q2 2020, which was at an elevated level due to the impact of the recession. Going the other way, our expense for performance-based incentive compensation increased to 6.4%, consistent with our very strong operating results. Expense for temporary labor also increased as a percent of net revenue to 4.5% as a result of servicing the top line's quick acceleration. At quarter end, [indiscernible] worldwide headcount was approximately 53,000, a 1.4% increase from a year ago and up 5.2% from the beginning of this year with hiring to support our growth. 
Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue by 380 basis points to 13.3%. Our occupancy expense decreased to 5% of net revenue, mainly due to the restructuring of our real estate as well as leverage on our revenue growth. We leverage all other office and other direct expense by 220 basis points, which reflects lower expense for bad debt and acquisition costs and leverage as a result of our revenue growth. 
Our SG&A expense was 1.3% of net revenue, with the increase from a year ago due to higher unallocated performance-based incentive expense and increased employee insurance expense, which was at a very low level a year ago. 
On Slide 7, we present detail on adjustments to our reported second quarter results in order to provide greater clarity and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left-hand side with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS. Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.6 million. The restructuring refinement in the quarter was a benefit of $200,000. To be clear, this is a small adjustment to estimate of the 2020 restructuring program. 
Below operating expenses in column 4, we had a pretax loss in the quarter of $1.7 million in other expenses due to the disposition of small nonstrategic businesses. At the foot of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of these adjustments was $0.04 per share, which [ burdens ] our diluted EPS as reported at $0.66 to adjusted earnings of $0.70 per diluted share. The appendix to our presentation includes a similar blue bridge on our diluted EPS for the 6-month period. 
On Slide 8, we turn to cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operations was $468.2 million compared with the use of $87.1 million a year ago. We generated $101.6 million from working capital compared to a use of $264.9 million last year. Investing activities was $43.3 million in the quarter, mainly for CapEx of $34 million. Financing activities used $101.8 million, mainly for our dividend. Our net increase in cash for the quarter was $325.6 million. 
Slide 9 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.34 billion of cash and equivalents. Under current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refers to our $500 million 3.75% senior note, which matures in October of this year. We plan to repay these notes from cash on hand. 
Slide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt. Again, we have the maturity in October of this year and then only $250 million due in April 2024. Thereafter, our next maturity is not until 2028. 
In summary, on Slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment. I would like to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity mean that we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Philippe."

While we remain very pleased with our results, it's worth reiterating, as Ellen just said, that this is an unusual, in fact, unprecedented environment in which we're operating. Now importantly, it bears noting that when compared to our non-pandemic results in 2019, Q2 results show our company is performing at a very high level. We continue to feel this is the result of strategic decisions that we've taken over a number of years to position our company for the future, investments and actions that have created a sustainable advantage for our organization. Today's IPG delivers addressable and accountable digital marketing programs. Combined with our world-class creative storytelling capabilities, these solutions make us higher-value partners to our clients. 
One of our many priorities over the years has been the creation and implementation of open architecture solutions where we bring the best of IPG together in collaborative teams that are customized to client-specific business needs and increasingly, a key element of this approach. Open Architecture 2.0, as it were, is Acxiom whose data management expertise and data assets play a role in an increasingly broad range of our offerings. In addition, Kinesso powers many of our applications and services that provide clients with a deep understanding of audiences in order to provide insights that inform creative work, segments for media delivery and line of sight to the effectiveness of the work that we are doing together. We saw this model come to life in the quarter with a Cigna count win, which combined talent from McCann Worldgroup, Initiative and R/GA powered by Kinesso and Acxiom. This is a continuation of several years of strong performance in integrated pitches, especially those that include creative and media as well as media and data. 
Another key decision that's contributed to our success has been our continued investment in strong agency brands, which helps us attract and retain top talent and deliver breakthrough creative ideas across a range of marketing disciplines. As a result of this strategy, IPG companies across our portfolio earned a number of important accolades during the quarter. Most notably, we have an impressive showing at the 2021 Time International Festival Creativity. IPG agencies took home 8 Grand Prix, the festival's highest honor. Wins across the network represented a broad range of clients, categories, agencies, disciplines and geographies. FCB's performance was a standout as the agency took home 4 Grand Prix and was named Global Network of the Year. The agency's creative community and its leadership deserve credit for this terrific accomplishment. 
FCB Health was also named Healthcare Network of the Year, and Area 23 and FCB Health Agency was named Healthcare Agency of the Year. McCann Client Microsoft was named Marketer of the Year at the festival, which is another major honor. And the agency also won a Grand Prix in brand experience and activation for its remarkable true namework for Mastercard, which empowers transgender and nonbinary cardholders to use their true name when using their credit card. 
In PR, McCann Paris earned a Grand Prix, partnering with Weber Shandwick, for a campaign that ran across the Middle East, which teaches women in a culturally sensitive way to perform self-checks for early breast cancer detection. FCB Chicago and Weber Shandwick teamed to earn a Grand Prix for work for AB InBev. And R/GA continues to be recognized for its ability to humanize technology, winning a Grand Prix in social and influencer marketing for disruptive work it did for Reddy on the Super Bowl. 
On Adage annual A-List and Creativity Awards, both Deutsche L.A. and the Martin Agency were named to the prestigious A list. Initiative was named Media Agency of the Year. And FCB Health's CEO, was recognized as our industry's Executive of the Year. 
At the holding company level, we made a number of announcements that position us for further success. Chief among them was our launch of IPG Health earlier this month. The move will align our top-performing companies, FCB Health and McCann Health under a new global network, IPG Health, led by a dynamic and proven CEO and a skilled executive leadership team. In this new operating structure, the distinct agency brands within FCB Health and McCann Health will remain active and continue to go to market independently. But they will also benefit from access to additional specialty services, knowledge sharing, proactive career management shared investment in new capabilities and skill sets, highly complementary geographic coverage as well as an even higher level of collaboration. 
Around the world, health care and well-being are areas of growing importance for our clients and society at large. As an industry sector, health care represents an increasingly vital part of the economy and one where innovation is becoming an ever more important driver of success. So the alignment of IPG's fully dedicated health care networks under the banner of IPG Health strengthens our leadership position in this dynamic sector. The scale, reach and most importantly, quality of our people and our work makes for an exciting combination. And it's why we think this new offering will continue to deliver great things in the years to come. 
This month, we also added to our strong roster of marketing technology and e-commerce providers with the launch of Performance Art, a data-led creative CRM agency, whose leadership team is known for delivering platform-level creative ideas that are at home in a client's e-retail flow as they are in a 30-second spot. 
Turning to performance at our agencies. Growth at IAN in the quarter was once again highlighted by media, data and tech and FCD led by Health Care. UM saw significant wins in the quarter with Enterprise Holdings; Behr Paint; and most recently, NYC & Company, New York City's official marketing and tourism organization. UM also saw an important account retention for the Australian government. At the Campaign Agency of the Year Awards, UM earned a Global Media Agency of the Year honors, and UM APAC was named Best Media Network in that region. At Initiative, the agency was named 2020's Most Competitive Network Globally in Media Pitches and saw a major win in the U.K. with banking and insurance company, NatWest Group. We also continue to see terrific momentum at Reprise, especially as it relates to their growing e-commerce capabilities. 
Acxiom, Kinesso and Matterkind are also performing well, and they're key to how we help clients thrive in the addressable media market, which requires flexibility given the quickly shifting landscape. At Acxiom, we continue to invest behind innovative new products and services, such as customer data platforms and identity resolution with which we are seeing increased client adoption. Another important development saw Acxiom deploy their latest customer intelligence platform on the cloud with a key financial services client. 
At our creative integrated networks, FCB, McCann and MullenLowe Group were named to Act Responsible 2020 Good Report, a unique ranking of the world's best use of creative communications to promote sustainability and social responsibility. On top of its exceptional showing [ a ton ], at FCB Global, the network continues to invest in talent and new offerings, hiring ahead of data science and connections to expand its expertise in commerce, data and technology fueled creativity. McCann also continues to prove a creative powerhouse, as we saw, in the network was recently named Web Network of the Year, and McCann New York was named Weber Agency of the Year. MRM continues to leverage its Martek expertise and is seeing strong growth with its MRM Commerce division, which help marketers drive engagement interaction and conversion on commerce platforms. And MullenLowe Group, Mediahub continues its strong new business momentum, and during the quarter, added Hallmark's parent company, Crown Media, as well as Tally Financial. MullenLowe is also a global leader in purpose-driven work, and we saw that as a continued to partner with governments in a number of countries around the world to inform people the benefits of being vaccinated against COVID-19. 
At R/GA, campaign named the London office as the U.K.'s Digital Agency of the Year. And R/GA London added 2 new clients, financial services company, Allianz; and [indiscernible] Clothing. We named the new CEO at Huge, who joins the digital agency after a very successful tenure at initiative, where he helped turn the agency into a leader in the media space. During the quarter, Huge also saw strong new business activity, adding Sub-zero Appliances, Wake Firm, Tezos Foundation and Nicko Asset Management. The Martin Agency continues to impact culture and drive strong business results for its clients. Notably, the agency sold the city short film for DoorDash for -- at the Tribeca Film Festival last month and had captured the resilience of New York City's restaurants and the role they play in the cities like. 
At IPG DXTRA, we also saw recognition as the number of companies were called out for their ability to deliver creative solutions. Weber Shandwick was the most awarded PR agency at Can this year. Current global demonstrated their commitment to closing the disability and inclusion gap by creating guidelines and toolkits for marketers so as to make content more accessible for consumers with site, hearing or other cognitive impairments. And this program was recognized as one of Fast Company's world-changing ideas for 2021. Jack Morton launched what they are referring to as the return-to-live dashboard, and that's a tool for brand marketers to access where, when and how businesses in the U.S. can safely get back to hosting live experiences. Golan continued its strong performance in new business, was selected as LinkedIn's Global Social Media Agency of Record and also Agency of Record for Yamaha music. Golan was also named PRWeek's Global Agency of the Year. And at Octagon, the Sports and Entertainment Network won Best in Talent Representation at the 2021 Sports Business Awards. 
Pivoting now back to the holding company, another key area that Behr's mentioned is our long-term focus on ESG, including diversity, equity and inclusion. As a leader in marketing services, in a citizen of the communities where our employees live, work and vote, we welcome the responsibility to operate sustainably and contribute to the healthier society and planning. In all of our operations and activities, we're working to build on and more fully live into this commitment. And this includes reassessing how we hire, train and promote a diverse workforce, incorporate rigorous practices around data ethics and media responsibility as well as reduce our greenhouse gas emissions further around the world. Key accomplishments on this front include IPG being recently named by Forbes to their Top 10 List of America's Best Employers for Diversity. 
During the quarter, we also created a new position, our industry's first culture officer, to focus on long-term thought leadership relating to a broad range of social justice issues for underserved and underrepresented communities. During the quarter, as part of our integrated ESG efforts, we also announced an action plan that consists of 3 climate roles, committing to set a science-based target; sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2030; and joining the Climate Pledge, co-founded by Amazon in Global Optimism. In addition, we've published our first SASB report, becoming the first company in the advertising and marketing sector to publish an alignment with SASB's industry standards. Our agencies also contribute significantly to our ESG profile. 
And importantly, here in the U.S., we saw media brands take a leading role in the industry conversation about promoting greater media equity. And they announced that they're committing to invest at least 5% of client budgets in Black-owned Media by 2023. Octagon launched an accelerator program with historically black colleges and universities for students interested in sports and entertainment as a career. And R/GA created an innovative program to raise money for environmental organizations through a dedicated YouTube channel that plays nature videos, which have become hugely popular during the pandemic, and it direct all of the ad revenues generated on this channel to environmental NGOs. 
Now as we sit here at the halfway mark of 2021, the success we've seen is thanks to the talent, efforts and commitment of our people. And we continue to be highly focused on supporting their physical and mental well-being as we plan, return to office. Like many of us, I look forward to working live with colleagues and clients, especially given that we're an ideas-driven service business. Our culture, our capacity for innovation and the ways in which we combine creativity with technology and data are all enhanced by in-person interactions. 
Now here in the U.S., we expect to have more people returning to our offices in a flexible hybrid model, beginning in mid-September as is already the case in certain other parts of the world. We will, of course, be mindful of the public health situation and of the learnings we've accumulated during the past 16 months when it comes to flexible work practices. The expected costs associated with live collaboration with colleagues as well as travel will begin to return as a normal part of how we work and, therefore, be reflected in our operating results. 
For example, as we look forward to the remainder of the year, we expect an increase in travel costs in the fourth quarter, which could return to levels consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2019. As we said earlier, these are unprecedented times. None of us had previously been required to adapt the constraints of living and working through a pandemic. And likewise, none of us has experience in emerging for one. Thankfully, as a company, we are well positioned to do so. 
Earlier on the call, we shared our perspective on the balance of the year, based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of macro recovery, that people continue to become vaccinated to protect themselves and their communities and that we're able to adequately mitigate the impact of dangerous new variants. We've delivered a very strong first half of the year on top of the most challenging comps in our industry. 
Further, despite continued macro uncertainty, we have greater clarity to the balance of 2021. We, therefore, believe that current performance, combined with the continued execution of our long-term strategy, are significant drivers for the sustained enhancement of value for all of our stakeholders. As always, we're committed to sound financial fundamentals, including debt reduction as well as continuing to grow our dividend. We also remain focused on getting back to our share repurchase program, and we will keep you apprised of our progress as the year develops. 
As always, we want to thank our clients and our people, who are ultimately the 2 key pillars of our success. I'd also like to thank you all for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call over for questions."

Look, I mean, I think those are terrific questions or things we obviously think about. And so if I were to track the progression for you, what I'd say to you is if you think back to what we talked about the last time we were all together, from February to April, we clearly saw improvement in the broader economic environment, but also in the tone of what I guess I'd call client sentiment, right? And so as we went through the quarter, that trend was clearly continuing to build over the course of the second quarter, right? And so as we think about it, is it a question of surprise? I mean I think we said to you, we felt confident in our offerings, specifically in ways we can help clients to stand apart and to succeed in a digital-first kind of economy. So now that growth is available, we're obviously pleased to see that we're capitalizing on the environment. So you start breaking down the results, and what do you see? You see, whether it's geographies or practice areas, content creation, creativity, data and tech, it was very, very widely spread. And so Matterkind addressable media growing a very, very strong grower for us. 
Health Care continued to be an area where we're seeing really, really good results. And then perhaps if you're bracketing it, having decreased by north of 30%, in light of the pandemic, we clearly have experiential and advance know, showing a real recovery, they're not all the way back, right? 
Month-to-month in the quarter, we saw consistency. So that's something where in terms of projecting forward to we see that as encouraging. And then as we forecast for the back half of the year, we also see that consistency and that ratable. There isn't a moment in time where we're expecting there to be something dramatic to get us to what we've communicated to you, which is that 9% to 10% number, right? And the one big caveat is one that applies for all of us around the world, which is just there's a significant deterioration on the public health front. 
And you really get at something because what I think we're seeing is we're seeing the overall environment stronger, but we're also seeing underlying factors that have to do with strategic actions we've been taking over a number of years. And they're aligned with trends that have been accelerated by the pandemic, right? So whether that is addressable media, precision in the creative that we deliver, e-commerce, those are all areas where we're strong, and we're definitely seeing growth. Hard to tell you exactly given that we don't know what some of our peers have done and that we clearly believe that we're taking share as well as seeing net new opportunities because we're building new capabilities that take us into kind of new addressable universe. 
And I think last I think for us, as a management team, the strongest indicator is how relevant is an offering when you just benchmark off of the same period in '19 and you think about the 2-year stack from the Q2 '21 results. That's what's telling us competitiveness of a specific part of our space or of IPG all in a sustainable platform where we feel like that's what gives us confidence that we can grow for the balance of the year and obviously beyond that."

You obviously have some great margin improvement this year with the benefit of expenses being cut back and also the bigger picture permanent cost cut you took that you announced earlier on.

So let me -- actually, why don't I just talk to that at a fairly macro level, and then I think we should get Ellen into the conversation as well. But I mean, there were a lot of moving parts in terms of what's going on with our profitability in this calendar year, but it's good to see significant strides on margin performance like on the top line. We're very committed to the savings that we have consistently shared with you all around the restructuring. And so that's permanent annualized $160 million. We're tracking that, and we're holding ourselves and our operating teams accountable to that. Then there's the fact that I think we've got a consistent track record over time that we grow margin with revenue growth, so there's meaningful opportunity there. And so operating leverage, I think, is a lever that stays with us into '22 and beyond. 
And then lastly, as I mentioned in the answer to your revenue question, the higher value services and the new commercial models, I think, are also an opportunity from a margin perspective. And let's see. I mean, Ellen can pull apart all the ins and outs of this year."

I'll start with the actions that we took last year as part of the restructuring, and they were clearly structural and strategic. And that is why we are so confident in them and that we will realize the savings that we've committed to. So if you break them down and you look at the fact that we took out 15% of our real estate portfolio or that we eliminated certain regional or other layers of management to become more agile or that we were able to nearshore or offshore certain roles, that gives us great confidence that those savings are permanent, and they will not come back with revenue growth. 
Turning to some of the more variable expenses. If you look at travel and meetings, they will come back. And initially, they may come back pretty full as there's pent-up demand for people to get back together, to get out and see clients and to see our people for training and development. Do they go back fully to pre-pandemic levels? That remains to be seen. I am hopeful that the learnings from the pandemic with using technology and really thinking carefully about the environment will help us be more efficient and prevent them from fully going back to pre-pandemic levels. 
And then I would just reiterate the fact that what Philippe said is that we've demonstrated over a period of time that with revenue growth, we can expand margins, and we're incentivized to do so. Our incentives are largely based on organic revenue growth and margin improvement, and that makes me pretty optimistic."

And then I think as we've discussed previously, I think a second or a third wave or whatever it is that any country might be experiencing is not going to necessarily be the same as the first because there is a sense that you're still making progress toward an outcome. So you're still either getting people vaccinated or in the case of many of our clients, you've pivoted into and accelerated your ability to operate, whether it's through e-com or other ways in which you're going direct to consumers, you're clearly leaning more heavily into digital as part of your mix and transforming your business. So I think that, that, again, means that we don't necessarily see that the impact will be as significant. 
And then specific to certain markets for us, as we've also said before, client mix can have a pretty significant impact for us on the ground in any given market. So to my mind, TBD as to whether we're getting there on those 2 markets. They're fairly modest in size for us. I think China is probably the 1 we focus on the most as a place where we want to be delivering for our global multinationals. And we're doing some interesting things in that market with Acxiom and some of our relationships with some of the large platforms there and what we can do with data. So it's still work in progress, but I couldn't put a date on that for you."

On the inflation question, I mean, to date, we haven't seen generalized wage inflation, but we're watching it closely. It is something we talk about with our operators. The talent market is competitive, and that's not a new thing. We've been used to that for quite some time. And I think what you are seeing is a little bit of higher attrition, and whether that's because people sat at home for 16 months and now have the ability to move around. So we're watching that closely as well. But we're being very innovative in the way we recruit and retain talent. We're focusing on flexibility; the quality of our return to office experience that we're planning; training and development; and of course, diversity, equity and inclusion, which is something that we've been focused on for a very long time for now.

So clearly, we've been dealing with the pressures of the talent market for the kind of digital and tech talent that has been in demand for a while. 
I think to Ellen's point, some of those turnover numbers feel as if we've yet to see what it normalizes out to because there, it does feel like they were lower in '20. They're picking up now. I think that people were understandably sitting still last year. And now that the world feels like a place where you might get out and about, again, you're looking. And so it's a topic that comes up in our conversations with the operators. We're keeping a close eye on it, looking at how we -- how do we manage it and how do we stay ahead of it to mitigate the impact. We'll keep you posted on kind of what we're seeing, but people come to work across our portfolio because of a range of things that have meant that whether we were competing for talent with start-ups or with large tech companies for the last few years, we've been fairly successful at it. So we got to just keep, to Ellen's point, figuring out how we put what are our advantages to work in those conversations."

Look, I think it's any number of things, which you would assume. So clearly, the need to be conversant in and to put into effect programs so that you are, call it what you will. So people call it e-com and there's a lot going on there. I mean, social is becoming a big part of what happens somewhere in the funnel -- in the middle of the funnel actually and moving upstream in the funnel. So everybody is clearly wanting to talk about and engage in conversations around, call it, digital marketing calling e-com, et cetera. 
Increasingly, everybody is also -- we've had some really interesting conversations with regional clients in the CPG space, for example, you might not think of who are very, very focused on data and on either assessing their first-party data assets and understanding how they get organized so that they can begin to put them to work or if they're further behind in terms of the readiness there. How do you take businesses that traditionally have not been particularly data-rich and begin to sort of interact with consumers so that you're going to basically pull those -- that kind of information in, to the question Alexia asked earlier, in the experiential and events space. We're clearly seeing the need to get more digital and to use that as a way to -- so to my mind, those are the 2 really big questions that have risen to the top of most everybody's list, right? 
And then in terms of the balance sheet question you asked, as I said, we are committed to -- we've returned, what is it, $4.8 billion. We believe that's a big part of our story and how it is that we should be thinking about kind of balanced growth for the company. So we're clearly focused on that."

I think there's pent-up demand for travel, absolutely.

And we want to be sure that, that's getting staffed appropriately and that we've got clients who are giving us these new remits or new -- net new clients to us, getting the appropriate level of service. 
In terms of the philosophical question, it's interesting because I don't know that I would call it philosophy, but as we said, the restructuring positions us well. We've said all along, we want to come out of the pandemic a stronger company. And I think we're showing that we're well on our way there. And then you do begin to see the transformation into certain of the areas, which we think will be accretive because they'll take us to more performance-based kinds of models and to higher value or instances in which our IP can be licensed out or can give us access to. So I think to my mind, it's not philosophy because I can't give you a tenet that says this will be good forever. I can tell you that at the moment, we see continued opportunity and upside. And therefore, whether it's in '22, '23, that's going to be what we're making our objective. To Ellen's point, that's also how we reward our people. And if there comes a point at which we began to believe or see that the ceiling that you mentioned is there, then as always, we're going to be very transparent and walk you collectively through what we're seeing and why what we believe is what we believe. But I can't say something now that is going to be kind of evergreen in that way because our business is in the midst of evolving. And right now, we see opportunity."

As always, I'll start with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter, Ellen will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with updates on key developments at our agencies, to be followed by Q&A.  
I'd like to begin once again by thanking our 53,000 fellow employees around the world for the professionalism and dedication that continue to see us through the many challenges of COVID. These include the transition to work from home and now are planning for a return to office in many parts of the world as well as the significant personal difficulties presented by the long course of the pandemic. 
It's due to the efforts of our people, their commitment to their craft, our clients and to each other that we can share with you today these very strong results, performance that demonstrates our resilience represents a remarkable rebound from the impact of the pandemic and is also the largest second quarter in our company's history.  
Our strong results in the quarter are build on IPG's consistent record of industry outperformance and margin expansion. Our growth across regions, disciplines and client sectors speaks to more than a recovering global economy. It underscored the elevated value that marketing and media partners can deliver, and the integration of creativity, technology and data at scale made the significantly increased velocity of digital transformation. 
At Interpublic, we're confident that we are attuned to the powerful currents that are transforming consumer behavior and are required for business relevance, and that we are increasingly delivering differentiated and higher-end solutions that help our clients win in a world of accelerated technological and societal change. 
That takes creativity and precision, data and accountability, all of which we're able to bring together in customized teams that drive talent from across our portfolio. Ultimately, our growth speaks to our ability to drive outstanding business results for our clients.  
Our net organic revenue growth in the second quarter was 19.8%. That's against the second quarter of 2020 when, as you will recall, our organic change was negative 9.9%, which, while well ahead of our peer group, did mark our steepest decrease of the recession. It's also important to note that our 7.9% organic increase this quarter relative to the pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019. 
Compared to last year, our organic growth was at double-digit rates around the world. In the U.S., it was 17.4%. Growth in our international markets ranged from 14% in the Asia Pacific region to 49% in Latin America. We also had a very broad contribution from our operating segments and disciplines.
Our IAN segment grew 20.5% organically, with increases led by media, data and technology and with solid contributions from our global integrated networks. There was also strength across most of our disciplines led by health care.  
In our DXTRA segment, organic growth was 15.1%, with strong increases from last year's heavily impacted Q2 across Octagon sports and entertainment and Jack Morton's experiential offerings.  
Looking at client sectors, the picture is also one of comprehensive acceleration. Each of our 8 major sectors had double-digit increases from a year ago. The auto, retail and other sectors were up more than 20%. Consumer goods, tech and telecom and health care increased in the mid- to high teens. Food and beverage and financial services were up in the low double-digit range.  
Turning to operating expense and profitability. Our teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline, and while remaining focused on appropriate cost control, we're also continuing to invest to support accelerating growth. We continue to see the benefits of cost improvements from strategic restructuring actions taken last year, notably in our payroll expense and our expense for occupancy.  
We also continue to see the benefits of low variable expenses as a result of the highly restrictive global travel environment and from the cost efficiencies of a largely remote workforce. As we look ahead to post-pandemic work life, it's worth noting that we can, of course, expect that expenses for travel, meetings, office utilities and the like will begin to return in the second half of this year, most notably in Q4 and, of course, into next year.  
Our second quarter net income was $263.3 million as reported. Adjusted EBITDA was $405.8 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue was 17.9%. 
Our results reflect significant operating leverage compared to both last year and the 2019 period on our expense for base payroll and our office and other expenses. We delevered on our expense accrual for our performance-based incentive compensation plans, though our operating performance is tracking well ahead of planned target.  
Diluted earnings per share was $0.66 as reported and was $0.70 as adjusted for the after-tax expense of the amortization required intangibles. 
As we look to the balance of the year, you'll recall that in April, we shared a full year 2021 performance outlook based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery. At that time, we outlined our view towards full year organic growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 15.5%. 
In light of our very strong second quarter and also having recently refreshed our bottom-up outlook for the second half of the year based on conversations with our clients and operating teams, we believe it's appropriate at the midpoint of this quite unusual year, unprecedented, in fact, to upgrade those expectations. Of course, we do sadly need to recognize that the COVID pandemic and the related risk to the macro environment are not yet behind us.  
In particular, as we look ahead, we all understand that lagging vaccination rates in many parts of the world and the emergence of new variants may entail a higher COVID risk. That's something we'll watch closely as we enter the second half of the year, especially our seasonally important fourth quarter. But predicated on the continued progress on public health issues, we believe that we can deliver organic growth for the full year of 9% to 10%, and with that level of growth, we would expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 16%. 
As such, we see this as another year of strong value creation for all of our stakeholders. We'll, of course, keep you apprised of progress as the year develops, and we look forward to those conversations.  
On that note, I'd like to hand over the call to Ellen now for a more in-depth view of our results."

Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation, second quarter net revenue increased 22.5% from a year ago, with organic growth of 19.8%. Adjusted EBITDA before a small restructuring adjustment was $405.8 million, and margin was 17.9%. 
These are levels that compare very favorably against any previous second quarter. With growth having accelerated, certain variable expenses continue to lag, and we are additionally seeing the structural benefits of last year's restructuring program.  
Diluted earnings per share was $0.66 as reported and $0.70 as adjusted for the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles.  
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow.  
Turning to second quarter revenue on Slide 4. Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.27 billion, an increase of $416.2 million from a year ago. Compared to Q2 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 3.1%, with the U.S. dollar weaker against currencies in most of our largest markets. 
Net divestitures were negative 40 basis points. Our organic net revenue increase was 19.8%, which brings us to 10.6% organic growth for the 6 months. 
At the bottom of this slide, we break out segment revenue in the quarter. Our IAN segment grew 20.5% organically. We had notably strong growth across our offerings in media, data and tech, McCann, FCB with health care a significant driver, MullenLowe, Huge and R/GA. 
At IPG DXTRA, organic growth was 15.1%, which reflects some recovery of the events and sports marketing offerings within the segment, the disciplines that have been most significantly impacted by the pandemic. Our public relations offering also had solid growth in the quarter.  
Moving on to Slide 5, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region. In the U.S., which was 63% of net revenue in the quarter, organic growth was 17.4%. Revenue decreased a year ago in the same period by 8%. Year-on-year performance was very strong across media, data and tech, FCB driven by health care, IPG DXTRA, McCann, MullenLowe and Huge. 
International markets were 37% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 24.4% organically. You'll recall that the same market decreased 13.1% a year ago in the second quarter, which ranged by region between 10 -- negative 10% and negative 15%.  
Continental Europe grew 27.9%, with notably strong growth in Germany, Spain and France. There were a number of operating highlights in the region led by media, data and tech, McCann, R/GA and DXTRA. The U.K. increased 18.7% organically led by McCann, DXTRA, media, data and tech and R/GA.  
Asia Pac grew 14% organically. Our organic growth was paced by Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and India, while China and Japan decreased.  
Our organic growth in LatAm was 49%, with exceptional results across the region, including Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.  
Our Other Markets group grew 29.2%, with notably strong performance in the Middle East and Canada.  
Moving on to Slide 6 on operating expenses in the quarter. Our operating expenses, excluding billable expenses, the amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring charges, increased only 11% from a year ago under 22.5% growth of net revenue. The result was second quarter margin expansion to 17.9% from 9.4% a year ago. 
We continue to see efficiencies in a number of different expense categories as we had it in this year's first quarter, and these were both structural and variable. In the structural category, we are seeing the benefit of the strategic restructuring actions, which we initiated in the second quarter of last year and continue to execute over the second half. As a reminder, these actions involve the elimination of certain positions and resulting headcount reductions that will not return with revenue growth.
We also reduced our real estate footprint by 15% last year. We are currently seeing the benefit of most of these actions. And at a full run rate, they will generate $160 million in annual cost savings. 
We've also had, over the course of the pandemic, a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses. I would call out specifically lower travel and related expenses, which was the case in the second quarter of 2020 and has continued through Q2 2021.  
As you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue was 65.4%, which has significantly improved from the second quarter of 2020 when revenue had decreased sharply. 
Underneath that, we drove very strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which was 53% of net revenue in the quarter. That reflects the benefit of last year's restructuring and the fact that the pace of new hiring lags our significant revenue growth, as has been the case in past business cycles. 
Our severance expense ratio also decreased sharply to only 40 basis points of net revenue compared to 3% in Q2 2020, which was at an elevated level due to the impact of the recession. 
Going the other way, our expense for performance-based incentive compensation increased to 6.4%, consistent with our very strong operating results. Expense for temporary labor also increased as a percent of net revenue to 4.5% as a result of servicing the top line's quick acceleration. At quarter end, total worldwide headcount was approximately 53,000, a 1.4% increase from a year ago and up 5.2% from the beginning of this year, with hiring to support our growth.  
Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue by 380 basis points to 13.3%. Our occupancy expense decreased to 5% of net revenue mainly due to the restructuring of our real estate as well as leverage on our revenue growth. 
We leverage all other office and other direct expense by 220 basis points, which reflects lower expense for bad debt and acquisition costs and leverage as a result of our revenue growth. 
Our SG&A expense was 1.3% of net revenue, with the increase from a year ago due to the higher unallocated performance-based incentive expense and increased employee insurance expense, which was at a very low level a year ago.  
On Slide 7, we present detail on adjustments to our reported second quarter results in order to provide greater clarity and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left-hand side with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS. 
Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.6 million. The restructuring refinement in the quarter was a benefit of $200,000. To be clear, this is a small adjustment to estimate of the 2020 restructuring program.  
Below operating expenses in column 4, we had a pretax loss in the quarter of $1.7 million in other expenses due to the disposition of small nonstrategic businesses. At the foot of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of these adjustments was $0.04 per share, which bridges our diluted EPS as reported at $0.66 to adjusted earnings of $0.70 per diluted share. 
The appendix to our presentation includes a similar blue bridge on our diluted EPS for the 6-month period.  
On Slide 8, we turn to cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operations was $468.2 million compared with the use of $87.1 million a year ago. We generated $101.6 million from working capital compared to a use of $264.9 million last year. Investing activities was $43.3 million in the quarter mainly for CapEx of $34 million. Financing activities used $101.8 million mainly for our dividend. Our net increase in cash for the quarter was $325.6 million.  
Slide 9 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.34 billion of cash and equivalents. Under current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refers to our $500 million 3.75% senior note, which matures in October of this year. We plan to repay these notes from cash on hand.  
Slide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt. Again, we have the maturity in October of this year and then only $250 million due in April 2024. Thereafter, our next maturity is not until 2028.  
In summary, on Slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment. I would like to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity mean that we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially.  
And with that, I'll turn it back to Philippe."

While we remain very pleased with our results, it's worth reiterating, as Ellen just said, that this is an unusual, in fact, unprecedented environment in which we're operating. 
Now importantly, it bears noting that when compared to our non-pandemic results in 2019, Q2 results show our company is performing at a very high level. We continue to feel this is the result of strategic decisions that we've taken over a number of years to position our company for the future, investments and actions that have created a sustainable advantage for our organization. 
Today's IPG delivers addressable and accountable digital marketing programs. Combined with our world-class creative storytelling capabilities, these solutions make us higher-value partners to our clients.  
One of our many priorities over the years has been the creation and implementation of Open Architecture solutions, where we bring the best of IPG together in collaborative teams that are customized to client-specific business needs and, increasingly, a key element of this approach. 
Open Architecture 2.0, as it were, is Acxiom whose data management expertise and data assets play a role in an increasingly broad range of our offerings. In addition, Kinesso powers many of our applications and services that provide clients with a deep understanding of audiences in order to provide insights that inform creative work, segments for media delivery and line of sight to the effectiveness of the work that we are doing together. 
We saw this model come to life in the quarter with a Cigna account win, which combined talent from McCann Worldgroup, Initiative and R/GA powered by Kinesso and Acxiom. This is a continuation of several years of strong performance in integrated pitches, especially those that include creative and media as well as media and data.  
Another key decision that's contributed to our success has been our continued investment in strong agency brands, which helps us attract and retain top talent and deliver breakthrough creative ideas across a range of marketing disciplines. 
As a result of this strategy, IPG companies across our portfolio earned a number of important accolades during the quarter. Most notably, we had an impressive showing at the 2021 Cannes International Festival of Creativity. IPG agencies took home 8 Grand Prix, the festival's highest honor. Wins across the network represented a broad range of clients, categories, agencies, disciplines and geographies. 
FCB's performance was a standout as the agency took home 4 Grand Prix and was named Global Network of the Year. The agency's creative community and its leadership deserve credit for this terrific accomplishment.  
FCB Health was also named Healthcare Network of the Year, and Area 23, an FCB Health Agency, was named Healthcare Agency of the Year. 
McCann client Microsoft was named Marketer of the Year at this festival, which is another major honor, and the agency also won a Grand Prix in brand experience and activation for its remarkable True Name work for Mastercard, which empowers transgender and nonbinary cardholders to use their true name when using their credit card.  
In PR, McCann Paris earned a Grand Prix, partnering with Weber Shandwick, for a campaign that ran across the Middle East, which teaches women in a culturally sensitive way to perform self-checks for early breast cancer detection. 
FCB Chicago and Weber Shandwick teamed to earn a Grand Prix for work for AB InBev. And R/GA continues to be recognized for its ability to humanize technology, winning a Grand Prix in social and influencer marketing for disruptive work it did for Reddit on the Super Bowl.  
On Adage's annual A-List and Creativity Awards, both Deutsche LA and the Martin Agency were named to the prestigious A-List. Initiative was named Media Agency of the Year, and FCB Health's CEO was recognized as our industry's Executive of the Year.  
At the holding company level, we made a number of announcements that position us for further success. Chief among them was our launch of IPG Health earlier this month. The move will align our top-performing companies, FCB Health and McCann Health, under a new global network. IPG Health, led by a dynamic and proven CEO and a skilled executive leadership team. 
In this new operating structure, the distinct agency brands within FCB Health and McCann Health will remain active and continue to go to market independently, but they will also benefit from access to additional specialty services, knowledge sharing, proactive career management, shared investment in new capabilities and skill sets, highly complementary geographic coverage as well as an even higher level of collaboration.  
Around the world, health care and well-being are areas of growing importance for our clients and society at large. As an industry sector, health care represents an increasingly vital part of the economy and one where innovation is becoming an ever more important driver of success. 
So the alignment of IPG's fully dedicated health care networks under the banner of IPG Health strengthens our leadership position in this dynamic sector. The scale, reach, and, most importantly, quality of our people and our work makes for an exciting combination, and it's why we think this new offering will continue to deliver great things in the years to come.  
This month, we also added to our strong roster of marketing technology and e-commerce providers with the launch of Performance Art, a data-led creative CRM agency, whose leadership team is known for delivering platform-level creative ideas that are at home in a client's e-retail flow as they are in a 30-second spot.  
Turning to performance at our agencies. Growth at IAN in the quarter was once again highlighted by media, data and tech and FCB led by health care. UM saw significant wins in the quarter with enterprise holdings; Behr Paint; and most recently, NYC & Company, New York City's official marketing and tourism organization. 
UM also saw an important account retention for the Australian government. At the Campaign Agency of the Year Awards, UM earned a Global Media Agency of the Year honors, and UM APAC was named Best Media Network in that region. 
At Initiative, the agency was named 2020's Most Competitive Network Globally in Media Pitches and saw a major win in the U.K. with banking and insurance company, NatWest Group. We also continue to see terrific momentum at Reprise, especially as it relates to their growing e-commerce capabilities.  
Acxiom, Kinesso and Matterkind are also performing well, and they're key to how we help clients thrive in the addressable media market, which requires flexibility given the quickly shifting landscape. 
At Acxiom, we continue to invest behind innovative new products and services, such as customer data platforms and identity resolution, with which we are seeing increased client adoption. Another important development saw Acxiom deploy their latest customer intelligence platform on the cloud with a key financial services client.  
At our creative integrated networks, FCB, McCann and MullenLowe Group were named to ACT Responsible 2020 Good Report, a unique ranking of the world's best use of creative communications to promote sustainability and social responsibility. 
On top of its exceptional showing at Cannes, at FCB Global, the network continues to invest in talent and new offerings, hiring ahead of data science and connections to expand its expertise in commerce, data and technology fueled creativity. 
McCann also continues to prove a creative powerhouse, as we saw, when the network was recently named Webby Network of the Year, and McCann New York was named Webby Agency of the Year. 
MRM continues to leverage its martech expertise and is seeing strong growth with its MRM Commerce division, which help marketers drive engagement, interaction and conversion on commerce platforms. 
At MullenLowe Group, Mediahub continues its strong new business momentum, and during the quarter, added Hallmark's parent company, Crown Media, as well as Tally Financial. MullenLowe is also a global leader in purpose-driven work, and we saw that as it continued to partner with governments in a number of countries around the world to inform people the benefits of being vaccinated against COVID-19.  
At R/GA, Campaign named the London office as the U.K.'s Digital Agency of the Year. And R/GA London added 2 new clients, financial services company Allianz; and Vollebak Clothing. 
We named a new CEO at Huge, who joins the digital agency after a very successful tenure at Initiative, where he helped turn the agency into a leader in the media space. During the quarter, Huge also saw strong new business activity, adding Sub-Zero Appliances, Wakefern, Tezos Foundation and Nikko Asset Management. 
The Martin Agency continues to impact culture and drive strong business results for its clients. Notably, the agency's Soul Of The City short film for DoorDash premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival last month and had captured the resilience of New York City's restaurants and the role they play in the cities alike.  
At IPG DXTRA, we also saw recognition as a number of companies were called out for their ability to deliver creative solutions. Weber Shandwick was the most awarded PR agency at Cannes this year. Current global demonstrated their commitment to closing the disability and inclusion gap by creating guidelines and toolkits for marketers, so as to make content more accessible for consumers with sight, hearing or other cognitive impairments, and this program was recognized as one of Fast Company's world-changing ideas for 2021. 
Jack Morton launched what they are referring to as the Return to Live Dashboard, and that's a tool for brand marketers to access where, when and how businesses in the U.S. can safely get back to hosting live experiences. 
Golin continued its strong performance in new business, was selected as LinkedIn's Global Social Media Agency of Record and also Agency of Record for Yamaha Music. Golin was also named PRWeek's Global Agency of the Year.
And at Octagon, the Sports & Entertainment Network won Best in Talent Representation at the 2021 Sports Business Awards. 
Pivoting now back to the holding company, another key area that bears mention is our long-term focus on ESG, including diversity, equity and inclusion. As a leader in marketing services, and a citizen of the communities where our employees live, work and vote, we welcome the responsibility to operate sustainably and contribute to the healthier society and planning. 
In all of our operations and activities, we're working to build on and more fully live into this commitment, and this includes reassessing how we hire, train and promote a diverse workforce, incorporate rigorous practices around data ethics and media responsibility as well as reduce our greenhouse gas emissions further around the world. Key accomplishments on this front include IPG being recently named by Forbes to their Top 10 List of America's Best Employers for Diversity. 
During the quarter, we also created a new position, our industry's first Culture Officer, to focus on long-term thought leadership relating to a broad range of social justice issues for underserved and underrepresented communities. 
During the quarter, as part of our integrated ESG efforts, we also announced an action plan that consists of 3 climate roles: committing to set a science-based target; sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2030; and joining The Climate Pledge, co-founded by Amazon in Global Optimism. 
In addition, we've published our first SASB report, becoming the first company in the advertising and marketing sector to publish an alignment with SASB's industry standards. 
Our agencies also contribute significantly to our ESG profile. And importantly, here in the U.S., we saw media brands take a leading role in the industry conversation about promoting greater media equity, and they announced that they're committing to invest at least 5% of client budgets in Black-owned media by 2023. 
Octagon launched an accelerator program with historically Black colleges and universities for students interested in sports and entertainment as a career. And R/GA created an innovative program to raise money for environmental organizations through a dedicated YouTube channel that plays nature videos, which have become hugely popular during the pandemic, and it direct all of the ad revenues generated on this channel to environmental NGOs. 
Now as we sit here at the halfway mark of 2021, the success we've seen is thanks to the talent, efforts and commitment of our people, and we continue to be highly focused on supporting their physical and mental well-being as we plan return to office. Like many of us, I look forward to working live with colleagues and clients, especially given that we're an ideas driven service business. Our culture, our capacity for innovation and the ways in which we combine creativity with technology and data are all enhanced by in-person interactions. 
Now here in the U.S., we expect to have more people returning to our offices in a flexible hybrid model beginning in mid-September, as is already the case in certain other parts of the world. We will, of course, be mindful of the public health situation and of the learnings we've accumulated during the past 16 months when it comes to flexible work practices. 
The expected cost associated with live collaboration with colleagues as well as travel will begin to return as a normal part of how we work and, therefore, be reflected in our operating results. For example, as we look forward to the remainder of the year, we expect an increase in travel cost in the fourth quarter, which could return to levels consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
As we said earlier, these are unprecedented times. None of us had previously been required to adapt to the constraints of living and working through a pandemic. And likewise, none of us has experience in emerging for one. Thankfully, as a company, we are well positioned to do so. 
Earlier on the call, we shared our perspective on the balance of the year based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of macro recovery, that people continue to become vaccinated to protect themselves and their communities and that we're able to adequately mitigate the impact of dangerous new variants. 
We've delivered a very strong first half of the year on top of the most challenging comps in our industry. Further, despite continued macro uncertainty, we have greater clarity to the balance of 2021. We therefore believe that current performance, combined with the continued execution of our long-term strategy, are significant drivers for the sustained enhancement of value for all of our stakeholders. 
As always, we're committed to sound financial fundamentals, including debt reduction as well as continuing to grow our dividend. We also remain focused on getting back to our share repurchase program, and we will keep you apprised of our progress as the year develops. 
As always, we want to thank our clients and our people, who are ultimately the 2 key pillars of our success. I'd also like to thank you all for your time this morning. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over for questions."

And so if I were to track the progression for you, what I'd say to you is if you think back to what we talked about the last time we were all together, from February to April, we clearly saw improvement in the broader economic environment, but also in the tone of what, I guess I'd call, client sentiment, right? 
And so as we went through the quarter, that trend was clearly continuing to build over the course of the second quarter, right? And so as we think about it, is it a question of surprise? I mean, I think we said to you, we felt confident in our offerings, specifically in ways we can help clients to stand apart and to succeed in a digital-first kind of economy. 
So now that growth is available, we're obviously pleased to see that we're capitalizing on the environment. So you start breaking down the results, and what do you see? You see, whether it's geographies or practice areas, content creation, creativity, data and tech, it was very, very widely spread. 
And so Matterkind addressable media growing, a very, very strong grower for us. Health care continued to be an area where we're seeing really, really good results. And then perhaps if you're bracketing it, having decreased by north of 30%, in light of the pandemic, we clearly have experiential and advance know, showing a real recovery, they're not all the way back, right? 
Month-to-month in the quarter, we saw consistency, so that's something where, in terms of projecting forward to, we see that as encouraging. And then as we forecast for the back half of the year, we also see that consistency and that ratable. 
There isn't a moment in time where we're expecting there to be something dramatic to get us to what we've communicated to you, which is that 9% to 10% number, right? And the one big caveat is one that applies for all of us around the world, which is just there's a significant deterioration on the public health front. 
And you really get at something because what I think we're seeing is we're seeing the overall environment stronger, but we're also seeing underlying factors that have to do with strategic actions we've been taking over a number of years, and they're aligned with trends that have been accelerated by the pandemic, right? 
So whether that is addressable media, precision in the creative that we deliver, e-commerce, those are all areas where we're strong, and we're definitely seeing growth. Hard to tell you exactly given that we don't know what some of our peers have done, and that we clearly believe that we're taking share as well as seeing net new opportunities because we're building new capabilities to take us into kind of new addressable universe. 
And I think last, I think, for us as a management team, the strongest indicator is how relevant is an offering when you just benchmark off of the same period in '19 and you think about the 2-year stack from the Q2 '21 results. That's what's telling us, competitiveness of a specific part of our space or of IPG all in, a sustainable platform where we feel like that's what gives us confidence that we can grow for the balance of the year and obviously beyond that."

You obviously have some great margin improvement this year with the benefit of expenses being cut back and also the bigger picture permanent cost cut you took that you announced earlier on. 
When you think about margins longer term, though, I'm not sure if you could still achieve margin improvement in 2020 given the comps, but is there still the plan to continue to improve margins longer term post this year?"

So let me -- actually, why don't I just talk to that at a fairly macro level, and then I think we should get Ellen into the conversation as well. 
But I mean, there were a lot of moving parts in terms of what's going on with our profitability in this calendar year, but it's good to see significant strides on margin performance like on the top line. We're very committed to the savings that we have consistently shared with you all around the restructuring, and so that's permanent annualized $160 million. We're tracking that, and we're holding ourselves and our operating teams accountable to that. 
Then there's the fact that I think we've got a consistent track record over time that we grow margin with revenue growth, so there's meaningful opportunity there. And so operating leverage, I think, is a lever that stays with us into '22 and beyond. 
And then lastly, as I mentioned in the answer to your revenue question, the higher value services and the new commercial models, I think, are also an opportunity from a margin perspective. 
And let's see. I mean, Ellen can pull apart all the ins and outs of this year."

I'll start with the actions that we took last year as part of the restructuring, and they were clearly structural and strategic, and that is why we are so confident in them and that we will realize the savings that we've committed to. 
So if you break them down and you look at the fact that we took out 15% of our real estate portfolio or that we eliminated certain regional or other layers of management to become more agile or that we were able to nearshore or offshore certain roles, that gives us great confidence that those savings are permanent, and they will not come back with revenue growth. 
Turning to some of the more variable expenses. If you look at travel and meetings, they will come back. And initially, they may come back pretty full, as there's pent-up demand for people to get back together, to get out and see clients and to see our people for training and development. 
Do they go back fully to pre-pandemic levels? That remains to be seen. I am hopeful that the learnings from the pandemic, with using technology and really thinking carefully about the environment, will help us be more efficient and prevent them from fully going back to pre-pandemic levels. 
And then I would just reiterate the fact that what Philippe said is that we've demonstrated over a period of time that with revenue growth, we can expand margins, and we're incentivized to do so. Our incentives are largely based on organic revenue growth and margin improvement, and that makes me pretty optimistic."

And then I think as we've discussed previously, I think a second or a third wave or whatever it is that any country might be experiencing is not going to necessarily be the same as the first because there is a sense that you're still making progress toward an outcome. 
So you're still either getting people vaccinated or, in the case of many of our clients, you've pivoted into and accelerated your ability to operate, whether it's through e-com or other ways in which you're going direct to consumers, you're clearly leaning more heavily into digital as part of your mix and transforming your business. So I think that, that, again, means that we don't necessarily see that the impact will be as significant. 
And then specific to certain markets, for us, as we've also said before, client mix can have a pretty significant impact for us on the ground in any given market. So to my mind, TBD as to whether we're getting there on those 2 markets. They're fairly modest in size for us. 
I think China is probably the one we focus on the most as a place where we want to be delivering for our global multinationals. And we're doing some interesting things in that market with Acxiom and some of our relationships with some of the large platforms there and what we can do with data.

On the inflation question, I mean, to date, we haven't seen generalized wage inflation, but we're watching it closely. It is something we talk about with our operators. The talent market is competitive, and that's not a new thing. We've been used to that for quite some time. And I think what you are seeing is a little bit of higher attrition, and whether that's because people sat at home for 16 months and now have the ability to move around, so we're watching that closely as well.

I think to Ellen's point, some of those turnover numbers feel as if we've yet to see what it normalizes out to because there -- it does feel like they were lower in '20. They're picking up now. I think that people were understandably sitting still last year. And now that the world feels like a place where you might get out and about, again, you're looking. 
And so it's a topic that comes up in our conversations with the operators. We're keeping a close eye on it, looking at how we -- how do we manage it and how do we stay ahead of it to mitigate the impact. 
We'll keep you posted on kind of what we're seeing, but people come to work across our portfolio because of a range of things that have meant that whether we were competing for talent with start-ups or with large tech companies for the last few years, we've been fairly successful at it. So we got to just keep, to Ellen's point, figuring out how we put what are our advantages to work in those conversations."

So what has changed in the conversation, maybe the speed, to innovate and transform? And then more broadly, given how well you're doing and given the balance sheet, what is the company waiting for in terms of buybacks? It seems like you guys have clearly gone over the hurdles of COVID-19 in terms of performance. Your balance sheet is pristine. Why not start leaning into the buyback sooner than later?"

So clearly, the need to be conversant in and to put into effect programs, so that you are -- call it what you will, so people call it e-com and there's a lot going on there. I mean, social is becoming a big part of what happens somewhere in the funnel -- in the middle of the funnel actually and moving upstream in the funnel. 
So everybody is clearly wanting to talk about and engage in conversations around, call it, digital marketing, calling e-com, et cetera. Increasingly, everybody is also -- we've had some really interesting conversations with regional clients in the CPG space, for example, of you might not think of who are very, very focused on data and on either assessing their first-party data assets and understanding how they get organized, so that they can begin to put them to work or if they're further behind in terms of the readiness there, how do you take businesses that traditionally have not been particularly data-rich and begin to sort of interact with consumers so that you're going to basically pull those -- that kind of information in, to the question Alexia asked earlier, in the experiential and events space. 
We're clearly seeing the need to get more digital and to use that as a way to -- so to my mind, those are the 2 really big questions that have risen to the top of most everybody's list, right? 
And then in terms of the balance sheet question you asked, as I said, we are committed to -- we've returned, what is it, $4.8 billion. We believe that's a big part of our story and how it is that we should be thinking about kind of balanced growth for the company. So we're clearly focused on that."

There was zero travel. There was zero going back to the office. I think it's important that we remind ourselves that. And as we mentioned, we are envisioning a second half where people are returning back to the office to the extent we can in a safe manner, where people are beginning to travel and meet again. 
And we will be accelerating wage cuts, and that is all gone and elapsed, and we will be hiring against revenue growth. So I think those are the ins and outs that it's very important when you just look at the second half comp."

I think there's pent-up demand for travel, absolutely, so I think that you'll see people wanting to -- there's definitely things that get done when we are working physically together that are much harder to do remotely. 
And then there is growth. And we want to be sure that, that's getting staffed appropriately and that we've got clients who are giving us these new remits or new -- net new clients to us, getting the appropriate level of service. 
In terms of the philosophical question, it's interesting because I don't know that I would call it philosophy. But as we said, the restructuring positions us well. We've said all along, we want to come out of the pandemic a stronger company, and I think we're showing that we're well on our way there. 
And then you do begin to see the transformation into certain of the areas, which we think will be accretive because they'll take us to more performance-based kinds of models and to higher value or instances in which our IP can be licensed out or can give us access to. 
So I think to my mind, it's not philosophy because I can't give you a tenet that says this will be good forever. I can tell you that at the moment, we see continued opportunity and upside. And therefore, whether it's in '22, '23, that's going to be what we're making our objective. To Ellen's point, that's also how we reward our people. 
And if there comes a point at which we began to believe or see that the ceiling that you mentioned is there, then, as always, we're going to be very transparent and walk you collectively through what we're seeing and why what we believe is what we believe. 
But I can't say something now that is going to be kind of evergreen in that way because our business is in the midst of evolving. And right now, we see opportunity."

As usual, I'll start with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter, Ellen will then provide additional details. I'll conclude with updates on key developments at our agencies, and then we'll follow that with Q&A. 
We're pleased to share our very strong third quarter performance. But before turning to the numbers, I'd like to begin by recognizing and thanking our people across all of Interpublic, who have continued to show a high level of dedication and support to our clients and to one another. They are the principal reason we can report such strong results again this quarter. 
Our people are delivering insight and execution required for the complex integration of creativity, technology and data at scale that marketers across industry sectors need in order to accelerate their business transformation journeys. This kind of work is helping set a standard for our industry and further build on IPG's record of industry outperformance and margin expansion. 
As we've moved through September and now into October,  it's also been rewarding to begin welcoming our people back to office settings and to see many of our teams together again in the places where creativity, collaboration and culture are ultimately rooted and regularly renewed. 
Turning to our results in the quarter. Our net organic revenue growth in the third quarter was 15%. That's against the third quarter of 2020 when, as you'll recall, our organic change was negative 3.7% due to the impact of the pandemic. It's also important to note that our 2-year organic increase was 10.7% relative to the third quarter of 2019, which is a strong result. 
Compared to 2020,  our growth in the quarter was again broad-based by region of the world, discipline as well as client sector. Organic growth was 14.7% in the U.S., and it ranged between 11% and 20% in our international regions. Both of our operating segments also grew at double-digit rates. Our IAN segment increased 14.4% organically, with all major agencies contributing high single to double-digit percentage increases. We were led by media, data and technology, R/GA and Huge as well as by Mullen Lowe, McCann and FCB, highlighted by notable contributions from their health care and advertising disciplines. In our DXTRA segment, organic growth was 18.6% and reflecting double-digit increases across each of our DXTRA agencies and furthering the rebound from the sharp impact of the pandemic last year on our sports and entertainment as well as experiential businesses. 
Looking at client sectors, the picture is also one of balanced growth, with nearly every 1 of our 8 major client sectors, increasing at a double-digit percentage rate, led by the auto sector, our other sector with government and industrials and the tech and telecom, retail and health care sectors. 
Turning to profitability and expenses. Our results again demonstrate outstanding focus and execution by our operating teams, even as we continue to invest to support areas of accelerating growth and to enhance our offerings. Third quarter net income was $239.9 million as reported. Our adjusted EBITA was $369.5 million our margin of adjusted EBITA before restructuring was 16.3% compared with 16.2% a year ago and 14.7% in the third quarter of 2019. 
There were several factors worth noting within those comparisons. We had solid operating leverage on our expenses for base payroll as we continue to see the structural benefits of the strategic cost actions taken last year. Those are reflected in our base payroll as well as our occupancy expense. To date, our very strong top line growth is also outpacing the associated hiring. And therefore, our expense for temporary labor increased from a year ago. Our travel and related expenses continue to track at low levels, but still were somewhat higher than last year. 
As we look ahead, T&E expense will pick up over the remainder of the year. Our expense accrual for employee performance-based incentive compensation, however, increased as a percentage of net revenue which is a direct result of our strong operating performance. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.60 as reported and was $0.63 as adjusted for the after-tax expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. In sum, our quarter as well as our year-to-date speak to strong financial performance across the key metrics of growth, EBITA and earnings per share. Our growth reflects the cyclical economic recovery as well as the important structural currents that favor the kinds of higher order expertise with which we're well resourced. 
The work we're doing solves for the increasingly complex world faced by our clients in a marketing and media environment that's defined by a very rapid rate of change. This is a validation of our long-term strategic focus on building offerings that help clients integrate brand experience across all consumer touch points, improve their capacity to apply data in the way their business goes to market and capitalize on the benefits of technology and digital channels. Going back a number of years, we've anticipated transformational opportunities of this type of environment. Other important drivers of our continued success, our ability to deliver fully integrated solutions through our open architecture model and our emphasis on strong agency brands and best industry talent so as to deliver breakthrough creative ideas and content. 
We've also fostered a culture that respects to the individual, is transparent with respect to clients and is accountable when it comes to data privacy and media responsibility. 
Turning to our outlook with our seasonally important fourth quarter still ahead, we're pleased to increase our financial performance objectives. We now expect that we can deliver organic growth for the year of approximately 11%, which is ahead of the 9% to 10% range we had previously indicated. With growth at that higher level, and given our strong results through the 9 months, we would therefore expect to achieve adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 16.8%, which is an increase of 80 basis points over the level that we had previously shared with you. 
Our outlook is based on expectations of a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery. We began the fourth quarter well positioned with strong operating momentum. And the tone of the business remains solid as we head into the year-end and holiday season. As such, we see 2021 as another year of strong value creation for all of our stakeholders. And on that note, I'll now hand over the call to Ellen for a more in-depth view of our results."

Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation. Third quarter net revenue increased 15.7% from a year ago, with organic growth of 15%. Adjusted EBITA before a small restructuring adjustment was $369.5 million and margin was 16.3%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.60 as reported and $0.63 as adjusted for the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles, a small restructuring adjustment and a net gain from the disposition of nonstrategic businesses. 
On October 1,  following the conclusion of the third quarter, we repaid our $500 million, 3.75% senior notes from cash on hand, further deleveraging our balance sheet. 
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Turning to the third quarter revenue on Slide 4. Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.26 billion, an increase of $307.1 million from a year ago. Compared to Q3 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 1.1% with the U.S. dollar weaker than a year ago in all world regions with the exception of LatAm. Net divestitures were negative 40 basis points. Our net organic revenue increase was 15%, which brings us to 12% organic growth for the 9 months. 
At the bottom of this slide, we break out segment revenue in the quarter. Our EM segment grew 14.4% organically. We had notably strong growth across our offerings in media, data and tech, R/GA, Huge, McCann Worldgroup, FCB driven by Health and the MullenLowe Group. At IPG DXTRA, organic growth was 18.6%, which reflects double-digit growth across public relations, experiential, sports and entertainment and branding disciplines. 
Moving on to Slide 5, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region. In the U.S., which was 65% of our net revenue in the quarter, organic growth was 14.7%. The organic revenue decrease a year ago was 2.4%. Year-on-year performance was notably strong across both our EN and DXTRA segments and at almost all of our agencies led by Media, data and tech, FCB, MullenLowe, McCann, Weber and Jack Morton. International markets were 35% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 15.4% organically. You'll recall that the same markets decreased 6% a year ago. The U.K. increased 13.3% organically led by our offerings in media, data and tech, DXTRA, McCann and R/GA. Continental Europe grew 11.8%. Among our largest national markets, we had notably strong growth in Germany, Spain, Italy and France. There were a number of operating highlights in the region, led by media, data and tech, DXTRA and R/GA. Asia Pac increased 17.4% organically, led by growth across most national markets, notably Australia, Singapore, India, the Philippines, China and Japan. Our iconic organic growth in LatAm was 20.3%, with exceptional results in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Chile. 
Our other markets group, which consists of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, grew 17.1% organically led by notably strong performance in Canada. Moving on to Slide 6 and operating expenses in the quarter. Our fully adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.3% and compared with 16.2% a year ago and 14.7% in the third quarter of 2019. We continue to see efficiencies in a number of different expense categories as we had in this year's first half, and these were both structural and variable. In the structural category, we are seeing the benefit of the strategic restructuring actions, which we initiated in the second quarter last year and continue to execute over the back half of 2020. As we've called out previously, we also had a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses from pre-COVID levels. I would call out specifically travel and related expenses, which while increased from the third quarter a year ago, were still well below their level in 2019. As you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue was 66.8% compared with 65% in last year's third quarter. The increase was due to higher expenses in 2 categories: our accrual for performance-based incentive compensation was 5.8% of net revenue; and our expense for temporary labor, which was 5% of net revenue in the quarter. 
We had strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which was 53.9% and of third quarter net revenue, which reflects the benefit of our restructuring actions and the fact that the pace of hiring lags our strong revenue growth, which has been the case in past economic expansions. At quarter end, total worldwide headcount was approximately 54,600, an 8% increase from a year ago. We have added net 4,500 people year-to-date to support our growth. Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percent of net revenue by 250 basis points to 13.3%. That reflects lower occupancy expense mainly due to the restructuring of our real estate. The ratio was 5% of net revenue. We also reduced all other office and other direct expense by 120 basis points compared to last year. which reflects lower expense for bad debt and leverage as a result of our growth. Our SG&A expense was 1.4% of net revenue with the increase from a year ago due to higher unallocated performance-based incentive expense and increased employee insurance, which was at a very low level last year. 
On Slide 7, we present detail on adjustments to our reported third quarter results in order to provide greater clarity and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left-hand side of the page, with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS. Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.5 million. 
The restructuring refinement in the quarter was a benefit of $3.5 million. To be clear, this is an adjustment to estimates of the 2020 restructuring program. Below operating expenses in column 4, we had a gain due to the disposition of certain nonstrategic businesses, which was $1.7 million in the quarter. As to further the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of these adjustments was $0.03 per share, which bridges our diluted EPS as reported at $0.60 to adjusted earnings of $0.63 per diluted share. The appendix to our presentation includes a similar bridge for diluted EPS for the 9-month period. 
On Slide 8, we turn to cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operations was $390.2 million compared to $689.3 million a year ago. We generated $79.6 million from working capital compared to $376.8 million last year, which was an unusually strong seasonal result. Investing activities used $72 million in the quarter, mainly for CapEx, $61.3 million. Financing activities used $153.3 million, mainly for our dividend. Our net increase in cash for the quarter was $152.5 million. 
Slide 9 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Under current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refers to our $500 million, 3.75% senior notes, which have matured since the balance sheet date, and we repaid with cash on hand. 
Slide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt. Again, this includes the October 1 maturity. Our next maturity is $250 million due April 2024. And following that, there's nothing until 2028. In summary, on Slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment. I would like to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity mean that we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially. And with that, I'll turn it back to Philippe."
108616,1684541272,2408794,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen. The combination of our exceptionally talented people and a balanced portfolio of offerings and capabilities continues to set a standard for growth in our industry. The strategic steps we've taken over the long term have positioned IPG as",2034,"Thank you, Ellen. The combination of our exceptionally talented people and a balanced portfolio of offerings and capabilities continues to set a standard for growth in our industry. The strategic steps we've taken over the long term have positioned IPG as a high-value business partner to our clients. We're able to combine the power of creativity and narrative storytelling with the benefits of data and technology in order to deliver growth for marketers across a broad range of sectors. These strategic steps are evident in our strong results and position us well going forward. By helping clients to better understand audiences and to engage with them with greater precision and accountability, we can help companies succeed the digital economy. 
Today, marketers are responsible for increasing business innovation, building new content platforms and e-commerce platforms as well as adopting emerging tech and leveraging data, all while complying with an evolving data privacy landscape. Our clients are also at the forefront of addressing societal issues and corporate purpose on behalf of their companies and brands. As a partner, we're helping them solve for all of these challenges with our ability to deliver complex integrations focused on business results and outcomes. Our ability to help marketers proactively address these issues is further assisted by our intentional focus on ESG priorities as core business imperatives. That's why we've been focused in working on ESG for many years at IPG. We continue to build on a strong industry record in DEI initiatives, which are integral to nurturing the highest quality and most representative perspectives, insights and creative voices across our company. 
More recently, we've launched our first formal human rights policy and our work with clients around social issues includes campaigns focused on LGBTQ+ rights, mental health awareness, ways in which we can remove implicit bias from core data sets and also use data to increase the health of our planet as well as sustainable consumption models. 
With respect to climate, we're now measuring our total greenhouse gas emissions around the world. We're committed to setting a science-based target and to reaching net zero carbon across our business by 2040. We've also agreed to source 100% renewable electricity by 2030 for our entire portfolio. 
Now turning to the highlights of performance from across that portfolio during the quarter, a key sector that continues to show strength for us is health care. As you know, IPG has significant operations in health care marketing, totaling approximately 1/4 of our total revenue. 
This includes specialized global health care networks as well as significant health care activity and client relationships at our media and public relations operations and within some of our U.S. independents. As health and wellness continue to be a top concern for people, companies and governments around the world, we've seen an increased need for sound health care information to be delivered at speed in ways that are highly personal, culturally relevant as well as respectful of privacy regulations. 
Within the health care sector as well as across other client sectors, our ability to deliver open architecture solutions will continue to drive success for our company. We have deep experience providing customized integrated client service models to many of our largest client partners. And we continue to perform well in winning new business on this sort of work, especially in pitches that leverage the IPG data stack as a key part of the strategy. 
This past quarter, for example, Morgan Stanley and ETRADE named Mediahub as Media Agency of record, following a highly competitive review. Data strategy was a key component of the brief. For this reason, our customer intelligence company, Acxiom was placed front and center in our winning proposal. The Mediahub team is leading media strategy, planning and activation in the U.S., leveraging Acxiom's consumer data and expertise to fuel tightly targeted and effective communication solutions. 
In Media brands, we continue to see a high degree of engagement with many of the world's most sophisticated marketers across our 2 largest brands, UM and Initiative. During the quarter, initiative U.S. won Adweek's prestigious Media Agency of the Year honor for 2021. 
Last year at this time, within Media brands, we launched Reprise Commerce, the global specialty e-commerce offering. And since then, e-commerce revenue within that unit has increased significantly as we've helped clients build out holistic approaches to e-commerce, including e-retail, supply chain and warehousing, marketplaces and direct-to-consumer programs. There's never been a more important time to connect the e-commerce opportunity with the full power of clients' media and marketing investments. 
In addition, we can create and deploy consistent cross-channel experiences that dynamically adapt to consumer needs and goals in real time, thanks to our outstanding creative and content capabilities. This expertise is a key part of the news last week, that the owner of Arthur's Original Candies, Stork USA, had selected UM as its media agency of record. UM takes on all strategy, planning, buying and analytics duties including the implementation of Stork's shopper commerce activity. 
Our data and technology offerings continue to be key drivers of performance for us as well, featuring an all-major open architecture and new business activity of significant scale. This month marks the third anniversary of Acxiom becoming part of IPG. 
During the third quarter, Acxiom continued to post strong performance and to win in the marketplace, bringing in major new clients from the media, retail and financial services sector. Most recently, a top 10 financial services company engaged Acxiom to build their unified enterprise data layer, which again shows the strength and depth of Acxiom's technology expertise. 
During Q3, Kinesso launched what we're calling the Kinesso Intelligence Identity product, also called that KII, and this is a new identity solution that works across the Open Web as well as the walled gardens and is already live with clients across a broad range of verticals. Along with IPG Media brands, the Trade Desk, among the first media partners using KII. And the launch comes at a particularly important moment as brands and agencies work to create and bolster privacy-first identity solutions that can assure addressability as third-party cookies and mobile ad IDs begin to be phased out. KII can match a brand's first-party CRM data and map it to key identifiers, significantly increasing match rates and reducing the need for third-party onboarders. When it comes to the strength of our brands and the creative advertising space, McCann, FCB and MullenLowe continue to distinguish themselves this quarter. McCann Worldgroup was named Global Network of the Year at the 2021 Guaranty Award, which recognizes the best creative communications from the female perspective. Also notable McCann Worldgroup named a new President and Global Chief Creative Officer, who joins us from Nike, where he served in senior brand marketing and creative leadership roles for more than 20 years, most recently leading Nike's men's brands globally. During his tenure at Nike, he was responsible for many of the world's best-known and most iconic campaigns across a range of marketing disciplines and channels. 
At FCB, the agency's Chicago office was ranked as the top creative agency in North America in the Lion's creativity report. In that same report, FCB was ranked among the top networks in the world. And FCB was also named North American Agency of the Year at the 2021 New York Festival Awards. 
MullenLowe was named the second most effective agency at the recent USF awards, and MullenLowe Group was named the #2 most effective network globally. In both cases, punching well above its weight against larger competitors. During the quarter, the agency won the T.J. Maxx creative account. And just this week, Mediahub won 3 Adweek Media Plan of the Year awards as well as seeing its U.K. office win global media duties for Farfetch, which is a luxury fashion e-commerce brand. R/GA launched what they are calling a direct to Avatar capability, and that's going to create virtual stories for brands within metaverse platforms. And that really takes out new territory in direct-to-consumer sales. On the growth front, R/GA added projects for digital forward partners like Tunnel, Slack, CVS and Roku. 
Huge also launched a new commerce offering, which caused the experienced stack of the future. And that's a tool that consolidates various elements of SaaS into an integrated growth solution for brands. I think we're also going to see the agency's newly appointed CEO, further his plans to infuse data into Huge's core offerings. 
IPG's DXTRA growth in the quarter was broad-based and it benefited from the return of live events. Jack Morton won new client assignments with Amazon and Twitch and along with Octagon sports and entertainment was listed among event marketers ranking of the top 100 event agencies of 2021. Audio social media app, Clubhouse, added Golin as its global agency lead agency. Weber was named the Supplier of the Year by GM; and security software company, McAfee, also named Weber Shandwick, its global agency of record to help redefine the firm as a consumer brand. 
Lastly, Weber launched a media security center in partnership with Blackbird AI to address emerging information for us. And this is an offering that's built to offer solutions to what business leaders say is a really leading reputational issue, which is the spread of misinformation and disinformation. During the quarter, we also saw continued positive momentum at our U.S. independent agencies. The Martin Agency won Hasbro's NERF brand of products. Carmichael Lynch was named Strategy and creative lead for H&R Block, where he'll take on responsibility for strategy, creative and social media as well as public relations; and Deutsch LA added Energy Drink brand A Shock to its roster. 
All in, we're in a positive position from a net new business standpoint for the year, and our new business pipeline continues to be active. As is typical at this time,  we don't have full visibility on project work as we head into the fourth quarter, which will include the crucial holiday shopping season. Now in line with the growth we're seeing across much of the portfolio,  our companies are adding staff with the requisite contemporary skill sets as well as expertise. So hiring is yet to fully keep pace with a very strong growth we've seen to date this year. We've begun seeing travel restrictions lifted in certain key markets as infection rates decline. And we fully continue to use technology and practices developed during the pandemic to reduce travel and other carbon-intensive parts of our business wherein as appropriate, but we believe that some of what we could call standard cost of doing business will return in Q4 and in a larger measure in 2022. 
Earlier on the call, we shared with you our perspective on the full year and our updated expectation that will deliver approximately 11% organic growth and adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 16.8% for the full year 2021. That view is predicated, as we indicated, on the assumption that they'll continue to be or reasonably steady course of macro recovery. And we're very proud to have delivered a very strong 9 months thus far this year on top of the most challenging comps in the industry. 
Current performance combined with the continued execution of our long-term strategy, should continue to be significant drivers for sustained value creation for all of our stakeholders. We're committed to sound financial fundamentals as well as continuing to grow our dividend as we've consistently done, including through the pandemic and returning to our share repurchase program also remains a priority, as we turn our focus on planning for the upcoming year. We'll, of course, keep you updated on our progress on that front. 
We're confident as well that the investments in talent and capabilities we continue to make position IPG well for the future. As Ellen said, this is an unprecedented time, but we have a highly relevant and differentiated set of offerings underpinned by a sound financial foundation and a strong balance sheet. 
As always, we want to thank our clients and our people. Those are the key pillars of our success. And we want to thank you as well for your time this morning. So now let's open the call for your questions."

And obviously, the revenue growth has been sort of industry leading for a while. I guess my question really is -- when you look at the overall growth that you've been seeing as a company, how much of this sort of outperformance do you think is due to the fact that you have leaned into areas and made investments in like Acxiom, which clearly the examples you gave, made a difference in terms of winning incremental business. Or how much do you think, again, sort of high level, is this you're just positioned very well for the recovery given your exposure to health care and such."

Look, I think it's obviously difficult to tell you for fact what is behind some of the performance that our competitors are posting. And I also don't know that I would separate health care given that there was a moment in time when it was not the scale business that it is for us. And then a lot of what drives success in that business is analogous to what we've been doing across the portfolio, which is to say, can you help clients with a broader range of problems, can you give them more accountability and more clarity around when they're making investments or when they're putting a message out into the marketplace, who it is that you're trying to reach and how precisely it is that you're trying to impact that potential consumer or that audience. So I think it's hard for me to pull it apart or to break it out for you. 
I mean I think it's fair to say that we do consistently call out for you that whether it's media, data and technology, whether it is the health care space, our digital agencies -- those are all clearly areas of strength for us and drivers of that multiyear now, if you look at the compounded change, we're clearly feeling like we are leaning into where there's demand and where there's opportunity in the space. The other thing that I think makes it difficult to answer the question is that we think of it as an integrated whole. And so obviously, you can make the case to a client and you can prove the case to a client far more effectively if you've got a solution that encompasses as much of the ecosystem as possible so that you're able to help them at every level in the funnel at every level in the process, whether you're using that data to come up with the insights that will then inform the messaging or the plans that inform the distribution of that message or then picking up on those signals pulling them back in and having them continue to sort of feed that loop. So I think to our mind, clearly, the performance is indicative of the fact that some of the decisions we've made going back now strategically were the right ones, but it's still very much work in progress. And to my mind, there's a lot of opportunity ahead. 
But I think we could do better in both pulling that together and continuing to demonstrate that it works. But I can't tell you -- I can only tell you that in our world, that's what we're seeing get traction."

It's probably challenging to tell you, again, given how much upheaval there's been both last year and this year, when or at what that level, that will be established. But that's clearly the aspiration of whether it's by doing what we've done, which is to build out these incremental capabilities to combine them in a way where you've got the marketing services component and then the data and technology component, which inform one another. 
And then ultimately, as you also know, we're thinking that this approach should open new revenue streams and new commercial models to us, which, again, we believe, would go to the point that you're asking. So that's definitely where we're looking to get to."

But I think it's really important to look at the fact that we have been able to expand our margins as well as we have to date, and we believe that we have long-term margin expansion capability. 
I mean I go back to 2019 pre-pandemic. And if you look at our margin then, it was about 14%. Last year, we -- it was our intention to emerge a stronger company. As everyone knows, we did a restructuring and committed to $160 million of savings or about 180, 190 basis points of 2019 revenue. We're seeing that savings, which makes us feel really good. Also, I'd point to, and we've had a consistent algorithm of being able to convert revenue growth to profitability. And we expect that will continue.  As you point out this year, and as I mentioned in my remarks, hiring is lagging revenue growth, and that's not unusual in a period of time like this, but also our temp help as a result is running high. And because of our very strong performance and targets that we set in the very beginning of the year, incentive comp is also running at very high levels, which will reset at the end of this year and the beginning of next year. So despite whether or not we have a difficult in the short term in '22, we fully believe we have more room to expand our margins going forward in the long term."

Well, look, I mean, I think that the kinds of questions and issues that need to be solved if you're running a business today and you are looking to achieve whatever your goals are imply that you're looking for partners that can help you address kind of a range of things that are sort of digital economy related. So whether that is your own business transformation, whether that is your data strategy at the enterprise level and then ultimately, how you're going to take increasingly your own first-party data and put it to use so that you are either, I think, increasingly being more effective with your investments, but also more efficient. And then lastly, how you show up and how you go kind of direct to the consumer, and therefore, e-commerce very, very broadly construed, right, because I think that so much of what's happening now in e-comm is happening in -- on owned platforms and channels that companies and marketers own. It's clearly going to be happening in areas that go sort of from the ad tech world, where we've generally or largely been focused as an industry for a number of years to more tech. But it will -- whether it's in the app world in the gaming world, et cetera. So I think that  it's both a fairly broad playing field. You've got some maybe smaller entities with deep specialization in some of those areas. It's interesting from where we sit because we think it creates a broader kind of addressable marketplace. And if you look at our immediate competitive set, I mean, I think they're clearly looking at and thinking about sitting where they are and with the portfolio they have, how do they approach these things. 
In terms of kind of the bigger or the broader competitive set. You see some activity, but I think the headlines are ahead of the reality there. And then I think you need to figure out ways to partner up, particularly kind of in the data in the tech world because I think that as everything changes there, there's going to need to be universal identifiers. There's going to need to be kind of ways to privacy-compliant way, engage with consumers and help again clients go to market. And so that will clearly imply being able to work with the folks who are solving for that, whether it's from a measurement point of view or  from an activation point of view. So I don't know that I'm seeing anything that we think is unexpected. 
I think probably, if anything, the pandemic has probably moved us forward faster along this track.  But it's a direction or an avenue that we were heading down anyway."

So I think that, that was clearly an important area of focus. 
I think that you then heard from us, and we have leaned into ensuring that the connectivity there with media, which was the most obvious adjacency in the place where we've been building, whether it was our own stack, pre-Acxiom, with Acxiom is a foundational piece of it or whether it was the activation piece Cadreon, which is now matter kind addressable across all channels. 
But now we're definitely seeing Acxiom pretty consistently across the board. We are focused on what we can do there in the health care space, we think there's a lot of opportunity there. We definitely have it baked into, as we've called out, anything that involves a scale opportunity that is complex or multi-agency with a client.  A lot of -- anything that's a top 20 IPG client. 
I think if anything, the thing that's been holding us back is likely that during the pandemic, virtual has, I think, been a bit of a break on not specific or only in this space, but I think that innovation internally is harder to do when people are not together. And so it's definitely the case that I think that whatever the next generation product wise is or the ways in which we can be even tighter and quicker on the integration is a place that I think we'll be focused on, but I think it will unlock in large part because our teams are going to be able to be together. We had a product road map off-site with the Acxiom Kinesso leadership for 1.5 days, and that was much more productive. So it was about 1.5 months ago than we would have been otherwise. So I think all in, plenty to do and still lots of upside. But I think that we're pleased with where we are on that."

As far as inflation, we're not seeing materially higher broad-based inflation in our numbers to date, but we're seeing what everyone else is seeing. The talent market clearly has become more competitive and attrition is higher post the pandemic. We went through a period of time or no 1 left. So you're seeing, I think, a 2-year attrition rate this year. And as a result, specifically because we're growing so fast, our hiring has not kept up. So what we're focused on is really innovating our recruitment techniques. We're doing all kinds of different things on that front, including count referral bonuses, looking for different places for our workforce, including bringing working moms, maybe back into the workforce. We're also trying to create opportunities for our people by creating promotion opportunities. 
And it's not all about the compensation, although we do pay people competitively, it's also really about the quality of the work environment that you provide, training and development, your values that you stand for as a company, including DE&I and ESG. So we're really focused on all of those things. One other thing I would point out is that our company, typically, or our industry benefits from higher level of economic activity. So that could actually turn out to be a positive from a revenue perspective. And I think it's also important to note that we are investing in some of these more innovative ways of solving higher order client -- problems for our clients. So whether it's digital transformation or getting, as Philippe said, direct-to-consumer e-commerce, we think all those things will do well in this environment as well."

If you look at Omnicom guidance, their guidance lead them to go from minus 2% to minus 5%, a 3-point slowdown. And Publicis guidance leads them to go from plus 5% to plus 2%, a 3-point slowdown, again, all against 2019. So you, 8-point slowdown, Omnicom and Publicis, 3 points slowdown.

I think it's an interesting question, but I think that -- we don't look at the year on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I would ask that you then let me give us some broader context in answering it, right? I think that the variability that we see in the business on a quarter-to-quarter basis reflects the fact that client activity has to do with their needs and their competitive situation and then also with the macro. And so we've always framed up our expectations and we managed the business in terms of the full year, right? So if I look at the full year, with organic growth, as we've said, in the range of 11%, on top of what are definitely the most challenging comps in the sector, that's a very strong result. 
And if I look at a 2-year compound stack, if that 11% comes in, that still has us at just under 6% when without us in the mix, the industry is probably flat. I think if you get under that quarterly number and you think about the fluctuations, I think the point that you raise feels to me like it's about timing from where I sit, right? And so Q4 last year, timing clearly favors Q4, whether that's as obscured somewhat by the recessionary environment that we were navigating at that point. So you had pullbacks early in the pandemic, then our clients get their bearings. They figure out how to go virtual, they lean into a lot of what we've been talking about digital e-com. And so there's pent-up demand that clearly benefited Q4 from where we were sitting. We saw it in digital media spend, very strong spend in the retail category. There was a lot of COVID-related government communications work, which thankfully is going to hopefully be a little less necessary now. And this year, we've seen this marked acceleration in Q2 and Q3.  And I think that reflects, at the macro level, the progress that's been made broadly on public health and the fact that economic activity is up, but also the acceleration of the digital behaviors, which IPG has been anticipating for many years with strategic actions. And so those 2 quarters have been very, very strong. 
And so going into Q4, I'd say to you that what we're seeing is tone of the business is solid. We're net new business positive. But Delta has definitely created some uncertainty at the macro level. The pent-up demand that was a plus in Q4 isn't necessarily there. And so that's where, as I said to you, we look at the year, we feel very comfortable with the year. We look at the 2-year stack. We think that is very strong as well. And so to my mind, I don't see it as you -- I don't read it the way that you do. I think that when you then -- when we have a discussion about what '22 looks like, then we have -- then we have the question that you put out there."

As usual, I'll start with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter, Ellen will then provide additional details. I'll conclude with updates on key developments at our agencies, and then we'll follow that with Q&A.  
We're pleased to share our very strong third quarter performance. But before turning to the numbers, I'd like to begin by recognizing and thanking our people across all of Interpublic, who have continued to show a high level of dedication and support to our clients and to one another. They are the principal reason we can report such strong results again this quarter.  
Our people are delivering insight and execution required for the complex integration of creativity, technology and data at scale that marketers across industry sectors need in order to accelerate their business transformation journeys. This kind of work is helping set a standard for our industry and further build on IPG's record of industry outperformance and margin expansion.  
As we've moved through September and now into October, it's also been rewarding to begin welcoming our people back to office settings and to see many of our teams together again in the places where creativity, collaboration and culture are ultimately rooted and regularly renewed.  
Turning to our results in the quarter. Our net organic revenue growth in the third quarter was 15%. That's against the third quarter of 2020 when, as you'll recall, our organic change was negative 3.7% due to the impact of the pandemic. It's also important to note that our 2-year organic increase was 10.7% relative to the third quarter of 2019, which is a strong result.  
Compared to 2020, our growth in the quarter was again broad-based by region of the world, discipline as well as client sector. Organic growth was 14.7% in the U.S., and it ranged between 11% and 20% in our international regions. Both of our operating segments also grew at double-digit rates. Our IAN segment increased 14.4% organically, with all major agencies contributing high single to double-digit percentage increases. We were led by media, data and technology, R/GA and Huge as well as by MullenLowe, McCann and FCB, highlighted by notable contributions from their health care and advertising disciplines. In our DXTRA segment, organic growth was 18.6% reflecting double-digit increases across each of our DXTRA agencies and furthering the rebound from the sharp impact of the pandemic last year on our sports and entertainment as well as experiential businesses. 
Looking at client sectors, the picture is also one of balanced growth, with nearly every 1 of our 8 major client sectors, increasing at a double-digit percentage rate, led by the auto sector, our other sector with government and industrials and the tech and telecom, retail and health care sectors.  
Turning to profitability and expenses. Our results again demonstrate outstanding focus and execution by our operating teams, even as we continue to invest to support areas of accelerating growth and to enhance our offerings. Third quarter net income was $239.9 million as reported. Our adjusted EBITA was $369.5 million our margin of adjusted EBITA before restructuring was 16.3% compared with 16.2% a year ago and 14.7% in the third quarter of 2019.  
There were several factors worth noting within those comparisons. We had solid operating leverage on our expenses for base payroll as we continue to see the structural benefits of the strategic cost actions taken last year. Those are reflected in our base payroll as well as our occupancy expense. To date, our very strong top line growth is also outpacing the associated hiring. And therefore, our expense for temporary labor increased from a year ago. Our travel and related expenses continue to track at low levels, but still were somewhat higher than last year.  
As we look ahead, T&E expense will pick up over the remainder of the year. Our expense accrual for employee performance-based incentive compensation, however, increased as a percentage of net revenue which is a direct result of our strong operating performance. 
Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.60 as reported and was $0.63 as adjusted for the after-tax expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. 
In sum, our quarter as well as our year-to-date speak to strong financial performance across the key metrics of growth, EBITA and earnings per share. Our growth reflects the cyclical economic recovery as well as the important structural currents that favor the kinds of higher order expertise with which we're well resourced.  
The work we're doing solves for the increasingly complex world faced by our clients in a marketing and media environment that's defined by a very rapid rate of change. This is a validation of our long-term strategic focus on building offerings that help clients integrate brand experience across all consumer touch points, improve their capacity to apply data in the way their business goes to market and capitalize on the benefits of technology and digital channels. 
Going back a number of years, we've anticipated transformational opportunities of this type of environment. Other important drivers of our continued success, our ability to deliver fully integrated solutions through our open architecture model and our emphasis on strong agency brands and best industry talent so as to deliver breakthrough creative ideas and content.  
We've also fostered a culture that respects the individual, is transparent with respect to clients and is accountable when it comes to data privacy and media responsibility.  
Turning to our outlook with our seasonally important fourth quarter still ahead, we're pleased to increase our financial performance objectives. We now expect that we can deliver organic growth for the year of approximately 11%, which is ahead of the 9% to 10% range we had previously indicated. With growth at that higher level, and given our strong results through the 9 months, we would therefore expect to achieve adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 16.8%, which is an increase of 80 basis points over the level that we had previously shared with you.  
Our outlook is based on expectations of a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery. We began the fourth quarter well positioned with strong operating momentum. And the tone of the business remains solid as we head into the year-end and holiday season. As such, we see 2021 as another year of strong value creation for all of our stakeholders. And on that note, I'll now hand over the call to Ellen for a more in-depth view of our results."

Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation. Third quarter net revenue increased 15.7% from a year ago, with organic growth of 15%. Adjusted EBITA before a small restructuring adjustment was $369.5 million and margin was 16.3%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.60 as reported and $0.63 as adjusted for the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles, a small restructuring adjustment and a net gain from the disposition of nonstrategic businesses.  
On October 1, following the conclusion of the third quarter, we repaid our $500 million, 3.75% senior notes from cash on hand, further deleveraging our balance sheet.  
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. Turning to the third quarter revenue on Slide 4. Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.26 billion, an increase of $307.1 million from a year ago. Compared to Q3 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 1.1% with the U.S. dollar weaker than a year ago in all world regions with the exception of LatAm. Net divestitures were negative 40 basis points. Our net organic revenue increase was 15%, which brings us to 12% organic growth for the 9 months.  
At the bottom of this slide, we break out segment revenue in the quarter. Our IAN segment grew 14.4% organically. We had notably strong growth across our offerings in media, data and tech, R/GA, Huge, McCann Worldgroup, FCB driven by Health and the MullenLowe Group. At IPG DXTRA, organic growth was 18.6%, which reflects double-digit growth across public relations, experiential, sports and entertainment and branding disciplines.  
Moving on to Slide 5, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region. In the U.S., which was 65% of our net revenue in the quarter, organic growth was 14.7%. The organic revenue decrease a year ago was 2.4%. Year-on-year performance was notably strong across both our IAN and DXTRA segments and at almost all of our agencies led by media, data and tech, FCB, MullenLowe, McCann, Weber and Jack Morton. 
International markets were 35% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 15.4% organically. You'll recall that the same markets decreased 6% a year ago. 
The U.K. increased 13.3% organically led by our offerings in media, data and tech, DXTRA, McCann and R/GA. Continental Europe grew 11.8%. Among our largest national markets, we had notably strong growth in Germany, Spain, Italy and France. There were a number of operating highlights in the region, led by media, data and tech, DXTRA and R/GA. 
Asia Pac increased 17.4% organically, led by growth across most national markets, notably Australia, Singapore, India, the Philippines, China and Japan. Our organic growth in LatAm was 20.3%, with exceptional results in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Chile.  
Our other markets group, which consists of Canada, the Middle East and Africa, grew 17.1% organically led by notably strong performance in Canada. 
Moving on to Slide 6 and operating expenses in the quarter. Our fully adjusted EBITA margin was 16.3% and compared with 16.2% a year ago and 14.7% in the third quarter of 2019. We continue to see efficiencies in a number of different expense categories as we had in this year's first half, and these were both structural and variable. In the structural category, we are seeing the benefit of the strategic restructuring actions, which we initiated in the second quarter last year and continue to execute over the back half of 2020. 
As we've called out previously, we also had a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses from pre-COVID levels. I would call out specifically travel and related expenses, which while increased from the third quarter a year ago, were still well below their level in 2019. As you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue was 66.8% compared with 65% in last year's third quarter. The increase was due to higher expenses in 2 categories: our accrual for performance-based incentive compensation was 5.8% of net revenue; and our expense for temporary labor, which was 5% of net revenue in the quarter.  
We had strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which was 53.9% of third quarter net revenue, which reflects the benefit of our restructuring actions and the fact that the pace of hiring lags our strong revenue growth, which has been the case in past economic expansions. At quarter end, total worldwide headcount was approximately 54,600, an 8% increase from a year ago. We have added net 4,500 people year-to-date to support our growth. 
Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percent of net revenue by 250 basis points to 13.3%. That reflects lower occupancy expense mainly due to the restructuring of our real estate. The ratio was 5% of net revenue. We also reduced all other office and other direct expense by 120 basis points compared to last year, which reflects lower expense for bad debt and leverage as a result of our growth. 
Our SG&A expense was 1.4% of net revenue with the increase from a year ago due to higher unallocated performance-based incentive expense and increased employee insurance, which was at a very low level last year.  
On Slide 7, we present detail on adjustments to our reported third quarter results in order to provide greater clarity and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left-hand side of the page, with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITA and our adjusted diluted EPS. Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.5 million.  
The restructuring refinement in the quarter was a benefit of $3.5 million. To be clear, this is an adjustment to estimates of the 2020 restructuring program. Below operating expenses in column 4, we had a gain due to the disposition of certain nonstrategic businesses, which was $1.7 million in the quarter. As to further the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of these adjustments was $0.03 per share, which bridges our diluted EPS as reported at $0.60 to adjusted earnings of $0.63 per diluted share. The appendix to our presentation includes a similar bridge for diluted EPS for the 9-month period.  
On Slide 8, we turn to cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operations was $390.2 million compared to $689.3 million a year ago. We generated $79.6 million from working capital compared to $376.8 million last year, which was an unusually strong seasonal result. Investing activities used $72 million in the quarter, mainly for CapEx, $61.3 million. Financing activities used $153.3 million, mainly for our dividend.  Our net increase in cash for the quarter was $152.5 million.  
Slide 9 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Under current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refers to our $500 million, 3.75% senior notes, which have matured since the balance sheet date, and we repaid with cash on hand.  
Slide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt. Again, this includes the October 1 maturity. Our next maturity is $250 million due April 2024. And following that, there's nothing until 2028. 
In summary, on Slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment. I would like to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity mean that we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially. And with that, I'll turn it back to Philippe."
108616,1684541272,2408917,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen. The combination of our exceptionally talented people and a balanced portfolio of offerings and capabilities continues to set a standard for growth in our industry. The strategic steps we've taken over the long term have positioned IPG as",2035,"Thank you, Ellen. The combination of our exceptionally talented people and a balanced portfolio of offerings and capabilities continues to set a standard for growth in our industry. The strategic steps we've taken over the long term have positioned IPG as a high-value business partner to our clients. We're able to combine the power of creativity and narrative storytelling with the benefits of data and technology in order to deliver growth for marketers across a broad range of sectors. These strategic steps are evident in our strong results and position us well going forward. By helping clients to better understand audiences and to engage with them with greater precision and accountability, we can help companies succeed the digital economy.  
Today, marketers are responsible for increasing business innovation, building new content platforms and e-commerce platforms as well as adopting emerging tech and leveraging data, all while complying with an evolving data privacy landscape. Our clients are also at the forefront of addressing societal issues and corporate purpose on behalf of their companies and brands. 
As a partner, we're helping them solve for all of these challenges with our ability to deliver complex integrations focused on business results and outcomes. Our ability to help marketers proactively address these issues is further assisted by our intentional focus on ESG priorities as core business imperatives. That's why we've been focused in working on ESG for many years at IPG. We continue to build on a strong industry record in DEI initiatives, which are integral to nurturing the highest quality and most representative perspectives, insights and creative voices across our company.  
More recently, we've launched our first formal human rights policy and our work with clients around social issues includes campaigns focused on LGBTQ+ rights, mental health awareness, ways in which we can remove implicit bias from core data sets and also use data to increase the health of our planet as well as sustainable consumption models.  
With respect to climate, we're now measuring our total greenhouse gas emissions around the world. We're committed to setting a science-based target and to reaching net zero carbon across our business by 2040. We've also agreed to source 100% renewable electricity by 2030 for our entire portfolio.  
Now turning to the highlights of performance from across that portfolio during the quarter, a key sector that continues to show strength for us is health care. As you know, IPG has significant operations in health care marketing, totaling approximately 1/4 of our total revenue.  
This includes specialized global health care networks as well as significant health care activity and client relationships at our media and public relations operations and within some of our U.S. independents. As health and wellness continue to be a top concern for people, companies and governments around the world, we've seen an increased need for sound health care information to be delivered at speed in ways that are highly personal, culturally relevant as well as respectful of privacy regulations.  
Within the health care sector as well as across other client sectors, our ability to deliver open architecture solutions will continue to drive success for our company. We have deep experience providing customized integrated client service models to many of our largest client partners. And we continue to perform well in winning new business on this sort of work, especially in pitches that leverage the IPG data stack as a key part of the strategy.  
This past quarter, for example, Morgan Stanley and ETRADE named Mediahub as Media Agency of record, following a highly competitive review. Data strategy was a key component of the brief. For this reason, our customer intelligence company, Acxiom was placed front and center in our winning proposal. The Mediahub team is leading media strategy, planning and activation in the U.S., leveraging Acxiom's consumer data and expertise to fuel tightly targeted and effective communication solutions. 
In Media brands, we continue to see a high degree of engagement with many of the world's most sophisticated marketers across our 2 largest brands, UM and Initiative. During the quarter, Initiative U.S. won Adweek's prestigious Media Agency of the Year honor for 2021. 
Last year at this time, within Media brands, we launched Reprise Commerce, the global specialty e-commerce offering. And since then, e-commerce revenue within that unit has increased significantly as we've helped clients build out holistic approaches to e-commerce, including e-retail, supply chain and warehousing, marketplaces and direct-to-consumer programs. There's never been a more important time to connect the e-commerce opportunity with the full power of clients' media and marketing investments. 
In addition, we can create and deploy consistent cross-channel experiences that dynamically adapt to consumer needs and goals in real time, thanks to our outstanding creative and content capabilities. This expertise is a key part of the news last week, that the owner of Werther's Original Candies, Storck USA, had selected UM as its media agency of record. UM takes on all strategy, planning, buying and analytics duties including the implementation of Storck's shopper commerce activity. 
Our data and technology offerings continue to be key drivers of performance for us as well, featuring an all-major open architecture and new business activity of significant scale. This month marks the third anniversary of Acxiom becoming part of IPG. 
During the third quarter, Acxiom continued to post strong performance and to win in the marketplace, bringing in major new clients from the media, retail and financial services sector. Most recently, a top 10 financial services company engaged Acxiom to build their unified enterprise data layer, which again shows the strength and depth of Acxiom's technology expertise. 
During Q3, Kinesso launched what we're calling the Kinesso Intelligence Identity product, also called that KII, and this is a new identity solution that works across the Open Web as well as the walled gardens and is already live with clients across a broad range of verticals. Along with IPG Media brands, The Trade Desk, among the first media partners using KII. And the launch comes at a particularly important moment as brands and agencies work to create and bolster privacy-first identity solutions that can assure addressability as third-party cookies and mobile ad IDs begin to be phased out. 
KII can match a brand's first-party CRM data and map it to key identifiers, significantly increasing match rates and reducing the need for third-party onboarders. When it comes to the strength of our brands and the creative advertising space, McCann, FCB and MullenLowe continue to distinguish themselves this quarter. McCann Worldgroup was named Global Network of the Year at the 2021 Gerety Awards, which recognizes the best creative communications from the female perspective. Also notable McCann Worldgroup named a new President and Global Chief Creative Officer, who joins us from Nike, where he served in senior brand marketing and creative leadership roles for more than 20 years, most recently leading Nike's men's brands globally. During his tenure at Nike, he was responsible for many of the world's best-known and most iconic campaigns across a range of marketing disciplines and channels. 
At FCB, the agency's Chicago office was ranked as the top creative agency in North America in the Lion's creativity report. In that same report, FCB was ranked among the top networks in the world. And FCB was also named North American Agency of the Year at the 2021 New York Festival Awards. 
MullenLowe was named the second most effective agency at the recent US Effie awards, and MullenLowe Group was named the #2 most effective network globally. In both cases, punching well above its weight against larger competitors. During the quarter, the agency won the T.J. Maxx creative account. And just this week, Mediahub won 3 Adweek Media Plan of the Year awards as well as seeing its U.K. office win global media duties for Farfetch, which is a luxury fashion e-commerce brand. 
R/GA launched what they are calling a direct to Avatar capability, and that's going to create virtual stories for brands within metaverse platforms. And that really stakes out new territory in direct-to-consumer sales. On the growth front, R/GA added projects for digital forward partners like Tunnel, Slack, CVS and Roku. 
Huge also launched a new commerce offering, which caused the experienced stack of the future. And that's a tool that consolidates various elements of SaaS into an integrated growth solution for brands. I think we're also going to see the agency's newly appointed CEO, further his plans to infuse data into Huge's core offerings. 
IPG's DXTRA growth in the quarter was broad-based and it benefited from the return of live events. Jack Morton won new client assignments with Amazon and Twitch and along with Octagon Sports and Entertainment was listed among event marketers ranking of the top 100 event agencies of 2021. Audio social media app, Clubhouse, added Golin as its global agency lead agency. Weber was named the Supplier of the Year by GM; and security software company, McAfee, also named Weber Shandwick, its global agency of record to help redefine the firm as a consumer brand. 
Lastly, Weber launched a media security center in partnership with Blackbird AI to address emerging information for us. And this is an offering that's built to offer solutions to what business leaders say is a really leading reputational issue, which is the spread of misinformation and disinformation. During the quarter, we also saw continued positive momentum at our U.S. independent agencies. The Martin Agency won Hasbro's NERF brand of products. Carmichael Lynch was named Strategy and creative lead for H&R Block, where he'll take on responsibility for strategy, creative and social media as well as public relations; and Deutsch LA added Energy Drink brand A SHOC to its roster. 
All in, we're in a positive position from a net new business standpoint for the year, and our new business pipeline continues to be active. As is typical at this time, we don't have full visibility on project work as we head into the fourth quarter, which will include the crucial holiday shopping season. Now in line with the growth we're seeing across much of the portfolio, our companies are adding staff with the requisite contemporary skill sets as well as expertise. 
So hiring is yet to fully keep pace with a very strong growth we've seen to date this year. We've begun seeing travel restrictions lifted in certain key markets as infection rates decline. And we fully continue to use technology and practices developed during the pandemic to reduce travel and other carbon-intensive parts of our business wherein as appropriate, but we believe that some of what we could call standard cost of doing business will return in Q4 and in a larger measure in 2022. 
Earlier on the call, we shared with you our perspective on the full year and our updated expectation that will deliver approximately 11% organic growth and adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 16.8% for the full year 2021. That view is predicated, as we indicated, on the assumption that they'll continue to be or reasonably steady course of macro recovery. And we're very proud to have delivered a very strong 9 months thus far this year on top of the most challenging comps in the industry. 
Current performance combined with the continued execution of our long-term strategy, should continue to be significant drivers for sustained value creation for all of our stakeholders. We're committed to sound financial fundamentals as well as continuing to grow our dividend as we've consistently done, including through the pandemic and returning to our share repurchase program also remains a priority, as we turn our focus on planning for the upcoming year. We'll, of course, keep you updated on our progress on that front. 
We're confident as well that the investments in talent and capabilities we continue to make position IPG well for the future. As Ellen said, this is an unprecedented time, but we have a highly relevant and differentiated set of offerings underpinned by a sound financial foundation and a strong balance sheet. 
As always, we want to thank our clients and our people. Those are the key pillars of our success. And we want to thank you as well for your time this morning. So now let's open the call for your questions."

And obviously, the revenue growth has been sort of industry leading for a while. I guess my question really is -- when you look at the overall growth that you've been seeing as a company, how much of this sort of outperformance do you think is due to the fact that you have leaned into areas and made investments in like Acxiom, which clearly the examples you gave, made a difference in terms of winning incremental business. Or how much do you think, again, sort of high level, is this you're just positioned very well for the recovery given your exposure to health care and such."
108616,1684541272,2408917,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","No worries. Alexia. Look, I think it's obviously difficult to tell you for fact what is behind some of the performance that our competitors are posting.

Look, I think it's obviously difficult to tell you for fact what is behind some of the performance that our competitors are posting. And I also don't know that I would separate health care given that there was a moment in time when it was not the scale business that it is for us. And then a lot of what drives success in that business is analogous to what we've been doing across the portfolio, which is to say, can you help clients with a broader range of problems, can you give them more accountability and more clarity around when they're making investments or when they're putting a message out into the marketplace, who it is that you're trying to reach and how precisely it is that you're trying to impact that potential consumer or that audience? 
So I think it's hard for me to pull it apart or to break it out for you. I mean I think it's fair to say that we do consistently call out for you that whether it's media, data and technology, whether it is the health care space, our digital agencies -- those are all clearly areas of strength for us and drivers of that multiyear now, if you look at the compounded change, we're clearly feeling like we are leaning into where there's demand and where there's opportunity in the space. 
The other thing that I think makes it difficult to answer the question is that we think of it as an integrated whole. And so obviously, you can make the case to a client and you can prove the case to a client far more effectively if you've got a solution that encompasses as much of the ecosystem as possible so that you're able to help them at every level in the funnel at every level in the process, whether you're using that data to come up with the insights that will then inform the messaging or the plans that inform the distribution of that message or then picking up on those signals pulling them back in and having them continue to sort of feed that loop. 
So I think to our mind, clearly, the performance is indicative of the fact that some of the decisions we've made going back now strategically were the right ones, but it's still very much work in progress. And to my mind, there's a lot of opportunity ahead. But I think we could do better in both pulling that together and continuing to demonstrate that it works. But I can't tell you -- I can only tell you that in our world, that's what we're seeing get traction."

It's probably challenging to tell you, again, given how much upheaval there's been both last year and this year, when or at what that level, that will be established. But that's clearly the aspiration of whether it's by doing what we've done, which is to build out these incremental capabilities to combine them in a way where you've got the marketing services component and then the data and technology component, which inform one another. 
And then ultimately, as you also know, we're thinking that this approach should open new revenue streams and new commercial models to us, which, again, we believe, would go to the point that you're asking. So that's definitely where we're looking to get to."

But I think it's really important to look at the fact that we have been able to expand our margins as well as we have to date, and we believe that we have long-term margin expansion capability. 
I mean I go back to 2019 pre-pandemic. And if you look at our margin then, it was about 14%. Last year, we -- it was our intention to emerge a stronger company. As everyone knows, we did a restructuring and committed to $160 million of savings or about 180, 190 basis points of 2019 revenue. We're seeing that savings, which makes us feel really good. 
Also, I'd point to, and we've had a consistent algorithm of being able to convert revenue growth to profitability. And we expect that will continue.  As you point out this year, and as I mentioned in my remarks, hiring is lagging revenue growth, and that's not unusual in a period of time like this, but also our temp help as a result is running high. And because of our very strong performance and targets that we set in the very beginning of the year, incentive comp is also running at very high levels, which will reset at the end of this year and the beginning of next year. So despite whether or not we have a difficult comp in the short term in '22, we fully believe we have more room to expand our margins going forward in the long term."

Well, look, I mean, I think that the kinds of questions and issues that need to be solved if you're running a business today and you are looking to achieve whatever your goals are imply that you're looking for partners that can help you address kind of a range of things that are sort of digital economy related. So whether that is your own business transformation, whether that is your data strategy at the enterprise level and then ultimately, how you're going to take increasingly your own first-party data and put it to use so that you are either, I think, increasingly being more effective with your investments, but also more efficient. 
And then lastly, how you show up and how you go kind of direct to the consumer, and therefore, e-commerce very, very broadly construed, right, because I think that so much of what's happening now in e-comm is happening in -- on owned platforms and channels that companies and marketers own. It's clearly going to be happening in areas that go sort of from the ad tech world, where we've generally or largely been focused as an industry for a number of years to more tech. 
But it will -- whether it's in the app world in the gaming world, et cetera. So I think that  it's both a fairly broad playing field. You've got some maybe smaller entities with deep specialization in some of those areas. It's interesting from where we sit because we think it creates a broader kind of addressable marketplace. And if you look at our immediate competitive set, I mean, I think they're clearly looking at and thinking about sitting where they are and with the portfolio they have, how do they approach these things. 
In terms of kind of the bigger or the broader competitive set. You see some activity, but I think the headlines are ahead of the reality there. And then I think you need to figure out ways to partner up, particularly kind of in the data in the tech world because I think that as everything changes there, there's going to need to be universal identifiers. 
There's going to need to be kind of ways to privacy-compliant way, engage with consumers and help again clients go-to-market. And so that will clearly imply being able to work with the folks who are solving for that, whether it's from a measurement point of view or from an activation point of view. So I don't know that I'm seeing anything that we think is unexpected. I think probably, if anything, the pandemic has probably moved us forward faster along this track. But it's a direction or an avenue that we were heading down anyway."

I think that the integration went exceptionally well, and that was clearly a focus of ours and particularly important when you consider that what Acxiom brought to us was a level of credibility and trust when it comes to sizable marketing and client organizations saying, okay, as a holder of our first-party data, you can do that in a way that we know is scaled, is secure, et cetera. So I think that, that was clearly an important area of focus. 
I think that you then heard from us, and we have leaned into ensuring that the connectivity there with media, which was the most obvious adjacency in the place where we've been building, whether it was our own stack, pre-Acxiom, with Acxiom is a foundational piece of it or whether it was the activation piece Cadreon, which is now matter kind addressable across all channels. 
But now we're definitely seeing Acxiom pretty consistently across the board. We are focused on what we can do there. In the health care space, we think there's a lot of opportunity there. We definitely have it baked into, as we've called out, anything that involves a scale opportunity that is complex or multi-agency with a client.  A lot of -- anything that's a top 20 IPG client. 
I think if anything, the thing that's been holding us back is likely that during the pandemic, virtual has, I think, been a bit of a break on not specific or only in this space, but I think that innovation internally is harder to do when people are not together. And so it's definitely the case that I think that whatever the next generation product wise is or the ways in which we can be even tighter and quicker on the integration is a place that I think we'll be focused on, but I think it will unlock in large part because our teams are going to be able to be together. 
We had a product road map off-site with the Acxiom Kinesso leadership for 1.5 days, and that was much more productive. So it was about 1.5 months ago than we would have been otherwise. So I think all in, plenty to do and still lots of upside. But I think that we're pleased with where we are on that."

As far as inflation, we're not seeing materially higher broad-based inflation in our numbers to date, but we're seeing what everyone else is seeing. The talent market clearly has become more competitive and attrition is higher post the pandemic. We went through a period of time where no one left. So you're seeing, I think, a 2-year attrition rate this year. And as a result, specifically because we're growing so fast, our hiring has not kept up. 
So what we're focused on is really innovating our recruitment techniques. We're doing all kinds of different things on that front, including count referral bonuses, looking for different places for our workforce, including bringing working moms, maybe back into the workforce. We're also trying to create opportunities for our people by creating promotion opportunities. 
And it's not all about the compensation, although we do pay people competitively, it's also really about the quality of the work environment that you provide, training and development, your values that you stand for as a company, including DE&I and ESG. So we're really focused on all of those things. One other thing I would point out is that our company, typically, or our industry benefits from higher level of economic activity. So that could actually turn out to be a positive from a revenue perspective. And I think it's also important to note that we are investing in some of these more innovative ways of solving higher order client -- problems for our clients. So whether it's digital transformation or getting, as Philippe said, direct-to-consumer e-commerce, we think all those things will do well in this environment as well."

If you look at Omnicom guidance, their guidance lead them to go from minus 2% to minus 5%, a 3-point slowdown. And Publicis guidance leads them to go from plus 5% to plus 2%, a 3-point slowdown, again, all against 2019. So you, 8-point slowdown, Omnicom and Publicis, 3-point slowdown.

I think it's an interesting question, but I think that -- we don't look at the year on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I would ask that you then let me give us some broader context in answering it, right? I think that the variability that we see in the business on a quarter-to-quarter basis reflects the fact that client activity has to do with their needs and their competitive situation and then also with the macro. 
And so we've always framed up our expectations and we managed the business in terms of the full year, right? So if I look at the full year, with organic growth, as we've said, in the range of 11%, on top of what are definitely the most challenging comps in the sector, that's a very strong result. 
And if I look at a 2-year compound stack, if that 11% comes in, that still has us at just under 6% when without us in the mix, the industry is probably flat. I think if you get under that quarterly number and you think about the fluctuations, I think the point that you raise feels to me like it's about timing from where I sit, right? 
And so Q4 last year, timing clearly favors Q4, whether that's as obscured somewhat by the recessionary environment that we were navigating at that point. So you had pullbacks early in the pandemic, then our clients get their bearings. They figure out how to go virtual, they lean into a lot of what we've been talking about digital e-com. And so there's pent-up demand that clearly benefited Q4 from where we were sitting. We saw in digital media spend, very strong spend in the retail category. There was a lot of COVID-related government communications work, which thankfully is going to hopefully be a little less necessary now. 
And this year, we've seen this marked acceleration in Q2 and Q3.  And I think that reflects, at the macro level, the progress that's been made broadly on public health and the fact that economic activity is up, but also the acceleration of the digital behaviors, which IPG has been anticipating for many years with strategic actions. And so those 2 quarters have been very, very strong. 
And so going into Q4, I'd say to you that what we're seeing is tone of the business is solid. We're net new business positive. But Delta has definitely created some uncertainty at the macro level. The pent-up demand that was a plus in Q4 isn't necessarily there. And so that's where, as I said to you, we look at the year, we feel very comfortable with the year. We look at the 2-year stack. We think that is very strong as well. And so to my mind, I don't see it as you -- I don't read it the way that you do. I think that when you then -- when we have a discussion about what '22 looks like, then we have -- then we have the question that you put out there."

I hope everyone is keeping well. As usual, I'll start with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter, Ellen will then provide additional details, I'll conclude with updates on key developments at our agencies and then we'll follow that with Q&A.
We're pleased to share our very strong third quarter performance. But before turning to the numbers, I'd like to begin by recognizing and thanking our people across all of Interpublic, who have continued to show a high level of dedication and support to our clients and to one another. They are the principal reason we can report such strong results again this quarter.
The people are delivering insight and execution required for the complex integration of creativity, technology and data at scale that marketers across industry sectors need in order to accelerate their business transformation journeys. This kind of work is helping set a standard for our industry and further build on IPG's record of industry outperformance and margin expansion.
As we've moved through September and now into October, it's also been rewarding to begin welcoming our people back to office settings and to see many of our teams together again in the places where creativity, collaboration and culture are ultimately rooted and regularly renewed.
Turning to our results in the quarter. Our net organic revenue growth in the third quarter was 15%. That's against the third quarter of 2020 when, as you'll recall, our organic change was negative 3.7% due to the impact of the pandemic. It's also important to note that our 2-year organic increase was 10.7% relative to the third quarter of 2019, which is a strong result.
Compared to 2020, our growth in the quarter was again broad-based by region of the world, discipline as well as client sector. Organic growth was 14.7% in the U.S., and it ranged between 11% and 20% in international regions. Both of our operating segments also grew at double-digit rates. Our IAN segment increased 14.4% organically, with all major agencies contributing high single to double-digit percentage increases. We were led by media, data and technology, R/GA and Huge as well as by MullenLowe, McCann and FCB, highlighted by notable contributions from their health care and advertising disciplines.
In our DXTRA segment, organic growth was 18.6%, reflecting double-digit increases across each of our DXTRA agencies and furthering the rebound from the sharp impact of the pandemic last year on our sports and entertainment as well as experiential businesses.
Looking at client sectors, the picture is also one of balanced growth, with nearly every 1 of our 8 major client sectors increasing at a double-digit percentage rate, led by the auto sector, our other sector with government and industrials and the tech and telecom, retail and health care sectors.  
Turning to profitability and expenses. Our results again demonstrate outstanding focus and execution by our operating teams, even as we continue to invest to support areas of accelerating growth and to enhance our offerings. Third quarter net income was $239.9 million as reported. Our adjusted EBITA was $369.5 million. And our margin of adjusted EBITA before restructuring was 16.3% compared with 16.2% a year ago and 14.7% in the third quarter of 2019.
There were several factors worth noting within those comparisons. We had solid operating leverage on our expenses for base payroll as we continue to see the structural benefits of the strategic cost actions taken last year. Those are reflected in our base payroll as well as our occupancy expense. To date, our very strong top line growth is also outpacing the associated hiring. And therefore, our expense for temporary labor increased from a year ago. Our travel and related expenses continue to track at low levels, but still were somewhat higher than last year.
As we look ahead, T&E expense will pick up over the remainder of the year. Our expense accrual for employee performance-based incentive compensation, however, increased as a percentage of net revenue which is a direct result of our strong operating performance.
Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.60 as reported and was $0.63 as adjusted for the after-tax expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles and other items.
In sum, our quarter as well as our year-to-date speak to strong financial performance across the key metrics of growth, EBITA and earnings per share. Our growth reflects the cyclical economic recovery as well as the important structural currents that favor the kinds of higher order expertise with which we're well resourced. 
The work we're doing solves for the increasingly complex world faced by our clients in a marketing and media environment that's defined by a very rapid rate of change. This is a validation of our long-term strategic focus on building offerings that help clients integrate brand experience across all consumer touch points, improve their capacity to apply data in the way their business goes to market and capitalize on the benefits of technology and digital channels.
Going back a number of years, we've anticipated transformational opportunities of this type of environment. Other important drivers of our continued success are our ability to deliver fully integrated solutions through our open architecture model and our emphasis on strong agency brands and best industry talent so as to deliver breakthrough creative ideas and content.
We've also fostered a culture that respects the individual, is transparent with respect to clients and is accountable when it comes to data privacy and media responsibility.
Turning to our outlook with our seasonally important fourth quarter still ahead, we're pleased to increase our financial performance objectives. We now expect that we can deliver organic growth for the year of approximately 11%, which is ahead of the 9% to 10% range we had previously indicated. With growth at that higher level, and given our strong results through the 9 months, we would therefore expect to achieve adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 16.8%, which is an increase of 80 basis points over the level that we had previously shared with you.
Our outlook is based on expectations of a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery. We began the fourth quarter well positioned with strong operating momentum. And the tone of the business remains solid as we head into the year-end and holiday season. As such, we see 2021 as another year of strong value creation for all of our stakeholders. And on that note, I'll now hand over the call to Ellen for a more in-depth view of our results."

Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation. Third quarter net revenue increased 15.7% from a year ago, with organic growth of 15%. Adjusted EBITA before a small restructuring adjustment was $369.5 million and margin was 16.3%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.60 as reported and $0.63 as adjusted for the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles, a small restructuring adjustment and a net gain from the disposition of nonstrategic businesses.
On October 1, following the conclusion of the third quarter, we repaid our $500 million, 3.75% senior notes from cash on hand, further deleveraging our balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow.
Turning to the third quarter revenue on Slide 4. Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.26 billion, an increase of $307.1 million from a year ago. Compared to Q3 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 1.1% with the U.S. dollar weaker than a year ago in all world regions with the exception of LatAm. Net divestitures were negative 40 basis points. Our net organic revenue increase was 15%, which brings us to 12% organic growth for the 9 months.
At the bottom of this slide, we break out segment revenue in the quarter. Our IAN segment grew 14.4% organically. We had notably strong growth across our offerings in media, data and tech, R/GA, Huge, McCann Worldgroup, FCB driven by Health and the MullenLowe Group. At IPG DXTRA, organic growth was 18.6%, which reflects double-digit growth across public relations, experiential, sports and entertainment and branding disciplines.
Moving on to Slide 5, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region. In the U.S., which was 65% of our net revenue in the quarter, organic growth was 14.7%. The organic revenue decrease a year ago was 2.4%. Year-on-year performance was notably strong across both our IAN and DXTRA segments and at almost all of our agencies led by media, data and tech, FCB, MullenLowe, McCann, Weber and Jack Morton. 
International markets were 35% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 15.4% organically. You'll recall that the same markets decreased 6% a year ago.
The U.K. increased 13.3% organically, led by our offerings in media, data and tech, DXTRA, McCann and R/GA. Continental Europe grew 11.8%. Among our largest national markets, we had notably strong growth in Germany, Spain, Italy and France. There were a number of operating highlights in the region, led by media, data and tech, DXTRA and R/GA.
Asia Pac increased 17.4% organically, led by growth across most national markets, notably Australia, Singapore, India, the Philippines, China and Japan. Our organic growth in LatAm was 20.3% with exceptional results in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Chile.
Our other markets group, which consists of Canada, the Middle East and Africa grew 17.1% organically, led by notably strong performance in Canada.
Moving on to Slide 6 and operating expenses in the quarter. Our fully adjusted EBITA margin was 16.3% compared with 16.2% a year ago and 14.7% in the third quarter of 2019. We continue to see efficiencies in a number of different expense categories as we had in this year's first half, and these were both structural and variable.
In the structural category, we are seeing the benefit of the strategic restructuring actions, which we initiated in the second quarter last year and continue to execute over the back half of 2020.
As we've called out previously, we've also had a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses from pre-COVID levels. I would call out specifically travel and related expenses, which while increased from the third quarter a year ago, were still well below their level in 2019.
As you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue was 66.8% compared with 65% in last year's third quarter. The increase was due to higher expenses in 2 categories: our accrual for performance-based incentive compensation was 5.8% of net revenue; and our expense for temporary labor, which was 5% of net revenue in the quarter.
We had strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which was 53.9% of third quarter net revenue, which reflects the benefit of our restructuring actions and the fact that the pace of hiring lags our strong revenue growth, which has been the case in past economic expansions. At quarter end, total worldwide headcount was approximately 54,600, an 8% increase from a year ago. We have added net 4,500 people year-to-date to support our growth.
Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percent of net revenue by 250 basis points to 13.3%. That reflects lower occupancy expense mainly due to the restructuring of our real estate. The ratio was 5% of net revenue. We also reduced all other office and other direct expense by 120 basis points compared to last year, which reflects lower expense for bad debt and leverage as a result of our growth.
Our SG&A expense was 1.4% of net revenue with the increase from a year ago due to higher unallocated performance-based incentive expense and increased employee insurance, which was at a very low level last year.
On Slide 7, we present detail on adjustments to our reported third quarter results in order to provide greater clarity and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left-hand side of the page, with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITA and our adjusted diluted EPS. Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.5 million.  
The restructuring refinement in the quarter was a benefit of $3.5 million. To be clear, this is an adjustment to estimates of the 2020 restructuring program.
Below operating expenses in column 4, we had a gain due to the disposition of certain nonstrategic businesses, which was $1.7 million in the quarter. At the foot of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of these adjustments was $0.03 per share, which bridges our diluted EPS as reported at $0.60 to adjusted earnings of $0.63 per diluted share. The appendix to our presentation includes a similar bridge for diluted EPS for the 9-month period.
On Slide 8, we turn to cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operations was $390.2 million compared to $689.3 million a year ago. We generated $79.6 million from working capital compared to $376.8 million last year, which was an unusually strong seasonal result. Investing activities used $72 million in the quarter, mainly for CapEx, $61.3 million. Financing activities used $153.3 million, mainly for our dividend. Our net increase in cash for the quarter was $152.5 million.
Slide 9 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Under current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refers to our $500 million, 3.75% senior notes, which have matured since the balance sheet date, and we repaid with cash on hand.
Slide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt. Again, this includes the October 1 maturity. Our next maturity is $250 million due April 2024. And following that, there's nothing until 2028. 
In summary, on Slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment. I would like to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity mean that we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially. And with that, I'll turn it back to Philippe."
108616,1684541272,2412597,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen. The combination of our exceptionally talented people and a balanced portfolio of offerings and capabilities continues to set a standard for growth in our industry. The strategic steps we've taken over the long term have positioned IPG as",2036,"Thank you, Ellen. The combination of our exceptionally talented people and a balanced portfolio of offerings and capabilities continues to set a standard for growth in our industry. The strategic steps we've taken over the long term have positioned IPG as a high-value business partner to our clients.
We're able to combine the power of creativity and narrative storytelling with the benefits of data and technology in order to deliver growth for marketers across a broad range of sectors. These strategic steps are evident in our strong results and position us well going forward. By helping clients to better understand audiences and to engage with them with greater precision and accountability, we can help companies succeed the digital economy.
Today, marketers are responsible for increasing business innovation, building new content platforms and e-commerce platforms as well as adopting emerging tech and leveraging data, all while complying with an evolving data privacy landscape. Our clients are also at the forefront of addressing societal issues and corporate purpose on behalf of their companies and brands.
As a partner, we're helping them solve for all of these challenges with our ability to deliver complex integrations focused on business results and outcomes. Our ability to help marketers proactively address these issues is further assisted by our intentional focus on ESG priorities as core business imperatives. That's why we've been focused in working on ESG for many years at IPG. We continue to build on a strong industry record in DEI initiatives, which are integral to nurturing the highest quality and most representative perspectives, insights and creative voices across our company.  
More recently, we've launched our first formal human rights policy. And our work with clients around social issues includes campaigns focused on LGBTQ+ rights, mental health awareness, ways in which we can remove implicit bias from core data sets and also use data to increase the health of our planet as well as sustainable consumption models.  
With respect to climate, we're now measuring our total greenhouse gas emissions around the world. We're committed to setting a science-based target and to reaching net zero carbon across our business by 2040. We've also agreed to source 100% renewable electricity by 2030 for our entire portfolio.
Now turning to the highlights of performance from across that portfolio during the quarter, a key sector that continues to show strength for us is health care. As you know, IPG has significant operations in health care marketing, totaling approximately 1/4 of our total revenue.
This includes specialized global health care networks as well as significant health care activity and client relationships at our media and public relations operations and within some of our U.S. independents. As health and wellness continue to be a top concern for people, companies and governments around the world, we've seen an increased need for sound health care information to be delivered at speed in ways that are highly personal, culturally relevant as well as respectful of privacy regulations.
Within the health care sector as well as across other client sectors, our ability to deliver open architecture solutions will continue to drive success for our company. We have deep experience providing customized integrated client service models to many of our largest client partners. And we continue to perform well in winning new business on this sort of work, especially in pitches that leverage the IPG data stack as a key part of the strategy.
This past quarter, for example, Morgan Stanley and E-Trade named Mediahub as Media Agency of record, following a highly competitive review. Data strategy was a key component of the brief. For this reason, our customer intelligence company, Acxiom was placed front and center in our winning proposal. The Mediahub team is leading media strategy, planning and activation in the U.S., leveraging Acxiom's consumer data and expertise to fuel tightly targeted and effective communication solutions.
In Mediabrands, we continue to see a high degree of engagement with many of the world's most sophisticated marketers across our 2 largest brands, UM and Initiative. During the quarter, Initiative U.S. won Adweek's prestigious Media Agency of the Year honor for 2021.
Last year at this time, within Mediabrands, we launched Reprise Commerce, the global specialty e-commerce offering. And since then, e-commerce revenue within that unit has increased significantly as we've helped clients build out holistic approaches to e-commerce, including e-retail, supply chain and warehousing, marketplaces and direct-to-consumer programs. There's never been a more important time to connect the e-commerce opportunity with the full power of clients' media and marketing investments.
In addition, we can create and deploy consistent cross-channel experiences that dynamically adapt to consumer needs and goals in real time, thanks to our outstanding creative and content capabilities. This expertise is a key part of the news last week, that the owner of Werther's Original candies, Storck USA, had selected UM as its media agency of record. UM takes on all strategy, planning, buying and analytics duties including the implementation of Storck's shopper commerce activity.
Our data and technology offerings continue to be key drivers of performance for us as well, featuring an all-major open architecture and new business activity of significant scale. This month marks the third anniversary of Acxiom becoming part of IPG.
During the third quarter, Acxiom continued to post strong performance and to win in the marketplace, bringing in major new clients from the media, retail and financial services sector. Most recently, a top 10 financial services company engaged Acxiom to build their unified enterprise data layer, which again shows the strength and depth of Acxiom's technology expertise.
During Q3, Kinesso launched what we're calling the Kinesso Intelligence Identity product, also called that KII, and this is a new identity solution that works across the open web as well as the walled gardens and is already live with clients across a broad range of verticals. Along with IPG Mediabrands, The Trade Desk is among the first media partners using KII. And the launch comes at a particularly important moment as brands and agencies work to create and bolster privacy-first identity solutions that can assure addressability as third-party cookies and mobile ad IDs begin to be phased out.
KII can match a brand's first-party CRM data and map it to key identifiers, significantly increasing match rates and reducing the need for third-party onboarders. When it comes to the strength of our brands and the creative advertising space, McCann, FCB and MullenLowe continued to distinguish themselves this quarter.
McCann Worldgroup was named Global Network of the Year at the 2021 Gerety Awards, which recognizes the best creative communications from the female perspective. Also notable McCann Worldgroup named a new President and Global Chief Creative Officer, who joins us from Nike, where he served in senior brand marketing and creative leadership roles for more than 20 years, most recently leading Nike's men's brands globally. During his tenure at Nike, he was responsible for many of the world's best-known and most iconic campaigns across a range of marketing disciplines and channels.
At FCB, the agency's Chicago office was ranked as the top creative agency in North America in the Lions Creativity Report. In that same report, FCB was ranked among the top networks in the world. And FCB was also named North American Agency of the Year at the 2021 New York Festival Awards.
MullenLowe was named the second most effective agency at the recent U.S. Effie awards, and MullenLowe Group was named the #2 most effective network globally. In both cases, punching well above its weight against larger competitors. During the quarter, the agency won the T.J. Maxx creative account. And just this week, Mediahub won 3 Adweek Media Plan of the Year awards as well as seeing its U.K. office win global media duties for FARFETCH, which is a luxury fashion e-commerce brand.
R/GA launched what they are calling a direct to avatar capability, and that's going to create virtual stories for brands within metaverse platforms. And that really stakes out new territory in direct-to-consumer sales. On the growth front, R/GA added projects for digital forward partners like[ Tonal ], Slack, CBS and Roku.
Huge also launched a new commerce offering, which it calls the experienced stack of the future. And that's a tool that consolidates various elements of SaaS into an integrated growth solution for brands. I think we're also going to see the agency's newly appointed CEO, further his plans to infuse data into Huge's core offerings.
IPG's DXTRA growth in the quarter was broad-based and it benefited from the return of live events. Jack Morton won new client assignments with Amazon and Twitch and along with Octagon Sports and Entertainment was listed among event marketers ranking of the top 100 event agencies of 2021. Audio social media app, Clubhouse, added Golin as its global agency lead agency. Weber was named the Supplier of the Year by GM; and security software company, McAfee, also named Weber Shandwick, its global agency of record to help redefine the firm as a consumer brand.
Lastly, Weber launched a media security center in partnership with Blackbird.AI to address emerging information for us. And this is an offering that's built to offer solutions to what business leaders say is a really leading reputational issue, which is the spread of misinformation and disinformation.
During the quarter, we also saw continued positive momentum at our U.S. independent agencies. The Martin Agency won Hasbro's NERF brand of products. Carmichael Lynch was named Strategy and creative lead for H&R Block, where he'll take on responsibility for strategy, creative and social media as well as public relations; and Deutsch LA added Energy Drink [ brand ] A SHOC to its roster.
All in, we're in a positive position from a net new business standpoint for the year, and our new business pipeline continues to be active. As is typical at this time, we don't have full visibility on project work as we head into the fourth quarter, which will include the crucial holiday shopping season. Now in line with the growth we're seeing across much of the portfolio, our companies are adding staff with the requisite contemporary skill sets as well as expertise.
So hiring is yet to fully keep pace with a very strong growth we've seen to date this year. We've begun seeing travel restrictions lifted in certain key markets as infection rates decline. And we fully continue to use technology and practices developed during the pandemic to reduce travel and other carbon-intensive parts of our business wherein as appropriate, but we believe that some of what we could call standard cost of doing business will return in Q4 and in a larger measure in 2022. 
Earlier on the call, we shared with you our perspective on the full year and our updated expectation that will deliver approximately 11% organic growth and adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 16.8% for the full year 2021. That view is predicated, as we indicated, on the assumption that they'll continue to be a reasonably steady course of macro recovery. And we're very proud to have delivered a very strong 9 months thus far this year on top of the most challenging comps in the industry.
Current performance combined with the continued execution of our long-term strategy should continue to be significant drivers for sustained value creation for all of our stakeholders. We're committed to sound financial fundamentals as well as continuing to grow our dividend as we've consistently done, including through the pandemic. And returning to our share repurchase program also remains a priority, as we turn our focus on planning for the upcoming year. We'll, of course, keep you updated on our progress on that front.
We're confident as well that the investments in talent and capabilities we continue to make position IPG well for the future. As Ellen said, this is an unprecedented time, but we have a highly relevant and differentiated set of offerings underpinned by a sound financial foundation and a strong balance sheet.
As always, we want to thank our clients and our people. Those are the key pillars of our success. And we want to thank you as well for your time this morning. So now let's open the call for your questions."

And obviously, the revenue growth has been sort of industry leading for a while. I guess my question really is when you look at the overall growth that you've been seeing as a company, how much of this sort of outperformance do you think is due to the fact that you have leaned into areas and made investments in like Acxiom, which clearly, in the examples you gave, made a difference in terms of winning incremental business? Or how much do you think, again, sort of high level, is this -- you're just positioned very well for the recovery given your exposure to health care and such?"
108616,1684541272,2412597,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","No worries. Alexia. Look, I think it's obviously difficult to tell you for fact what is behind some of the performance that our competitors are posting.

Look, I think it's obviously difficult to tell you for fact what is behind some of the performance that our competitors are posting. And I also don't know that I would separate health care given that there was a moment in time when it was not the scale business that it is for us. And then a lot of what drives success in that business is analogous to what we've been doing across the portfolio, which is to say, can you help clients with a broader range of problems? Can you give them more accountability and more clarity around when they're making investments or when they're putting a message out into the marketplace? Who it is that you're trying to reach and how precisely it is that you're trying to impact that potential consumer or that audience?
So I think it's hard for me to pull it apart or to break it out for you. I mean I think it's fair to say that we do consistently call out for you that whether it's media, data and technology, whether it is the health care space, our digital agencies -- those are all clearly areas of strength for us and drivers of that multiyear now. If you look at the compounded change, we're clearly feeling like we are leaning into where there's demand and where there's opportunity in the space.
The other thing that I think makes it difficult to answer the question is that we think of it as an integrated whole. And so obviously, you can make the case to a client and you can prove the case to a client far more effectively if you've got a solution that encompasses as much of the ecosystem as possible so that you're able to help them at every level in the funnel, at every level in the process, whether you're using that data to come up with the insights that will then inform the messaging or the plans that inform the distribution of that message or then picking up on those signals, pulling them back in and having them continue to sort of feed that loop.
So I think to our mind, clearly, the performance is indicative of the fact that some of the decisions we've made are going back now strategically with the right ones, but it's still very much work in progress. And to my mind, there's a lot of opportunity ahead. But I think we could do better in both pulling that together and continuing to demonstrate that it works. But I can't tell you -- I can only tell you that in our world, that's what we're seeing get traction."

It's probably challenging to tell you, again, given how much upheaval there's been both last year and this year, when or at what that level that will be established. But that's clearly the aspiration of whether it's by doing what we've done, which is to build out these incremental capabilities, to combine them in a way where you've got the marketing services component and then the data and technology component, which inform one another.
And then ultimately, as you also know, we're thinking that this approach should open new revenue streams and new commercial models to us, which, again, we believe, would go to the point that you're asking. So that's definitely where we're looking to get to."

But I think it's really important to look at the fact that we have been able to expand our margins as well as we have to date, and we believe that we have long-term margin expansion capability.
I mean I go back to 2019 pre-pandemic. And if you look at our margin then, it was about 14%. Last year, we -- it was our intention to emerge as stronger company. As everyone knows, we did a restructuring and committed to $160 million of savings or about 180, 190 basis points of 2019 revenue. We're seeing that savings, which makes us feel really good.
Also, I'd point to, we've had a consistent algorithm of being able to convert revenue growth to profitability. And we expect that will continue.  As you point out this year, and as I mentioned in my remarks, hiring is lagging revenue growth, and that's not unusual in a period of time like this. But also our temp help as a result is running high. And because of our very strong performance and targets that we set in the very beginning of the year, incentive comp is also running at very high levels, which will reset at the end of this year and the beginning of next year. So despite whether or not we have a difficult comp in the short term in '22, we fully believe we have more room to expand our margins going forward in the long term."

Well, look, I mean I think that the kinds of questions and issues that need to be solved if you're running a business today and you are looking to achieve whatever your goals are, imply that you're looking for partners that can help you address kind of a range of things that are sort of digital economy related. So whether that is your own business transformation, whether that is your data strategy at the enterprise level and then ultimately, how you're going to take increasingly your own first-party data and put it to use so that you are either, I think, increasingly being more effective with your investments, but also more efficient.
And then lastly, how you show up and how you go kind of direct to the consumer, and therefore, e-commerce very, very broadly construed, right, because I think that so much of what's happening now in e-comm is happening in -- on owned platforms and channels that companies and marketers own. It's clearly going to be happening in areas that go sort of from the ad tech world, where we've generally or largely been focused as an industry for a number of years to MarTech. But it will -- whether it's in the app world, in the gaming world, et cetera.
So I think that  it's both a fairly broad playing field. You've got some maybe smaller entities with deep specialization in some of those areas. It's interesting from where we sit because we think it creates a broader kind of addressable marketplace. And if you look at our immediate competitive set, I mean I think they're clearly looking at and thinking about sitting where they are and with the portfolio they have, how do they approach these things. 
In terms of kind of the bigger or the broader competitive set, you see some activity, but I think the headlines are ahead of the reality there. And then I think you need to figure out ways to partner up, particularly kind of in the data and the tech world because I think that as everything changes there, there's going to need to be universal identifiers. There's going to need to be kind of ways to privacy-compliant way, engage with consumers and help again clients go-to-market.
And so that will clearly imply being able to work with the folks who are solving for that, whether it's from a measurement point of view or from an activation point of view. So I don't know that I'm seeing anything that we think is unexpected. I think probably, if anything, the pandemic has probably moved us forward faster along this track. But it's a direction or an avenue that we were heading down anyway."

So I think that, that was clearly an important area of focus. 
I think that you then heard from us, and we have leaned into ensuring that the connectivity there with media, which was the most obvious adjacency in the place where we've been building, whether it was our own stack, pre-Acxiom, with Acxiom as a foundational piece of it, or whether it was the activation piece, Cadreon, which is now Matterkind, addressable across all channels. 
But now we're definitely seeing Acxiom pretty consistently across the board. We are focused on what we can do there. In the health care space, we think there's a lot of opportunity there. We definitely have it baked into, as we've called out. Anything that involves the scale opportunity that is complex or multi-agency with a client.  A lot of -- anything that's a top 20 IPG client.
I think if anything, the thing that's been holding us back is likely that during the pandemic, virtual has, I think, been a bit of a break on not specific or only in this space, but I think that innovation internally is harder to do when people are not together. And so it's definitely the case that I think that whatever the next generation product wise is or the ways in which we can be even tighter and quicker on the integration is a place that I think we'll be focused on, but I think it will unlock in large part because our teams are going to be able to be together.
We had a product road map off-site with the Acxiom-Kinesso leadership for 1.5 days, and that was much more productive. So it was about 1.5 months ago than we would have been otherwise. So I think all in, plenty to do and still lots of upside. But I think that we're pleased with where we are on that."

As far as inflation, we're not seeing materially higher broad-based inflation in our numbers to date, but we're seeing what everyone else is seeing. The talent market clearly has become more competitive and attrition is higher post the pandemic. We went through a period of time where no one left. So you're seeing, I think, a 2-year attrition rate this year. And as a result, specifically because we're growing so fast, our hiring has not kept up.
So what we're focused on is really innovating our recruitment techniques. We're doing all kinds of different things on that front, including talent referral bonuses, looking for different places for our workforce, including bringing working moms maybe back into the workforce. We're also trying to create opportunities for our people by creating promotion opportunities.
And it's not all about the compensation, although we do pay people competitively. It's also really about the quality of the work environment that you provide, training and development, your values that you stand for as a company, including DE&I and ESG. So we're really focused on all of those things.
One other thing I would point out is that our company, typically, or our industry benefits from higher level of economic activity. So that could actually turn out to be a positive from a revenue perspective. And I think it's also important to note that we are investing in some of these more innovative ways of solving higher order client -- problems for our clients. So whether it's digital transformation or getting, as Philippe said, direct-to-consumer e-commerce, we think all those things will do well in this environment as well."

So that means that on a 2-year stack, you would grow from 11% growth in Q3 to a 3% growth in Q4, which is an 8-point slowdown.
If you look at Omnicom guidance, their guidance lead them to go from minus 2% to minus 5%, a 3-point slowdown. And Publicis guidance leads them to go from plus 5% to plus 2%, a 3-point slowdown, again, all against 2019. So you, 8-point slowdown; Omnicom and Publicis, 3-point slowdown.

So I would ask that you then let me give some broader context in answering it, right? I think that the variability that we see in the business on a quarter-to-quarter basis reflects the fact that client activity has to do with their needs and their competitive situation and then also with the macro.
And so we've always framed up our expectations and we managed the business in terms of the full year, right? So if I look at the full year, with organic growth, as we've said, in the range of 11%, on top of what are definitely the most challenging comps in the sector, that's a very strong result.
And if I look at a 2-year compound stack, if that 11% comes in, that still has us at just under 6% when without us in the mix, the industry is probably flat. I think if you get under that quarterly number and you think about the fluctuations, I think the point that you raised feels to me like it's about timing from where I sit, right?
And so Q4 last year, timing clearly favors Q4, whether that's as obscured somewhat by the recessionary environment that we were navigating at that point. So you had pullbacks early in the pandemic, then our clients get their bearings. They figure out how to go virtual, they lean into a lot of what we've been talking about, digital e-com. And so there's pent-up demand that clearly benefited Q4 from where we were sitting. We saw in digital media spend, very strong spend in the retail category. There was a lot of COVID-related government communications work, which thankfully is going to hopefully be a little less necessary now.
And this year, we've seen this marked acceleration in Q2 and Q3. And I think that reflects, at the macro level, the progress that's been made broadly on public health and the fact that economic activity is up, but also the acceleration of the digital behaviors, which IPG has been anticipating for many years with strategic actions. And so those 2 quarters have been very, very strong.
And so going into Q4, I'd say to you that what we're seeing is tone of the business is solid. We're net new business positive. But Delta has definitely created some uncertainty at the macro level. The pent-up demand that was a plus in Q4 isn't necessarily there. And so that's where, as I said to you, we look at the year, we feel very comfortable with the year. We look at the 2-year stack. We think that is very strong as well. And so to my mind, I don't see it as you -- I don't read it the way that you do. I think that when you then -- when we have a discussion about what '22 looks like, then we have the question that you put out there."

I hope everyone is keeping well. As usual, I'll start with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter, Ellen will then provide additional details, I'll conclude with updates on key developments at our agencies and then we'll follow that with Q&A.
We're pleased to share our very strong third quarter performance. But before turning to the numbers, I'd like to begin by recognizing and thanking our people across all of Interpublic, who have continued to show a high level of dedication and support to our clients and to one another. They are the principal reason we can report such strong results again this quarter.
The people are delivering insight and execution required for the complex integration of creativity, technology and data at scale that marketers across industry sectors need in order to accelerate their business transformation journeys. This kind of work is helping set a standard for our industry and further build on IPG's record of industry outperformance and margin expansion.
As we've moved through September and now into October, it's also been rewarding to begin welcoming our people back to office settings and to see many of our teams together again in the places where creativity, collaboration and culture are ultimately rooted and regularly renewed.
Turning to our results in the quarter. Our net organic revenue growth in the third quarter was 15%. That's against the third quarter of 2020 when, as you'll recall, our organic change was negative 3.7% due to the impact of the pandemic. It's also important to note that our 2-year organic increase was 10.7% relative to the third quarter of 2019, which is a strong result.
Compared to 2020, our growth in the quarter was again broad-based by region of the world, discipline as well as client sector. Organic growth was 14.7% in the U.S., and it ranged between 11% and 20% in international regions. Both of our operating segments also grew at double-digit rates. Our IAN segment increased 14.4% organically, with all major agencies contributing high single to double-digit percentage increases. We were led by media, data and technology, R/GA and Huge as well as by MullenLowe, McCann and FCB, highlighted by notable contributions from their health care and advertising disciplines.
In our DXTRA segment, organic growth was 18.6%, reflecting double-digit increases across each of our DXTRA agencies and furthering the rebound from the sharp impact of the pandemic last year on our sports and entertainment as well as experiential businesses.
Looking at client sectors, the picture is also one of balanced growth, with nearly every 1 of our 8 major client sectors increasing at a double-digit percentage rate, led by the auto sector, our other sector with government and industrials and the tech and telecom, retail and health care sectors.  
Turning to profitability and expenses. Our results again demonstrate outstanding focus and execution by our operating teams, even as we continue to invest to support areas of accelerating growth and to enhance our offerings. Third quarter net income was $239.9 million as reported. Our adjusted EBITA was $369.5 million. And our margin of adjusted EBITA before restructuring was 16.3% compared with 16.2% a year ago and 14.7% in the third quarter of 2019.
There were several factors worth noting within those comparisons. We had solid operating leverage on our expenses for base payroll as we continue to see the structural benefits of the strategic cost actions taken last year. Those are reflected in our base payroll as well as our occupancy expense. To date, our very strong top line growth is also outpacing the associated hiring. And therefore, our expense for temporary labor increased from a year ago. Our travel and related expenses continue to track at low levels, but still were somewhat higher than last year.
As we look ahead, T&E expense will pick up over the remainder of the year. Our expense accrual for employee performance-based incentive compensation, however, increased as a percentage of net revenue which is a direct result of our strong operating performance.
Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.60 as reported and was $0.63 as adjusted for the after-tax expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles and other items.
In sum, our quarter as well as our year-to-date speak to strong financial performance across the key metrics of growth, EBITA and earnings per share. Our growth reflects the cyclical economic recovery as well as the important structural currents that favor the kinds of higher order expertise with which we're well resourced. 
The work we're doing solves for the increasingly complex world faced by our clients in a marketing and media environment that's defined by a very rapid rate of change. This is a validation of our long-term strategic focus on building offerings that help clients integrate brand experience across all consumer touch points, improve their capacity to apply data in the way their business goes to market and capitalize on the benefits of technology and digital channels.
Going back a number of years, we've anticipated transformational opportunities of this type of environment. Other important drivers of our continued success are our ability to deliver fully integrated solutions through our open architecture model and our emphasis on strong agency brands and best industry talent so as to deliver breakthrough creative ideas and content.
We've also fostered a culture that respects the individual, is transparent with respect to clients and is accountable when it comes to data privacy and media responsibility.
Turning to our outlook with our seasonally important fourth quarter still ahead, we're pleased to increase our financial performance objectives. We now expect that we can deliver organic growth for the year of approximately 11%, which is ahead of the 9% to 10% range we had previously indicated. With growth at that higher level, and given our strong results through the 9 months, we would therefore expect to achieve adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 16.8%, which is an increase of 80 basis points over the level that we had previously shared with you.
Our outlook is based on expectations of a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery. We began the fourth quarter well positioned with strong operating momentum. And the tone of the business remains solid as we head into the year-end and holiday season. As such, we see 2021 as another year of strong value creation for all of our stakeholders. And on that note, I'll now hand over the call to Ellen for a more in-depth view of our results."

Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation. Third quarter net revenue increased 15.7% from a year ago, with organic growth of 15%. Adjusted EBITA before a small restructuring adjustment was $369.5 million and margin was 16.3%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.60 as reported and $0.63 as adjusted for the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles, a small restructuring adjustment and a net gain from the disposition of nonstrategic businesses.
On October 1, following the conclusion of the third quarter, we repaid our $500 million, 3.75% senior notes from cash on hand, further deleveraging our balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 3, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow.
Turning to the third quarter revenue on Slide 4. Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.26 billion, an increase of $307.1 million from a year ago. Compared to Q3 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 1.1% with the U.S. dollar weaker than a year ago in all world regions with the exception of LatAm. Net divestitures were negative 40 basis points. Our net organic revenue increase was 15%, which brings us to 12% organic growth for the 9 months.
At the bottom of this slide, we break out segment revenue in the quarter. Our IAN segment grew 14.4% organically. We had notably strong growth across our offerings in media, data and tech, R/GA, Huge, McCann Worldgroup, FCB driven by Health and the MullenLowe Group. At IPG DXTRA, organic growth was 18.6%, which reflects double-digit growth across public relations, experiential, sports and entertainment and branding disciplines.
Moving on to Slide 5, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region. In the U.S., which was 65% of our net revenue in the quarter, organic growth was 14.7%. The organic revenue decrease a year ago was 2.4%. Year-on-year performance was notably strong across both our IAN and DXTRA segments and at almost all of our agencies led by media, data and tech, FCB, MullenLowe, McCann, Weber and Jack Morton. 
International markets were 35% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 15.4% organically. You'll recall that the same markets decreased 6% a year ago.
The U.K. increased 13.3% organically, led by our offerings in media, data and tech, DXTRA, McCann and R/GA. Continental Europe grew 11.8%. Among our largest national markets, we had notably strong growth in Germany, Spain, Italy and France. There were a number of operating highlights in the region, led by media, data and tech, DXTRA and R/GA.
Asia Pac increased 17.4% organically, led by growth across most national markets, notably Australia, Singapore, India, the Philippines, China and Japan. Our organic growth in LatAm was 20.3% with exceptional results in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Chile.
Our other markets group, which consists of Canada, the Middle East and Africa grew 17.1% organically, led by notably strong performance in Canada.
Moving on to Slide 6 and operating expenses in the quarter. Our fully adjusted EBITA margin was 16.3% compared with 16.2% a year ago and 14.7% in the third quarter of 2019. We continue to see efficiencies in a number of different expense categories as we had in this year's first half, and these were both structural and variable.
In the structural category, we are seeing the benefit of the strategic restructuring actions, which we initiated in the second quarter last year and continue to execute over the back half of 2020.
As we've called out previously, we've also had a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses from pre-COVID levels. I would call out specifically travel and related expenses, which while increased from the third quarter a year ago, were still well below their level in 2019.
As you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue was 66.8% compared with 65% in last year's third quarter. The increase was due to higher expenses in 2 categories: our accrual for performance-based incentive compensation was 5.8% of net revenue; and our expense for temporary labor, which was 5% of net revenue in the quarter.
We had strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which was 53.9% of third quarter net revenue, which reflects the benefit of our restructuring actions and the fact that the pace of hiring lags our strong revenue growth, which has been the case in past economic expansions. At quarter end, total worldwide headcount was approximately 54,600, an 8% increase from a year ago. We have added net 4,500 people year-to-date to support our growth.
Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percent of net revenue by 250 basis points to 13.3%. That reflects lower occupancy expense mainly due to the restructuring of our real estate. The ratio was 5% of net revenue. We also reduced all other office and other direct expense by 120 basis points compared to last year, which reflects lower expense for bad debt and leverage as a result of our growth.
Our SG&A expense was 1.4% of net revenue with the increase from a year ago due to higher unallocated performance-based incentive expense and increased employee insurance, which was at a very low level last year.
On Slide 7, we present detail on adjustments to our reported third quarter results in order to provide greater clarity and a picture of comparable performance. This begins on the left-hand side of the page, with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITA and our adjusted diluted EPS. Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.5 million.  
The restructuring refinement in the quarter was a benefit of $3.5 million. To be clear, this is an adjustment to estimates of the 2020 restructuring program.
Below operating expenses in column 4, we had a gain due to the disposition of certain nonstrategic businesses, which was $1.7 million in the quarter. At the foot of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of these adjustments was $0.03 per share, which bridges our diluted EPS as reported at $0.60 to adjusted earnings of $0.63 per diluted share. The appendix to our presentation includes a similar bridge for diluted EPS for the 9-month period.
On Slide 8, we turn to cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operations was $390.2 million compared to $689.3 million a year ago. We generated $79.6 million from working capital compared to $376.8 million last year, which was an unusually strong seasonal result. Investing activities used $72 million in the quarter, mainly for CapEx, $61.3 million. Financing activities used $153.3 million, mainly for our dividend. Our net increase in cash for the quarter was $152.5 million.
Slide 9 is the current portion of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Under current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refers to our $500 million, 3.75% senior notes, which have matured since the balance sheet date, and we repaid with cash on hand.
Slide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt. Again, this includes the October 1 maturity. Our next maturity is $250 million due April 2024. And following that, there's nothing until 2028. 
In summary, on Slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment. I would like to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity mean that we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially. And with that, I'll turn it back to Philippe."
108616,1684541272,2412690,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen. The combination of our exceptionally talented people and a balanced portfolio of offerings and capabilities continues to set a standard for growth in our industry. The strategic steps we've taken over the long term have positioned IPG as",2036,"Thank you, Ellen. The combination of our exceptionally talented people and a balanced portfolio of offerings and capabilities continues to set a standard for growth in our industry. The strategic steps we've taken over the long term have positioned IPG as a high-value business partner to our clients.
We're able to combine the power of creativity and narrative storytelling with the benefits of data and technology in order to deliver growth for marketers across a broad range of sectors. These strategic steps are evident in our strong results and position us well going forward. By helping clients to better understand audiences and to engage with them with greater precision and accountability, we can help companies succeed the digital economy.
Today, marketers are responsible for increasing business innovation, building new content platforms and e-commerce platforms as well as adopting emerging tech and leveraging data, all while complying with an evolving data privacy landscape. Our clients are also at the forefront of addressing societal issues and corporate purpose on behalf of their companies and brands.
As a partner, we're helping them solve for all of these challenges with our ability to deliver complex integrations focused on business results and outcomes. Our ability to help marketers proactively address these issues is further assisted by our intentional focus on ESG priorities as core business imperatives. That's why we've been focused in working on ESG for many years at IPG. We continue to build on a strong industry record in DEI initiatives, which are integral to nurturing the highest quality and most representative perspectives, insights and creative voices across our company.  
More recently, we've launched our first formal human rights policy. And our work with clients around social issues includes campaigns focused on LGBTQ+ rights, mental health awareness, ways in which we can remove implicit bias from core data sets and also use data to increase the health of our planet as well as sustainable consumption models.  
With respect to climate, we're now measuring our total greenhouse gas emissions around the world. We're committed to setting a science-based target and to reaching net zero carbon across our business by 2040. We've also agreed to source 100% renewable electricity by 2030 for our entire portfolio.
Now turning to the highlights of performance from across that portfolio during the quarter, a key sector that continues to show strength for us is health care. As you know, IPG has significant operations in health care marketing, totaling approximately 1/4 of our total revenue.
This includes specialized global health care networks as well as significant health care activity and client relationships at our media and public relations operations and within some of our U.S. independents. As health and wellness continue to be a top concern for people, companies and governments around the world, we've seen an increased need for sound health care information to be delivered at speed in ways that are highly personal, culturally relevant as well as respectful of privacy regulations.
Within the health care sector as well as across other client sectors, our ability to deliver open architecture solutions will continue to drive success for our company. We have deep experience providing customized integrated client service models to many of our largest client partners. And we continue to perform well in winning new business on this sort of work, especially in pitches that leverage the IPG data stack as a key part of the strategy.
This past quarter, for example, Morgan Stanley and E-Trade named Mediahub as Media Agency of record, following a highly competitive review. Data strategy was a key component of the brief. For this reason, our customer intelligence company, Acxiom was placed front and center in our winning proposal. The Mediahub team is leading media strategy, planning and activation in the U.S., leveraging Acxiom's consumer data and expertise to fuel tightly targeted and effective communication solutions.
In Mediabrands, we continue to see a high degree of engagement with many of the world's most sophisticated marketers across our 2 largest brands, UM and Initiative. During the quarter, Initiative U.S. won Adweek's prestigious Media Agency of the Year honor for 2021.
Last year at this time, within Mediabrands, we launched Reprise Commerce, the global specialty e-commerce offering. And since then, e-commerce revenue within that unit has increased significantly as we've helped clients build out holistic approaches to e-commerce, including e-retail, supply chain and warehousing, marketplaces and direct-to-consumer programs. There's never been a more important time to connect the e-commerce opportunity with the full power of clients' media and marketing investments.
In addition, we can create and deploy consistent cross-channel experiences that dynamically adapt to consumer needs and goals in real time, thanks to our outstanding creative and content capabilities. This expertise is a key part of the news last week, that the owner of Werther's Original candies, Storck USA, had selected UM as its media agency of record. UM takes on all strategy, planning, buying and analytics duties including the implementation of Storck's shopper commerce activity.
Our data and technology offerings continue to be key drivers of performance for us as well, featuring an all-major open architecture and new business activity of significant scale. This month marks the third anniversary of Acxiom becoming part of IPG.
During the third quarter, Acxiom continued to post strong performance and to win in the marketplace, bringing in major new clients from the media, retail and financial services sector. Most recently, a top 10 financial services company engaged Acxiom to build their unified enterprise data layer, which again shows the strength and depth of Acxiom's technology expertise.
During Q3, Kinesso launched what we're calling the Kinesso Intelligence Identity product, also called that KII, and this is a new identity solution that works across the open web as well as the walled gardens and is already live with clients across a broad range of verticals. Along with IPG Mediabrands, The Trade Desk is among the first media partners using KII. And the launch comes at a particularly important moment as brands and agencies work to create and bolster privacy-first identity solutions that can assure addressability as third-party cookies and mobile ad IDs begin to be phased out.
KII can match a brand's first-party CRM data and map it to key identifiers, significantly increasing match rates and reducing the need for third-party onboarders. When it comes to the strength of our brands and the creative advertising space, McCann, FCB and MullenLowe continued to distinguish themselves this quarter.
McCann Worldgroup was named Global Network of the Year at the 2021 Gerety Awards, which recognizes the best creative communications from the female perspective. Also notable McCann Worldgroup named a new President and Global Chief Creative Officer, who joins us from Nike, where he served in senior brand marketing and creative leadership roles for more than 20 years, most recently leading Nike's men's brands globally. During his tenure at Nike, he was responsible for many of the world's best-known and most iconic campaigns across a range of marketing disciplines and channels.
At FCB, the agency's Chicago office was ranked as the top creative agency in North America in the Lions Creativity Report. In that same report, FCB was ranked among the top networks in the world. And FCB was also named North American Agency of the Year at the 2021 New York Festival Awards.
MullenLowe was named the second most effective agency at the recent U.S. Effie awards, and MullenLowe Group was named the #2 most effective network globally. In both cases, punching well above its weight against larger competitors. During the quarter, the agency won the T.J. Maxx creative account. And just this week, Mediahub won 3 Adweek Media Plan of the Year awards as well as seeing its U.K. office win global media duties for FARFETCH, which is a luxury fashion e-commerce brand.
R/GA launched what they are calling a direct to avatar capability, and that's going to create virtual stories for brands within metaverse platforms. And that really stakes out new territory in direct-to-consumer sales. On the growth front, R/GA added projects for digital forward partners like[ Tonal ], Slack, CBS and Roku.
Huge also launched a new commerce offering, which it calls the experienced stack of the future. And that's a tool that consolidates various elements of SaaS into an integrated growth solution for brands. I think we're also going to see the agency's newly appointed CEO, further his plans to infuse data into Huge's core offerings.
IPG's DXTRA growth in the quarter was broad-based and it benefited from the return of live events. Jack Morton won new client assignments with Amazon and Twitch and along with Octagon Sports and Entertainment was listed among event marketers ranking of the top 100 event agencies of 2021. Audio social media app, Clubhouse, added Golin as its global agency lead agency. Weber was named the Supplier of the Year by GM; and security software company, McAfee, also named Weber Shandwick, its global agency of record to help redefine the firm as a consumer brand.
Lastly, Weber launched a media security center in partnership with Blackbird.AI to address emerging information for us. And this is an offering that's built to offer solutions to what business leaders say is a really leading reputational issue, which is the spread of misinformation and disinformation.
During the quarter, we also saw continued positive momentum at our U.S. independent agencies. The Martin Agency won Hasbro's NERF brand of products. Carmichael Lynch was named Strategy and creative lead for H&R Block, where he'll take on responsibility for strategy, creative and social media as well as public relations; and Deutsch LA added Energy Drink [ brand ] A SHOC to its roster.
All in, we're in a positive position from a net new business standpoint for the year, and our new business pipeline continues to be active. As is typical at this time, we don't have full visibility on project work as we head into the fourth quarter, which will include the crucial holiday shopping season. Now in line with the growth we're seeing across much of the portfolio, our companies are adding staff with the requisite contemporary skill sets as well as expertise.
So hiring is yet to fully keep pace with a very strong growth we've seen to date this year. We've begun seeing travel restrictions lifted in certain key markets as infection rates decline. And we fully continue to use technology and practices developed during the pandemic to reduce travel and other carbon-intensive parts of our business wherein as appropriate, but we believe that some of what we could call standard cost of doing business will return in Q4 and in a larger measure in 2022. 
Earlier on the call, we shared with you our perspective on the full year and our updated expectation that will deliver approximately 11% organic growth and adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 16.8% for the full year 2021. That view is predicated, as we indicated, on the assumption that they'll continue to be a reasonably steady course of macro recovery. And we're very proud to have delivered a very strong 9 months thus far this year on top of the most challenging comps in the industry.
Current performance combined with the continued execution of our long-term strategy should continue to be significant drivers for sustained value creation for all of our stakeholders. We're committed to sound financial fundamentals as well as continuing to grow our dividend as we've consistently done, including through the pandemic. And returning to our share repurchase program also remains a priority, as we turn our focus on planning for the upcoming year. We'll, of course, keep you updated on our progress on that front.
We're confident as well that the investments in talent and capabilities we continue to make position IPG well for the future. As Ellen said, this is an unprecedented time, but we have a highly relevant and differentiated set of offerings underpinned by a sound financial foundation and a strong balance sheet.
As always, we want to thank our clients and our people. Those are the key pillars of our success. And we want to thank you as well for your time this morning. So now let's open the call for your questions."

And obviously, the revenue growth has been sort of industry leading for a while. I guess my question really is when you look at the overall growth that you've been seeing as a company, how much of this sort of outperformance do you think is due to the fact that you have leaned into areas and made investments in like Acxiom, which clearly, in the examples you gave, made a difference in terms of winning incremental business? Or how much do you think, again, sort of high level, is this -- you're just positioned very well for the recovery given your exposure to health care and such?"
108616,1684541272,2412690,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Executives","No worries. Alexia. Look, I think it's obviously difficult to tell you for fact what is behind some of the performance that our competitors are posting.

Look, I think it's obviously difficult to tell you for fact what is behind some of the performance that our competitors are posting. And I also don't know that I would separate health care given that there was a moment in time when it was not the scale business that it is for us. And then a lot of what drives success in that business is analogous to what we've been doing across the portfolio, which is to say, can you help clients with a broader range of problems? Can you give them more accountability and more clarity around when they're making investments or when they're putting a message out into the marketplace? Who it is that you're trying to reach and how precisely it is that you're trying to impact that potential consumer or that audience?
So I think it's hard for me to pull it apart or to break it out for you. I mean I think it's fair to say that we do consistently call out for you that whether it's media, data and technology, whether it is the health care space, our digital agencies -- those are all clearly areas of strength for us and drivers of that multiyear now. If you look at the compounded change, we're clearly feeling like we are leaning into where there's demand and where there's opportunity in the space.
The other thing that I think makes it difficult to answer the question is that we think of it as an integrated whole. And so obviously, you can make the case to a client and you can prove the case to a client far more effectively if you've got a solution that encompasses as much of the ecosystem as possible so that you're able to help them at every level in the funnel, at every level in the process, whether you're using that data to come up with the insights that will then inform the messaging or the plans that inform the distribution of that message or then picking up on those signals, pulling them back in and having them continue to sort of feed that loop.
So I think to our mind, clearly, the performance is indicative of the fact that some of the decisions we've made are going back now strategically with the right ones, but it's still very much work in progress. And to my mind, there's a lot of opportunity ahead. But I think we could do better in both pulling that together and continuing to demonstrate that it works. But I can't tell you -- I can only tell you that in our world, that's what we're seeing get traction."

It's probably challenging to tell you, again, given how much upheaval there's been both last year and this year, when or at what that level that will be established. But that's clearly the aspiration of whether it's by doing what we've done, which is to build out these incremental capabilities, to combine them in a way where you've got the marketing services component and then the data and technology component, which inform one another.
And then ultimately, as you also know, we're thinking that this approach should open new revenue streams and new commercial models to us, which, again, we believe, would go to the point that you're asking. So that's definitely where we're looking to get to."

But I think it's really important to look at the fact that we have been able to expand our margins as well as we have to date, and we believe that we have long-term margin expansion capability.
I mean I go back to 2019 pre-pandemic. And if you look at our margin then, it was about 14%. Last year, we -- it was our intention to emerge as stronger company. As everyone knows, we did a restructuring and committed to $160 million of savings or about 180, 190 basis points of 2019 revenue. We're seeing that savings, which makes us feel really good.
Also, I'd point to, we've had a consistent algorithm of being able to convert revenue growth to profitability. And we expect that will continue.  As you point out this year, and as I mentioned in my remarks, hiring is lagging revenue growth, and that's not unusual in a period of time like this. But also our temp help as a result is running high. And because of our very strong performance and targets that we set in the very beginning of the year, incentive comp is also running at very high levels, which will reset at the end of this year and the beginning of next year. So despite whether or not we have a difficult comp in the short term in '22, we fully believe we have more room to expand our margins going forward in the long term."

Well, look, I mean I think that the kinds of questions and issues that need to be solved if you're running a business today and you are looking to achieve whatever your goals are, imply that you're looking for partners that can help you address kind of a range of things that are sort of digital economy related. So whether that is your own business transformation, whether that is your data strategy at the enterprise level and then ultimately, how you're going to take increasingly your own first-party data and put it to use so that you are either, I think, increasingly being more effective with your investments, but also more efficient.
And then lastly, how you show up and how you go kind of direct to the consumer, and therefore, e-commerce very, very broadly construed, right, because I think that so much of what's happening now in e-comm is happening in -- on owned platforms and channels that companies and marketers own. It's clearly going to be happening in areas that go sort of from the ad tech world, where we've generally or largely been focused as an industry for a number of years to MarTech. But it will -- whether it's in the app world, in the gaming world, et cetera.
So I think that  it's both a fairly broad playing field. You've got some maybe smaller entities with deep specialization in some of those areas. It's interesting from where we sit because we think it creates a broader kind of addressable marketplace. And if you look at our immediate competitive set, I mean I think they're clearly looking at and thinking about sitting where they are and with the portfolio they have, how do they approach these things. 
In terms of kind of the bigger or the broader competitive set, you see some activity, but I think the headlines are ahead of the reality there. And then I think you need to figure out ways to partner up, particularly kind of in the data and the tech world because I think that as everything changes there, there's going to need to be universal identifiers. There's going to need to be kind of ways to privacy-compliant way, engage with consumers and help again clients go-to-market.
And so that will clearly imply being able to work with the folks who are solving for that, whether it's from a measurement point of view or from an activation point of view. So I don't know that I'm seeing anything that we think is unexpected. I think probably, if anything, the pandemic has probably moved us forward faster along this track. But it's a direction or an avenue that we were heading down anyway."

So I think that, that was clearly an important area of focus. 
I think that you then heard from us, and we have leaned into ensuring that the connectivity there with media, which was the most obvious adjacency in the place where we've been building, whether it was our own stack, pre-Acxiom, with Acxiom as a foundational piece of it, or whether it was the activation piece, Cadreon, which is now Matterkind, addressable across all channels. 
But now we're definitely seeing Acxiom pretty consistently across the board. We are focused on what we can do there. In the health care space, we think there's a lot of opportunity there. We definitely have it baked into, as we've called out. Anything that involves the scale opportunity that is complex or multi-agency with a client.  A lot of -- anything that's a top 20 IPG client.
I think if anything, the thing that's been holding us back is likely that during the pandemic, virtual has, I think, been a bit of a break on not specific or only in this space, but I think that innovation internally is harder to do when people are not together. And so it's definitely the case that I think that whatever the next generation product wise is or the ways in which we can be even tighter and quicker on the integration is a place that I think we'll be focused on, but I think it will unlock in large part because our teams are going to be able to be together.
We had a product road map off-site with the Acxiom-Kinesso leadership for 1.5 days, and that was much more productive. So it was about 1.5 months ago than we would have been otherwise. So I think all in, plenty to do and still lots of upside. But I think that we're pleased with where we are on that."

As far as inflation, we're not seeing materially higher broad-based inflation in our numbers to date, but we're seeing what everyone else is seeing. The talent market clearly has become more competitive and attrition is higher post the pandemic. We went through a period of time where no one left. So you're seeing, I think, a 2-year attrition rate this year. And as a result, specifically because we're growing so fast, our hiring has not kept up.
So what we're focused on is really innovating our recruitment techniques. We're doing all kinds of different things on that front, including talent referral bonuses, looking for different places for our workforce, including bringing working moms maybe back into the workforce. We're also trying to create opportunities for our people by creating promotion opportunities.
And it's not all about the compensation, although we do pay people competitively. It's also really about the quality of the work environment that you provide, training and development, your values that you stand for as a company, including DE&I and ESG. So we're really focused on all of those things.
One other thing I would point out is that our company, typically, or our industry benefits from higher level of economic activity. So that could actually turn out to be a positive from a revenue perspective. And I think it's also important to note that we are investing in some of these more innovative ways of solving higher order client -- problems for our clients. So whether it's digital transformation or getting, as Philippe said, direct-to-consumer e-commerce, we think all those things will do well in this environment as well."

So if I look at your full year guidance, where you're guiding to 11% for the full year versus 2020, that is 8% in Q4. So that means that on a 2-year stack, you would grow from 11% growth in Q3 to a 3% growth in Q4, which is an 8-point slowdown.
If you look at Omnicom guidance, their guidance lead them to go from minus 2% to minus 5%, a 3-point slowdown. And Publicis guidance leads them to go from plus 5% to plus 2%, a 3-point slowdown, again, all against 2019. So you, 8-point slowdown; Omnicom and Publicis, 3-point slowdown. Why are you the most conservative when you are the best in class? Should you slow less than them, is my first question?"

So I would ask that you then let me give some broader context in answering it, right? I think that the variability that we see in the business on a quarter-to-quarter basis reflects the fact that client activity has to do with their needs and their competitive situation and then also with the macro.
And so we've always framed up our expectations and we managed the business in terms of the full year, right? So if I look at the full year, with organic growth, as we've said, in the range of 11%, on top of what are definitely the most challenging comps in the sector, that's a very strong result.
And if I look at a 2-year compound stack, if that 11% comes in, that still has us at just under 6% when without us in the mix, the industry is probably flat. I think if you get under that quarterly number and you think about the fluctuations, I think the point that you raised feels to me like it's about timing from where I sit, right?
And so Q4 last year, timing clearly favors Q4, whether that's as obscured somewhat by the recessionary environment that we were navigating at that point. So you had pullbacks early in the pandemic, then our clients get their bearings. They figure out how to go virtual, they lean into a lot of what we've been talking about, digital e-com. And so there's pent-up demand that clearly benefited Q4 from where we were sitting. We saw in digital media spend, very strong spend in the retail category. There was a lot of COVID-related government communications work, which thankfully is going to hopefully be a little less necessary now.
And this year, we've seen this marked acceleration in Q2 and Q3. And I think that reflects, at the macro level, the progress that's been made broadly on public health and the fact that economic activity is up, but also the acceleration of the digital behaviors, which IPG has been anticipating for many years with strategic actions. And so those 2 quarters have been very, very strong.
And so going into Q4, I'd say to you that what we're seeing is tone of the business is solid. We're net new business positive. But Delta has definitely created some uncertainty at the macro level. The pent-up demand that was a plus in Q4 isn't necessarily there. And so that's where, as I said to you, we look at the year, we feel very comfortable with the year. We look at the 2-year stack. We think that is very strong as well. And so to my mind, I don't see it as you -- I don't read it the way that you do. I think that when you then -- when we have a discussion about what '22 looks like, then we have the question that you put out there."
