With me today to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2020 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. 
This past year presented challenges that none of us could have predicted. I am so proud of how Team Kroger has risen to meet every challenge and to be there for our customers when they've needed us the most. While we hope that the worst of the pandemic is behind us and we are encouraged by the progress around the initial vaccine rollout, our priority remains the health and safety of our associates, customers and communities. 
2020 was the final year of our 3-year transformational plan, Restock Kroger, during which we made strategic investments and changes to our business model to better serve our customers. We focused on widening and deepening our competitive moats, which include Seamless, Personalization, Fresh and Our Brands. As a result, we generated strong momentum and successfully repositioned our company to serve our customers in new and exciting ways. 
Let me now turn to our results. Kroger delivered strong results during our fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. We continued to gain market share and full year results were above the guidance we shared with you last quarter. Identical sales without fuel were 14.1% for the year as customers continued to consolidate trips and spend more per transaction. We grew digital sales triple digits in 2020, enabled by our team's ability to pivot quickly and effectively in the first stage of the pandemic to ensure that we were meeting our customers' demand for safe, low-touch and touchless shopping modalities. 
Our strong performance in digital is also a testament to the proactive investments we made over the last several years in our network, which positioned Kroger to respond with agility during this crisis and critical time. Beyond the numbers, we have built substantial momentum within our business and, more importantly, we continue to deepen our personalized relationships with our customers who remain at the center of everything we do. 
When the pandemic started, no one knew what to expect. But what we did know was that our decisions and actions would be guided by our purpose and our values. Our purpose is to feed the human spirit, which means we are driven to do more and help make the lives of those around us better, especially during times of uncertainty. Since the beginning of the pandemic last March, our most urgent priority has been to safeguard our associates and customers. We've implemented dozens of new safety and cleanliness processes and procedures in our stores and all of our facilities, including safety partitions and physical distancing floor decals, implementation of customer capacity limits and providing PPE like masks for our associates, all of which are described in our Blueprint for Businesses, an open source guide we've created to help other companies navigate the complexities of safely operating during a pandemic. 
Supported by our strong performance and cash position, we've committed more than $2.5 billion to safeguard the environment of our associates and customers where they work and shop in and to reward associates, including committing nearly $1 billion to better secure pensions for over 30,000 associates. This was in addition to paid emergency leave, financial assistance through our Helping Hand Funds program and much more. We continue to provide support for our associates including awards in November and February that included $100 cash and 1,000 fuel points placed on frontline associate shopper cards to help ease financial hardship from the pandemic and as a thank you for their continued commitment to serving our customers so tirelessly. 
We know the critical role that the COVID vaccine plays in creating a safe environment for our associates and customers. That's why we're encouraging everyone to receive the vaccine as soon as they're eligible to do so. During the quarter, we announced a $100 incentive for all associates who received the manufacturer-recommended dosage of the vaccine. We hope this offer, along with targeted education efforts will help break through vaccine hesitancy and further encourage the health and safety of our associates. 
Kroger Health is proud to be a partner with the federal government and our state governments in distributing the vaccine. We continue to introduce initiatives to improve the vaccination process, including the recent launch of a new scheduling tool and enhancements to our website to make finding and scheduling vaccine appointments easier. To date, Kroger Health has administrated more than 665,000 vaccines, including more than 38,000 for our own associates. Because vaccine availability and eligibility continues to vary by jurisdiction, we are advocating at the local, state and federal level and calling for our associates and frontline grocery workers broadly to be included in the earliest vaccine phase possible. 
Inspired by purpose and guided by our values, 2020 taught us that we are capable of doing more, of moving faster and effectively prioritizing what matters most to our customers, associates and communities. In addition to changing how we work, COVID-19 has changed how our customers enjoy food. We continue to see people eat and work more from home and prioritize health and cleanliness. We believe that these trends will continue even as restrictions ease and vaccinations are distributed. We will share more of these trends with you at our Investor Day in a few weeks. 
What hasn't changed is our fundamental commitment to provide -- to putting our customers first. Our competitive moats, Seamless, Personalization, Fresh and Our Brands are built upon this commitment and are stronger today than ever before, especially as customers eat more food at home. We will continue to invest in these critical competitive advantages as we work to win a larger share of the food-at-home market. 
Let me provide some more detail on each of these competitive moats. Pick-up and delivery continued to grow during the quarter, and we are seeing more and more new customers engaging in our Seamless ecosystem. Our overall digital sales grew 118%, including delivery sales growth of 249% during the quarter. When customers engage in both our in-store and online modalities, we see a 98% retention rate within our ecosystem, highlighting how sticky our customer engagement is. 
During the quarter, we also saw further improvement in digital profitability as we continue to improve cost efficiency, sales mix and retail media. Yesterday, we completed the inaugural order through our first Ocado Shed in Monroe, Ohio. This marks the soft opening of the facility and we look forward to our brand opening in early April. We continue to be excited about the elevated experience that this will bring to our customers in the tri-state area and across the country as we continue to open additional facilities. 
Our data and personalization allow us to deliver meaningful, unique customer moments across channels to address specific customer needs while enhancing their relationship with Kroger. 60 million households shop with Kroger every year. The scale of our digital business has grown rapidly. In fact, during 2020, we had over 1.3 billion customer interactions across our digital modalities, a 30% increase over last year. Our significant reach allows us to meaningfully personalize the customer experience. 
In 2020, we presented nearly 11 million (sic) [ billion ] personalized recommendations per week. That's right, 11 billion recommendations personalized each week. When you look at that over the year, that's more than 0.5 trillion offered personalized for customers during 2020. We achieved several exciting milestones in Fresh this year. As more customers are spending more time at home, our produce and floral departments outperformed total company. Customers are focused on eating healthier, as evidenced by the increased engagement in our Simple Truth brands, which grew 18% during the quarter. 
We also saw customers trading up and buying higher-quality premium products like luxury wine and Murray's Cheese, which also outperformed the total company. As customers look for food inspiration, we continue to develop innovative products to meet their needs, including ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat foods. We have seen significant growth in Deli Bakery and Meal Solution, and Home Chef finished the year with record sales, capturing additional share of stomach from restaurants and grocery retailers. 
Also this quarter, our Fresh for Everyone campaign celebrated its first anniversary. The marketing campaign is reaching new heights in ad effectiveness and is resonating with our customers. Our brands achieved its best year ever in 2020, exceeding $26.2 billion in sales. Our Simple Truth brand achieved a major milestone, exceeding $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. And this is a brand that was just -- that was created from scratch a little over 5 years ago. We saw a 20% growth in our premium culinary brand, Private Selection, as more people continue cooking at home and elevating their meals. 
Our Simple Truth plant-based platform launched 53 new items in 2020. One of the key launches for the year was Simple Truth Oat Milk Ice Cream. This line has brought new customers to the category and sales are continuing to outpace projections. Over 1.4 million new households have purchased from the Simple Truth plant-based platform this year as we hold high standards for the taste and experience of our plant-based products, just like the rest of our brand's portfolio. Our trial rate has continued to grow and our repeat rate has continued to strengthen. 
Kroger is committing to helping people and our planet. This is at the core of who we are as a company. During 2020, this work became even more critical as our communities experienced the pandemic and its economic impacts, social unrest and natural disasters. Let me provide some detail on 2 important areas under our broader ESG strategy, diversity, equity and inclusion, and our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste efforts to improve food access and food security. 
Diversity and inclusion are among Kroger's long-standing core values. In October, we introduced a 10-point framework for action to accelerate diversity, equity and inclusion and promote greater change in the workplace and in our communities. As part of this framework, we created an internal advisory council comprised of black leaders and associates across the company to help set priorities and drive meaningful change. 
The Kroger Co. Foundation also established a $5 million racial equity fund to align philanthropy to our extended commitment. So far, the foundation has directed $3 million in grants to 4 organizations with innovative approaches to building stronger, more equitable communities. COVID-19 and its impact also shined a light on the intersection of food security, health and nutrition and racial equity. Given the increased need in 2020, Kroger nearly doubled our charitable giving to the Feeding America network of food banks and supported key partners like No Kid Hungry to direct meals where needed most. 
We are pleased to note that our associates continue to rescue surplus food throughout the year despite heavy stockpiling periods early in the year. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste is the centerpiece of our ESG strategy and it's how our associates live our purpose every day. I would now like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our quarter 4 and full year 2020 financial results. Gary?"

We are extremely proud of our results in 2020 and the balance achieved in delivering for all our key stakeholders, our associates, customers, communities and shareholders. Strong execution by our team and accele",1556,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. We are extremely proud of our results in 2020 and the balance achieved in delivering for all our key stakeholders, our associates, customers, communities and shareholders. Strong execution by our team and accelerated investments in our competitive moats during the pandemic allowed us to create significant value to shareholders and strengthen our balance sheet. 
The momentum we see in our business, which started pre pandemic and accelerated during the pandemic places us in an even better position to grow sales and profitability in the future and deliver on our TSR commitments. Proof points of the accelerated momentum in our model achieved during 2020 include: significant market share gains, accelerated investments in Fresh and digital experience, over $1 billion of cost savings, $150 million of incremental alternative profit and improved digital profitability. 
Let me share additional color on each of these points. The change in customer behavior caused by COVID was, of course, a major factor in our results last year. This brought to the forefront the importance to the customer of fresh and digital. We continue to invest and aggressively grow our capabilities in these areas of strength for Kroger, leading to significant gains in both digital and total food-at-home market share. 
Consistent with our value creation model, we were disciplined in balancing investments in our customers and associates with cost savings. For the third year in a row, our operations and sourcing teams delivered over $1 billion in incremental cost savings. These savings continue to be focused in areas that take complexity out of the business and allow our associates to provide a better customer experience. 
Alternative profit continues to be a significant growth driver in our model and contributed $150 million of incremental operating profit on top of the $100 million of incremental profit in 2019. Retail media fueled this acceleration, and we continue to see significant opportunity for additional growth in the future. Importantly, this progress with cost savings and growth of retail media also allowed us to improve the profitability of our digital model in 2020, as we reduced the cost to fulfill a digital order and grew media revenue from digital sales. 
I'll now provide more color on our full year results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $3.47 per diluted share, up 58% compared to last year and ahead of the range we shared during quarter 3. Identical sales, excluding fuel, were 14.1%, in line with expectations. And our adjusted FIFO operating profit also came in at the top end of our increased guidance. Gross margin was 23.3% of sales for 2020. FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 14 basis points, reflecting sales leverage, continued growth in alternative profit streams and sourcing benefits, offset by continued investments in price and value for customers. 
Our OG&A rate without fuel and adjustment items decreased 6 basis points, reflecting increased sales leverage and execution of cost savings, offset by COVID-related investments to reward associates and to protect the health and safety of associates, customers and our communities. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.81 per diluted share, up 42% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 10.6%, driven by continued strength in grocery, produce and meat. Digital sales grew 118% during the quarter, outpacing the full year rate as customers continued to rely heavily on our digital modalities. Digital contributed approximately 5.5% to total identical sales without fuel. And as a result of productivity improvements in the cost to fulfill a digital order and accelerated retail media revenue, we improved pass-through profitability on digital sales by over 20% in the fourth quarter. 
FIFO gross margin rate decreased 6 basis points, with continued price investments offset by growth in alternative profit streams and sourcing benefits. Our OG&A rate without fuel and adjustment items decreased 7 basis points, which reflects increased sales leverage and execution and cost savings, offset by continued COVID-related investments to reward our associates and to protect the health and safety of associates, customers and our communities. 
During the fourth quarter, the incremental COVID-related investments were approximately $275 million. LIFO was a credit for the quarter of $84 million. The LIFO credit was primarily driven by fourth quarter working capital improvements in pharmacy inventory and dairy deflation. The income tax rate of 30.8% was a benefit for the fourth quarter as a result of the UFCW pension restructure charge. 
Fuel was a headwind of approximately $50 million to net operating profit during quarter 4. Like the broader industry, we experienced a year-over-year decline in fuel gallons, and the average retail price of fuel was also lower at $2.20 this quarter versus $2.58 in the same quarter last year. 
As Rodney touched on earlier, our associates have been nothing short of amazing over the past year, and we continue to invest in and reward our associates for their incredible work. We invested approximately $300 million in increased hourly wage during 2020 as part of the $800 million incremental investment in associate wages previously announced as part of Restock Kroger. Our average hourly rate is now $15.50, up from $15 last year, and with comprehensive benefits factored in, our average hourly rate is over $20. In 2021, we expect to invest an incremental $350 million in continued average value wage increases for our associates. 
Looking ahead, we have several major labor negotiations in 2021, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Atlanta, Houston, Little Rock, Michigan, Memphis, Mid-Atlantic, Cincinnati and Portland. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. 
Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
Turning now to our financial strategy. As a result of our strong operating performance, Kroger generated tremendous free cash flow in 2020, which resulted in a significant strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. We reduced net total debt by $2 billion over the last 4 quarters, and Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.75 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our financial strategy remains unchanged, and we will continue to evaluate how to deploy excess cash in ways that will accelerate our value creation model by sustainably growing earnings and delivering on our TSR commitment of 8% to 11%. 
Looking towards 2021, we are providing specific guidance to help you better understand how we see the business today. Due to the uncertainty surrounding trends in the food-at-home market as COVID vaccines roll out, we are sharing a wider range than we typically would, and we will be transparent in sharing more as the year unfolds. Our insights suggest there are a number of consumer changes that have occurred during the pandemic that will prove to be more structural and lasting which, combined with our strong execution and flexible financial model, give us confidence we will be able to manage through the current unknowns. 
As we cycle the tough comparisons from 2020, we expect our sales will turn negative in 2021 and are guiding to a range of negative 3% to negative 5% identical sales, excluding fuel, and adjusted FIFO operating profit of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion in 2021. Evaluating our performance using a 2-year period will more accurately measure our underlying momentum. We expect our 2-year stacked identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 9% and 11%. In addition, we expect our adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to have compounded annual growth rates of between 12% and 16% and 5.4% and 8.5%, respectively. Over the 2 years, this would result in total shareholder return significantly above our previously communicated target of 8% to 11%. 
We expect our free cash flow to be at least $1.6 billion in 2021, which includes a payment of $300 million for payroll taxes deferred from 2020. Over the course of 2020 and 2021, average annual free cash flow is forecast to be between $2.9 billion and $3 billion. This excludes the sale of strategic assets, company's funds or pension contributions and pension payments related to the restructuring of multi-employer pension plans. 
These 2-year expectations are ahead of our TSR growth algorithm, and we believe the momentum in our business places us in an even better position to grow profitably in the future. We remain committed to delivering strong and attractive shareholder -- total shareholder return over the long term and expect our 2021 operating profit guidance to represent a new higher baseline from which we will deliver future TSR of 8% to 11%. Finally, we look forward to sharing more about our strategy for growth and delivering on our TSR commitments at our upcoming Investor Day. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Rodney."

On your first question, we would expect alternative profits to continue to be a driver. As you know, 2020 was higher than 2019. We think 2021 incrementally will be a little bit lower than 2020 but very similar, and part of it will, obviously, as the year progresses. 
As you know, the 2 major parts of alternative profit: one is Kroger Personal Finance, and we believe that will get back on track. Obviously, the pandemic has impacted gift card sales and some of those things which has affected it. If you look at media, retail media is increasingly becoming a channel that companies look to advertise in. And it's a double win for us because it's an incredibly effective way for CPGs and others to advertise, and they get great insight on how good they do. And if you look at our data, especially and recently, there was an independent report that showed how Kroger -- how well retail media does when somebody invests in Kroger. 
So we think that will continue to be an important part of the model and an incredible, important part of the growth. And as you know, our digital channel continues to grow as well. We would expect fuel to be a headwind from a profitability standpoint in 2021, especially earlier in the year, but we would expect gallons to turn around and have meaningful growth in gallons. But the total gallons will still be less than what they were in 2019. And for us, fuel is just a great way of providing rewards to our customers that they care about, and we are starting to see people starting to drive a little more, and it's 1 way to reward customers for shopping with us that's unique to Kroger. 
If you look at promotional intensity, we would expect it to remain similar to where it is. So far, we haven't really seen a lot different. One of the things that I think everybody knows is that when you start cycling, it's because things beyond your company. I think in the past, a lot of times when promotional intensity started, it started because somebody thought they were losing share. And the insights and data is so much better where people can see where they are in market share. And we still continue to see people shopping more for food at home versus in some of the other channels, so that will help all boats to rise. So that's what we see at the moment. Now over time, it will play out. Gary, I don't know if you want to add anything on to the -- John's first question on operating profit."

As you might imagine, when we're cycling a year like 2020, there's going to be quite a few pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that represent the overall guidance that we shared for operating profit. 
I'll maybe just provide a little bit more color on the big pieces. As I mentioned, certainly has done a couple of them [ with all ] profit and fuel. The other things I would say in the sort of the tailwind category would be there will be certain costs, as you might imagine, related to COVID, that we won't have to cycle in 2021. Incentive costs, we'd also expect it to be lower than they would have been in 2020. We continue to take out costs so we'd expect another $1 billion of cost savings as part of the model in 2021 as we continue to achieve balance across productivity improvements, sourcing savings, administrative savings, so you're taking some of those learnings from COVID and how we can continue to operate more leanly and some of those lasting changes that can help us operate more efficiently. 
We would expect health and wellness to be a tailwind in 2021 as you start to see the new scripts of pharmacy bouncing back and some of those scripts that were restricted because of COVID coming back into play. Digital profitability, we think, will be a headwind for us as we continue to make progress, not only in the part that Rodney mentioned around digital media but also as we continue to improve the efficiency of the cost of order. 
And then on the headwind side, sales deleverage, of course, is a factor that's fully reflected in our model. Fuel, you mentioned, we have fully contemplated the initial investments in Ocado. They would be north of $100 million in our model for 2021 as well as we take the upfront costs of starting to ramp up the productivity in those first sites. 
We would also, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, continue to invest in [indiscernible] for our associates. And in addition to that, of course, there's still going to be some COVID costs that will continue in 2021 as we maintain a safe environment and continue to operate through the next phase of the pandemic."

Typically in the brick-and-mortar store, it's in the mid-teens, the mid- to high teens actually if you look at 2020 with a significantly ramped-up sales volume. And we talked about digital being in that mid-single-digit range. So when I talk about the improvement that we saw in Q4, it would be taking approximately 5% and essentially a 20% improvement on that. So taking it from mid-single digits up by -- up from, say, in the region of 5% to maybe 6.5% would be directionally the number that I was referring to when I shared that comment in the prepared remarks. 
And it really comes back to the 2 levers that we talked about in the last call and at our investor meeting in the fall last year, where we're extremely focused on continuing to use technology and process improvement to reduce the cost to fill a digital order.

And secondly, as Rodney alluded to in his last answer to John's question around media growth and the significant momentum we're seeing in media, most of that growth is coming through our digital channels because when customers engage with us digitally, we can truly personalize the experience. And that's where our CPG partners today get very excited about the unique value we can create for them by personalizing the offer and the promotion and driving a higher return on that spend. 
As we look at 2021, we would expect that has to continue to improve as we continue to accelerate the momentum in the 2 areas that I just mentioned. We'll share a lot more color at our Investor Day at the end of March and how we think about the overall path, but the goal that we've laid out for ourselves is to get to parity with the store profitability that I referenced earlier. And actually with Ocado, we believe there's potential to go beyond that level, too, as we roll out those facilities and get them up to full capacity."

And that's something we think is still important because we manage through all the changes and the unknowns that are in front of us. I think I shared earlier with the cost in Q4 was $275 million approximately. We would expect that number to be ramping down in the first half of the year, and certainly, as we reach the second half of 2021 as hopefully, we're in an environment where the COVID vaccine is more widely in place, then that would significantly see a slope down in those costs. 
So we expect it to be a continued gradual reduction as we move into the 2021 year and as we start to be able to continue to optimize the plans around safety and cleaning and processes and of course, as we're rolling out the vaccination. The reason it doesn't ramp down more quickly is that, as Rodney shared in his prepared comments, we we're very deliberate about wanting to really focus on helping our associates get the vaccination as quickly as possible with offering the $100 incentive to our associates to try and achieve that as quickly as we can."

I'll talk about some of the overall pieces and Gary can get into more of the specific numbers if he wants to add anything. As you know, all along, we've always said we believe that the customer will continue to transition to wanting to do some of their shopping online. And what we find is, by far, the majority of our customers that move online, they still physically go into our stores. So it's incredibly important for us to create a seamless experience to where customers can be bounced back and forth, be inspired on both channels. 
And we've always felt very strongly that job 1 was to make sure that we didn't lose any customers. One of the things that we have found that I mentioned, Gary and I both have mentioned, is during COVID, we had a lot of new customers and we had a lot of new customers that came to digital channels, both that had never shopped at Kroger before and people that deepened their relationship. So incrementally, we get a higher share of the household spend and those new customers is obviously incremental as well. 
Obviously, that has a certain benefit to profitability. We -- also, our operations team is doing an incredible job partnering with our technology team on changing the way how efficient we can pick an order in a store. If you look at over time, we would expect online to continue to grow, but we think it's massively critical to be able to have an experience where a customer still wants to come into a store and shop online. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have a 98% retention rate with that customer. 
And when you look at the overall online, we'll have a combination of Ocado facilities, some type of smaller regional type facilities and stores. And Ocado is an important part of that overall relationship from a technology and process change. So -- and then if you look at retail media, we still see huge growth opportunities there because the channel is just now starting to get momentum behind it, and people are finding that it's a great investment of their marketing dollars overall and they get a great return for that money. And by having first-party data, we can help people see whether they get a return on that spend or not. And one of the things that we believe in is total transparency with our customers there. Gary, anything you want to add on?"

The only thing, I guess, coming back to the big picture question of how we think about our model, as Rodney alluded to it in his comments, we shared this and we'll talk more about at the end of March around our value creation model. We feel very confident in our ability to continue to invest in the customer through digital and through what's valuable to them and our associates through average daily rate and do that in a balanced way as we continue to take cost out of the business and use our traffic to drive alternative profit streams. 
And we feel like we've got into that flywheel effect and believe that 2020 was an inflection point for digital as part of that as we hit a scale of over $10 million in sales and really pulling the different levers together to start to improve the profitability in the model as Rodney described. And I think when you take all that together, we believe through the journey of Restock Kroger, the combined 2 years of 2020 and 2021, we think, will look very strong in terms of TSR, and we come out of that with more momentum in our business because we were able to leverage that model and the investments that we made to support customers and our associates as we come through the other side of the pandemic."

As we think about the guidance that we've shared, that will be an interesting dynamic when you look at the numbers based on the individual year-over-year ID sales and then the 2-year stacked ID sales, I think will essentially will be kind of an inverse as you go through the year. So in the first part of the year, we would expect to be maybe even slightly below the bottom end of the range in terms of ID sales on the individual year 2021. 
But actually, at the top end and potentially even over the range on the 2-year stacked number, and then as the year progresses, the 2-year stacked number moves more towards the lower end or maybe even below the bottom end of the range but actually the current year identical sales improve significantly.

So we had a significant increase in the amount that they spent per transaction. If you look at the number of loyal shoppers, there was a ton of change in the numbers because of consolidation of households where people moved in with family members or shopping for other family members, things like that. 
So if you look, there's a decline in loyal shoppers but it's really hard to assign all of that to a customer not shopping with you anymore because what we find is a lot of those customers have consolidated with another -- a different household member because people moved back -- kids have moved in with parents or kids are buying for parents, things like that. 
If you look at new customers, the most new customers we've seen in a year, probably if you took the last 3 or 4 years added together, we had more new customers this year. We've done a couple of things on changing, where in the past, a new customer had to be with us a period of time before we started engaging with them on a personalized basis. Now we engage with them immediately. And we keep improving that personalization to be more and more directed to just that household as we learn more about them. And then hopefully, their understanding by being part of our ecosystem, the overall value we provide. 
On our fresh identicals, overall, they would be for the year. If you look at meat and produce and seafood and floral and those, it would be meaningfully higher than our overall IDs. If you look at deli, it would be behind, especially early in the year. Now we did continue to gain share in deli. But deli, especially in stores where we had a high lunchtime crowd of people coming in just for lunch that day, it definitely affected our deli business.

We did that specifically in 2019 because we were coming towards the end of Restock Kroger, and we've changed our long-term outlook so we wanted to make sure we gave everybody clarity on what the financial model would look like in 2020. So we haven't given specific numbers. 
With that being said, I think we've been pretty clear in our communication on our TSR model that we expect between 5% and 6% of our TSR algorithm to be generated from a payout ratio to our investors. And so if you think about that, then we'd certainly be expecting with that cash flow being strong within 2021, the amount of buybacks that we would do would be consistent with delivering on the payout ratio that we share within our TSR model, which is 5% to 6%. That includes the dividend at between 2% and 2.5%. 
So we'll share a little bit more color on how we're thinking about cash flow in general at the Investor Day because as I mentioned in my prepared comments, our free cash flow is significantly stronger over 2020 and '21 than our TSR model contemplates. And we're being very diligent in looking at what's the best way to deploy that free cash flow to make sure that we're accelerating growth in the company and delivering on the 8% to 11% beyond 2021 as we look at longer-term guidance."

And I think people have found that, that's really convenient. And I think about like toilet paper, the amount of toilet paper that's sold in bigger packs, the customer gets a better value and they're stocked up for a longer period of time. 
The other thing that, to me, is incredibly exciting because of our strong position in Fresh and our strong brands is that customers have upgraded in quality significantly. As I mentioned, if you look at the growth of Private Selection, we've had huge growth in Private Selection. If you look at the growth in Fresh on like seafood, there's been great growth there. People have learned how to cook seafood. All of those things, I think once you get addicted to something that's high quality, it's hard to go back. A small example that I remember growing up, I thought macaroni and cheese came out of a box and that was fine. Now I buy my cheese for macaroni and cheese from Murray's Cheese, and it's a completely different experience. And once you get used to that experience, it's hard to go back. And I think customers will continue to have those behaviors and they've learned how to cook. 
On share, the thing that we think is absolutely massively critical is Seamless and having an experience where a customer can easily switch between online and in-store because what we find is different shopping occasions, customers have a different need in terms of the channel to deliver that. And what we find is by being multichannel, it allows the customer to deal with it on their terms, not our terms. 
Fresh is always important. It's the #1 driver on where people decide where to shop is the quality of fresh. And if you were at some of our internal meetings, you would hear us making -- talk about all the things that we're doing to get better on Fresh. But if you look at our customers, they tell us versus our big box, we start out in a great position but you wouldn't know that if you look at the drive internally. And then Our Brands and then being able to personalize every experience one-on-one, those are the things that's going to allow us to continue to grow share."

We would expect within the guidance that we've shared, gross margin to be a -- to decline in 2021. And that's a combination of factors. So 1 of it would be the example you shared of mix. 
I think a good example of that would be we'd expect pharmacy and health and wellness business to continue to grow in 2021. And that has a lower gross margin rate than the overall business, excluding fuel, whereas obviously, we've guided to our overall sales being down in 2021. We would expect some sales deleverage as you think across things like shrink and advertising. But they would also be offset by sourcing benefits I mentioned earlier and alternative profit streams. So there's going to be some momentum in gross margin, too. But net-net, we think all of that results in a declining gross margin. 
And then conversely, we'd actually expect there to be an improvement in OG&A because of some of the items I used earlier on the call around the cost savings, the digital improvement in profitability and not cycling some of the COVID costs that we had in 2020."

With me today to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2020 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. 
This past year presented challenges that none of us could have predicted. I am so proud of how Team Kroger has risen to meet every challenge and to be there for our customers when they've needed us the most. While we hope that the worst of the pandemic is behind us and we are encouraged by the progress around the initial vaccine rollout, our priority remains the health and safety of our associates, customers and communities. 
2020 was the final year of our 3-year transformational plan, Restock Kroger, during which we made strategic investments and changes to our business model to better serve our customers. We focused on widening and deepening our competitive moats, which include Seamless, Personalization, Fresh and Our Brands. As a result, we generated strong momentum and successfully repositioned our company to serve our customers in new and exciting ways.
Let me now turn to our results. Kroger delivered strong results during our fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. We continued to gain market share, and full year results were above the guidance we shared with you last quarter. Identical sales without fuel were 14.1% for the year as customers continued to consolidate trips and spend more per transaction. We grew digital sales triple digits in 2020, enabled by our team's ability to pivot quickly and effectively in the first stage of the pandemic to ensure that we were meeting our customers' demand for safe, low-touch and touchless shopping modalities. 
Our strong performance in digital is also a testament to the proactive investments we made over the last several years in our network, which positioned Kroger to respond with agility during this crisis and critical time. Beyond the numbers, we have built substantial momentum within our business and, more importantly, we continue to deepen our personalized relationships with our customers who remain at the center of everything we do. 
When the pandemic started, no one knew what to expect. But what we did know was that our decisions and actions would be guided by our purpose and our values. Our purpose is to feed the human spirit, which means we are driven to do more and help make the lives of those around us better, especially during times of uncertainty. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic last March, our most urgent priority has been to safeguard our associates and customers. We've implemented dozens of new safety and cleanliness processes and procedures in our stores and all of our facilities, including safety partitions and physical distancing floor decals, implementation of customer capacity limits and providing PPE like masks for our associates, all of which are described in our Blueprint for Businesses, an open source guide we've created to help other companies navigate the complexities of safely operating during a pandemic. 
Supported by our strong performance and cash position, we've committed more than $2.5 billion to safeguard the environment of our associates and customers where they work and shop in and to reward associates, including committing nearly $1 billion to better secure pensions for over 30,000 associates. This was in addition to paid emergency leave, financial assistance through our Helping Hand Funds program and much more. We continue to provide support for our associates including awards in November and February that included $100 cash and 1,000 fuel points placed on frontline associate shopper cards to help ease financial hardship from the pandemic and as a thank you for their continued commitment to serving our customers so tirelessly. 
We know the critical role that the COVID vaccine plays in creating a safe environment for our associates and customers. That's why we're encouraging everyone to receive the vaccine as soon as they're eligible to do so. During the quarter, we announced a $100 incentive for all associates who received the manufacturer-recommended dosage of the vaccine. We hope this offer, along with targeted education efforts, will help break through vaccine hesitancy and further encourage the health and safety of our associates. 
Kroger Health is proud to be a partner with the federal government and our state governments in distributing the vaccine. We continue to introduce initiatives to improve the vaccination process, including the recent launch of a new scheduling tool and enhancements to our website to make finding and scheduling vaccine appointments easier. To date, Kroger Health has administrated more than 665,000 vaccines, including more than 38,000 for our own associates. 
Because vaccine availability and eligibility continues to vary by jurisdiction, we are advocating at the local, state and federal level and calling for our associates and frontline grocery workers broadly to be included in the earliest vaccine phase possible. Inspired by purpose and guided by our values, 2020 taught us that we are capable of doing more, of moving faster and effectively prioritizing what matters most to our customers, associates and communities. 
In addition to changing how we work, COVID-19 has changed how our customers enjoy food. We continue to see people eat and work more from home and prioritize health and cleanliness. We believe that these trends will continue even as restrictions ease and vaccinations are distributed. We will share more of these trends with you at our Investor Day in a few weeks. 
What hasn't changed is our fundamental commitment to provide -- to putting our customers first. Our competitive moats, Seamless, Personalization, Fresh and Our Brands, are built upon this commitment and are stronger today than ever before, especially as customers eat more food at home. We will continue to invest in these critical competitive advantages as we work to win a larger share of the food-at-home market. 
Let me provide some more detail on each of these competitive moats. Pick-up and delivery continued to grow during the quarter, and we are seeing more and more new customers engaging in our Seamless ecosystem. Our overall digital sales grew 118%, including delivery sales growth of 249% during the quarter. When customers engage in both our in-store and online modalities, we see a 98% retention rate within our ecosystem, highlighting how sticky our customer engagement is. 
During the quarter, we also saw further improvement in digital profitability as we continue to improve cost efficiency, sales mix and retail media. Yesterday, we completed the inaugural order through our first Ocado shed in Monroe, Ohio. This marks the soft opening of the facility, and we look forward to our brand opening in early April. We continue to be excited about the elevated experience that this will bring to our customers in the tri-state area and across the country as we continue to open additional facilities. 
Our data and personalization allow us to deliver meaningful, unique customer moments across channels to address specific customer needs while enhancing their relationship with Kroger. 60 million households shop with Kroger every year. The scale of our digital business has grown rapidly. In fact, during 2020, we had over 1.3 billion customer interactions across our digital modalities, a 30% increase over last year. Our significant reach allows us to meaningfully personalize the customer experience. 
In 2020, we presented nearly 11 million (sic) [ billion ] personalized recommendations per week. That's right, 11 billion recommendations personalized each week. When you look at that over the year, that's more than 0.5 trillion offered personalized for customers during 2020. 
We achieved several exciting milestones in Fresh this year. As more customers are spending more time at home, our produce and floral departments outperformed total company. Customers are focused on eating healthier, as evidenced by the increased engagement in our Simple Truth brands, which grew 18% during the quarter. 
We also saw customers trading up and buying higher-quality premium products like luxury wine and Murray's Cheese, which also outperformed the total company. As customers look for food inspiration, we continue to develop innovative products to meet their needs, including ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat foods. We have seen significant growth in Deli Bakery and meal solution, and Home Chef finished the year with record sales, capturing additional share of stomach from restaurants and grocery retailers. 
Also this quarter, our Fresh for Everyone campaign celebrated its first anniversary. The marketing campaign is reaching new heights in ad effectiveness and is resonating with our customers. Our brands achieved its best year ever in 2020, exceeding $26.2 billion in sales. Our Simple Truth brand achieved a major milestone, exceeding $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. And this is a brand that was just -- that was created from scratch a little over 5 years ago. We saw a 20% growth in our premium culinary brand, Private Selection, as more people continue cooking at home and elevating their meals. 
Our Simple Truth plant-based platform launched 53 new items in 2020. One of the key launches for the year was Simple Truth Oat Milk ice cream. This line has brought new customers to the category and sales are continuing to outpace projections. Over 1.4 million new households have purchased from the Simple Truth plant-based platform this year as we hold high standards for the taste and experience of our plant-based products, just like the rest of Our Brand's portfolio. Our trial rate has continued to grow and our repeat rate has continued to strengthen. 
Kroger is committing to helping people and our planet. This is at the core of who we are as a company. During 2020, this work became even more critical as our communities experienced the pandemic and its economic impacts, social unrest and natural disasters. Let me provide some detail on 2 important areas under our broader ESG strategy, diversity, equity and inclusion, and our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste efforts to improve food access and food security. 
Diversity and inclusion are among Kroger's long-standing core values. In October, we introduced a 10-point framework for action to accelerate diversity, equity and inclusion and promote greater change in the workplace and in our communities. As part of this framework, we created an internal advisory council comprised of black leaders and associates across the company to help set priorities and drive meaningful change.
The Kroger Co. Foundation also established a $5 million racial equity fund to align philanthropy to our extended commitment. So far, the foundation has directed $3 million in grants to 4 organizations with innovative approaches to building stronger, more equitable communities. COVID-19 and its impact also shined a light on the intersection of food security, health and nutrition and racial equity. Given the increased need in 2020, Kroger nearly doubled our charitable giving to the Feeding America network of food banks and supported key partners like No Kid Hungry to direct meals where needed most. 
We are pleased to note that our associates continue to rescue surplus food throughout the year despite heavy stockpiling periods early in the year. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste is the centerpiece of our ESG strategy and it's how our associates live our purpose every day. 
I would now like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our quarter 4 and full year 2020 financial results. Gary?"

We are extremely proud of our results in 2020 and the balance achieved in delivering for all our key stakeholders, our associates, customers, communities and shareholders. Strong execution by our team and accelerated investments in our competitive moats during the pandemic allowed us to create significant value to shareholders and strengthen our balance sheet. 
The momentum we see in our business, which started pre pandemic and accelerated during the pandemic places us in an even better position to grow sales and profitability in the future and deliver on our TSR commitments. Proof points of the accelerated momentum in our model achieved during 2020 include: significant market share gains, accelerated investments in Fresh and digital experience, over $1 billion of cost savings, $150 million of incremental alternative profit and improved digital profitability. 
Let me share additional color on each of these points. The change in customer behavior caused by COVID was, of course, a major factor in our results last year. This brought to the forefront the importance to the customer of fresh and digital. We continue to invest and aggressively grow our capabilities in these areas of strength for Kroger, leading to significant gains in both digital and total food-at-home market share. Consistent with our value creation model, we were disciplined in balancing investments in our customers and associates with cost savings. For the third year in a row, our operations and sourcing teams delivered over $1 billion in incremental cost savings. These savings continue to be focused in areas that take complexity out of the business and allow our associates to provide a better customer experience. 
Alternative profit continues to be a significant growth driver in our model and contributed $150 million of incremental operating profit on top of the $100 million of incremental profit in 2019. Retail media fueled this acceleration, and we continue to see significant opportunity for additional growth in the future. Importantly, this progress with cost savings and growth of retail media also allowed us to improve the profitability of our digital model in 2020, as we reduced the cost to fulfill a digital order and grew media revenue from digital sales. 
I'll now provide more color on our full year results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $3.47 per diluted share, up 58% compared to last year and ahead of the range we shared during quarter 3. Identical sales, excluding fuel, were 14.1%, in line with expectations. And our adjusted FIFO operating profit also came in at the top end of our increased guidance. Gross margin was 23.3% of sales for 2020. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 14 basis points, reflecting sales leverage, continued growth in alternative profit streams and sourcing benefits, offset by continued investments in price and value for customers. 
Our OG&A rate without fuel and adjustment items decreased 6 basis points, reflecting increased sales leverage and execution of cost savings, offset by COVID-related investments to reward associates and to protect the health and safety of associates, customers and our communities. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.81 per diluted share, up 42% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 10.6%, driven by continued strength in grocery, produce and meat. Digital sales grew 118% during the quarter, outpacing the full year rate as customers continued to rely heavily on our digital modalities. Digital contributed approximately 5.5% to total identical sales without fuel. And as a result of productivity improvements in the cost to fulfill a digital order and accelerated retail media revenue, we improved pass-through profitability on digital sales by over 20% in the fourth quarter. 
FIFO gross margin rate decreased 6 basis points, with continued price investments offset by growth in alternative profit streams and sourcing benefits. Our OG&A rate without fuel and adjustment items decreased 7 basis points, which reflects increased sales leverage and execution and cost savings, offset by continued COVID-related investments to reward our associates and to protect the health and safety of associates, customers and our communities. 
During the fourth quarter, the incremental COVID-related investments were approximately $275 million. LIFO was a credit for the quarter of $84 million. The LIFO credit was primarily driven by fourth quarter working capital improvements in pharmacy inventory and dairy deflation. The income tax rate of 30.8% was a benefit for the fourth quarter as a result of the UFCW pension restructure charge. 
Fuel was a headwind of approximately $50 million to net operating profit during quarter 4. Like the broader industry, we experienced a year-over-year decline in fuel gallons, and the average retail price of fuel was also lower at $2.20 this quarter versus $2.58 in the same quarter last year. 
As Rodney touched on earlier, our associates have been nothing short of amazing over the past year, and we continue to invest in and reward our associates for their incredible work. We invested approximately $300 million in increased hourly wage during 2020 as part of the $800 million incremental investment in associate wages previously announced as part of Restock Kroger. Our average hourly rate is now $15.50, up from $15 last year. And with comprehensive benefits factored in, our average hourly rate is over $20. In 2021, we expect to invest an incremental $350 million in continued average hourly wage increases for our associates. 
Looking ahead, we have several major labor negotiations in 2021, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Atlanta, Houston, Little Rock, Michigan, Memphis, Mid-Atlantic, Cincinnati and Portland. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. 
Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
Turning now to our financial strategy. As a result of our strong operating performance, Kroger generated tremendous free cash flow in 2020, which resulted in a significant strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. We reduced net total debt by $2 billion over the last 4 quarters, and Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.75 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. 
Our financial strategy remains unchanged, and we will continue to evaluate how to deploy excess cash in ways that will accelerate our value creation model by sustainably growing earnings and delivering on our TSR commitment of 8% to 11%. 
Looking towards 2021, we are providing specific guidance to help you better understand how we see the business today. Due to the uncertainty surrounding trends in the food-at-home market as COVID vaccines roll out, we are sharing a wider range than we typically would, and we will be transparent in sharing more as the year unfolds. Our insights suggest there are a number of consumer changes that have occurred during the pandemic that will prove to be more structural and lasting, which, combined with our strong execution and flexible financial model, give us confidence we will be able to manage through the current unknowns. 
As we cycle the tough comparisons from 2020, we expect our sales will turn negative in 2021 and are guiding to a range of negative 3% to negative 5% identical sales, excluding fuel, and adjusted FIFO operating profit of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion in 2021. Evaluating our performance using a 2-year period will more accurately measure our underlying momentum. We expect our 2-year stacked identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 9% and 11%. 
In addition, we expect our adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to have compounded annual growth rates of between 12% and 16%, and 5.4% and 8.5%, respectively. Over the 2 years, this would result in total shareholder return significantly above our previously communicated target of 8% to 11%. 
We expect our free cash flow to be at least $1.6 billion in 2021, which includes a payment of $300 million for payroll taxes deferred from 2020. Over the course of 2020 and 2021, average annual free cash flow is forecast to be between $2.9 billion and $3 billion. This excludes the sale of strategic assets, company's funds and pension contributions and pension payments related to the restructuring of multi-employer pension plans. 
These 2-year expectations are ahead of our TSR growth algorithm, and we believe the momentum in our business places us in an even better position to grow profitably in the future. We remain committed to delivering strong and attractive shareholder -- total shareholder return over the long term and expect our 2021 operating profit guidance to represent a new higher baseline from which we will deliver future TSR of 8% to 11%. 
Finally, we look forward to sharing more about our strategy for growth and delivering on our TSR commitments at our upcoming Investor Day. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Rodney."

On your first question, we would expect alternative profits to continue to be a driver. As you know, 2020 was higher than 2019.

On your first question, we would expect alternative profits to continue to be a driver. As you know, 2020 was higher than 2019. We think 2021, incrementally, will be a little bit lower than 2020 but very similar, and part of it will, obviously, as the year progresses. 
As you know, the 2 major parts of alternative profit: one is Kroger Personal Finance, and we believe that will get back on track. Obviously, the pandemic has impacted gift card sales and some of those things which has affected it. If you look at retail media, retail media is increasingly becoming a channel that companies look to advertise in. And it's a double win for us because it's an incredibly effective way for CPGs and others to advertise, and they get great insight on how good they do. And if you look at our data, especially and recently, there was an independent report that showed how Kroger -- how well our retail media does when somebody invests in Kroger. 
So we think that will continue to be an important part of the model and an incredible, important part of the growth. And as you know, our digital channel continues to grow as well. We would expect fuel to be a headwind from a profitability standpoint in 2021, especially earlier in the year, but we would expect gallons to turn around and have meaningful growth in gallons. But the total gallons will still be less than what they were in 2019. And for us, fuel is just a great way of providing rewards to our customers that they care about, and we are starting to see people starting to drive a little more, and it's one way to reward customers for shopping with us that's unique to Kroger. 
If you look at promotional intensity, we would expect it to remain similar to where it is. So far, we haven't really seen a lot different. One of the things that I think everybody knows is that when you start cycling, it's because things beyond your company. I think in the past, a lot of times when promotional intensity started, it started because somebody thought they were losing share. And the insights and data is so much better where people can see where they are in market share. And we still continue to see people shopping more for food at home versus in some of the other channels, so that will help all boats to rise. So that's what we see at the moment. Now over time, it will play out. Gary, I don't know if you want to add anything on to the -- John's first question on operating profit."

I think maybe the only thing I would add is that you picked on a couple of the moving parts in the model for next year. As you might imagine, when we're cycling a year like 2020, there's going to be quite a few pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that represent the overall guidance that we shared for operating profit. 
I'll maybe just provide a little bit more color on the big pieces. As I mentioned, you certainly has done a couple of them without profit and fuel. The other things I would say in the sort of the tailwind category would be there will be certain costs, as you might imagine, related to COVID, that we won't have to cycle in 2021. Incentive costs, we'd also expect to be lower than they would have been in 2020. We continue to take out costs so we'd expect another $1 billion of cost savings as part of the model in 2021 as we continue to achieve balance across productivity improvements, sourcing savings, administrative savings. And in administrative savings, we're taking some of those learnings from COVID and how we can continue to operate more leanly and some of those lasting changes that can help us operate more efficiently. 
We would expect health and wellness to be a tailwind in 2021 as you start to see the new scripts of pharmacy bouncing back and some of those scripts that were restricted because of COVID coming back into play. Digital profitability, we think, will be a headwind for us as we continue to make progress, not only in the part that Rodney mentioned around digital media but also as we continue to improve the efficiency of the cost of that order. 
And then on the headwind side, sales deleverage, of course, is a factor that's fully reflected in our model. Fuel, you mentioned, we have fully contemplated the initial investments in Ocado. They would be north of $100 million in our model for 2021 as well as we take the upfront costs of starting to ramp up the productivity in those first sites. 
We would also, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, continue to invest in average hourly wage for our associates. And in addition to that, of course, there's still going to be some COVID costs that will continue in 2021 as we maintain a safe environment and continue to operate through the next phase of the pandemic."

So we mentioned before, as you know, that our digital pass-through rates profitability is lower than our store profitability. Typically, in the brick-and-mortar store, it's in the mid-teens, the mid- to high teens actually if you look at 2020 with a significantly ramped-up sales volume. And we talked about digital being in that mid-single-digit range. So when I talk about the improvement that we saw in Q4, it would be taking approximately 5% and, essentially, a 20% improvement on that. So taking it from mid-single digits up by -- up from, say, in the region of 5% to maybe 6.5% would be directionally the number that I was referring to when I shared that comment in the prepared remarks. 
And it really comes back to the 2 levers that we talked about in the last call and at our investor meeting in the fall last year, where we're extremely focused on continuing to use technology and process improvement to reduce the cost to fill a digital order. And we've made significant progress there across our technology and operations teams. 
And secondly, as Rodney alluded to in his last answer to John's question around media growth and the significant momentum we're seeing in media, most of that growth is coming through our digital channels because when customers engage with us digitally, we can truly personalize the experience, and that's where our CPG partners today get very excited about the unique value we can create for them by personalizing the offer and the promotion and driving a higher return on that spend. 
As we look at 2021, we would expect that has to continue to improve, as we continue to accelerate the momentum in the 2 areas that I just mentioned. We'll share a lot more color at our Investor Day at the end of March and how we think about the overall path, but the goal that we've laid out for ourselves is to get to parity with the store profitability that I referenced earlier. And actually, with Ocado, we believe there's potential to go beyond that level, too, as we roll out those facilities and get them up to full capacity."

And that's something we think is still important as we manage through all the changes and the unknowns that are in front of us. 
I think I shared earlier with the cost in Q4 was $275 million approximately. We would expect that number to be ramping down in the first half of the year, and certainly, as we reach the second half of 2021 as, hopefully, we're in an environment where the COVID vaccine is more widely in place, then that would significantly see a slope down in those costs. 
So we expect it to be a continued gradual reduction as we move into the 2021 year and as we start to be able to continue to optimize the plans around safety and cleaning and processes and, of course, as we're rolling out the vaccination. The reason it doesn't ramp down more quickly is that, as Rodney shared in his prepared comments, we we're very deliberate about wanting to really focus on helping our associates get the vaccination as quickly as possible, with offering the $100 incentive to our associates to try and achieve that as quickly as we can."

I'll talk about some of the overall pieces, and Gary can get into more of the specific numbers if he wants to add anything. As you know, all along, we've always said we believe that the customer will continue to transition to wanting to do some of their shopping online. And what we find is, by far, the majority of our customers that move online, they still physically go into our stores. So it's incredibly important for us to create a seamless experience to where customers can be -- bounce back and forth, be inspired on both channels. 
And we've always felt very strongly that job 1 was to make sure that we didn't lose any customers. One of the things that we have found that I mentioned, Gary and I both have mentioned, is during COVID, we had a lot of new customers and we had a lot of new customers that came to digital channels, both that had never shopped at Kroger before and people that deepened their relationship. So incrementally, we get a higher share of the household spend, and those new customers is obviously incremental as well. 
Obviously, that has a certain benefit to profitability. We -- also, our operations team is doing an incredible job partnering with our technology team on changing the way, how efficient we can pick an order in a store. If you look at, over time, we would expect online to continue to grow, but we think it's massively critical to be able to have an experience where a customer still wants to come into a store and shop online. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have a 98% retention rate with that customer. 
And when you look at the overall online, we'll have a combination of Ocado facilities, some type of smaller regional type facilities and stores. And Ocado is an important part of that overall relationship from a technology and process change. So -- and then if you look at retail media, we still see huge growth opportunities there because the channel is just now starting to get momentum behind it and people are finding that it's a great investment of their marketing dollars, overall, and they get a great return for that money. And by having first-party data, we can help people see whether they get a return on that spend or not. And one of the things that we believe in its total transparency with our customers there. Gary, anything you want to add on that?"

The only thing, I guess, coming back to the big picture question of how we think about our model, as Rodney alluded to it in his comments, we shared this and we'll talk more about it at the end of March around our value creation model. We feel very confident in our ability to continue to invest in the customer through digital and through what's valuable to them and our associates through average hourly rate and do that in a balanced way as we continue to take cost out of the business and use our traffic to drive alternative profit streams. 
And we feel like we've got into that flywheel effect and believe that 2020 was an inflection point for digital as part of that as we hit a scale of over $10 billion in sales and really pulling the different levers together to start to improve the profitability in the model, as Rodney described. And I think when you take all that together, we believe through the journey of Restock Kroger, the combined 2 years of 2020 and 2021, we think, will look very strong in terms of TSR, and we come out of that with more momentum in our business because we were able to leverage that model and the investments that we made to support customers and our associates as we come through the other side of the pandemic."

As we think about the guidance that we've shared, that will be an interesting dynamic when you look at the numbers based on the individual year-over-year ID sales and then the 2-year stacked ID sales, and it will, essentially will be kind of an inverse as you go through the year. So in the first part of the year, we would expect to be maybe even slightly below the bottom end of the range in terms of ID sales on the individual year 2021. But actually, at the top end and potentially even over the range on the 2-year stacked number. And then as the year progresses, the 2-year stacked number moves more towards the lower end or maybe even below the bottom end of the range, but actually the current year identical sales improve significantly.

So if you look, there's a decline in loyal shoppers, but it's really hard to assign all of that to a customer not shopping with you anymore because what we find is a lot of those customers have consolidated with another -- a different household member because people moved back. Kids have moved in with parents, or kids are buying for parents, things like that. 
If you look at new customers, the most new customers we've seen in a year, probably if you took the last 3 or 4 years added together, we had more new customers this year. We've done a couple of things on changing, where in the past, a new customer had to be with us a period of time before we started engaging with them on a personalized basis. Now we engage with them immediately. And we keep improving that personalization to be more and more directed to just that household as we learn more about them. And then, hopefully, they were understanding by being part of our ecosystem, the overall value we provide. 
On our fresh identicals, overall, they would be for the year. If you look at meat and produce and seafood and floral and those, it would be meaningfully higher than our overall IDs. If you look at deli, it would be behind, especially early in the year. Now we did continue to gain share in deli. But deli, especially in stores where we had a high lunchtime crowd of people coming in just for lunch that day, it definitely affected our deli business. So if you look at within deli, like deli sliced meats and things had great growth, but other pieces of it was a little different than that."

We feel good about where we are on gaps versus all of our competitors. And as you know, customers decide where to shop based on fresh and friendliness of service and other things in addition to price. 
It's fascinating that the customer sensitivity to price really doesn't seem to be changing much, but when they get money in their pocket, they definitely spend more and they are definitely upgrading to higher-quality products as well. So it doesn't appear that there's a huge change in price sensitivity, but there is change in terms of when somebody gets the government stimulus money, things like that, you can definitely see that flowing through on spending.

We would expect the promotional environment to be higher in 2021, of course, than '20 because there was a period of time where a number of our competitors were not promoting. 
That being said, I think it's important to remember, a lot of our investments in 2020 were promotional in nature so we can cycle those again and deploy them where they have the most value for the customer based on the way that they are defining value as they come through the pandemic. And as Rodney mentioned, we feel very good about our position, and the market seems to be acting generally pretty rationally around. It's going to be a unique year in '21 that we're cycling, obviously, a change in customer behavior. And we believe we're well positioned to manage through that."

And a second question would be regarding your capital allocation guidance for the year. How are you thinking about share repurchases and where returning cash to shareholders maybe shakes out in your cash utilization priority ranking in '21?"

We -- I think as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we really think about managing the gross margin and the OG&A as a balance within our overall financial model. So we generally don't get into specific elements. As you might imagine, we did see sales leverage and shrink improvement throughout the year, and we talked about that in some of our results. 
We've taken very much a balanced approach, though, to be investing in areas in the business where we believe that sets us up for continued growth in 2021. And that's why I think we do feel good about the position we go in next year, having managed through the balance of maintaining those investments in the customer and our associates and being able to then manage through the transition next year and still deliver what we think, by the end of the year, will be a strong outcome and significantly ahead of our overall TSR model. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we'll share more again at the Investor Day at the end of March. We haven't given specific guidance on buybacks. We did that specifically in 2019 because we were coming towards the end of Restock Kroger, and we've changed our long-term outlook so we wanted to make sure we gave everybody clarity on what the financial model would look like in 2020. So we haven't given specific numbers. 
With that being said, I think we've been pretty clear in our communication on our TSR model that we expect between 5% and 6% of our TSR algorithm to be generated from a payout ratio to our investors. And so if you think about that, then we'd certainly be expecting with that cash flow being strong within 2021, the amount of buybacks that we would do would be consistent with delivering on the payout ratio that we share within our TSR model, which is 5% to 6%. That includes the dividend at between 2% and 2.5%. 
So we'll share a little bit more color on how we're thinking about cash flow in general at the Investor Day because, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, our free cash flow is significantly stronger over 2020 and '21 than our TSR model contemplates. And we're being very diligent in looking at what's the best way to deploy that free cash flow to make sure that we're accelerating growth in the company and delivering on the 8% to 11% beyond 2021 as we look at longer-term guidance."

And I think people have found that, that's really convenient. And I think about like toilet paper, the amount of toilet paper that's sold in bigger packs, the customer gets a better value and they're stocked up for a longer period of time. 
The other thing that, to me, is incredibly exciting because of our strong position in Fresh and our strong brands is that customers have upgraded in quality significantly. As I mentioned, if you look at the growth in Private Selection, we've had huge growth in Private Selection. If you look at the growth in Fresh on like seafood, there's been great growth there. People have learned how to cook seafood. 
All of those things, I think once you get addicted to something that's high quality, it's hard to go back. A small example that I remember growing up, I thought macaroni and cheese came out of a box and that was fine. Now I buy my cheese for macaroni and cheese from Murray's Cheese, and it's a completely different experience. And once you get used to that experience, it's hard to go back. 
And I think customers will continue to have those behaviors and they've learned how to cook. 
On share, the thing that we think is absolutely massively critical is Seamless and having an experience where a customer can easily switch between online and in-store because what we find is different shopping occasions, customers have a different need in terms of the channel to deliver that. And what we find is by being multichannel, it allows the customer to deal with it on their terms, not our terms. 
Fresh is always important. It's the #1 driver on where people decide where to shop, is the quality of Fresh. And if you were at some of our internal meetings, you would hear us making -- talk about all the things that we're doing to get better on Fresh. But if you look at our customers, they tell us versus our big box, we start out in a great position but you wouldn't know that if you look at the drive internally. And then Our Brands and then being able to personalize every experience one-on-one, those are the things that's going to allow us to continue to grow share."

We would expect, within the guidance that we've shared, gross margin to be a -- to decline in 2021. And that's a combination of factors. So one of it would be the example you shared in mix. I think a good example of that would be, we'd expect pharmacy and health and wellness business to continue to grow in 2021. And that has a lower gross margin rate than the overall business, excluding fuel, whereas, obviously, we've guided to our overall sales being down in 2021. We would expect some sales deleverage as you think across things like shrink and advertising. But they would also be offset by sourcing benefits, as I mentioned earlier, and alternative profit streams. So there's going to be some momentum in gross margin, too. But net-net, we think all of that results in a declining gross margin. 
And then conversely, we'd actually expect there to be an improvement in OG&A because of some of the items I mentioned earlier on the call around the cost savings, the digital improvement in profitability and not cycling some of the COVID costs that we had in 2020."

While the COVID-19 health crisis has not ended, this is the first quarter where we saw significant signs of recovery and the beginning of a return to what we are hopeful will be a new normal. Our quarter results demonstrate that Kroger is even better positioned today to connect with our customers than we were before the pandemic, because of our relentless focus on Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital for our customers. 
I'm incredibly proud of our amazing associates, who continue to be there for our customers, communities and each other. Because of our associates' commitment, Kroger's first quarter Identical sales without fuel grew ahead of our internal expectations. Digital sales grew triple digits since the beginning of 2019. We saw a strong growth in alternative profits and significant progress with our cost savings initiatives. All of this gives us confidence to raise its guidance for the year and announce a new $1 billion share buyback program. 
I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing 3 key areas: first, how customer behavior is changing in this transition period; second, how we are Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital; finally, I will highlight how we continue to live our purpose to feed the human spirit through the associate experience and our work to vaccinate millions of Americans. 
Our customers are in a time of transition. During the quarter, we began to see some pre-pandemic habits resume. For example, smaller holiday gatherings are likely to fade as more than half of our shoppers believe holidays will return to normal by the 4th of July. We are also seeing customers shop more frequently as COVID restrictions ease. Importantly, we saw a continuation of several pandemic trends. This includes heightened digital engagement across demographics; expanded consumption in key fresh areas like meat, produce and natural foods; and trading up to more premium products. 
New trends are emerging as well as customers settle into new routines. In a recent survey of our customers, a remarkable 92% of the people say they enjoy cooking the same or more than they did pre-COVID. And as people's busy social lives pick up, more customers are looking for convenience in cooking options. We continue to utilize our data to understand those behaviors that are more permanent in nature. Whether customer habits are returning, hardening or emerging, we will continue to meet the customer where they are and use our data science expertise to be where they are going. 
As we discussed during our Investor Day, fresh is incredibly important to our customers. Our produce fresh score metrics continue to improve, and we are testing and learning through end-to-end fresh initiatives to consistently improve the experience and deliver even more value to our customers. We announced our Go Fresh & Local Supplier Accelerator, providing more local and regional suppliers the opportunity to partner with Kroger and providing our buyers with the opportunity to discover new suppliers who share our commitment to advancing freshness, quality and our Fresh for Everyone commitment. In fact, since launching on May 12, we have already received more than 1,000 applications to participate. 
We are building on the momentum of 2020 within our seamless ecosystem through expanded capacity, improved customer experience and continuous innovation. During the first quarter, we expanded capacity by 15% to support our continued sales growth. Our teams worked together to improve in-stock fill rates and further reduced wait time at car side, enhancing -- both enhancing the customer experience. To date, we have over 2 million time slots available per week to serve our customers the fresh food and essential products they want when they want it. 
We continue to expand our seamless ecosystem through our new customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado. We opened our first facility in Ohio in March and at the beginning of June, launched Kroger delivery in Florida. Launching in a new geography is incredibly exciting and a milestone moment in our history. Our Kroger delivery team is ready to bring fresh, affordable food and a consistent customer experience directly to the doors of our customers. In addition to the [ Grovel and CFC ], [ Bespoke ] in Tampa and Jacksonville are also now open. The hub and spoke model allows us to extend the range of our CFC, allowing us to serve more customers' incredible products directly to their door. 
And we are just getting started. We are thrilled to report that NPS scores are among the highest in the digital retail and we continue to be pleased with our fill rates and our on-time delivery metrics. Kroger's data and personalization capabilities will contribute to increasingly meaningful ways to grow our e-commerce reach and capabilities, and we continue to elevate our personalized customer experience with our data today. During the quarter, we made more than 258 billion personalized recommendations to our customers through our digital experience. 
At Kroger, we have always known that our associates are the heart of our business. We are proud of our opportunity culture, where people can come for a job and stay for a career. More than 70% of our store directors began as part-time clerks. We are building a connected culture that embraces agility and collaboration, and that celebrates and incentivizes lifelong learning and growth. For example, since launching it in 2017, our industry-leading education assistance program has helped more than 6,300 associates take steps to learn and grow as individuals and employees. That is one of many ways we invest in our associates. We continue to invest in wages, with our average hourly rate increasing during quarter 1 as well. We are on track to increase our average hourly rate to over $16. And with comprehensive benefits, our average hourly rate will be approaching $21 by the end of the year. 
As we have done throughout the pandemic, Kroger remains committed to health and safety. To support the Biden Administration's goal to have at least 70% of U.S. adults receive their first COVID-19 vaccine dose by July 4, we launched an aggressive customer and associate marketing campaign and community immunity giveaway. Next week, we will announce the first $1 million winner and 10 free groceries for a year winners. Since announcing the giveaway, we are running 29% ahead of forecasted vaccinations. To date, Kroger Health has administrated over 5 million vaccines in our pharmacies and clinic locations and at community sites across the country. 
Now I would like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our first quarter results. Gary?"
284342,717294535,2322598,"The Kroger Co., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Jun 17, 2021",2021-06-17,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger delivered strong results in the first quarter, providing a further proof point of the momentum we have created in our business model.

Kroger delivered strong results in the first quarter, providing a further proof point of the momentum we have created in our business model. We continue to execute our priorities of Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital, which led to top line sales results ahead of our internal expectations. We were disciplined in balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and achieved record growth in alternative profit streams. While year-over-year comparisons are impacted by the pandemic, as well by the dramatic change in customer behavior we saw in quarter 1 last year due to COVID-19, looking over a 2-year time horizon, our adjusted EPS of $1.19 represents a compounded annual growth rate of 28.6% versus 2019. 
I'll now provide additional color on our first quarter results. Identical sales without fuel declined 4.1%, which translates to a 2-year stacked growth of 14.9%. Digital sales grew 16% on top of the 92% growth during quarter 1 of 2020, and we continue to make progress in improving the sustainability of our digital business. As previously shared, 2 key drivers of long-term digital profitability are the cost to fill a digital order and the retail media revenue generated from a digital transaction. In the first quarter, we reduced the amount of time taken to pick a digital order by 5% and increased media revenue per digital basket by 33%. 
Gross margin was 22.6% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 65 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was wholly attributable to sales deleverage, higher shrink and the COVID-19-related inventory write-down for PPE to be donated to community partners. Pricing investments during the quarter and the impact of mix changes as a result of cycling COVID-19 trends last year were fully offset by sourcing benefits and alternative profit growth. On a 2-year basis, our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 21 basis points compared to 2019. 
The operating general and administrative rate decreased 108 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items, reflecting our continued discipline in cost management. This improvement was driven by decreased COVID-19-related costs, lower contributions to multi-employer pension plans, execution of cost-saving initiatives and decreased incentive costs, partially offset by sales deleverage. On a 2-year basis, our OG&A rate decreased by 58 basis points compared to 2019, and we remain on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings for the fourth consecutive year. 
Alternative profit achieved record profit growth during the quarter, led by exceptional growth in retail media. Kroger Personal Finance also delivered double-digit profit growth, with strong performance across several key product areas. Based on our performance in the first quarter, we now expect alternative profit growth to be towards the top end of our goal of $100 million to $150 million of incremental profit in 2021. 
Fuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition. Gallons grew in the first quarter by 13% as we started to cycle the impact of COVID-19 last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.79 this quarter versus $2.13 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.35 compared to $0.48 in the same quarter last year. While fuel was a headwind to operating profit of approximately $130 million versus 2020, we were encouraged by our trends, which were better than expected. 
Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to investing in the business to drive long-term sustainable net earnings growth, maintaining its current investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to shareholders via share repurchase and a growing dividend over time. Last month, we announced the restructuring of the Sound Pension Trust. Similar to previous multi-employer pension restructurings, this transaction will improve security and stability of future pension benefits for those associates, while also minimizing our future exposure to market risk and produces a return on investment above our internal hurdle rate by mitigating future pension contribution costs. On an after-tax basis, $344 million will be needed to execute the transaction and we expect this to be funded evenly over 7 years. 
Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.79 compared to 1.81 a year ago. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5. Net total debt increased during the quarter primarily due to the company entering into a transaction to purchase and then immediately sell a portfolio of 28 of our existing stores. This transaction allowed us to secure long-term access to these locations at very favorable lease rates. The unusual structure used to complete this transaction requires Kroger's liability for the long-term commitment to these stores to be shown as debt, similar to a capital or finance lease as opposed to being recognized as a typical operating lease. 
Our new $1 billion share buyback program announced today reinforces the Board's and management's confidence in our cash flow generation and is consistent with our commitment to deliver sustainable and attractive total shareholder returns of 8% to 11%. Our associates have been incredibly -- have been incredible throughout the pandemic. We continue to invest in our associates and strive to make our overall benefits package relevant in today's employment market. During the first quarter, we ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering associates in the Cincinnati division. Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations later in the year, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Atlanta, Houston, Little Rock, Michigan, Memphis, Mid-Atlantic and Portland. 
Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
Looking forward to the rest of 2021, while there remain uncertainties regarding what will emerge as the new normal in food at home trends, based on our strong results to date and confidence in our ability to execute our strategy, we are increasing our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect Identical sales for the year to be between negative 4% and negative 2.5%, which represents a 2-year stack of 10.1% to 11.6%. We also expect full year adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.10, representing a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of 16% to 19%. Looking at the cadence for Identical sales for the remainder of the year, we would expect our Identical sales in quarter 2 to be within our new target range of 4 -- of negative 4% to negative 2.5%. And we would expect quarter 3 and quarter 4 to be at the top end or slightly better than the range. 
Turning to EPS, our increased guidance implies adjusted EPS will be between 10.5% and 15% lower than 2020. We expect second quarter adjusted EPS will be around the top end of this range as we continue to cycle higher COVID-related costs from quarter 2 last year, and we expect quarter 3 and quarter 4 will be slightly below the range. 
In closing, we believe our year-to-date performance provides a further proof point of the strength and momentum we are seeing in our business model and builds on the progress achieved in 2019 and 2020. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder returns by leveraging our leading market position and executing on the exciting growth opportunities shared at our Investor Day. 
And now I'll turn it back to Rodney."

If you look at during the first quarter, early in the quarter, we were still cycling non-COVID. And the sales early in the quarter were especially strong. If you look at really starting in the second period and the third and fourth periods, we were cycling COVID. And if you look at the 2-year stack for those periods, it was pretty consistent on a 2-year stack basis. But when you look at year-on-year, obviously, it wasn't. If you look at the comment I made during the second quarter, quarter-to-date, obviously, the trends have improved slightly on a year-on-year basis, but would be very similar on a 2-year stack basis.

But when we look at the trend in sales volume versus what we were seeing in 2019 and the growth versus '19, it's really been remarkably consistent when you look at after that March initial time period, where there was obviously some stockpiling and panic-buying by consumers last year. 
When you look at the 2021 versus 2019 over April, May and June, generally, the trend has been very consistent even with some of the reopening that's been happening in the economy, which we think is some of the comments that Rodney made around families getting back together in larger groups, continuing to want to eat healthier. And so seeing some of those sort of trends that we think may be more structure and lasting because of the way consumers are looking to change the way they balance their eating habits. 
I think the question around guidance and the other comment I would maybe make, essentially, as you know, we're only a couple of months on from when we gave and reconfirmed the original guidance. So it is really, as you were suggesting, we still believe within our overall plan that we're going to continue to execute at a high level and continue to grow our share of the food at home business over time. What we do think will happen is there will be some softening in food at home trends as we go through the year as the market continues to reopen. And of course, I think everybody is seeing some benefit right now of government stimulus dollars in the market and it's hard to predict how that will change over time as well. So I would say, for the rest of the year with only 2 more months of data points, while we've been very pleased with our progress and they're executing at a high level, and as Rodney mentioned, we've seen sales above where we'd have expected to be so far this year, in terms of the macro, what do we think will happen as the year plays out, I wouldn't say we've fundamentally changed that view."

From a gross margin perspective, I think what was encouraging for us during the first quarter, whether you look at it year-over-year or the 2-year comparison to your point, is that outside of the sales deleverage and the onetime donation that we're making on PPE equipment, really, the improvements that we saw in sourcing and the acceleration in all profit, funded the gross margin investments that we're making. So I'm not trying to suggest that that's something that we should assume happens every quarter as we'll continue to manage dynamically and sometimes will fund the investments through continued cost savings initiatives. But overall, we feel very good about the balance in the business and our ability to manage those levers to both deliver for our customers, but also deliver sustainable growth in the future in earnings."

As you know, if you look at over the years, Kroger has been able to successfully operate in high inflationary environments and low inflationary environments. If you look at the details of inflation during the quarter, if you look in the Fresh departments, inflation has continued to increase during the quarter. Part of that is driven because of if you look at a lot of supply disruptions a year ago because of COVID. So it's going to be hard to tell. But we would expect overall to be able to successfully operate in whatever the environment is, and we would expect to be able to pass those costs to customers as you look at things that are permanent in nature. 
The other thing I think is always important to remind each of us, including our internal team, is if you look, typically, our business operates the best when inflation is about 3% to 4%. And we have a meaningful amount of fixed costs. And when inflation is at 3% to 4%, that gives you leverage on those costs and the inflation of 3% to 4%, customers don't overly react to that inflationary environment either. So we view a little bit of inflation is always good in our business and we would expect to be able to pass that through as well on things that are permanent in nature. 
And one of the last comment I would make is it is the important part of having such a strong Our Brands program and our own manufacturing plants. If we have inflation that is not driven by true cost changes, what always happens is our brands gain significant share at the expense of some of those national brand players as well."

I would say essentially, consistent with Rodney's comments, things are playing out at this point for the year, where we would have expected them to be, Chuck. The good news is building on Rodney's comments about the early indicators on the customer-facing part of Ocado. Everything we're seeing within the technology and supply chain teams would say that the way that we envisage the technology and the efficiency of the model would work as we're kind of finding so far with the operation up and running, that everything would be consistent with that expectation in the model. So nothing new or different to report there. 
As you know, most of the costs in the first year are going to be those sort of largely fixed costs. And really, as we shared at the Investor Day, the focus for us will be is as we start to ramp up the volume, our ability to speed up that ramp over time, is there any -- what will be critical to us delivering on the overall financial returns that we're expecting from Ocado and also our opportunity to potentially beat those returns. So as you'll recall, to recap, we would expect in year 1 for that to be a fairly meaningful investment of that fixed overhead is put in place for an Ocado facility. And then as the volume ramps up, we -- by year 2, we're getting to that breakeven point. And then by year 3, we're starting to improve the profitability with the goal of getting to at least parity with stores. 
So a long way to go on that journey, but I would say we're not seeing anything right now that would be different or inconsistent with the what we were expecting to see. But as Rodney said, very early day and a lot of work to do."

Yes, so I think just maybe a recap on how the year played out last year and then to your point, how we kind of see the guidance for this year, as you may recall, so last year, we started the year in Q1 with 19% IDs and then I think it was 14.6% in Q2. Q3 and Q4 range anywhere between 10.5% and just south of 11%. So we did see a 9% deceleration in sales last year. So we're cycling obviously that into this year. So even with improvement in our ID sales growth expectations as we go through the year, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are expecting to go from the 4.1% in Q1. In Q2, we sort of think we'll be in the range of a new guidance of negative 2.5% to 4%. And then in Q3 and Q4, the sort of the top end of that range or maybe slightly better than that range based on what we're seeing today. 
So I think a lot of our expectations are really based on our original guidance for the year that while we're really pleased with the execution that we've had across the business, that we've continued to see, if you look at our results today versus where they were in 2019 that we're still -- we still have more share than we did 2 years ago. So our expectation of ourselves is to continue that. But we do ultimately expect there to be some deceleration in that 2-year stack as customers start to return to what we think will be the new normal. I would say that even with those numbers, of course, you're still getting to when you think about the end of the year, if you're in that, I'll just take the example of the bottom end of our range, you're still going to be at that sort of 9%, 2-year growth in terms of trends across 2019 and '21.

If you look at cost inflation and retail inflation, on the Fresh departments, cost inflation would have been slightly higher than retail inflation. In the center store categories, it would be the other way around in terms of historical basis. 
In terms of looking at gross margin, we think it's incredibly important to look at the total business. And when you look at the overall retail model that we've developed, alternative profit is driven by the traffic that we have both online and physical and stores. So we think it's an important part of the overall business model, and it's really hard to separate what is -- what one piece of margin is being driven by something else. And as you know, retail media is the fastest-growing media channel and the margins on that are significantly better than traditional supermarkets, and we continue to grow in that space because of the great work that our Kroger Precision Marketing has done over the last 3 years and the team that we've built. 
So for us, it is -- retail media is a core part of the business. If you look at the overall margins, it's a core part of the business. And we really -- the way we manage our business is looking at operating margins in total and how are those trending, and how are we balancing cost reductions and margin improvements."

Really, there's a -- as you can imagine, there's a lot of moving parts in G&A just because of what we're cycling from 2020 and as all that on [indiscernible]. And it's actually one of the reasons why we felt it was important to share a comparison versus 2019 because I think in some ways, that gives you a sense of the momentum that we're creating overall and our ability to manage costs and continue to improve our efficiency in the model. 
If I kind of maybe talk you through some of the major sort of puts and takes, if you like, in the model, we do overall expect OG&A to be a tailwind for the year, and that's consistent with the original guidance that we shared. The main drivers that will kind of support that tailwind would be as we start to cycle the COVID cost as we did in Q1, we obviously continue to be very disciplined in making sure we're creating a safe environment for our associates and our customers. But we have ensured that we continue to be more efficient in identifying how we can improve our processes and our cost model to minimize those costs without compromising on safety and ensuring that we're creating the right environment in the store and online. So there will be some benefit that continues to flow through. 
We would estimate that COVID costs were probably just shy of $150 million in this quarter and in future quarters, they'll probably be less than $100 million a quarter as we look forward and gradually declining over time. In addition to those COVID costs that we're cycling, we do expect, as you know, digital profitability continue to improve. And a lot of that improvement is in the cost to serve and cost to fill an order. And so that is something that we continue to focus on that will help our overall OG&A model as we get more efficient in digital. There's sort of a practical cost savings, too, when you think about last year was a very strong year for the business across our key incentive metrics around operating profit growth and sales growth. This year, we would expect incentive costs to be more normalized. So it look more like a normal year, which creates a tailwind in our cost structure as well. 
And then I think on the headwind side of things that would offset those savings would be our continued investment in the average value rates for our associates. As Rodney mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are committed to continuing to invest in our associates to make sure that we continue to be competitive but also recognize the value our associates play as a critical role and obviously delivering for our customers. And then secondly, of course, the sales deleverage will have a negative impact on costs as well. So net-net, we still expect that OG&A to be a tailwind as we head through the year, but there will be a lot of puts and takes in the model."

In terms of traffic and changes there, very consistent. I would say the biggest surprise so far has been continuing to find associates to hire. And last year, we -- last week, excuse me. Last week, we did a hybrid hiring event and we were very pleased with the number of people we were able to hire from that hybrid hiring event.

And from there, of course, we're building to the commitment of doubling the business over the next few years. 
So we mentioned it, I think, at Investor Day, we didn't really necessarily think that was a linear journey, if you think about 2021, 2022 and 2023.

And for us, we think that's incredibly important because we want to make sure we earn the right and earn the right in terms of gaining share when you look at the amount of money that's spent in digital is well north of $100 billion and getting our fair share of that is important, and it's important for the business model as well.

So we feel very good about our ability to drive both parts of that model. And I think our track record would show that we've been able to maintain that momentum. I think we do think of them as very different pools of money as well, though, as Rodney mentioned. So on sourcing, it's not just about squeezing an extra $0.01 out by negotiating. It's about being creative of outsourcing. It's about our own brand products as well and using those and thinking about design of the product and looking at how we manage future cost inflation and hedging of or getting ahead of sort of changes in cost structure. 
So we think about sourcing at a very strategic level and look at it across many different levers to make sure that we're continuing to get better at how we operate most efficiently. And we would still see significant runway to keep getting better on those fronts and being able to support our model overall by improved sourcing benefits. And at the same time, as Rodney mentioned, on the media side of the business, really, all that revenue is coming from different pools of opportunity where many of our CPG partners are spending with media companies to be able to drive their overall sales growth through media marketing and digital channels that are available and e-commerce platforms, and we believe that the Kroger ecosystem offers some significant advantages and can be redeploying some of those dollars for a CPG partner to help them get either a higher return on what they're spending or spend less dollars to get the same return because we can offer a more efficient model for them."

We would -- if you look at some areas on pharmaceuticals and things you continue to forward buy is something that's been done throughout. It's just not as big as other things. If you end up in an environment where there was heavier inflation, you would expect to be doing more forward buying. But if inflation is more normal, we would not. 
The other thing that drove a lot of forward buy in the past is the CPGs had excess capacity, and they were trying to fill up the production of that excess capacity. And as of right now, we don't see that. But it's a great question, and it's something we'll continue to look for the opportunities. We did do a lot of forward buy last year during COVID, but it wasn't forward buy, it was just when you could find the product. We leased about 20 extra warehouses to have -- to get product to have, to be able to serve customers."

Our qua",1093,"Thank you, Rebekah, and thank you for joining us today. While the COVID-19 health crisis has not ended, this is the first quarter where we saw significant signs of recovery and the beginning of a return to what we are hopeful will be a new normal. Our quarter results demonstrate that Kroger is even better positioned today to connect with our customers than we were before the pandemic because of our relentless focus on Leading with Fresh and Accelerating With Digital for our customers.  
I'm incredibly proud of our amazing associates who continue to be there for our customers, communities and each other. Because of our associates' commitment, Kroger's first quarter identical sales without fuel grew ahead of our internal expectations. Digital sales grew triple digits since the beginning of 2019. We saw a strong growth in alternative profits and significant progress with our cost savings initiatives. All of this gives us confidence to raise guidance for the year and announce a new $1 billion share buyback program.  
I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing 3 key areas: first, how customer behavior is changing in this transition period; second, how we are leading with fresh and accelerating with digital; finally, I will highlight how we continue to live our purpose to feed the human spirit through the associate experience and our work to vaccinate millions of Americans.  
Our customers are in a time of transition. During the quarter, we began to see some pre-pandemic habits resume. For example, smaller holiday gatherings are likely to fade as more than half of our shoppers believe holidays will return to normal by the 4th of July. We are also seeing customers shop more frequently as COVID restrictions ease. Importantly, we saw a continuation of several pandemic trends. This includes heightened digital engagement across demographics, expanded consumption in key fresh areas like meat, produce and natural foods; and trading up to more premium products.  
New trends are emerging as well as customers settle into new routines. In a recent survey of our customers, a remarkable 92% of the people say they enjoy cooking the same or more than they did pre-COVID. And as people's busy social lives pick up, more customers are looking for convenience in cooking options. We continue to utilize our data to understand those behaviors that are more permanent in nature. Whether customer habits are returning, hardening or emerging, we will continue to meet the customer where they are and use our data science expertise to be where they are going.  
As we discussed during our Investor Day, Fresh is incredibly important to our customers. Our produce fresh score metrics continue to improve, and we are testing and learning through end-to-end Fresh initiatives to consistently improve the experience and deliver even more value to our customers. We announced our Go Fresh & Local Supplier Accelerator, providing more local and regional suppliers the opportunity to partner with Kroger and providing our buyers with the opportunity to discover new suppliers who share our commitment to advancing freshness, quality and our Fresh for Everyone commitment.  
In fact, since launching on May 12, we've already received more than 1,000 applications to participate. We are building on the momentum of 2020 within our seamless ecosystem through expanded capacity, improved customer experience and continuous innovation. During the first quarter, we expanded capacity by 15% to support our continued sales growth. Our teams worked together to improve in-stock fill rates and further reduced wait time at car side, enhancing -- both enhancing the customer experience. 
To date, we have over 2 million time slots available per week to serve our customers the fresh food and essential products they want when they want it. We continue to expand our seamless ecosystem through our new customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado. We opened our first facility in Ohio in March, and at the beginning of June, launched Kroger delivery in Florida. Launching in a new geography is incredibly exciting and a milestone moment in our history. Our Kroger delivery team is ready to bring fresh, affordable food and a consistent customer experience directly to the doors of our customers.  
In addition to the Groveland CFC and spoke in Tampa and Jacksonville are also now open. The hub and spoke model allows us to extend the range of our CFCs, allowing us to serve more customers' incredible products directly to their door. And we are just getting started. 
We are thrilled to report that NPS scores are among the highest in the digital retail and we continue to be pleased with our fill rates and our on-time delivery metrics. Kroger's data and personalization capabilities will contribute to increasingly meaningful ways to grow our e-commerce reach and capabilities, and we continue to elevate our personalized customer experience with our data today. 
During the quarter, we made more than 258 billion personalized recommendations to our customers through our digital experience. At Kroger, we have always known that our associates are the heart of our business. We are proud of our opportunity culture, where people can come for a job and stay for a career. More than 70% of our store directors began as part-time clerks. 
We are building a connected culture that embraces agility and collaboration, and that celebrates and incentivizes lifelong learning and growth. For example, since launching it in 2017, our industry-leading education assistance program has helped more than 6,300 associates take steps to learn and grow as individuals and employees. That is one of many ways we invest in our associates. 
We continue to invest in wages, with our average hourly rate increasing during quarter 1 as well. We are on track to increase our average hourly rate to over $16. And with comprehensive benefits, our average hourly rate will be approaching $21 by the end of the year. 
As we have done throughout the pandemic, Kroger remains committed to health and safety. To support the Biden administration's goal to have at least 70% of U.S. adults receive their first COVID-19 vaccine dose by July 4, we launched an aggressive customer and associate marketing campaign and community immunity giveaway. Next week, we will announce the first $1 million winner and 10 free groceries for a year winners. Since announcing the giveaway, we are running 29% ahead of forecasted vaccinations. To date, Kroger Health has administrated over 5 million vaccines in our pharmacies and clinic locations and at community sites across the country.  
Now I would like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our first quarter results. Gary?"
284342,717294535,2322731,"The Kroger Co., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Jun 17, 2021",2021-06-17,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger delivered strong results in the first quarter, providing a further proof point of momentum we have created in our business model.

Kroger delivered strong results in the first quarter, providing a further proof point of momentum we have created in our business model. We continue to execute our priorities of Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital, which led to top line sales results ahead of our internal expectations. We were disciplined in balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and achieved record growth in alternative profit streams.  
While year-over-year comparisons are impacted by the pandemic, as well by the dramatic change in customer behavior we saw in quarter 1 last year due to COVID-19, looking over a 2-year time horizon, our adjusted EPS of $1.19 represents a compounded annual growth rate of 28.6% versus 2019. 
I'll now provide additional color on our first quarter results. Identical sales without fuel declined 4.1%, which translates to a 2-year stacked growth of 14.9%. Digital sales grew 16% on top of the 92% growth during quarter 1 of 2020, and we continue to make progress in improving the sustainability of our digital business. As previously shared, 2 key drivers of long-term digital profitability are the cost to fill a digital order and the retail media revenue generated from a digital transaction. In the first quarter, we reduced the amount of time taken to pick a digital order by 5% and increased media revenue per digital basket by 33%.  
Gross margin was 22.6% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 65 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was wholly attributable to sales deleverage, higher shrink and the COVID-19-related inventory write-down for PPE to be donated to community partners. 
Pricing investments during the quarter and the impact of mix changes as the result of cycling COVID-19 trends last year were fully offset by sourcing benefits and alternative profit growth. On a 2-year basis, our FIFO gross margin rates, excluding fuel, decreased 21 basis points compared to 2019.  
The operating, general and administrative rate decreased 108 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items, reflecting our continued discipline in cost management. This improvement was driven by decreased COVID-19-related costs, lower contributions to multi-employer pension plans, execution of cost-saving initiatives and decreased incentive costs, partially offset by sales deleverage. On a 2-year basis, our OG&A rate decreased by 58 basis points compared to 2019, and we remain on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings for the fourth consecutive year.  
Alternative profit achieved record profit growth during the quarter, led by exceptional growth in retail media. Kroger Personal Finance also delivered double-digit profit growth, with strong performance across several key product areas. Based on our performance in the first quarter, we now expect alternative profit growth to be towards the top end of our goal of $100 million to $150 million of incremental profit in 2021.  
Fuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition. Gallons grew in the first quarter by 13% as we started to cycle the impact of COVID-19 last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.79 this quarter versus $2.13 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.35 compared to $0.48 in the same quarter last year. While fuel was a headwind to operating profit of approximately $130 million versus 2020, we were encouraged by our trends, which were better than expected.  
Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow and remains committed to investing in the business to drive long-term sustainable net earnings growth, maintaining its current investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to shareholders via share repurchase and a growing dividend over time. 
Last month, we announced the restructuring of the Sound Pension Trust. Similar to previous multi-employer pension restructurings, this transaction will improve security and stability of future pension benefits for those associates, while also minimizing our future exposure to market risk and produces a return on investment above our internal hurdle rate by mitigating future pension contribution costs. On an after-tax basis, $344 million will be needed to execute the transaction, and we expect this to be funded evenly over 7 years.  
Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.79 compared to 1.81 a year ago. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5. Net total debt increased during the quarter primarily due to the company entering into a transaction to purchase and then immediately sell a portfolio of 28 of our existing stores. This transaction allowed us to secure long-term access to these locations at very favorable lease rates. The unusual structure used to complete this transaction requires Kroger's liability for the long-term commitment to these stores to be shown as debt, similar to a capital or finance lease as opposed to being recognized as a typical operating lease. 
Our new $1 billion share buyback program announced today reinforces the Board's and management's confidence in our cash flow generation and is consistent with our commitment to deliver sustainable and attractive total shareholder returns of 8% to 11%. 
Our associates have been incredibly -- have been incredible throughout the pandemic. We continue to invest in our associates and strive to make our overall benefits package relevant in today's employment market. During the first quarter, we ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW, covering associates in the Cincinnati division. Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations later in the year, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Atlanta, Houston, Little Rock, Michigan, Memphis, Mid-Atlantic and Portland. 
Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
Looking forward to the rest of 2021, while there remain uncertainties regarding what will emerge as the new normal in food at home trends, based on our strong results to date and confidence in our ability to execute our strategy, we are increasing our full year 2021 guidance. 
We now expect identical Sales for the year to be between negative 4% and negative 2.5%, which represents a 2-year stack of 10.1% to 11.6%. We also expect full year adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.10, representing a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of 16% to 19%. Looking at the cadence for Identical sales for the remainder of the year, we would expect our Identical sales in quarter 2 to be within our new target range of 4 -- of negative 4% to negative 2.5%. And we would expect quarter 3 and quarter 4 to be at the top end or slightly better than the range. 
Turning to EPS, our increased guidance implied adjusted EPS will be between 10.5% and 15% lower than 2020. We expect second quarter adjusted EPS will be around the top end of this range as we continue to cycle higher COVID-related costs from quarter 2 last year, and we expect quarter 3 and quarter 4 will be slightly below the range. 
In closing, we believe our year-to-date performance provides a further proof point of the strength and momentum we are seeing in our business model and builds on the progress achieved in 2019 and 2020. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder returns by leveraging our leading market position and executing on the exciting growth opportunities shared at our Investor Day. 
And now I'll turn it back to Rodney."

And we would be slightly better than the guidance that Gary talked about for the quarter. 
If you look at during the first quarter, early in the quarter, we were still cycling non-COVID. And the sales early in the quarter were especially strong. If you look at really starting in the second period and the third and fourth periods, we were cycling COVID. And if you look at the 2-year stack for those periods, it was pretty consistent on a 2-year stack basis. But when you look at year-on-year, obviously, it wasn't. If you look at the comment I made during the second quarter, quarter-to-date, obviously, the trends have improved slightly on a year-on-year basis, but would be very similar on a 2-year stack basis. 
Gary, anything you would want to add?"

But when we look at the trend in sales volume versus what we were seeing in 2019 and the growth versus '19, it's really been remarkably consistent when you look at after that March initial time period, where there was obviously some stockpiling and panic-buying by consumers last year. 
When you look at the 2021 versus 2019 over April, May and June, generally, the trend has been very consistent even with some of the reopening that's been happening in the economy, which we think is some of the comments that Rodney made around families getting back together in larger groups, continuing to want to eat healthier. And so seeing some of those sort of trends that we think may be more structural and lasting because of the way consumers are looking to change the way they balance their eating habits. 
I think the question around guidance and the other comment I would maybe make, essentially, as you know, we're only a couple of months on from when we gave and reconfirmed the original guidance. So it is really -- as you were suggesting, we still believe within our overall plan that we're going to continue to execute at a high level and continue to grow our share of the food at home business over time. 
What we do think will happen is there will be some softening in food at home trends as we go through the year, as the market continues to reopen. And of course, I think everybody is seeing some benefit right now of government stimulus dollars in the market and it's hard to predict how that will change over time as well. So I would say, for the rest of the year, with only 2 more months of data points, while we've been very pleased with our progress and they're executing at a high level, and as Rodney mentioned, we've seen sales above where we'd have expected to be so far this year, in terms of the macro, what do we think will happen as the year plays out, I wouldn't say we've fundamentally changed that view."

From a gross margin perspective, I think what was encouraging for us during the first quarter, whether you look at it year-over-year or the 2-year comparison, to your point, is that outside of the sales deleverage and the onetime donation that we're making on PPE equipment, really, the improvements that we saw in sourcing and the acceleration in all profit funded the gross margin investments that we're making. 
So I'm not trying to suggest that that's something that we should assume happens every quarter as we'll continue to manage dynamically and sometimes will fund the investments through continued cost savings initiatives. But, overall, we feel very good about the balance in the business and our ability to manage those levers to both deliver for our customers, but also deliver sustainable growth in the future in earnings."

Those types of purchases normally have a higher margin. We're also seeing tailwinds from mix changes as people continue to be more aggressive on buying fresh, all of those things. 
And the point that Gary made that I think is incredibly important, and as you know, on Investor Day, we talked about it that we would expect continued operating margin improvements once you get through a cycling through COVID. We would continue to expect that because of the points that we made and Gary's point on alternative profits as well."

As you know, if you look at over the years, Kroger has been able to successfully operate in high inflationary environments and low inflationary environments. If you look at the details of inflation during the quarter, if you look in the Fresh departments, inflation has continued to increase during the quarter. Part of that is driven because of if you look at a lot of supply disruptions a year ago because of COVID. 
So it's going to be hard to tell.  We would expect overall to be able to successfully operate in whatever the environment is, and we would expect to be able to pass those costs to customers as you look at things that are permanent in nature. 
The other thing I think is always important to remind each of us, including our internal team, is if you look, typically, our business operates the best when inflation is about 3% to 4%. And we have a meaningful amount of fixed costs. And when inflation is at 3% to 4%, that gives you a leverage on those costs, and the inflation of 3% to 4%, customers don't overly react to that inflationary environment either. So we view a little bit of inflation is always good in our business, and we would expect to be able to pass that through as well on things that are permanent in nature. 
And one of the -- the last comment I would make is it is the important part of having such a strong, our Brands program and our own manufacturing plants, If we have inflation that is not driven by true cost changes, what always happens is our brands gain significant share at the expense of some of those national brand players as well."

I would say, essentially, consistent with Rodney's comments, things are playing out at this point for the year, where we would have expected them to be, Chuck. The good news is building on Rodney's comments about the early indicators on the customer-facing part of Ocado. Everything we're seeing within the technology and supply chain teams would say that the way that we envisage the technology and the efficiency of the model would work as we're kind of finding so far, with the operation up and running, that everything would be consistent with that expectation in the model. So nothing new or different to report there. 
As you know, most of the costs in the first year are going to be those sort of largely fixed costs. And really, as we shared at the Investor Day, the focus for us will be is as we start to ramp up the volume, our ability to speed up that ramp over time, is there any -- what will be critical to us delivering on the overall financial returns that we're expecting from Ocado and also our opportunity to potentially beat those returns. 
So as you'll recall, to recap, we would expect in year 1 for that to be a fairly meaningful investment of that fixed overhead is put in place for an Ocado facility. And then as the volume ramps up, we -- by year 2, we're getting to that breakeven point. And then by year 3, we're starting to improve the profitability, with the goal of getting to at least parity with stores. 
So a long way to go on that journey. But I would say we're not seeing anything right now, that would be different or inconsistent with the what we were expecting to see. But as Rodney said, very early day and a lot of work to do."

Yes, so I think just maybe a recap on how the year played out last year and then, to your point, how we kind of see the guidance for this year. As you may recall, so last year, we started the year in Q1 with 19% IDs and then I think it was 14.6% in Q2. Q3 and Q4 range anywhere between 10.5% and just south of 11%. So we did see a 9% deceleration in sales last year. So we're cycling, obviously, that into this year. 
So even with improvement in our ID sales growth expectations as we go through the year, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are expecting to go from the 4.1% in Q1. In Q2, we sort of think we'll be in the range of a new guidance of negative 2.5% to 4%. And then in Q3 and Q4, the sort of the top end of that range or maybe slightly better than that range based on what we're seeing today. 
So I think a lot of our expectations are really based on our original guidance for the year that while we're really pleased with the execution that we've had across the business, that we've continued to see, if you look at our results today versus where they were in 2019, and we're still -- we still have more share than we did 2 years ago. So our expectation of ourselves is to continue that. 
But we do ultimately expect there to be some deceleration in that 2-year stack as customers start to return to what we think will be the new normal. I would say that even with those numbers, of course, you're still getting to when you think about the end of the year, if you're in that, so I'll just take the example of the bottom end of our range. You're still going to be at that sort of 9%, 2-year growth in terms of trends across 2019 and '21. So significantly ahead of what our long-term model would typically be and certainly would put us well ahead of where we had expected to be pre-COVID when we talked about our TSR expectations."

If you look at cost inflation and retail inflation, on the Fresh departments, cost inflation would have been slightly higher than retail inflation. In the center store categories, it would be the other way around in terms of historical basis. 
In terms of looking at gross margin, we think it's incredibly important to look at the total business. And when you look at the overall retail model that we've developed, alternative profit is driven by the traffic that we have, both online and physical in stores. So we think it's an important part of the overall business model, and it's really hard to separate what is -- what one piece of the margin is being driven by something else. 
And as you know, retail media is the fastest-growing media channel and the margins on that are significantly better than traditional supermarkets, and we continue to grow in that space because of the great work that our Kroger Precision Marketing has done over the last 3 years and the team that we've built. 
So for us, it is -- retail media is a core part of the business. If you look at the overall margins, it's a core part of the business. And we really -- the way we manage our business is looking at operating margins in total and how are those trending, and how are we balancing cost reductions and margin improvements."

Really, there's a -- as you can imagine, there's a lot of moving parts in OG&A just because of what we're cycling from 2020 and as all that unravels. And it's actually one of the reasons why we felt it was important to share a comparison versus 2019 because I think in some ways, that gives you a sense of the momentum that we're creating, overall, and our ability to manage costs and continue to improve our efficiency in the model. 
If I kind of maybe talk you through some of the major sort of puts and takes, if you like, in the model, we do overall expect OG&A to be a tailwind for the year, and that's consistent with the original guidance that we shared. The main drivers that will kind of support that tailwind would be as we start to cycle the COVID cost as we did in Q1, we obviously continue to be very disciplined in making sure we're creating a safe environment for our associates and our customers. 
But we have ensured that we continue to be more efficient in identifying how we can improve our processes and our cost model to minimize those costs without compromising on safety and ensuring that we're creating the right environment in the store and online. So there will be some benefit that continues to flow through. 
We would estimate that COVID costs were probably just shy of $150 million in this quarter and in future quarters, they'll probably be less than $100 million a quarter as we look forward and gradually declining over time. 
In addition to those COVID costs that we're cycling, we do expect, as you know, digital profitability to continue to improve, and a lot of that improvement is in the cost to serve and cost to fill an order. And so that is something that we continue to focus on that will help our overall OG&A model as we get more efficient in digital. 
There's sort of a practical cost savings, too, when you think about last year was a very strong year for the business across our key incentive metrics around operating profit growth and sales growth. This year, we would expect incentive costs to be more normalized. So it looked more like a normal year, which creates a tailwind in our cost structure as well. 
And then I think, on the headwind side, things that would offset those savings would be our continued investment in the average value rates for our associates. As Rodney mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are committed to continuing to invest in our associates to make sure that we continue to be competitive, but also recognize the value our associates play as a critical role and obviously delivering for our customers. 
And then secondly, of course, the sales deleverage will have a negative impact on costs as well. So net-net, we still expect that OG&A to be a tailwind, as we head through the year, but there will be a lot of puts and takes in the model."

Part of the challenges in Q1, particularly in the quarter, is just that volatility and what was happening almost week by week, if you remember back to how customers were shopping and some of the supply chain issues. So I think, to Rodney's point, our focus and one of the reasons I should probably say we deliberately sort of wait until later in the year to talk about market share last year was we felt like it was hard to read during that time. 
And so as Rodney said, the focus really is on how do we make sure as we committed we would, we come out stronger through COVID, overall, and looking over that 2-year time period. I think what we're seeing so far, we feel good about the momentum and why we've also increased the guidance for the rest of the year."

But if you look at the commitment on doubling the business digitally and the continued improvement in profitability, we would expect -- we continue to expect those broader trends to hold in place. Everything that we can see, the customers continue to like to shop online.
The thing that I think is very important is that very few of our customers actually only shop online. And most shoppers shop online and in our stores. And when they shop both, our retention rate is incredibly high, and our ability to gain share within that household is very high as well. And those are the major trends that we would expect to continue. And those are the trends that we believe that will drive our ability to double our online business, along with expanding with the sheds and other pieces. 
In terms of -- if you look at within the year, Gary, I'll let you talk through that."

Yes, the way we think about it is very much that we believe that COVID has been a reset, if you like, for digital. So we probably pulled forward demand by anywhere between 3 and 4 years based on the way that customers really engaged in digital over the last 12 months. 
So I think the way you described it is how we certainly think about it. Looking at that 2-year view across 2020 and 2021 is the right way to think about it because after such growth, I think there is going to be something of a -- if you like, a normalization year this year. And from there, of course, we're building to the commitment of doubling the business over the next few years. 
So we mentioned it, I think, at Investor Day, we didn't really necessarily think that was a linear journey if you think about 2021, 2022 and 2023. So we do expect and still are very focused on that plan that we shared at our Investor Day a few months ago. And we still believe that's the journey that we're on and what we're committing to achieving over the next few years. 
But I do think this year and last year will be more of a 2-year view in the similar way we've looked at overall ID sales as there's kind of a normalization this year following that drive of growth in 2020, and we'll continue to build from there as we head towards that doubling the business by 2023."

And we want to be held accountable for delivering results the same way anyone else would be. 
And we shared it at our Investor Day, but independently, CPGs and others rate our retail media incredibly strong and better than pretty much anybody in the market in terms of the ability to target customers, getting their ROI on that retail spend and being able to adjust and eliminate wasted money, because we're totally transparent with our CPG partners in terms of how they invest their media money. 
And for us, we think that's incredibly important because we want to make sure we earn the right and earn the right in terms of gaining share when you look at the amount of money that's spent in digital is well north of $100 billion, and getting our fair share of that is important.

We've seen significant savings from sourcing over 2019, 2020 and, of course, 2021 as part of the $1 billion of savings. And at the same time, as Rodney mentioned, we've been growing alternative profits, with media being the fastest-growing part of that, significantly as well over -- incrementally over $100 million again over 2019, '20 and 2021, one compounding on top of the other. 
So we feel very good about our ability to drive both parts of that model. And I think our track record would show that we've been able to maintain that momentum. I think we do think of them as very different pools of money as well, though, as Rodney mentioned. So on sourcing, it's not just about squeezing an extra $0.01 out by negotiating. It's about being creative of outsourcing. It's about our own brand products as well and using those and thinking about design of the product and looking at how we manage future cost inflation and hedging of or getting ahead of sort of changes in cost structure. 
So we think about sourcing at a very strategic level and look at it across many different levers to make sure that we're continuing to get better at how we operate most efficiently. And we would still see significant runway to keep getting better on those fronts and being able to support our model, overall, by improved sourcing benefits. 
And at the same time, as Rodney mentioned, on the media side of the business, really, all that revenue is coming from different pools of opportunity where many of our CPG partners are spending with media companies to be able to drive their overall sales growth through media marketing and digital channels that are available and e-commerce platforms, and we believe that the Kroger ecosystem offers some significant advantages and can be redeploying some of those dollars for a CPG partner to help them get either a higher return on what they're spending or spend less dollars to get the same return because we can offer a more efficient model for them."

Our associates have done an incredible job operating our stores, pharmacy, supply chain and manufacturing facilities through the COVID environment. Their unending commitment to serving our customers and communities continues to make a difference in Kroger's second quarter identical sales without fuel, grew 14% on a 2-year stacked basis, ahead of our internal expectations. We saw triple-digit growth in digital over the same time period and continue to drive costs out of the business through cost-saving initiatives and operational efficiencies. We remain confident in our positioning and our ability to deliver consistently attractive total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time. 
I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing 3 key areas. First, customer behavior and how our seamless ecosystem is working. Second, I'll share examples of how we are leading with fresh and accelerating with digital. And finally, I will highlight how we continue to live our purpose to feed the human spirit through the associate experience and our work to advance Kroger's ESG commitments.
Our strategic focus on leading with fresh and accelerating with digital continues to build momentum across our businesses. As we've operated through the pandemic, we've recognized the structural shifts in our customers' eating and cooking habits. Customers are responding favorably to our value proposition and are enjoying the convenience of our seamless offerings. 
Early in the quarter, customers visited stores more frequently and [ shift ] from online to in-store. This highlights the relevance and convenience of our easily accessible footprint. Towards the end of the quarter, as COVID-19 cases increased in many geographies, customers began shifting back to our digital solutions. This further demonstrates the strength of our seamless ecosystem. 
Customers can choose how they want to shop. Our job is to be available in every channel. So the customer does not have to compromise. Regardless of how they choose to shop, customers are eating more food at home because it's more affordable, convenient, and healthier than other options. 
While some food and home trends may be transitory, our research suggests those I highlighted are structural, and Kroger is uniquely positioned to address them. Through our assortment of fresh products, world-class digital platform and innovative meal solutions, we will continue to elevate our position as a food authority, so that when customers think food, they think Kroger. 
We continue to advance our position as a leader in fresh during the second quarter. We saw positive identical sales in produce and floral and deli bakery, even as we lapped elevated sales in 2020. Our research shows how much our customers love our brands. Sales for both Simple Truth and Private Selection brands were strong as food-at-home trends remain sticky. 
We continue to innovate within fresh. For example, our expanded partnerships with ghost kitchen allow us to offer customers freshly prepared on-demand restaurant food. This is especially relevant at a time when many customers are looking for inspiration, and 70% of our customers say convenience is important when cooking. 
We also announced our 2021 Go Fresh & Local Supplier Accelerator cohort and are already bringing innovative, locally and regionally sourced products to stores across the country and helping many small entrepreneurs achieve their dreams. 
Earlier this week, Kroger announced our new brand icon, the fresh cart icon brings together the Kroger family of companies under one unifying visual, and reinforces our brand promise, Fresh for Everyone. 
We are very proud of our growth in digital, which increased 114% over the last 2 years, similar to our first quarter growth. We remain on track to deliver against our 2023 digital growth and profitability targets introduced at our 2021 IR day. 
While digital sales decreased 13% during the quarter, almost all customers who reduced their online spend during the quarter continue to shop with us in store, highlighting the power of our ecosystem and our ability to create a meaningful customer experience across all channels. 
As a short reminder, Kroger has doubled our e-commerce household penetration, increasing the number of our brick-and-mortar customers that engage with our digital solutions since 2019. During the quarter, we added over 340,000 new customers to our digital platforms. We continue to expand capacity across our footprint, and we reduced wait times for Kroger pickup. 
As we look ahead, our seamless ecosystem will remain a competitive advantage as we offer what customers need and want in a way that fits into their life, whether it's shopping in our stores, picking it up at our stores, or getting delivered or shipped directly to their homes. 
We continue to enhance our seamless ecosystem. As we shared last quarter, we currently have 2 customer fulfillment centers open, which are expanding our capabilities in Ohio and allowing us to expand into the new geographies within Florida. We are happy with the performance thus far and are energized by the volume and growth in both sheds. 
In Ohio, our focus has been on evolving the customer proposition to maximize opportunities alongside our existing digital solutions. In Florida, we launched Delivery Savings Pass, offering customers unlimited deliveries for just $79 per year. 
We continue to see incredible Net Promoter Scores, and our customers tell us they love our friendly, professionally trained drivers and the refrigerated delivery vans that bring the freshest food directly to their doorsteps. 
Looking ahead, we remain on track to open 6 customer fulfillment centers over 2022 and 2023, which will further expand our seamless ecosystem. 
Before I share some specifics on how we are using data and personalization to grow the business, I thought it would be helpful to remind you about how our rewards program and how it works. 
Our rewards program has been active for over 2 decades. It captures data from 60 million households and 96% of our sales. Customers clearly see the value of our program, which drives sales and builds loyalty. As an example, nearly 60% of all items in a digital basket were added through our personalization science, highlighting our ability to make meaningful suggestions that surprise and delight customers. Furthermore, when we personalize recommendations for our customers, we can reduce their time to shop by nearly 70%. 
Overall, 1 in 3 people have noted that groceries have gotten more expensive in the past months. Kroger customers benefit from our personalization as we offer highly relevant savings at a household level, allowing them to further stretch their food dollars. 
Our associates continue to deliver a full, fresh and friendly customer experience every day, every time while also supporting our communities through the pandemic. We remain urgently focused on keeping people safe in our stores and facilities. 
Our teams were recently recognized with the Gold Award for excellence in human capital management from the Brandon Hall Group for our people-centered COVID-19 response. Obviously, we're especially proud of that recognition. 
During the quarter, we introduced new technology to elevate our associate experience. Kroger launched Fresh Start, a new personalized training program to foster greater associate engagement and retention. We also launched our FEED app, which provides associates easy access to company communications and resources from their smartphones. We are incredibly proud that during the quarter, we saw an improvement in retention as we strive to gain employer where associates can come for a job and stay for a career. 
Now turning now to the live our purpose. We continue to believe that customers, associates and investors are increasingly choosing where to shop, where to work, and where to invest in companies that are taking meaningful steps to improve our communities and work to build a more sustainable planet. We recently published our 2021 ESG report on thekrogerco.com. It outlines our progress over the last several years. It further outlines our aspiration to further integrate ESG performance into lines of business and our commitment to creating shared value that benefits all stakeholders. 
We imagine a world where everyone is thriving together, and Kroger is helping millions of people live healthier, more sustainable lifestyle, protecting and restoring natural resources and contributing to more responsible and inclusive global systems. 
One of the many ways we bring our ESG vision to life is through our work that our Kroger health team has been doing to serve and support our customers and communities through the pandemic. During the quarter, we worked with Lyft to provide rides to COVID-19 vaccine appointments, teamed up with local sports icon to drive awareness and access in the underserved communities, and we concluded our #CommunityImmunity Giveaway. To date, we have provided over 6.7 million doses of the vaccine and continue to drive availability and education. And yesterday, President Biden noted that Kroger is 1 of 3 national partners who have agreed to make the rapid COVID test available to customers at cost for the next 100 days. 
Kroger is committed to helping people live healthier lives while safeguarding the communities we serve. Our ESG goals are ambitious, and with a team of almost 500,000 dedicated and driven associates, they are also achievable. 
Since we first introduced our commitment to delivering strong and sustainable total shareholder return in 2019, our teams have been laser-focused on execution. This focus has resulted in tangible results, allowing us to deliver this quarter and for the long term. 
Now I would like to turn it over to Gary to discuss our second quarter financial results. Gary?"
284342,1679539119,2394467,"The Kroger Co., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Sep 10, 2021",2021-09-10,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger is delivering strong results and continues to build momentum as we execute on our priorities of leading with fresh and accelerating with digital. During the quarter, adjusted FIFO operating profit grew",1415,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger is delivering strong results and continues to build momentum as we execute on our priorities of leading with fresh and accelerating with digital. 
During the quarter, adjusted FIFO operating profit grew by a compounded annual growth rate of 23% over 2019, and adjusted EPS grew by a compounded annual growth rate of 35% over the same 2-year period. This reflects our disciplined approach to executing our strategy, balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and accelerating growth in our alternative profit business. It also provides a further proof point of how we are successfully navigating the pandemic and emerging stronger as a business. 
I will now provide additional details on our second quarter results. Identical sales without fuel declined 0.6%. On a 2-year stack basis, identical sales without fuel increased 14%. Each period during the quarter was stronger than the last. And I'm delighted to say, we returned to positive identical sales without fuel during the final period of the quarter. 
Our digital platform remains a key strength in our model, and we were pleased with the triple-digit growth achieved over 2019. We remain on track with our plans to double our digital business by 2023 and would expect continued investments in the customer experience, scaling of new fulfillment centers and several new innovations, which we will announce throughout the year to drive future growth. As shared last quarter, we would not expect future digital growth to be linear, especially as we cycle COVID in 2021. 
During the quarter, we also made further progress in improving digital profitability as we achieved a record low for the time taken to pick a digital order in store and continue to see growth in the media revenue generated on digital transactions. 
Gross margin was 21.4% of sales for the second quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 60 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily related to price investments and higher shrink and supply chain costs, partially offset by sourcing benefits and growth in our alternative profit business. On a 2-year basis, our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 55 basis points compared to 2019. 
Consistent with many retailers, we experienced supply chain constraints and increased warehouse and transportation costs during the quarter. We are actively managing this risk within our business by securing increased capacity and augmenting associate retention programs within our own facilities. We expect supply chain costs to remain elevated in the second half of the year, and this is contemplated in our updated guidance. 
In the second half of the quarter, we also saw higher inflation in some categories. We are being disciplined in working with suppliers to manage these increases and are passing along higher cost to the customer where it makes sense to do so. While difficult to predict with precision, as we shared last quarter, we believe inflation for the full year will be higher than originally contemplated in our 2021 business plan. For the second half of 2021, our guidance now assumes inflation of between 2% and 3%. 
Recognizing recent inflation trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a higher LIFO charge for the quarter of $47 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. [ However ], strong operational execution allowed us to leverage operating, general and administrative expenses by 76 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items in the second quarter. This reflects lower COVID-19 related costs and savings captured through our cost-saving initiatives. 
On a 2-year basis, our OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased by 137 basis points compared to 2019. We continue to see opportunities to streamline processes and leverage technology, and remain on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings during 2021. 
The traffic and data generated by our seamless ecosystem continues to create a strong flywheel effect for our alternative profit business, which again experienced significant profit growth in the quarter. Media and Kroger Personal Finance continued to lead the way, and we remain on track to achieve the high end of our expected range of $100 million to $150 million of incremental operating profit in 2021.
Fuel is also an important part of our overall value proposition for our customers. Gallons grew in the second quarter by 7% and outpaced market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.13 this quarter versus $2.14 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.39 compared to $0.37 in the same quarter in 2020, and fuel was a tailwind to operating profit of $33 million compared to prior year. 
Turning now to our financial strategy. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to investing in the business to drive sustainable growth while also returning excess cash to shareholders. We are prioritizing capital investments that support our growth strategy, widen our competitive moats, and deliver strong returns. 
Capital expenditures year-to-date were down compared to prior year as we carefully navigated the impact of higher project costs and longer project lead times due to a challenging labor market. As we confirmed in guidance today, we are maintaining our range for capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities of between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion, and would currently anticipate coming in at the low end of this range for the year. 
During the quarter, Kroger repurchased $349 million of shares and year-to-date has repurchased $751 million of shares. As of the end of the second quarter, $779 million remains outstanding under the current Board authorization announced on June 17, 2021. In June, Kroger also increased the dividend by 17%, marking the 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
Our proactive approach to investing in our associates over recent years is helping us navigate a challenging labor market. Our strategy continues to focus on investing in compensation plans that reward our associates in ways that are meaningful to them. We are committing to investing $350 million in hourly wage increases for our associates during 2021, in addition to the $800 million we invested in associate wages between 2018 and 2020. 
Over the same period, we have also taken several opportunities to improve the security of our associates' pension benefits. Our average hourly rate is now in excess of $16 an hour, and with comprehensive benefits factored in, we'll be approaching $21 by the end of 2021. We are committed to increasing retail hourly wages sustainably, and our long-term financial model fully contemplates continued investments in associate hourly rates. 
During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in our Atlanta, Michigan, Food for Less and Mid-Atlantic divisions covering over 34,000 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Little Rock, Memphis and Portland. 
Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficiencies in health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local and international unions, which represent many of our associates about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
Turning now to our expectations for the second half of 2021. Driven by momentum in our results and sustained trends in food at home, we are raising our full year guidance. We have also narrowed the range of our guidance as we are further into the year and the trends in our business and the broader food-at-home market become clearer. We now expect identical sales without fuel in the second half of 2021 to be flat to slightly positive, resulting in full year results of negative 1.5% to negative 1% and a 2-year identical sales stack of between 12.6% to 13.1%. We expect our adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.35. We expect our adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4 billion, reflecting a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of between 14.1% and 15.6%. 
In conclusion, we are emerging stronger through the pandemic, and remain confident in our ability to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% by sustainably growing earnings and using our resilient free cash flow to return excess cash to investors. 
And now I'll turn it back to Rodney."

We are leveraging technology, innovation and our competitive moats to deliver against the total shareholder return model we introduced in 2019 and reaffirmed in 2021.

As Gary mentioned in his prepared remarks, the last period of the second quarter, we returned to positive identicals. And so far, in the third quarter, we continue to see the trend of positive identicals, and our guidance for the balance of the year is positive as well. 
So we're very pleased with where we are. We're pleased with the performance our teams are doing, and we're making progress and substantially ahead of where we initially we thought we would be at this point in time on cycling the COVID from last year. 
As we look toward 2022, Gary, unless you want to get into more of the details, I think the key thing would be what we talked about at our Investor Day in 2021, and that's our commitment to ESR model of 8% to 11%. And that's driven by a combination of sales growth, slight margin improvements and taking free cash flow and returning it to our shareholders via dividend and stock buyback. And the sum of those together is what will drive the 8% to 11%, and we remain committed to that. And obviously, since we put it in place in 2019, we've outperformed it. 
I don't know, Gary, if you want to add anything?"

As you look at the back half of the year, you asked some -- for additional color on how we're thinking about the the trends that we're seeing there and the guidance, I would say we're obviously heading into the back half of the year, as Rodney mentioned, with momentum in the business. 
We did raise the guidance to now be in that sort of 0% to 1% for the back half of the year based on reversing into that from the year-to-date performance and the guidance that we gave for the year. Overall, we're feeling really good about how we're executing in the business, and seeing that sustained trend in food at home as consumers continue to gravitate towards some of the trends that Rodney talked about. And also, obviously, we are seeing some return to previous behavior with the Delta variant currently prevalent in the U.S. as well. 
That being said, we do still think there are some knowns in the market. If you look at different countries, how long the impact of the Delta variant lasts, if you like, on consumer behavior. We are seeing some consumers return to normal behavior of returning to offices in some cases. And so while we feel really good about our trends and our ability to continue to win with the customer, the back half of the year would be more of an 11% to 12% 2-year stack based on still some of the uncertainties and unknowns around those elements that we're still looking to see how they play out. 
I think the only other thing that I would reinforce on Rodney's comment is that we do expect, as we shared at our Investor Day at the beginning of the year and as we come through 2020 and 2021, we expect the overall food-at-home trends in the market, but also specifically Kroger's overall sales to come out of 2021 in a much stronger position than we would have been had the pandemic not occurred. And so we believe that, that will still certainly be true as we head towards '22. And obviously, we look forward to sharing more details on 2022 when we get towards the end of the year."

And Gary, in his prepared remarks, talked a little bit about both of those. 
But if you look at shrink, a lot of that -- about half of the half, or 25% of it is driven within the shrink component, and that's heavily driven by organized crime or at least it appears to be. And I know Congress and other groups are starting to spend more time on understanding what's driving that, and what's behind it, and what's the distribution channels for the stolen products as well and trying to manage that. 
And then on the supply chain costs, we are proactively investing there to minimize the effect. On both of those areas, the guidance that Gary shared for the balance of the year reflects the pressure in those areas. 
And from an inflationary standpoint, as you know, over time, we've been successful in operating in slow or negative inflation and high inflation, and we would see this no different. And our business, the easiest place to operate is an inflation is between 3% or 4%, but you don't ever get what you -- it makes it the easiest. But so far, where costs are being passed through in an organized way for the most part and as we would expect and following our strategy."

The other thing that everybody on the call, your guess is as good as ours. But everything that we can tell, we believe that people will continue working from home more than the past. And many companies, and I know certainly we are supporting people in terms of different jobs, what jobs can be worked from what location. And in all of those cases, what we're finding is people are eating more meals at home, i.e., breakfast and lunch.

We feel that over 2019, 2020 and now 2021, we're really demonstrating how we're able to manage the business more holistically as we think about delivering on our TSR model. So you think about the continued investments even through the pandemic that we are making in our customers to ensure that they see the value we're delivering, whether that's in the experience and some of the digital investments or through continuing to invest in price where it make sense and personalization to make you positioned well with the customer; the investments that we're making in average hourly for our associates to ensure that we're continuing to improve the experience there. 
And as you look at that and then think about the way in which we've managed costs, we're continuing to accelerate our alternative profit businesses and, at the same time, continue to get stronger and more effective at sourcing and managing margins in that way. I think that gives us confidence in our ability to continue to manage the business overall and drive a strong TSR in line with our commitments as you think about over time, what our commitments are to our shareholders. 
So we'll obviously get into more specifics around how we think about '22 later in the year. And at this point, I wouldn't want to get into specific details about next year, but that's certainly how we think about our model and how we get confident in our ability to maintain the trajectory over time and supported by Rodney's comment on how we think about continuing to see the customer spend dollars of food at home and how we can continue to grow our business within that context."

The other thing that I've been really proud of our team is the innovation they been behind the product, and we've introduced over 140 new products in the quarter and would continue to expect that going forward. 
I don't -- we're not seeing behavior changes. If you go back to prior times when you had inflation, the customer, a lot of times, would trade over to our brands as part of their structuring their budget. We're not seeing budget changes on our brands happening at this point, but I'm sure if inflation continued. Our customers are telling us they still feel pretty good where they are financially. And for the most part, people are still saving at record levels and things like that. 
Now at some point, if budgets got more constrained, you'd probably start seeing some of that behavior. But the business we're gaining right now is really being created because of the innovation in our product and the quality of the product, and it's really standing on its own."

When we add in all the fixed costs, we're more on the journey towards profitability, as you are alluding to. We're generally focus though on what's the pass-through rate on the the transactions as we're growing customers because what we find with digital, as you know, is the customer becomes more loyal overall to Kroger, and we see about 50% or so incrementality as the customer engage digitally. 
As we've talked about previously, we've kind of -- when you think back to last year, we're a mid-single-digit pass-through rate compared to a pass-through rate that will be closer to mid- to high teens on a store transaction. And we're on the path to improving that profitability to drive towards doubling the profit rate on the digital transaction and ultimately targeting to get to parity. 
I would say we're making good progress on that journey. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we continue to make solid improvements in the efficiency of picking a digital order. And over time, we'd expect Ocado to play a role in that as well, of course, with the automation they provide. And with media revenue continuing to grow rapidly, that's also creating a tailwind.

I would say, overall, we're not changing our overall financial strategy. As we think about our free cash flow, we continue to start with how can we invest in the business to grow it profitably and sustain growth, and we still think there's lots of opportunity to accelerate the model. 
As we -- I think we added to do a little bit of this at our last Investor Day, our goal over time would be to be stretching our top line growth and our overall earnings growth. So the focus for excess free cash flow is certainly looking for where the opportunities as we believe we can continue to lead with fresh and accelerate with digital to drive that growth. We're certainly going to look at any of those incremental investments against the bar of seeing, is that going to drive a stronger return for investors versus buying back incremental stock. 
But within our overall framework today, as we obviously continue to invest in the business to grow, we are committed to continuing to return cash to shareholders at the level that we've shared in our current TSR model. As you've heard us say, we increased the dividend by 17% to reflect really our confidence that we expect to come out of COVID with a higher position from an operating profit perspective as we leave 2021. And and we continued to buy back stock during the quarter and would expect to continue to buy back stock at the current price. 
We do leverage a grid. I think I've referred to this before. So think about it as depending on where the share price is. That -- if the share price is lower, it buys back more stock during the quarter. If the share price is higher, it buys back less stock because we're not trying to time anything in the market. We're already trying to make sure that we're maximizing the return on the dollars as we go through the year to take advantage of fluctuations in the prices as it happens during a difficult trading period. 
But we certainly remain committed to returning cash to investors. We start with the excess cash from a point of view of saying where could we accelerate our growth. And ultimately, we'll share more on that as we identify those opportunities. And we'll continue to flex if we believe that there aren't those opportunities, then obviously, we'll look to make sure we are dynamic in making sure we're deploying excess cash."

If you look at basket size per purchase, it's significantly increased in terms of when customers come into the store, they buy significantly more or if you look at our online shop customer, that customer's basket size is significantly higher than a basket when somebody comes into a store. So both from a digital standpoint, and individual transaction standpoint, customers are significantly buying more. 
And it's all -- it's really 3 things. One, they're buying more. They're also buying premiumization of product where they upgraded the products they buy. And they also are buying bigger sized products as well. So if you think about toilet paper.

I would say that generally, we've been very comfortable with our ability to pass on the increases that we've seen at this point, and we would expect that to continue to be the case looking into the back half of the year. 
As you saw during the quarter, we are though continuing to invest in price where we think it makes sense. Sometimes that might be in areas where we're seeing inflation. Sometimes it might be we're investing because we believe it's the right thing to do to grow customer long-term loyalty in other places through our personalization strategies.

On the pharmacy side of things, yes, so essentially, as you know, we operate little clinics as well in a number of our stores and multiples of stores have little clinic facilities. And in our pharmacy core business, we continue to support the COVID vaccines. 
So my comment earlier was, when you look at the total health and wellness business, as we pivoted resources to do more COVID vaccinations and as we provide that support, whether it be through off-site locations or through our own facilities, and you look at the total impact of the pharmacy business as customers shifted to more COVID vaccines and less of the newer prescriptions, if you like, even though we grew script count overall during the quarter and continue to grow script count. If I look at the total impact on the health and wellness business on the quarter and the year-to-date, there wouldn't be a material overall outside of business plan performance. Although certainly, if you look to the COVID vaccines in isolation, they would create incremental value to the health and wellness business, but it was offset by lower revenue or lower margin impact on other parts of that business. So netted out to being on plan, if you like. 
And as we look at the back half of the year, I wouldn't expect it to be a reason that we have an incremental headwind in margin because of having less COVID vaccinations in the back half of the year as things start to return. So certainly, we expect some vaccines in the back half of the year, but things start to return a little bit more to normal and less of a spike in vaccines compared to what we saw in the first half of the year. 
From a LIFO perspective, as you -- I think you probably know, it's not really an easy thing to predict because LIFO was a charge is one data point at the end of the year. As we looked at the data point so far this year, we're seeing an inflation. We use those spots to predict where it would be. I think the best guidance we could give you is if you take the year-to-date performance in LIFO that we've charged to the P&L and then gross that up effectively for the full year, that would be essentially our full year expectation based on the data points that we've seen to this point in the year in our outlook. 
But FIFO -- sorry, LIFO, I beg your pardon is notoriously difficult to predict. So we're giving you our best estimate. But at the end of the day, it will be driven by accounting rules and a data point towards the end of the year. But I think the best indication we can give you at this point is to use the year-to-date performance and growth are up for the year is our best estimate."

And if you look in Florida, we are tracking ahead of where we thought we would be at this point. And the thing that I'm especially proud of our teams in Florida is our Net Promoter Scores are incredibly strong. I mean, mind boggling strong and made up in the neighborhood of best-in-class across all industries. And as you know, food retail usually struggles with having Net Promoter Scores that are up in the Apple neighborhood and things like that. 
So I'm incredibly proud of what our teams are doing in terms of creating the experience for the customer. And I appreciate and like your question. I would say we're still early in the process, and we continue to learn every day on our ability to ramp up a facility in a new market. 
Certainly, it's easier communicating to the customer in new markets or markets where our share isn't as high. And that was one of the reasons why we picked Florida and picked Monroe here outside of Cincinnati was to learn how to integrate it within our existing infrastructure and then having something from the ground up. And I would expect over time, we'll learn how to do both of them and we'll be really happy with the results."

Before we conclude today's call, I'd like to take a moment to remember the tragic events that took place nearly 20 years ago tomorrow, and to honor the lives lost on September 11, 2001. And as always, I'd like to take a moment to address our associates who are listening in. Thank you for delivering an outstanding performance this quarter and continuing to support our communities through the pandemic. As the number of COVID-19 cases continue to rise due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant, I want to affirm that health and safety of our associates and customers remain our top priority. We are doing everything we can do to make sure the vaccine is accessible and available to you and our customers wherever they are. I am so proud of our Kroger health team who have already administrated 6.7 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Thank you to our talented health care professionals for being there for our communities and for addressing questions for our customers about the vaccine and about getting the vaccine. 
I'm often reminded of the impact our associates have on the lives of our customers. Recently, one of our pharmacy managers in Atlanta saved a life of a customer that was having an allergic reaction in one of our stores. This is just one of the many examples that an extraordinary way our associates care for those around them. Thank you for inspiring me every day. And thank you for all you do every day to be there for our customers, our communities, and each other. That concludes today's call."

Our associates have done an incredible job operating our stores, pharmacies, supply chain and manufacturing facilities through the COVID environment. Their unending commitment to serving our customers and communities continues to make a difference in Kroger's second quarter identical sales without fuel grew 14% on a 2-year stacked basis, ahead of our internal expectations. We saw triple-digit growth in digital over the same time period and continue to drive costs out of the business through cost-saving initiatives and operational efficiencies. We remain confident in our positioning and our ability to deliver consistently attractive total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time.
I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing 3 key areas: first, customer behavior and how our seamless ecosystem is working; second, I'll share examples of how we are leading with fresh and accelerating with digital; and finally, I will highlight how we continue to live our purpose to feed the human spirit through the associate experience and our work to advance Kroger's ESG commitments. 
Our strategic focus on leading with fresh and accelerating with digital continues to build momentum across our businesses. As we've operated through the pandemic, we've recognized the structural shifts in our customers' eating and cooking habits. Customers are responding favorably to our value proposition and are enjoying the convenience of our seamless offerings.
Early in the quarter, customers visited stores more frequently, and many shifted from online to in store. This highlights the relevance and convenience of our easily accessible footprint. Towards the end of the quarter, as COVID-19 cases increased in many geographies, customers began shifting back to our digital solutions. This further demonstrates the strength of our seamless ecosystem. Customers can choose how they want to shop. Our job is to be available in every channel, so the customer does not have to compromise. Regardless of how they choose to shop, customers are eating more food at home because it's more affordable, convenient and healthier than other options.
While some food and home trends may be transitory, our research suggests those I highlighted are structural, and Kroger is uniquely positioned to address them. Through our assortment of fresh products, world-class digital platform and innovative meal solutions, we will continue to elevate our position as a food authority so that when customers think food, they think Kroger. 
We continue to advance our position as a leader in fresh during the second quarter. We saw positive identical sales in produce and floral and deli/bakery, even as we lapped elevated sales in 2020. Our research shows how much our customers love our brands. Sales for both Simple Truth and Private Selection brands were strong as food-at-home trends remained sticky. 
We continue to innovate within fresh. For example, our expanded partnerships with ghost kitchens allow us to offer customers freshly prepared, on-demand restaurant food. This is especially relevant at a time when many customers are looking for inspiration, and 70% of our customers say convenience is important when cooking. 
We also announced our 2021 Go Fresh & Local Supplier Accelerator cohort and are already bringing innovative, locally and regionally sourced products to stores across the country and helping many small entrepreneurs achieve their dreams.
Earlier this week, Kroger announced our new brand icon. The fresh cart icon brings together the Kroger Family of Companies under one unifying visual and reinforces our brand promise: Fresh for Everyone. 
We are very proud of our growth in digital, which increased 114% over the last 2 years, similar to our first quarter growth. We remain on track to deliver against our 2023 digital growth and profitability targets introduced at our 2021 IR Day. While digital sales decreased 13% during the quarter, almost all customers who reduced their online spend during the quarter continue to shop with us in store, highlighting the power of our ecosystem and our ability to create a meaningful customer experience across all channels.
As a short reminder, Kroger has doubled our e-commerce household penetration, increasing the number of our brick-and-mortar customers that engage with our digital solutions since 2019. During the quarter, we added over 340,000 new customers to our digital platforms. We continue to expand capacity across our footprint, and we reduced wait times for Kroger pickup.
As we look ahead, our seamless ecosystem will remain a competitive advantage as we offer what customers need and want in a way that fits into their life, whether it's shopping in our stores, picking it up at our stores, or getting it delivered or shipped directly to their homes.
We continue to enhance our seamless ecosystem. As we've shared last quarter, we currently have 2 customer fulfillment centers open, which are expanding our capabilities in Ohio and allowing us to expand into the new geographies within Florida. We are happy with the performance thus far and are energized by the volume and growth in both sheds.
In Ohio, our focus has been on evolving the customer proposition to maximize opportunities alongside our existing digital solutions. In Florida, we launched Delivery Savings Pass, offering customers unlimited deliveries for just $79 per year. We continue to see incredible Net Promoter Scores, and our customers tell us they love our friendly, professionally trained drivers and the refrigerated delivery vans that bring the freshest food directly to their doorsteps. Looking ahead, we remain on track to open 6 customer fulfillment centers over 2022 and 2023, which will further expand our seamless ecosystem. 
Before I share some specifics on how we are using data and personalization to grow the business, I thought it would be helpful to remind you about our rewards program and how it works. Our rewards program has been active for over 2 decades. It captures data from 60 million households and 96% of our sales. Customers clearly see the value of our program, which drives sales and builds loyalty. As an example, nearly 60% of all items in a digital basket were added through our personalization science, highlighting our ability to make meaningful suggestions that surprise and delight customers. Furthermore, when we personalize recommendations for our customers, we can reduce their time to shop by nearly 70%. 
Overall, 1 in 3 people have noted that groceries have gotten more expensive in the past months. Kroger customers benefit from our personalization as we offer highly relevant savings at a household level, allowing them to further stretch their food dollars. 
Our associates continue to deliver a full, fresh and friendly customer experience every day, every time while also supporting our communities through the pandemic. We remain urgently focused on keeping people safe in our stores and facilities. Our teams were recently recognized with the gold award for excellence in human capital management from the Brandon Hall Group for our people-centered COVID-19 response. Obviously, we're especially proud of that recognition. 
During the quarter, we introduced new technology to elevate our associate experience. Kroger launched Fresh Start, a new, personalized training program to foster greater associate engagement and retention. We also launched our FEED app, which provides associates easy access to company communications and resources from their smartphones. We are incredibly proud that, during the quarter, we saw an improvement in retention as we strive to gain an employer where associates can come for a job and stay for a career. 
Now turning now to the live our purpose. We continue to believe that customers, associates and investors are increasingly choosing where to shop, where to work and where to invest in companies that are taking meaningful steps to improve our communities and work to build a more sustainable planet. We've recently published our 2021 ESG report on thekrogerco.com. It outlines our progress over the last several years. It further outlines our aspiration to further integrate ESG performance into lines of business and our commitment to creating shared value that benefits all stakeholders. We imagine a world where everyone is thriving together, and Kroger is helping millions of people live healthier, more sustainable lifestyles, protecting and restoring natural resources and contributing to more responsible and inclusive global systems. 
One of the many ways we bring our ESG vision to life is through our work that our Kroger Health team has been doing to serve and support our customers and communities through the pandemic. During the quarter, we worked with Lyft to provide rides to COVID-19 vaccine appointments, teamed up with local sports icon to drive awareness and access in the underserved communities, and we concluded our #CommunityImmunity Giveaway. To date, we have provided over 6.7 million doses of the vaccine and continue to drive availability and education. And yesterday, President Biden noted that Kroger is 1 of 3 national partners who have agreed to make the rapid COVID test available to customers at cost for the next 100 days. 
Kroger is committed to helping people live healthier lives while safeguarding the communities we serve. Our ESG goals are ambitious. And with a team of almost 500,000 dedicated and driven associates, they are also achievable. 
Since we first introduced our commitment to delivering strong and sustainable total shareholder return in 2019, our teams have been laser-focused on execution. This focus has resulted in tangible results, allowing us to deliver this quarter and for the long term. 
Now I would like to turn it over to Gary to discuss our second quarter financial results. Gary?"
284342,1679539119,2394766,"The Kroger Co., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Sep 10, 2021",2021-09-10,"Earnings Calls","The Kroger Co.","Executives","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger is delivering strong results and continues to build momentum as we execute on our priorities of leading with fresh and accelerating with digital. During the quarter, adjusted FIFO operating profit grew",1412,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger is delivering strong results and continues to build momentum as we execute on our priorities of leading with fresh and accelerating with digital. 
During the quarter, adjusted FIFO operating profit grew by a compounded annual growth rate of 23% over 2019, and adjusted EPS grew by a compounded annual growth rate of 35% over the same 2-year period. This reflects our disciplined approach to executing our strategy, balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and accelerating growth in our alternative profit business. It also provides a further proof point of how we are successfully navigating the pandemic and emerging stronger as a business. 
I will now provide additional details on our second quarter results. Identical sales without fuel declined 0.6%. On a 2-year stack basis, identical sales without fuel increased 14%. Each period during the quarter was stronger than the last, and I'm delighted to say we returned to positive identical sales without fuel during the final period of the quarter. 
Our digital platform remains a key strength in our model, and we were pleased with the triple-digit growth achieved over 2019. We remain on track with our plans to double our digital business by 2023 and would expect continued investments in the customer experience, scaling of new fulfillment centers and several new innovations which we will announce throughout the year to drive future growth. As shared last quarter, we would not expect future digital growth to be linear, especially as we cycle COVID in 2021. 
During the quarter, we also made further progress in improving digital profitability as we achieved a record low for the time taken to pick a digital order in store and continue to see growth in the media revenue generated on digital transactions. 
Gross margin was 21.4% of sales for the second quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 60 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily related to price investments and higher shrink and supply chain costs, partially offset by sourcing benefits and growth in our alternative profit business. On a 2-year basis, our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 55 basis points compared to 2019. 
Consistent with many retailers, we experienced supply chain constraints and increased warehouse and transportation costs during the quarter. We are actively managing this risk within our business by securing increased capacity and augmenting associate retention programs within our own facilities. We expect supply chain costs to remain elevated in the second half of the year, and this is contemplated in our updated guidance. 
In the second half of the quarter, we also saw higher inflation in some categories. We are being disciplined in working with suppliers to manage these increases and are passing along higher cost to the customer where it makes sense to do so. While difficult to predict with precision, as we shared last quarter, we believe inflation for the full year will be higher than originally contemplated in our 2021 business plan. For the second half of 2021, our guidance now assumes inflation of between 2% and 3%. Recognizing recent inflation trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a higher LIFO charge for the quarter of $47 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. 
Further strong operational execution allowed us to leverage operating, general and administrative expenses by 76 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items, in the second quarter. This reflects lower COVID-19-related costs and savings captured through our cost-saving initiatives. 
On a 2-year basis, our OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased by 137 basis points compared to 2019. We continue to see opportunities to streamline processes and leverage technology and remain on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings during 2021. 
The traffic and data generated by our seamless ecosystem continues to create a strong flywheel effect for our alternative profit business, which again experienced significant profit growth in the quarter. Media and Kroger Personal Finance continued to lead the way, and we remain on track to achieve the high end of our expected range of $100 million to $150 million of incremental operating profit in 2021.
Fuel is also an important part of our overall value proposition for our customers. Gallons grew in the second quarter by 7% and outpaced market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.13 this quarter versus $2.14 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.39 compared to $0.37 in the same quarter in 2020, and fuel was a tailwind to operating profit of $33 million compared to prior year. 
Turning now to our financial strategy. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to investing in the business to drive sustainable growth while also returning excess cash to shareholders. We are prioritizing capital investments that support our growth strategy, widen our competitive moats, and deliver strong returns. 
Capital expenditures year-to-date were down compared to prior year as we carefully navigated the impact of higher project costs and longer project lead times due to a challenging labor market. As we confirmed in guidance today, we are maintaining our range for capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, of between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion and would currently anticipate coming in at the low end of this range for the year. 
During the quarter, Kroger repurchased $349 million of shares and year-to-date has repurchased $751 million of shares. As of the end of the second quarter, $779 million remains outstanding under the current Board authorization announced on June 17, 2021. In June, Kroger also increased the dividend by 17%, marking the 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
Our proactive approach to investing in our associates over recent years is helping us navigate a challenging labor market. Our strategy continues to focus on investing in compensation plans that reward our associates in ways that are meaningful to them. We are committing to investing $350 million in hourly wage increases for our associates during 2021, in addition to the $800 million we invested in associate wages between 2018 and 2020. 
Over the same period, we have also taken several opportunities to improve the security of our associates' pension benefits. Our average hourly rate is now in excess of $16 an hour. And with comprehensive benefits factored in, we'll be approaching $21 by the end of 2021. We are committed to increasing retail hourly wages sustainably, and our long-term financial model fully contemplates continued investments in associate hourly rates. 
During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in our Atlanta, Michigan, Food 4 Less and Mid-Atlantic divisions, covering over 34,000 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Little Rock, Memphis and Portland. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficiencies in health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local and international unions, which represent many of our associates about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
Turning now to our expectations for the second half of 2021. Driven by momentum in our results and sustained trends in food at home, we are raising our full year guidance. We have also narrowed the range of our guidance as we are further into the year and the trends in our business and the broader food-at-home market become clearer. We now expect identical sales without fuel in the second half of 2021 to be flat to slightly positive, resulting in full year results of negative 1.5% to negative 1% and a 2-year identical sales stack of between 12.6% to 13.1%. We expect our adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.35. We expect our adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4 billion, reflecting a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of between 14.1% and 15.6%. 
In conclusion, we are emerging stronger through the pandemic and remain confident in our ability to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% by sustainably growing earnings and using our resilient free cash flow to return excess cash to investors. 
And now I'll turn it back to Rodney."

And that's driven by a combination of sales growth, slight margin improvements and taking free cash flow and returning it to our shareholders via dividend and stock buyback. And the sum of those together is what will drive the 8% to 11%, and we remain committed to that. And obviously, since we put it in place in 2019, we've outperformed it.

As you look at the back half of the year, you asked some -- for additional color on how we're thinking about the trends that we're seeing there and the guidance, I would say we're obviously heading into the back half of the year, as Rodney mentioned, with momentum in the business. 
We did raise the guidance to now be in that sort of 0% to 1% for the back half of the year based on reversing into that from the year-to-date performance and the guidance that we gave for the year. Overall, we're feeling really good about how we're executing in the business and seeing that sustained trend in food at home as consumers continue to gravitate towards some of the trends that Rodney talked about. And also, obviously, we are seeing some return to previous behavior with the Delta variant currently prevalent in the U.S. as well. 
That being said, we do still think there are some knowns in the market. If you look at different countries, how long the impact of the Delta variant lasts, if you like, on consumer behavior, we are seeing some consumers return to normal behavior, returning to offices in some cases. And so while we feel really good about our trends and our ability to continue to win with the customer, the back half of the year would be more of an 11% to 12% 2-year stack based on still some of the uncertainties and unknowns around those elements that we're still looking to see how they play out. 
I think the only other thing that I would reinforce on Rodney's comment is that we do expect, as we shared at our Investor Day at the beginning of the year, that as we come through 2020 and 2021, we expect the overall food-at-home trends in the market but also specifically Kroger's overall sales to come out of 2021 in a much stronger position than we would have been had the pandemic not occurred. And so we believe that, that will still certainly be true as we head towards '22. And obviously, we look forward to sharing more details on 2022 when we get towards the end of the year."

But if you look at shrink, a lot of that -- about half of the half or 25% of it is driven within the shrink component, and that's heavily driven by organized crime or at least it appears to be. And I know Congress and other groups are starting to spend more time on understanding what's driving that and what's behind it and what's the distribution channels for the stolen products as well and trying to manage that. 
And then on the supply chain costs, we are proactively investing there to minimize the effect. On both of those areas, the guidance that Gary shared for the balance of the year reflects the pressure in those areas. And from an inflationary standpoint, as you know, over time, we've been successful in operating in slow or negative inflation and high inflation, and we would see this no different. And our business, the easiest place to operate is when inflation is between 3% or 4%, but you don't ever get what you -- it makes it the easiest. But so far, we're -- costs are being passed through in an organized way for the most part and as we would expect and following our strategy."

So is the strength this year just delaying the inevitable shift back to food away from home in calendar '22? And if that's the case, you're guiding to a 3% operating margin this year essentially. So how will you be able to maintain this operating margin rate in an environment where your sales are going to continue to be pressured, particularly as you have reduced a lot of your OG&A expenses this year?"

The other thing that everybody on the call, your guess is as good as ours. But everything that we can tell, we believe that people will continue working from home more than the past. And many companies, and I know certainly we are, are supporting people in terms of different jobs, what jobs can be worked from what location. And in all of those cases, what we're finding is people are eating more meals at home, i.e., breakfast and lunch. So everything that we can see, a meaningful part of the trend change is really structural and sustainable, and it's not just a onetime blip because of COVID.

And as you look at that and then think about the way in which we've managed costs, we're continuing to accelerate our alternative profit businesses, and at the same time, continue to get stronger and more effective at sourcing and managing margins in that way. I think that gives us confidence in our ability to continue to manage the business overall and drive a strong TSR in line with our commitments as you think about over time what our commitments are to our shareholders.

So that from our perspective, we can be agnostic from whether the customer is buying online or buying in the store. 
As we grow that digital profitability rate, important to remember that just doesn't affect the growth in the future, it affects the $10 billion business that we have today.

I don't -- we're not seeing behavior changes.

We're not seeing budget changes on our brands happening at this point but I'm sure if inflation continued. Our customers are telling us they still feel pretty good where they are financially.

As we've talked about previously, we've kind of -- when you think back to last year, we're at mid-single-digit pass-through rate compared to a pass-through rate that will be closer to mid- to high teens on a store transaction. And we're on the path to improving that profitability to drive towards doubling the profit rate on the digital transaction and ultimately targeting to get to parity. 
I would say we're making good progress on that journey. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we continue to make solid improvements in the efficiency of picking a digital order. And over time, we'd expect Ocado to play a role in that as well, of course, with the automation they provide. And with media revenue continuing to grow rapidly, that's also creating a tailwind.

I would say, overall, we're not changing our overall financial strategy. As we think about our free cash flow, we continue to start with how can we invest in the business to grow it profitably and sustain growth, and we still think there's lots of opportunity to accelerate the model. 
As we -- I think we alluded to a little bit of this at our last Investor Day, our goal over time would be to be stretching our top line growth and our overall earnings growth, so the focus for excess free cash flow is certainly looking for where the opportunities as we believe we can continue to lead with fresh and accelerate with digital to drive that growth. We're certainly going to look at any of those incremental investments against the bar of saying, ""Is that going to drive a stronger return for investors versus buying back incremental stock?""
But within our overall framework today, as we obviously continue to invest in the business to grow, we are committed to continuing to return cash to shareholders at the level that we've shared in our current TSR model. As you've heard us say, we increased the dividend by 17% to reflect really our confidence that we expect to come out of COVID at a higher position from an operating profit perspective as we leave 2021. And and we continued to buy back stock during the quarter and would expect to continue to buy back stock at the current price. 
We do leverage a grid. I think I've referred to this before. So think about it as depending on where the share price is. That -- if the share price is lower, it buys back more stock during the quarter. If the share price is higher, it buys back less stock because we're not trying to time anything in the market. We're already trying to make sure that we're maximizing the return on the dollars as we go through the year to take advantage of fluctuations in the prices as it happens during a difficult trading period. 
But we certainly remain committed to returning cash to investors. We start with the excess cash from a point of view of saying where could we accelerate our growth. And ultimately, we'll share more on that as we identify those opportunities. And we'll continue to flex, if we believe that there aren't those opportunities then obviously, we'll look to make sure we are dynamic in making sure we're deploying excess cash."

It really depends on if you're looking at versus prior year or 2 years. 
If you look at basket size per purchase, it's significantly increased in terms of when customers come into the store, they buy significantly more; or if you look at our online shop customer, that customer's basket size is significantly higher than a basket when somebody comes into a store. So both from a digital standpoint and individual transaction standpoint, customers are significantly buying more. 
And it's all -- it's really 3 things. One, they're buying more. They're also buying premiumization of product where they've upgraded the products they buy, and they also are buying bigger-sized products as well. So if you think about toilet paper, very few customers now can or will even buy a 4 pack of toilet paper, where most customers now are buying 24 pack or even bigger in some cases. 
In terms of the inflation, Gary, I'll let you answer Michael's question on that."

Yes, we've laid out before, I know, on the call, we have a very robust process for how we manage when we see inflationary costs flowing through from suppliers. And first of all, we challenge to make sure that we feel confident they're legitimate because, obviously, we want to make sure that they truly are structural cost changes. And then if they are, we absolutely have a process for passing them on to the customer. 
I would say that, generally, we've been very comfortable with our ability to pass on the increases that we've seen at this point, and we would expect that to continue to be the case looking into the back half of the year. As you saw during the quarter, we are, though, continuing to invest in price where we think it makes sense. Sometimes that might be in areas where we're seeing inflation. Sometimes it might be we're investing because we believe it's the right thing to do to grow customer long-term loyalty in other places through our personalization strategies. 
So overall, we feel good about the way in which we're able to manage the inflation within the business. At the same time, we are continuing to invest because we believe that's going to be important to grow share over the long term as well."

I'm just wondering if you could give a little more color on that because it was very sizable and one of your competitors in terms of basis point contribution to gross margin.
And then other model questions that I just wanted to clarify were what your actual LIFO expectations are for the year because that's obviously relevant for EPS and then what your COVID costs were in the quarter and what your expectations for COVID costs will be for the rest of the year. And then I had one other bigger-picture question."

On the pharmacy side of things, yes, so essentially, as you know, we operate little clinics as well in a number of our stores, and multiple of our stores have little clinic facilities. And in our pharmacy core business, we continue to support the COVID vaccines. 
So my comment earlier was, when you look at the total health and wellness business, as we pivoted resources to do more COVID vaccinations and as we provided that support, whether it be through off-site locations or through our own facilities, and you look at the total impact of the pharmacy business as customers shifted to more COVID vaccines and less of the newer prescriptions, if you like, even though we grew script count overall during the quarter and continue to grow script count. If I look at the total impact on the health and wellness business for the quarter and the year-to-date, there wouldn't be a material overall outside of business plan performance. Although certainly, if you look to the COVID vaccines in isolation, they would have created an incremental value to the health and wellness business, but it was offset by lower revenue or lower margin impact on other parts of that business, so netted out to being on plan, if you like. 
And as we look at the back half of the year, I wouldn't expect it to be a reason that we have an incremental headwind in margin because of having less COVID vaccinations in the back half of the year as things start to return. So certainly, we expect some vaccines in the back half of the year, but things start to return a little bit more to normal and less of a spike in vaccines compared to what we saw in the first half of the year. 
From a LIFO perspective, as you -- I think you probably know, it's not really an easy thing to predict because LIFO was a charge, is one data point at the end of the year. As we looked at the data point so far this year, we're seeing an inflation. We use those spots to predict where it would be. I think the best guidance we could give you is if you take the year-to-date performance in LIFO that we've charged to the P&L and then gross that up effectively for the full year, that would be essentially our full year expectation based on the data points that we've seen to this point in the year in our outlook. 
But FIFO -- I'm sorry, LIFO, I beg your pardon, is notoriously difficult to predict, so we're giving you our best estimate. But at the end of the day, it will be driven by accounting rules and a data point towards the end of the year. But I think the best indication we can give you at this point is to use the year-to-date performance and gross that up for the year is our best estimate."

We would expect it to be south of $100 million a quarter. But certainly, we're still seeing incremental costs. 
And some of the areas that you would probably expect when you think about how we're continuing to operate through COVID, we still have masks costs during the quarter. We still have cleaning costs. We still have extended leave of absence for any associates that are identified as having the COVID virus -- been diagnosed as a positive COVID case. 
So those would be the kind of costs that we would see, and we'd expect it to be a little bit less than $100 million a year -- sorry, a quarter, I beg your pardon, as we look at the back half of the year and still being a slight tailwind year-over-year but nothing like what we have seen in the first half of 2020."

And as you know, food retail usually struggles with having Net Promoter Scores that are up in the Apple neighborhood and things like that. So I'm incredibly proud of what our teams are doing in terms of creating the experience for the customer. 
And I appreciate and like your question. I would say we're still early in the process, and we continue to learn every day on our ability to ramp up a facility in a new market. Certainly, it's easier communicating to the customer in new markets or markets where our share isn't as high. And that was one of the reasons why we picked Florida and picked Monroe here outside of Cincinnati was to learn how to integrate it within our existing infrastructure and then having something from the ground up. And I would expect, over time, we'll learn how to do both of them, and we'll be really happy with the results."

And as always, I'd like to take a moment to address our associates who are listening in. Thank you for delivering an outstanding performance this quarter and continuing to support our communities through the pandemic. 
As the number of COVID-19 cases continue to rise due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant, I want to affirm that health and safety of our associates and customers remain our top priority. We are doing everything we can do to make sure the vaccine is accessible and available to you and our customers wherever they are. I am so proud of our Kroger Health team who have already administrated 6.7 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Thank you to our talented health care professionals for being there for our communities and for addressing questions for our customers about the vaccine and about getting the vaccine. 
I'm often reminded of the impact our associates have on the lives of our customers. Recently, one of our pharmacy managers in Atlanta saved a life of a customer that was having an allergic reaction in one of our stores. This is just one of the many examples that in extraordinary ways our associates care for those around them. Thank you for inspiring me every day, and thank you for all you do every day to be there for our customers, our communities and each other.

And as we move through the holiday season, we feel great about our ability to deliver. I would like to say a huge thank you to our associates who remain engaged, energized and focused on taking care of our customers. We are incredibly proud of our third quarter results and the underlying momentum in our business. We returned to positive identical sales without fuel for the quarter. We saw triple-digit digital sales growth on a 2-year stack, and we've increased our full year 2021 guidance. Our agility and the commitment from our amazing associates is allowing us to navigate current labor and supply chain conditions and provide the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem. Customers are demonstrating more back-to-normal behaviors and at the same time, are eating more food at home because it's more affordable, convenient and healthier than other options plus you can do it as a family. This was evidenced by our Thanksgiving holiday shopping behavior. Customers engaged in larger celebrations with friends and family compared to last year. We also saw them continuing to cook at home, leading up to and during the holiday and select more premium products to elevate the food experience. These are all reasons why we believe the food at home change is structural and not temporary. 
With most people consuming meals at home and grocery stores continuing to capture the majority share of stomach, it is more important than ever that we provide customers with flexibility on how they choose to shop with us. We have the right seamless ecosystem in place to meet our customers' evolving needs. Leading into Thanksgiving, 70% of consumers said that they would be doing more of the holiday shopping in the store this year. At the same time, 84% of consumers said that they will continue to shop online the same amount or more in the future. These seemingly contradictory behaviors are exactly what Kroger's seamless ecosystem was designed to accommodate. We know that inflation is having an impact on customers as well. 82% of consumers pulled across the country are feeling the impact of inflation, and 1 in 4 consumers are not confident in their finances right now. We are leveraging our data and personalization to enable our customers to stretch their food dollars. We deliver value when customers need it the most with personalized promotions, big packs and dynamic holiday offerings. Our brands also offer our customers flexibility within their spending without compromising, thanks to the wide variety of incredibly high-quality and innovative products at various price points. And while price continues to be top of mind, customers continue to desire the freshest food options, and we're there for them, leading with fresh. We grew sales in natural and organics as customers continue to gravitate toward better-for-you options. Our fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales without fuel during the quarter as well. We had a record quarter in our alternative farming offerings, which includes new approaches to growing produce, including vertical and indoor farm operations. These offerings expand customers' access to produce picked at the peak of freshness. We are very proud to share that Home Chef became a $1 billion brand on an annualized basis in the third quarter, as meal time shortcuts and solutions as well as new product innovations have clearly resonated with our customers. Kroger is focused on delivering a customer-centric seamless experience that requires 0 compromise no matter how customers choose to engage with us. We launched 3 new offerings during the quarter that support the plan to double digital sales and digital profitability by 2023. First, boost by Kroger, builds on our industry-leading loyalty program to deliver additional savings and personalized offers to our members. We are encouraged by the initial engagement in the program, which is ahead of internal expectations. Second, we launched Kroger Delivery Now in partnership with Instacart. This unique convenience and immediacy offering positions us to win more trips with current customers and to bring new customers to the Kroger ecosystem by offering the largest selection of quality fresh products at affordable prices in 30 minutes. 
Here's what's so special about this offering. It was profitable on day 1, contributing to our goal to double digital profitability by 2023 that was announced during our 2021 Investor Day. And third, we announced a strategic collaboration with Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy Baby that will expand our current marketplace offering and provide Kroger shoppers easy access to essential home and baby products. This exclusive offering will be available through both kroger.com and on a small-scale physical store pilot at select stores beginning in 2022. We continue to be pleased with the rollout of our customer fulfillment centers in Groveland, Florida and Monroe, Ohio, which are exceeding internal expectations, and we are especially proud of our Net Promoter Scores, driven by our teams, delivering a world-class experience for our customers, and we're really looking forward to hosting you in Groveland, early next year. 
Turning now to our supply chain. We feel great about our ability to serve customer needs through the holidays and beyond. This is because our teams have done such a good job planning well ahead to maintain a full fresh and friendly customer experience. In fact, our customers took action to prepare for today's supply chain constraints back in the spring. And a great example of leveraging learnings from operating during the pandemic, we kept the additional warehouses originally brought on to support business through COVID to ensure we were able to provide for customers throughout the holiday season as well. Because of our team's agility, we are better in stock today than we were a year ago, and we were able to serve customers through the Thanksgiving holiday with items they needed for their celebrations. In fact, we increased our year-over-year pickup fill rate by over 130 basis points during the week of Thanksgiving. We chose to incur significant costs in our supply chain during 2021, which has allowed us to provide our customers today and into 2022. We continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet, and we're working closely with suppliers to mitigate pain points for the customer. We are eager to welcome thousands of new associates to our organization as we began an incredible holiday season. Our hybrid hiring event last month contributed to the hiring of over 64,000 new associates during the quarter. We continue to invest in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness and continued investments in associate wages. 
As we reflect on the 1-year anniversary of our framework for action in response to racial injustice across the country and in the communities we serve, we are pleased to share our progress with you. Over 405,000 associates have completed diversity and inclusion training. We've increased our strategic hiring partnerships with historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions from 6 to 17. The Kroger Co. Foundation has awarded more than $3 million in grants to support innovative organizations focused on building more equitable and inclusive communities. And we increased Kroger's diverse supplier spend by 21% to $4.1 billion last year alone and remain on track toward our long-term goal to spend $10 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2030. While we know that there is more work to be done, we are energized and look forward to keeping our stakeholders updated on our progress. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to manage our business successfully in every operating environment. We remain customer obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates communities and shareholders. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our third quarter financials. Gary?"

Our focus on execution, combined with o",1674,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney shared this morning, Kroger delivered strong results in the third quarter, highlighting the flexibility of our business model in a dynamic operating environment. Our focus on execution, combined with our disciplined approach to balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and growth in our alternative profit business is positioning us well for the future. Over time, our model has proven to be resilient during different economic scenarios, and this was true again during the third quarter as we grew the top and bottom lines while navigating higher product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply chain constraints. Our identical sales without fuel in the quarter returned to positive, growing 3.1% as we delivered for our customers across our seamless ecosystem and customers, again, signaled higher food at home consumption is here to stay. Adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS both increased year-over-year and grew by compounded annual growth rates of 22% and 29%, respectively, versus 2019. Third quarter EPS was impacted by 2 unusual items that were excluded from our adjusted EPS results. First, we engaged in an annuity buyout and lump sum distribution transaction related to the company's consolidated retirement benefit plan, which will reduce future administrative costs. This triggered a write-off of deferred losses and a nonrecurring noncash charge of $87 million on a pretax basis. This company pension plan is currently 100% funded as a result of previous actions taken to freeze the plan and protect benefits for our associates. This transaction was fully funded by assets in the plan. The second unusual item was Kroger recording a nonrecurring benefit of $47 million or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily due to the favorable outcome of income tax audit examinations, covering multiple years. This amount is also excluded from the company's adjusted net earnings per diluted share result for the third quarter. 
I'll now provide more detail on our operating results in the quarter. On a 2-year stack basis, our identical sales without fuel increased 14%. We also saw digital sales increased 103% on a 2-year stack. As we have previously shared, we do not expect digital growth to be linear, especially as we cycle last year's sales spike and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again. The launch of several new digital offerings, which Rodney outlined earlier, in addition to the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against our growth targets for digital sales and profitability. We look forward to sharing more detail on our digital road map at the business update in March that noted Rob noted earlier on the call. 
With regard to digital profitability, we continue to make progress during the quarter and achieved our best cost to serve on record for pickup orders. Gross margin was [ 21.66% ] of sales for the third quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 41 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and continued price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits. Our investment was in line with expectations and fully funded by cost savings and OG&A improvement. Recognizing recent inflation trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a higher LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. This increase represents a $0.07 headwind to EPS in the quarter versus 2020. 
The operating general and administrative rates decreased 49 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. This improvement was achieved even with continued investments in our associates and growth in our average [indiscernible] rate and reflects the outstanding work our associates are doing to execute cost-saving initiatives in a very dynamic environment. We remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings during 2021. 
Our alternative profit business had a record third quarter and remains on track to deliver the high end of our expected range of $100 million to $150 million of incremental operating profit in 2021. We saw increased strength in Kroger Personal Finance results during the quarter and Kroger Precision Marketing introduced a new programmatic advertising marketplace to unleash first-party targeting and measurement capabilities, further highlighting our ability to differentiate in the advertising space. Fuel is also an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars especially in times when fuel prices are high. During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the number of customers actively engaging in our fuel program. Gallons grew in the third quarter by 5%, outpacing market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.24 this quarter versus $2.15 in the same quarter last year. Our [ sense to gallon ] fuel margin was $0.42 compared to $0.37 in the same quarter in 2020. 
I'd now like to spend a couple of minutes providing some additional perspective on how we are proactively managing inflation. We are currently operating in a more volatile inflationary environment and during the third quarter, Kroger saw higher product cost inflation in most categories. We are being disciplined in managing these increases. Our teams are doing an excellent job working to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model by using our data and working closely with our suppliers. We are passing along higher costs to the customer where it makes sense to do so. In some key areas, we are choosing much to pass through cost increases and continuing to invest in value for the customer. We are investing where it matters most, using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization with the objective of winning long-term customer allottee late. We also believe our brands as an import an even more important differentiator for Kroger in an inflationary environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great value, and great quality. 
Turning now to our financial strategy. Kroger is operating from a position of strength and continues to generate strong free cash flow as evidenced by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio hitting an all-time low of 1.68 in the third quarter. While we continue to see attractive opportunities to invest in the business, to widen our competitive moat and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth, our capital expenditures in 2021 are now expected to be below our original guidance range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This is because of delays in project implementations, primarily due to COVID-19-related supply challenges. Kroger continues to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $297 million of shares and year-to-date, have repurchased $1 billion of shares. 
Since 2000, we have now returned more than $20 billion to shareholders via share repurchases at an average price of $16.45 per share. As of the end of the third quarter, $511 million remains outstanding under the current Board authorization announced on June 17, 2021. We look forward to sharing more about our plans for future deployment of excess cash to drive sustainable growth and create value for our shareholders at our business update in March. 
As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest meaningfully in our associates. In addition to the $350 million of hourly-rate investment already planned this year, we have committed to further investments in the fourth quarter, which equates to an incremental $100 million on an annualized basis. 
During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in our Columbus and Mid-Atlantic divisions, covering over 4,500 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Lake Charles, TriPoint, Dallas Meat, Little Rock, Memphis, Portland and Denver. Our financial results are pressured by inefficiencies in health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local and international unions, which represent many of our associates about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
I'll now turn to our expectations for the remainder of 2021. Driven by the momentum in our third quarter results and sustained trends in food at home, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect identical sales without fuel for the full year to be between negative 0.4% and negative 0.2% and a 2-year identical sales stack of between 13.7% to 13.9%. There remains some uncertainties as we look ahead, and our guidance of positive ID sales excluding fuel of between 1.5% to 2.5% in the fourth quarter reflects this. We expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50. We expect our adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, reflecting a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of between 17% and 18.4%. 
The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range for 2021 now equates to full year results approximately in line with our 2020 results, despite cycling the unique COVID-19 related demand spike last year. Our guidance fully reflects the investments in our customers and associates I shared earlier, plus increased marketing to support the exciting new digital initiatives we launched in the third quarter. It also reflects the latest projection for LIFO. And because we recorded a LIFO credit in the fourth quarter last year, LIFO is now expected to be a $0.13 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter. 
Overall, we are very proud of our results, which are projected to be significantly ahead of where we originally guided for the year. In conclusion, Kroger is executing against its key financial and operational initiatives and continues to invest in strategic priorities that will deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. We believe our business is emerging stronger through the pandemic and through the investments we are making is well positioned to grow beyond 2021. 
I'll now turn it back to Rodney."

And then secondly, I think there's another big tranche of pricing coming in January from a lot of your vendors. How would you characterize that next tranche? Is it an unusually high acceleration? Or is it just kind of a continued acceleration similar to what you've seen so far? Maybe if you could even put it into context of CPI for us, it would be helpful."

And as Gary mentioned, we're on track to take $1 billion of cost out, and this is the fourth year in a row that we've been able to accomplish that, which really gives us the flexibility to be able to continue to invest in our customers. 
The other thing that our teams have done a nice job on, if you look at our procurement team, they've done a nice job of identifying opportunities to save money by working with our suppliers, and we continue to aggressively work in partnership with them. If you look at inflation during the quarter, it continued to increase throughout the quarter. As of right now, it's starting to stabilize, but obviously at a pretty high rate. So it's something that we aggressively use our data to understand and we aggressively try to make sure that the customer has alternatives to be able to stretch their budget as well. And that's, in some cases, that's switching to a cheaper price meat. In some cases, it's buying our brands, which has amazing quality as well. So with that, Gary, I'll let you get into more -- some more of the details for Rob."

Yes, I would say, Rob, obviously, when we guided at the second quarter, we said that the gross margin contraction could be similar to what we were seeing in Q2. And I would say the dynamics that are in place haven't changed dramatically. Obviously, it's a dynamic environment that we're managing and our goal, as Rodney mentioned, is to continue to find sourcing benefit and savings to offset the cost increases where we see them and to pass on pricing where it makes sense, but also to keep investing in the customer. And I'd say that we -- in Q2, we were doing that. And in Q3, we've continued to do that. Supply chain would have been a similar sort of headwind in Q2 and Q3. I would say we were successful in mitigating some of the cost increases in shrink during the quarter, which helped during the quarter, although we still think shrink is a dynamic metric to manage based on some of the organized crime that we see in shrink. But overall, we were pleased with the progress in shrink during the quarter. And I think for us, we kind of guided, while we never get into specific numbers on individual gross margin and G&A metrics because as Rodney mentioned that, our goal is to be dynamic in managing it, ensuring that we're delivering sustainably for our customers and growing loyalty while also being able to improve profitability over time by managing the different levers across selling growth rate, cost of goods savings, taking cost out of the business and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. 
So I think it's a dynamic environment to continue to manage. I think somewhere between that Q2 and Q3 range is where we think that we're operating right now. We think Q4 would likely be similar to what we've seen in Q2 and Q3. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are increasing some advertising in the fourth quarter to support the accelerated growth in some of those new initiatives. So I think, again, I wouldn't be guiding to a specific number, but in the range that you've seen in Q2 and Q3 is where we feel comfortable in managing the business and driving the right balance of sustainable growth for shareholders while continuing to win customer loyalty over time."

And if you look at the trend so far in this quarter, I would say that the quarter would have started a little bit slower because of we were cycling in that week before Thanksgiving a fairly large spike in consumer behavior that I think started to signal maybe a potential increase in cases this time last year and then Thanksgiving was very strong. We were very pleased with the results over the Thanksgiving week itself. I think some of the questions in our mind as we look towards Q4, that are some of the reasons that we guided to some of the uncertainties, it's hard to predict exactly what will happen with government stimulus dollars in the market, particularly at the state level. That's kind of really hard to get over the skin of what will happen in individual states around ongoing funding. We obviously know there are some continued supply chain challenges around product availability in certain categories, and that's getting better gradually but still has certainly some challenges in the market. And it will be those kind of things that for us would be the puts and takes and how strong Q4 plays out in our mind."

Yes, we're really proud of the team's work in those areas, as you mentioned. It started out at the beginning of Restock Crow. There is a sort of let's grab the opportunities that are immediately in front of us. And I think it's really become a core competency within the organization to drive sustainable savings in our model. On the sourcing side, I think I would describe it across a number of different areas. You start with how do you make sure, you're consolidating all the buying in the right places so you can maximize the data and knowledge and use our own experiences from the cost of commodities and the fact we manufacture many of our products so that we're getting smarter and more effective in how we buy. It's evolved into product design and packaging design and how do you really optimize the value, while not compromising on quality for the customer, so continuing to drive value in those areas. It's extended to the GPO partnership that we created with Walgreens and looking at how can you consolidate opportunities and best thinking there as well. So it continues to evolve for us and the team is doing a great job in finding those opportunities to maximize savings, and we would expect that to be a continued opportunity for us because we keep identifying new innovative ways to ensure that we're designing for value and maximizing opportunities to be more efficient.
On the sort of the G&A side of things, that's across a number of different areas as well. So it would include using technology and automation to reduce shrink and waste in the business, to improve on some of those activities in the store and our operations that are very manual and don't really maximize the value that our great associates can deliver for customers. So taking that non-value-added workout, wherever we can to allow our associates to focus on the customer. It includes automating our ordering and production planning type processes. One of the big ones, of course, this year that we think would expect to be a tailwind into next year as well for every dollar that we can capture this year would be taking cost out of our digital cost to serve. So we've invested significant labor over the years in building that digital ecosystem, and we'd expect to continue to grow that business, of course. But if we can take out -- if we can improve efficiency on that $10 billion digital business, it creates not just a saving on the next new sale, but it creates a saving on that baseline $10 billion business as well. 
And then finally, I would say we've taken the opportunity to use things like the learning through COVID, on things like administrative costs and where are there areas you can actually work more efficiently and operate in more of a hybrid environment to take cost out of the model as well. So if that gives you an idea of the way it's kind of really come embedded more in the business, and we certainly would expect as part of our overall TSR growth -- TSR growth model to be continuing to take costs to be able to fund investments in our average value rate for associates to be able to invest in pricing and value for the customer, while at the same time growing shareholder returns."

And it really comes back to what we were talking about earlier around ensuring that we understand the customer better than anybody using our data targeting our promotional activity and our personalized pricing and of course, where the pricing structure of product starts to change, really ensuring that customers see the value in our own brand products because of the great quality and value that they offer in combination and during times of high inflation and certainly in times of economic challenge, we found that Kroger has performed very well, and we've seen customers pivot to some of those opportunities based on the way we can communicate and connect customers with those strategies.

Everyone of our associates is helping make the holidays brighter and fresher for our customers and more importantly, for that customer and their family. And it doesn't matter if you're making a difference together like our Kroger Health team, who has administrated 8.5 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, or is individuals like [ Donna Greer ], a cashier at our store 387 in Collerville, Tennessee, whose unshakable positivity has been an inspiration to many, including the Collierville Herald independent who just named her Collierville woman of the Year. We are so proud of [ Donna ] and congratulations, Donna. When you look at these, there are just a few examples of our incredible people who bring our vision and values to life each and every day. Our associates are beyond amazing and continue to serve our communities and uplift each other and our customers. That concludes our call for today.

And as we move through the holiday season, we feel great about our ability to deliver. I would like to say a huge thank you to our associates who remain engaged, energized and focused on taking care of our customers. We are incredibly proud of our third quarter results and the underlying momentum in our business. We returned to positive identical sales without fuel for the quarter. We saw triple-digit digital sales growth on a 2-year stack, and we've increased our full year 2021 guidance. Our agility and the commitment from our amazing associates is allowing us to navigate current labor and supply chain conditions and provide the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem. 
Customers are demonstrating more back-to-normal behaviors, and at the same time, are eating more food at home because it's more affordable, convenient and healthier than other options, plus you can do it as a family. This was evidenced by our Thanksgiving holiday shopping behavior. Customers engaged in larger celebrations with friends and family compared to last year. We also saw them continuing to cook at home, leading up to and during the holiday, and select more premium products to elevate the food experience. These are all reasons why we believe the food at home change is structural and not temporary. 
With most people consuming meals at home and grocery stores continuing to capture the majority share of stomach, it is more important than ever that we provide customers with flexibility on how they choose to shop with us. We have the right seamless ecosystem in place to meet our customers' evolving needs. Leading into Thanksgiving, 70% of consumers said that they would be doing more of their holiday shopping in the store this year. At the same time, 84% of consumers said that they will continue to shop online the same amount or more in the future. These seemingly contradictory behaviors are exactly what Kroger's seamless ecosystem was designed to accommodate. 
We know that inflation is having an impact on customers as well. 82% of consumers polled across the country are feeling the impact of inflation, and 1 in 4 consumers are not confident in their finances right now. We are leveraging our data and personalization to enable our customers to stretch their food dollars. We deliver value when customers need it the most with personalized promotions, big packs and dynamic holiday offerings. Our brands also offer our customers flexibility within their spending without compromising, thanks to the wide variety of incredibly high-quality and innovative products at various price points. 
And while price continues to be top of mind, customers continue to desire the freshest food options, and we're there for them, leading with fresh. We grew sales in Natural & Organics as customers continue to gravitate toward better-for-you options. Our fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales without fuel during the quarter as well. We had a record quarter in our alternative farming offerings, which includes new approaches to growing produce, including vertical and indoor farm operations. These offerings expand customers' access to produce picked at the peak of freshness. 
We are very proud to share that Home Chef became a $1 billion brand on an annualized basis in the third quarter as mealtime shortcuts and solutions, as well as new product innovations, have clearly resonated with our customers. 
Kroger is focused on delivering a customer-centric, seamless experience that requires 0 compromise no matter how customers choose to engage with us. We launched 3 new offerings during the quarter that support the plan to double digital sales and digital profitability by 2023. First, Boost by Kroger builds on our industry-leading loyalty program to deliver additional savings and personalized offers to our members. We are encouraged by the initial engagement in the program which is ahead of internal expectations. 
Second, we launched Kroger Delivery Now in partnership with Instacart. This unique convenience and immediacy offering positions us to win more trips with current customers and to bring new customers to the Kroger ecosystem by offering the largest selection of quality fresh products at affordable prices in 30 minutes. Here's what's so special about this offering. It was profitable on day 1, contributing to our goal to double digital profitability by 2023 that was announced during our 2021 Investor Day. 
And third, we announced a strategic collaboration with Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy Baby that will expand our current marketplace offering and provide Kroger shoppers easy access to essential home and baby products. This exclusive offering will be available through both Kroger.com and on a small-scale physical store pilot at select stores beginning in 2022. We continue to be pleased with the rollout of our customer fulfillment centers in Groveland, Florida; and Monroe, Ohio, which are exceeding internal expectations, and we are especially proud of our Net Promoter Scores, driven by our teams, delivering a world-class experience for our customers, and we're really looking forward to hosting you in Groveland early next year. 
Turning now to our supply chain. We feel great about our ability to serve customer needs through the holidays and beyond. This is because our teams have done such a good job, planning well ahead to maintain a full, fresh and friendly customer experience. In fact, our customers took action to prepare for today's supply chain constraints back in the spring. And a great example of leveraging learnings from operating during the pandemic, we kept the additional warehouses originally brought on to support business through COVID to ensure we were able to provide for customers throughout the holiday season as well. 
Because of our team's agility, we are better in stock today than we were a year ago, and we were able to serve customers through the Thanksgiving holiday with items they needed for their celebrations. In fact, we increased our year-over-year pickup fill rate by over 130 basis points during the week of Thanksgiving. We chose to incur significant costs in our supply chain during 2021, which has allowed us to provide our customers today and into 2022. We continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet, and we're working closely with suppliers to mitigate pain points for the customer. 
We are eager to welcome thousands of new associates to our organization as we began an incredible holiday season. Our hybrid hiring event last month contributed to the hiring of over 64,000 new associates during the quarter. We continue to invest in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness and continued investments in associate wages. 
As we reflect on the 1-year anniversary of our Framework for Action in response to racial injustice across the country and in the communities we serve, we are pleased to share our progress with you. Over 405,000 associates have completed diversity and inclusion training. We've increased our strategic hiring partnerships with Historically Black Colleges & Universities and Hispanic-serving institutions from 6 to 17. The Kroger Co. Foundation has awarded more than $3 million in grants to support innovative organizations focused on building more equitable and inclusive communities, and we increased Kroger's diverse supplier spend by 21% to $4.1 billion last year alone and remain on track toward our long-term goal to spend $10 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2030. While we know that there is more work to be done, we are energized and look forward to keeping our stakeholders updated on our progress. 
One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to manage our business successfully in every operating environment. We remain customer obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our third quarter financials. Gary?"

Our focus on execution, combined with o",1667,"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney shared this morning, Kroger delivered strong results in the third quarter, highlighting the flexibility of our business model in a dynamic operating environment. Our focus on execution, combined with our disciplined approach to balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and growth in our alternative profit business, is positioning us well for the future. 
Over time, our model has proven to be resilient during different economic scenarios, and this was true again during the third quarter as we grew the top and bottom lines while navigating higher product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply chain constraints. Our identical sales without fuel in the quarter returned to positive, growing 3.1% as we delivered for our customers across our seamless ecosystem, and customers, again, signaled higher food-at-home consumption is here to stay. Adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS both increased year-over-year and grew by compounded annual growth rates of 22% and 29%, respectively, versus 2019. 
Third quarter EPS was impacted by 2 unusual items that were excluded from our adjusted EPS result. First, we engaged in an annuity buyout and lump sum distribution transaction related to the company's consolidated retirement benefit plan which will reduce future administrative costs. This triggered a write-off of deferred losses and a nonrecurring noncash charge of $87 million on a pretax basis. This company pension plan is currently 100% funded as a result of previous action taken to freeze the plan and protect benefits for our associates. This transaction was fully funded by assets in the plan. The second unusual item was Kroger recording a nonrecurring benefit of $47 million or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily due to the favorable outcome of income tax audit examinations, covering multiple years. This amount is also excluded from the company's adjusted net earnings per diluted share result for the third quarter. 
I'll now provide more detail on our operating results in the quarter. On a 2-year stack basis, our identical sales without fuel increased 14%. We also saw digital sales increased 103% on a 2-year stack. As we have previously shared, we do not expect digital growth to be linear, especially as we cycle last year's sales spike and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again. The launch of several new digital offerings, which Rodney outlined earlier, in addition to the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against our growth targets for digital sales and profitability. We look forward to sharing more detail on our digital road map at the business update in March that Rob noted earlier on the call. With regard to digital profitability, we continue to make progress during the quarter and achieved our best cost to serve on record for pickup orders. 
Gross margin was 21.66% of sales for the third quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 41 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and continued price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits. Our investment was in line with expectations and fully funded by cost savings and OG&A improvement. 
Recognizing recent inflation trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a higher LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. This increase represents a $0.07 headwind to EPS in the quarter versus 2020. 
The operating, general and administrative rates decreased 49 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. This improvement was achieved even with continued investments in our associates and growth in our average hourly rate and reflects the outstanding work our associates are doing to execute cost-saving initiatives in a very dynamic environment. We remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings during 2021. 
Our alternative profit business had a record third quarter and remains on track to deliver the high end of our expected range of $100 million to $150 million of incremental operating profit in 2021. We saw increased strength in Kroger Personal Finance results during the quarter, and Kroger Precision Marketing introduced a new programmatic advertising marketplace to unleash first-party targeting and measurement capabilities, further highlighting our ability to differentiate in the advertising space. 
Fuel is also an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars, especially in times when fuel prices are high. During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the number of customers actively engaging in our fuel program. Gallons grew in the third quarter by 5%, outpacing market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.24 this quarter versus $2.15 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.42 compared to $0.37 in the same quarter in 2020. 
I'd now like to spend a couple of minutes providing some additional perspective on how we are proactively managing inflation. We are currently operating in a more volatile inflationary environment. And during the third quarter, Kroger saw higher product cost inflation in most categories. We are being disciplined in managing these increases. Our teams are doing an excellent job, working to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model by using our data and working closely with our suppliers. 
We are passing along higher cost to the customer where it makes sense to do so. In some key areas, we are choosing not to pass through cost increases and continuing to invest in value for the customer. We are investing where it matters most, using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization with the objective of winning long-term customer loyalty. We also believe our brands is an -- is an even more important differentiator for Kroger in an inflationary environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great value and great quality. 
Turning now to our financial strategy. Kroger is operating from a position of strength and continues to generate strong free cash flow as evidenced by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio hitting an all-time low of 1.68 in the third quarter. While we continue to see attractive opportunities to invest in the business, to widen our competitive moat and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth, our capital expenditures in 2021 are now expected to be below our original guidance range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This is because of delays in project implementations, primarily due to COVID-19-related supply challenges. 
Kroger continues to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $297 million of shares, and year-to-date, have repurchased $1 billion of shares. Since 2000, we have now returned more than $20 billion to shareholders via share repurchases at an average price of $16.45 per share. As of the end of the third quarter, $511 million remains outstanding under the current Board authorization announced on June 17, 2021. We look forward to sharing more about our plans for future deployment of excess cash to drive sustainable growth and create value for our shareholders at our business update in March. 
As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest meaningfully in our associates. In addition to the $350 million of hourly rate investment already planned this year, we have committed to further investments in the fourth quarter, which equates to an incremental $100 million on an annualized basis. 
During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in our Columbus and Mid-Atlantic divisions, covering over 4,500 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Lake Charles, Freeport, Dallas meat, Little Rock, Memphis, Portland and Denver. Our financial results are pressured by inefficiencies in health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local and international unions, which represent many of our associates about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
I'll now turn to our expectations for the remainder of 2021. Driven by the momentum in our third quarter results and sustained trends in food at home, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect identical sales without fuel for the full year to be between negative 0.4% and negative 0.2% and a 2-year identical sales stack of between 13.7% to 13.9%. There remain some uncertainties as we look ahead, and our guidance of positive ID sales excluding fuel of between 1.5% to 2.5% in the fourth quarter reflects this. We expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50. We expect our adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, reflecting a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of between 17% and 18.4%. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range for 2021 now equates to full year results, approximately in line with our 2020 results, despite cycling the unique COVID-19-related demand spike last year. 
Our guidance fully reflects the investments in our customers and associates I shared earlier, plus increased marketing to support the exciting new digital initiatives we launched in the third quarter. It also reflects the latest projection for LIFO. And because we recorded a LIFO credit in the fourth quarter last year, LIFO is now expected to be a $0.13 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter. Overall, we are very proud of our results, which are projected to be significantly ahead of where we originally guided for the year. 
In conclusion, Kroger is executing against its key financial and operational initiatives and continues to invest in strategic priorities that will deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. We believe our business is emerging stronger through the pandemic and through the investments we are making is well positioned to grow beyond 2021. 
I'll now turn it back to Rodney."

First of all, I think it's important to remember what's allowing us to continue to invest in the customer and value is the great work our team is doing on cost reductions.

The other thing that our teams have done a nice job on, if you look at our procurement team, they've done a nice job of identifying opportunities to save money by working with our suppliers, and we continue to aggressively work in partnership with them. 
If you look at inflation during the quarter, it continued to increase throughout the quarter. As of right now, it's starting to stabilize but obviously at a pretty high rate. So it's something that we aggressively use our data to understand, and we aggressively try to make sure that the customer has alternatives to be able to stretch their budget as well. And that's -- in some cases, that's switching to a cheaper price meat. In some cases, it's buying our brands which has amazing quality as well.

I would say, Rob, obviously, when we guided at the second quarter, we said that the gross margin contraction could be similar to what we were seeing in Q2. And I would say the dynamics that are in place haven't changed dramatically. Obviously, it's a dynamic environment that we're managing, and our goal, as Rodney mentioned, is to continue to find sourcing benefit and savings to offset the cost increases where we see them and to pass on pricing where it makes sense but also to keep investing in the customer. And I'd say that we -- in Q2, we were doing that. In Q3, we've continued to do that. 
Supply chain would have been a similar sort of headwind in Q2 and Q3. I would say we were successful in mitigating some of the cost increases in shrink during the quarter, which helped during the quarter, although we still think shrink is a dynamic metric to manage based on some of the organized crime that we see in shrink. But overall, we were pleased with the progress in shrink during the quarter. And I think, for us, we kind of guided, while we never get into specific numbers on individual gross margin and OG&A metrics because, as Rodney mentioned there, our goal is to be dynamic in managing it, ensuring that we're delivering sustainably for our customers and growing loyalty while also being able to improve profitability over time by managing the different levers across selling growth rate, cost of goods savings, taking cost out of the business and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. 
So I think it's a dynamic environment we continue to manage. I think somewhere between the Q2 and Q3 range is where we think that we're operating right now. We think Q4 would likely be similar to what we've seen in Q2 and Q3. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are increasing some advertising in the fourth quarter to support the accelerated growth in some of those new initiatives. 
So I think, again, I wouldn't be guiding to a specific number, but in the range that you've seen in Q2 and Q3 is where we feel comfortable in managing the business and driving the right balance of sustainable growth for shareholders while continuing to win customer loyalty over time."

Ken, the point you made is, for us, we want to make sure we have the products customers want. So a Kroger brand item has to earn its right on the shelf, just like any other brand. But for us, it's obviously one of our competitive moats. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and we did a press release earlier in the quarter, we were proud that Home Chef became our fourth brand on -- that is over $1 billion a year. Our brands, for us, is incredibly important on our connection with our customers because it's an incredible great value for our customers with amazing quality. And when you look at Simple Truth and Private Selection, both of those brands offer something that's unique in the marketplace and continue to grow aggressively. Private Selection, most of the items are things that you can't get somewhere else, and Simple Truth just makes it super easy for a customer to eat healthy. So the trends are improving. But for us, it is an incredibly important part of our overall strategic strategy and a competitive moat."

So overall, we would expect that. We do feel good about the momentum in the business in terms of the connections with the customer, our seamless business processes on identifying ways to take cost out, so we can invest some of those cost savings in our associate wages, cost savings and the customer connection and other things.

And specifically, we do believe that some of the food-at-home trends that we've talked a lot about. We've said for some time and continue to believe that data shows that a number of those changes will be structural in nature, and we'll continue to see sustained trends in food at home. 
I think if you look at our performance over the last 2 years that Rodney was alluding to some of the individual drivers, but I think it's demonstrated in our mind the confidence in the value creation model that we're creating, the balance in our model to be able to drive sustainable growth. And the alternative profit stream is continuing to grow at double digits off a higher base. So certainly, I would endorse Rodney's comment more broadly around that commitment to TSR over time.

And if you look at the trend so far in this quarter, I would say that the quarter would have started a little bit slower because of -- we were cycling in that week before Thanksgiving a fairly large spike in consumer behavior that I think started to signal maybe a potential increase in cases this time last year, and then Thanksgiving was very strong. We were very pleased with the results over the Thanksgiving week itself. 
I think some of the questions in our mind as we look towards Q4 that are some of the reasons that we guided to some of the uncertainties, it's hard to predict exactly what will happen with government stimulus dollars in the market, particularly at the state level. That's kind of really hard to get over the skin of what will happen in individual states around ongoing funding. We obviously know there are some continued supply chain challenges around product availability in certain categories, and that's getting better gradually but still has certainly some challenges in the market.

We're really proud of the team's work in those areas, as you mentioned. It started out at the beginning of Restock Kroger. There is a sort of let's grab the opportunities that are immediately in front of us, and I think it's really become a core competency within the organization to drive sustainable savings in our model. 
On the sourcing side, I think I would describe it across a number of different areas. You start with how do you make sure you're consolidating all the buying in the right places, so you can maximize the data and knowledge and use our own experiences from the cost of commodities and the fact we manufacture many of our products so that we're getting smarter and more effective in how we buy. It's evolved into product design and packaging design and how do you really optimize the value while not compromising on quality for the customer, so continuing to drive value in those areas. It's extended to the GPO partnership that we created with Walgreens and looking at how can you consolidate opportunities and best thinking there as well. 
So it continues to evolve for us, and the team is doing a great job in finding those opportunities to maximize savings. And we would expect that to be a continued opportunity for us because we keep identifying new innovative ways to ensure that we're designing for value and maximizing opportunities to be more efficient.
On the sort of the OG&A side of things, that's across a number of different areas as well. So it would include using technology and automation to reduce shrink and waste in the business, to improve on some of those activities in the store and our operations that are very manual and don't really maximize the value that our great associates can deliver for customers, so taking that non-value-added work out wherever we can to allow our associates to focus on the customer. It includes automating our ordering and production planning-type processes. 
One of the big ones, of course, this year that we think would expect to be a tailwind into next year as well for every dollar that we can capture this year would be taking cost out of our digital cost to serve. So we've invested significant labor over the years in building that digital ecosystem, and we'd expect to continue to grow that business, of course. But if we can take out -- if we can improve efficiency on that $10 billion digital business, it creates not just a saving on the next new sale, but it creates a saving on that baseline $10 billion business as well. 
And then finally, I would say we've taken the opportunity to use things like the learnings through COVID on things like administrative costs and where are there areas you can actually work more efficiently and operate in more of a hybrid environment to take cost out of the model as well. 
So I hope that gives you an idea of the way it's kind of really become embedded more in the business, and we certainly would expect as part of our overall TSR growth model to be continuing to take costs to be able to fund investments in our average hourly rate for associates, to be able to invest in pricing and value for the customer while at the same time growing shareholder returns."

I think, really, I would pivot back to some of the comments that we made earlier around we think very much of it from the perspective of in all operating environments, Kroger has been able to demonstrate our ability to navigate through those situations. And it really comes back to what we were talking about earlier around ensuring that we understand the customer better than anybody, using our data, our targeting, our promotional activity and our personalized pricing, and of course, where the pricing structure of product starts to change, really ensuring that customers see the value in our own brand products because of the great quality and value that they offer in combination. And during times of high inflation and certainly in times of economic challenge, we found that Kroger has performed very well, and we've seen customers pivot to some of those opportunities based on the way we can communicate and connect customers with those strategies.

We continue to see people focus on health. If you look at early in COVID, people were not as focused on health, but they're definitely back where they're focused on health in a more aggressive way. All across the board, you see premiumization on what people do. And I always say I'm a reasonably aggressive shopper in our Murray's Cheese. Growing up, I would have never had really good cheese. And once you have a really good cheese, it's hard to go back to what you were used to when you -- before. And what we're finding is customers, when they upgrade and try higher-quality product, they find out they love it, and they become loyal to it. 
If you look at customers in terms of behavior and buying on promotion, it's been reasonably consistent throughout the pandemic. People stretch their budget where they need to or want to because -- and they will splurge in other places, which is one of the things that -- from a go-to-market standpoint that we really try to help a customer stretch their budget on things that are important to them, so they can splurge on what's important to them as well."

Obviously, we are really proud of the business performance, and it has demonstrated strength in the overall model and the position that we're in, as we said in the prepared comments. I would say our overall capital allocation strategy is unchanged, that we start with where are the opportunities to invest in capital in the business to drive sustainable growth. We're obviously in a great position around maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, and we've been able to make some good progress on chipping away at the pension funding from an overall sort of debt and potential liability there as well. 
This year, of course, we've been very committed to continuing to return cash to shareholders with the $1 billion, so far, on buybacks and the 17% increase in the dividend that we announced earlier in the year. So I think we've been very consistent with that plan so far. 
We do think that in the short term, it's important to maintain some flexibility, recognizing some of the uncertainty in the market that we've all talked about, that we're all navigating through at the moment. That being said, within those principles, we do think it's important, and we've been very committed, as you know, as a company, to being very disciplined with cash flow and deploying it to either grow the business or return to shareholders. 
So as we head towards 2022 and as we move towards the March planning meeting and the business update meeting that Rob shared, we'd certainly expect to share more color of how we're thinking about the excess cash and some of the opportunities we're exploring there."

Now our team has done a nice job of starting to identify some opportunities for efficiency. One of the biggest areas is that we continue to have extra warehouse space, and I guess I hesitate to call it extra warehouse space because we're actually using the warehouse space. But -- and over time, as we feel like things are permanent, you'll see us do more permanent-type warehouse projects to expand capacity rather than using it maybe in a way that's not as efficient. 
We would expect to continue to do that in the fourth quarter. 
As we look out next year, we really are working hard to make sure we stay agile in that area because things continue to change so quickly and what's going on with COVID, what's the COVID variance and things like that. So we really are making the decisions on an agile basis, and it's one of the learnings that we've had early on in the pandemic, and we'll continue to do that relative to the supply chain as well."
