I hope you and your families are holding up well in these turbulent times. Certainly, 2020 was an extraordinary year. And I'm incredibly proud of how our organization responded to and executed during a business environment that was anything but business as usual. Keeping our employees safe remains job one, and this has required investment and changes to the way we work: supplying the marketplace with food, required agility, contingency planning and creative ways to increase production, not to mention the courage and dedication of our front-line workers and aiding our communities, a key element of our company's culture and legacy was accelerated during the crisis. And it has been especially heartwarming to see our employees giving their time and effort to the cause. 
We also preserved and improved our financial flexibility. These have been our priorities during the crisis, and we have been executing well against all of them. 
And even while having to execute against crisis management priorities, we also overdelivered on our financial commitments. We did our best to provide you with guidance during the year despite an uncertain environment, and I trust that transparency was helpful to you. We ended up raising that guidance twice during the year, ultimately hitting or exceeding that guidance with our quarter 4 and full year results, even after absorbing $20 million in onetime costs related to redeeming debt late in the year. This is the kind of dependability we are striving for. 
We set out this year to return to balanced financial growth, meaning balance between top line growth, margin expansion and cash flow conversion. And sure enough, through all the unusual impacts, divestiture impact, COVID impacts, 53rd week, we did return to balanced financial growth in 2020: strong organic net sales growth, even if you exclude a reasonable estimate for COVID's net benefit; an expansion in gross profit margin despite incremental COVID related costs; growth in operating profit, even despite losing about 6 percentage points from the mechanical impact of last year's divestiture; a better-than-expected increase in cash flow, featuring a significantly improved conversion of net income. Even excluding COVID net benefits, we returned to balanced financial growth in 2020, right on schedule. 
We executed very well in market. The pandemic presented us with a sampling event like none other. And we saw increases in household penetration that outpaced most of our categories, giving us an excellent opportunity to communicate to and retain new and lapsed consumers. And we outgrew most of our categories, holding or gaining share of categories representing more than 80% of our net sales in those measured markets. 
Our emerging markets are a key long-term growth driver for us, and they represent over 20% of our net sales. In 2020, they were severely tested by pandemic-related shutdowns, economic slowdowns, even social unrest. And yet they delivered high single-digit organic net sales growth for us in 2020, even accelerating from the prior 2 years' growth rates. This is a real testament to our portfolio, our local supply chains and our experienced management teams in these markets. In short, the business performed very well in 2020, and we will take that momentum into 2021. 
Throughout the crisis, we have been working to ensure that there are lasting impacts from 2020 that should increase confidence in our ability to deliver consistent, dependable, balanced growth over time. I'll discuss just a few of them here. 
One is communicating with new and lapsed households. Rather than giving up on A&P we couldn't execute in the first half, we shifted that budgeted investment to the second half, focusing on advertising to these new and lapsed users. And we've leveraged advanced data and analytics to target those households and occasions. This gives us our best opportunity to retain an expanded consumer base. We know that online shopping for food experienced a step change in 2020. And our triple-digit growth in e-commerce sales was made possible by the brands in our portfolio and by our recent years' investment in infrastructure and capabilities. This will continue to benefit us. 
We're investing in our supply chain. This includes sustaining enhanced safety protocols that carry with them higher costs. But the crisis also resulted in us increasing our supply chain's agility and reducing complexity with the exiting of certain noncore product lines and tail SKUs. And it accelerated our expansion of capacity in areas that were already tight before the pandemic hit. This, too, will benefit us in 2021 and beyond. 
Enhanced financial flexibility is another lasting benefit. Improved cash flow generation and the prioritization of debt reduction resulted in deleveraging our balance sheet faster than we had anticipated. As Amit will discuss in a moment, this financial flexibility puts us in a position to resume dividend increases and share repurchases earlier than previously planned, returning more cash to share owners. 
And lastly, we remain solidly on track for consistent balanced growth. Even amidst the crisis, our focus was on what is best for sustainable growth. In addition to sustaining our solid top line growth, we have organizational focus on improving gross profit margin, increasing the return on our brand-building investment and discipline on overhead. 
There will be noise and uncertainty around the pandemic and its impacts. But in the spirit of transparency, we will continue to provide you guidance on our planning stance today. Our guidance for 2021 indicates balanced growth on a 2-year basis, attempting to smoothe out 2020's unusual events and to ensure that we remain on our balanced trajectory. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail."

In a year of unprecedented uncertainty, we consistently kept you apprised of our planning stance, raising our guidance twice during the year. And as shown on Slide #9, we ultimately achieved or exceeded that guidance",1688,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. In a year of unprecedented uncertainty, we consistently kept you apprised of our planning stance, raising our guidance twice during the year. And as shown on Slide #9, we ultimately achieved or exceeded that guidance with the results we announced today. This improving outlook across the year reflected the impact of elevated at-home consumption, of course. But it also reflected the strength of our underlying business and our return to balance growth. 
Let's first review our 2020 results, which are summarized on Slide #10. As I mentioned, our results for the fourth quarter came in better than expected. Organic net sales growth moderated to 2.5% in quarter 4, slightly better than we had forecasted and finished the year with 6% growth as guided. Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit increased slightly year-on-year in the fourth quarter, which was better than we had forecast for the quarter with double-digit brand-building investment, incremental COVID costs and higher performance-based compensation. We finished the year with currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit growth of 3.5%, which is higher than our guidance and includes roughly 6% negative impact from the absence of businesses we divested in 2019. 
Currency-neutral adjusted basis, earnings per share declined year-on-year in quarter 4 owing to a higher tax rate and shares outstanding as well as absorbing $20 million of nonrecurring costs related to our debt redemption we executed in December as part of our efforts to deleverage our balance sheet. 
For the year, our earnings per share grew 2.5%, which excludes roughly 5% negative impact from the absence of divested businesses. Finally, our cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion was much higher than projected, issuing higher earnings and a higher conversion of those net earnings. 
In all, a strong performance and the kind of balanced financial delivery we aim for. 
Let's take a look at these metrics in more detail. We'll start with net sales growth on Slide #11. On organic basis, net sales growth decelerated as expected in quarter 4, coming in at 2.5%. A few factors to point out. At-home consumption growth rates around the world remain elevated, not decelerating as much as expected. Away-from-home declines remained in double digits, though not moderating as much as expected. We experienced adverse timing of shipments in certain categories in the U.S. relative to their sustained consumption growth, and we experienced the business-specific headwind that we had anticipated, such as school closings in Northern Africa and October's civil unrest in Nigeria. Nevertheless, we saw organic growth in all 4 regions, again in quarter 4. 
Outside of organic basis growth, we saw adverse currency translation moderate from earlier in the year, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar since quarter 3. And this year, our quarter 4 included an extra week, something we have every 6 fiscal years. 
For the full year, our organic net sales growth was 6%, featuring growth in both volume and price/mix and with growth in all 4 regions and all 4 major categories groups: snacks, cereal, frozen and noodles and others. A reasonable estimate for the net COVID impact after its various puts and takes would suggest that it contributed about half of this organic net sales growth in 2020, putting our underlying growth at a very strong rate. Rounding out net sales growth for 2020, we roughly lost 5 percentage points from the absence of businesses we had divested back in July 2019. 
Currency translation was offset by the impact of having the extra week in our fourth quarter. 
Now let's turn our discussion to profit margins with Slide #12. As we've discussed, as we enter 2020, our goal was to stabilize gross profit margin, which would require offsetting a natural mix shift towards emerging markets, including our distributor business in Africa. We ended up doing better than that even as that mix shift continues. Specifically, our gross profit margin improved by 60 basis points year-on-year as operating leverage, revenue growth management and productivity initiatives more than offset the impact of more than $60 million of incremental direct COVID-related costs. 
In the fourth quarter, gross margin leveled out because of shipment timing in the U.S. and some incremental costs, particularly in Latin America, but we are pleased with how we performed on this metric in 2020. Our operating profit margin also improved in 2020, but it's quarter-by-quarter performance was greatly affected by the timing in our investment in advertising and consumer promotion. 
Recall that we postponed some advertising and a significant amount of consumer promotions during the first half, when sponsored events were canceled and the industry's focus was on getting food onto shelves. As you know, we decided to put that deferred spending to work in the second half, primarily in advertising aimed at building brand equity and retaining household penetration. The result was double-digit increases year-on-year in A&P during quarter 3 and quarter 4 as increased advertising more than offset decreased consumer promotions. For total A&P, we finished 2020 right on our budget with a mid-single-digit increase year-on-year. 
That brings us to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide #13. Cash flow came in higher than anticipated throughout the year, a combination of our increased operating profit and reduced restructuring outlays along with good working capital management. The result was a significant improvement in our conversion ratio of net income into cash flow. As you know, our priority for cash flow during 2019 and 2020 was to reduce our debt leverage after several years of acquisitions and restructuring outlays. This became all the more important as we entered an uncertain economic environment amidst the pandemic. Our stronger-than-expected cash flow allowed us to reduce debt faster than planned, right off to the $1.2 billion of debt we retired in December. This reduction in debt leverage gives us the financial flexibility to return more cash to shareowners, as I'll discuss in just a moment. 
So let's now turn our attention to 2021, starting with Slide #14. In forecasting our P&L for 2021, we ensured that we remain on track for steady, balanced growth. Obviously, though, 2020 is an unusual base year to say the least. Not only did it have an extra shipping week in quarter 4, but the pandemic created unusually high sales and operating leverage, especially in the first half. And it also resulted in investment being shifted to the second half. 
Our stance was to plan for 2-year growth that keeps us on our strategic plan. Specifically, we planned around assumptions that result in 2-year growth in organic net sales growth that is more than 2%, gross profit margin expansion on a 2-year basis and 2-year growth in currency-neutral operating profit of 3% to 4%, excluding our divested businesses results from the 2019 base. Obviously, we've made planning assumptions around COVID, which are as follows: underlying at-home demand remains relatively elevated but lapped unusual surges in quarter 1 and quarter 2; away-from-home demand remains depressed though moderating over the course of the year; and emerging markets remain in growth, though restrained by challenging macro conditions. 
But as you can see by the red bars on the slide, our underlying base business, excluding the divestiture, COVID and the 53rd week, is expected to post another year of net sales and operating profit growth. And on a 2-year basis, which effectively ignores the noise of 2020, we remain right on our strategic plan through 2021 and would call for similar balance performance in 2022. 
Slide #15 puts our 2021 guidance all together. Organic net sales are expected to be down about 1% year-on-year, reflecting the difficult comps in the first half. On a 2-year compound annual growth, though, this translates to roughly 2.5%, in line with the strategic plan I mentioned earlier. Adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis is projected to be down roughly 2% year-on-year, reflecting difficult comps in the first half related to last year's outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment. 
On a 2-year CAGR and excluding divested businesses from the 2019 base, this translates into roughly 3% to 4% growth, in line with our strategic plan. Adjusted earnings per share on a currency-neutral basis is expected to increase by approximately 1% year-on-year, aided by a decrease in interest expense caused by reduced debt and by lapping last year's debt redemption costs. On a 2-year basis, excluding the impact of the divestiture from 2019, this implies about a 4% to 5% CAGR. 
Cash flow is projected to be about $1.1 billion coming off 2020's exceptional $1.5 billion, but still significantly higher than 2019's cash flow of $600 million, which really was about $900 million when excluding the net of the divested business' cash flow less the divestiture-related tax and other outlays. This 2021 forecast is based on the earnings outlook and some timing of payments such as performance-based compensation accrued in 2020 but paid in 2021. 
Turning to Slide #16. We entered 2021 in very solid financial condition. We have growth momentum across our regions as evidenced by consumption and share trends. We did not pull back on brand investment in 2020, so our brands are in good health. We benefited from strengthened capabilities in digital, data and analytics and e-commerce, and we are well on our way to expanding capacity where it's tight. 
We've improved our ability to convert income into cash flow, and we've deleveraged our balance sheet for increased financial flexibility. The combination of this improved business condition and enhanced financial flexibility enables us to resume share repurchases this year after having refrained from them since quarter 1 2019. 
In addition, we are increasing our quarterly dividend rate starting in quarter 2. This means returning more cash to shareowners, and it reflects our confidence in the business. 
In summary, in 2020, we returned to balanced growth between top line, margins, bottom line and cash flow. We are confident that 2021 will be a continuation of this balanced growth even if 2020's COVID impact and 53rd week creates some noise on a 1-year basis. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses."
283356,701291835,2205714,"Kellogg Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Amit. Let's begin with North America on Slide #18. North America's organic net sales growth decelerated as expected in quarter 4 but in a different way than we projected. Consumption growth in retail channels decelerated only modestly as another",2343,"Thanks, Amit. Let's begin with North America on Slide #18. 
North America's organic net sales growth decelerated as expected in quarter 4 but in a different way than we projected. Consumption growth in retail channels decelerated only modestly as another wave of the pandemic set in. However, related to this was less moderation of declines in away-from-home channels and on-the-go products. 
In addition, we did experience some unexpected shipment timing in quarter 4, which likely resulted in trade inventory decreases in certain categories in the U.S., notably, crackers, cereal and portable wholesome snacks. We don't think this is anything other than timing between quarters, some of which should come back in quarter 1. 
From a financial standpoint, the quarter and year featured balanced growth. On an organic basis, which excludes the impact of 2019's divestiture, but also 2020's 53rd week, Kellogg North America delivered 5% net sales growth in 2020 with both volume and price/mix contributing. Meanwhile, we expanded the region's gross profit margin and grew operating profit, even while increasing brand-building investment to ensure we are retaining new households and adding to our brand's long-term equity. No question, it was a very strong year for Kellogg North America. 
Importantly, we saw growth across our category groups in 2020, as shown on Slide #19. In each of these category groups, there were headwinds in the form of sharply lower away-from-home occasions and outlets as well as reduced on-the-go occasions. The good news is that elevated at-home demand and a consumer preference for brands, accelerated our retail channel growth in each of these category groups. This is a tribute to the strength of our brands, but also to the agility and execution of our team. 
Innovation launches were impeded, but we still launched successes like Jumbo Snax and cereal, expanded into new segments like we did with Incognito in meat alternatives and built on the runaway success of Cheez-It snapped. Marketing programs had to be postponed early in the year, so we revised our commercial plan. We shifted more of our brand-building into advertising, and we put to work in the second half the investment dollars we couldn't execute in the first half. e-commerce growth accelerated throughout the industry in 2020, and our recent years' investments and capability building paid off in the form of triple-digit growth in 2020. 
The result was more than 3% organic net sales growth for our largest business, snacks, despite a lack of on-the-go occasions to go with notably strong 7% growth in cereal and 8% growth in frozen, all despite declines in away-from-home channels. 
More important is our performance in market, depicted on Slide #20. As you can see, we held or gained share in 4 of our 6 primary categories in 2020, including in quarter 4. Even in the 2 categories where we didn't outpace the category, we grew consumption at a double-digit rate. And this overall performance came despite running up against capacity on certain foods and despite having a sizable business in the types of on-the-go foods and pack formats that have declined during the pandemic. 
In cereal, we executed less promotional activity for Frosted Flakes in quarter 4 as we caught up on supply, which held us back late in the year, but we're pleased with our overall consumption growth in 2020 and particularly by the responsiveness of key brands to new messaging, such as Mini-Wheats, Raisin Bran and Special K and to resume media support, such as Apple Jacks and Corn Pops. 
In snacks, our share gain in crackers came from Cheez-It growth in both the base business and from the Snap innovation's impressive year 2 performance. Pringles growth accelerated as the year progressed, gaining share in quarter 4 behind the strength of its standard sized can and core 4 flavors. We grew consumption in a declining portable wholesome snacks category, led by sustained momentum in Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats as well as the resurgence of Nutri-Grain, backed by its first media campaign in several years. 
In frozen, Eggo continued to well outpace its frozen from the griddle category. And in Veggie Foods, Morningstar Farms tested the bounds of capacity and growing consumption nearly 26%, and it narrowed its gap to the surge in category in quarter 4 as we increased its production. So clearly, we are competing well across our categories. 
A potentially lasting impact is the household penetration we gained, as shown on Slide #21. With the exception of portable wholesome snacks, a category affected by reduced on-the-go occasions during the pandemic, we gained penetration in all of our categories. In fact, we outperformed our categories in this area in all but the frozen veggie foods category where we faced capacity limitations and the entrance of new players. This increased penetration is promising for future growth and a big reason we elected to reinvest in our brands in the second half. 
Equally important is the fact that our velocities have increased across all our categories. As shown on Slide #22, our velocities were already above those of almost all of our primary categories going into the year, and they improved further in 2020. This is a very good sign regarding the health of our brands. 
In summary, North America enters 2021 in very good condition, good market fundamentals, well-invested brands, momentum in e-commerce, a proven agility amidst very uncertain conditions and better-than-expected financial performance. As we look to 2021, we will continue to relieve capacity constraints while continuing to invest in communicating to incremental households and resuming a full flight of innovation. While comparisons get a little distortive, especially between March and August, the results should be sustained in market momentum. 
Now let's discuss our international businesses, starting with Europe on Slide #24. For Kellogg Europe, quarter 4 was our 13th consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth. A resurgence in COVID cases and restrictions reaccelerated cereal categories across the region, and we gained share overall by outpacing the category in 4 of our top 5 markets. This was led by a particularly impressive performance in the U.K. and by some of our biggest brands in the region like Crunchy Nut, Tresor and Extra. 
Importantly, our snacks business returned to growth in quarter 4. Recall that in quarter 2 and quarter 3, we'd experienced softness in snack shipments related to COVID and difficult economic conditions in markets like Russia and that a canceled Euro Cup soccer tournament made it more difficult to lap previous year's enormously successful Pringles summer marketing programs. During quarter 4, our Pringles business rebounded nicely, and we finished 2020 with a collective share gain in our top 8 markets led by each of our top 3 markets, the U.K., Germany and Russia. 
From a financial perspective, it was a strong year for Kellogg Europe, even amidst disruptions and costs related to COVID. In addition to the strong 5% organic net sales growth, our gross profit margin improved allowing us to increase brand investment and still deliver strong operating profit growth, even excluding the 53rd week. So Europe enters 2021, with good momentum. 
Our snacks business is on the upswing, and we have exciting innovation planned for Pringles, including a line of island hot flavors, and our commercial plan includes exciting activation around gaming and in the rescheduled EuroCup soccer tournament. While cereal categories will likely decelerate as COVID passes and mobility increases, we are actively investing to retain new households gained. We have a great commercial plan including a multi-brand campaign around well-being, the launch of a strawberry Cocoa Pops and a strong digital activation around key brands like Crunchy Nut, Extra and Tresor, just to name a few. Russia and Central and Eastern Europe remain promising opportunities for expansion even amidst the challenging environment presented by COVID and economic slowdowns. We look to reaccelerate growth in this business in 2021. 
Let's turn to Latin America on Slide #26. We had another strong quarter in this region. Its quarter 4 profit decline had been expected owing to some one-off costs related to Mexico, labeling regulations and a significant year-on-year increase in brand-building. What was impressive was its ability to sustain very strong top line growth amidst challenging conditions and delivered double-digit operating profit growth for the year. Cereal category growth rates in the region continued to decelerate but remained at elevated levels. We outpaced the category in key markets, including Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central America and Argentina. The result was strong net sales growth for cereal across all of our subregions. 
Our snacks business saw improvement again in quarter 4, accelerating our net sales growth in Latin America even as these categories remain under pressure amidst COVID and economic softness. Pringles posted strong consumption growth and share performance led by Mexico and by Brazil, which continues to benefit from local production and a new strategic distributor. Also in Brazil, our Parity business continued to gain share in cookies and powder drinks. 
So Kellogg Latin America has momentum going into 2021. Snacks growth should be led by continued momentum in Pringles, which is in a good position to build on its expansion in Brazil. And adding to our snacks offerings, we've just launched Cheez-It in that market. 
In cereal, we assume continued deceleration in the pandemic-related consumption growth, and we continue to navigate through Mexico's regulatory environment. Nevertheless, we have good plans in place and aim to continue to outpace their categories. 
And we'll finish with a discussion about EMEA, shown on Slide #28. As we told you a few months ago, our business in this region faced 2 primary headwinds in the form of civil unrest that disrupted all commerce in Nigeria during the last couple of weeks of October and school closings in Northern Africa, which effectively canceled a sizable biscuits business for us in quarter 4. Together, these likely clipped about 5 percentage points of EMEA's Q4 net sales growth. But behind these known disruptions, we continued positive performance. 
We continue to grow our noodles and other business in Africa and the Middle East, with momentum sustained through the fourth quarter and full year net sales approaching $1 billion. This gives our portfolio a low price point staple with terrific opportunity for continued growth. 
In cereal, we continue to outpace category growth in the region behind effective commercial programs, led by strong share performance in markets ranging from Australia and Korea to India and South Africa. Pringles net sales grew on the strength of double-digit consumption growth in quarter 4, outpacing the category overall in the region, with notable share gains in markets like Australia, Korea and South Africa. It was the rest of our snacks business that felt the brunt of the net sales headwinds I mentioned earlier, resulting in the overall snacks decline you see on this slide. 
Financially, it was a quarter of good balanced growth. Net sales growth, improved gross profit margin and growth in operating profit, even with a significant year-on-year increase in brand-building investment. 
The quarter finishes what was another impressive year for EMEA, especially given the environment. Like our other regions, EMEA has experienced elevated cereal consumption, giving us the opportunity to retain consumers with the right messaging and innovation while continuing to expand penetration in emerging markets. While other parts of our snacks businesses were interrupted by various COVID impacts, Pringles continues to show good momentum heading into the new year, and we continue to grow our business in Africa and the Middle East with noodles giving us a third growth engine to go along with cereal and snacks. 
Let's wrap up with a brief summary on Slide #31. In a year unlike any other, we are proud of the way our organization rallied to execute through unprecedented and challenging conditions. 
First, we've managed well through crisis. We've kept each other safe, supplying the marketplace with food and aiding our communities. The crisis is not over, and we will continue to focus on these areas. 
Second, we improved our competitive positions in 2020. We expanded household penetration by more than our categories, grew consumption across key markets, brands and retail channels, notably in e-commerce. We held or gained share in categories that represent nearly 85% of our company's net sales in those measured markets, and we increased our brand investment for the year, even after some of it had to be delayed during the first half. 
Third, we sustained strong growth in emerging markets in spite of challenging conditions. In fact, we accelerated our growth in these markets. This is a credit to our experienced management teams, our diversified geographic footprint, our local supply chains and the breadth of our portfolio. 
Fourth, we delivered better-than-expected financial results. We twice raised our full year outlook and ultimately delivered on that guidance. We accelerated our organic net sales growth even without COVID. And in a nod to balanced delivery, we expanded our gross profit margin in spite of incremental COVID costs and ongoing mix shifts towards emerging markets. We delivered operating profit growth and EPS growth even despite the impact of last year's major divestiture. 
And finally, we improved our financial flexibility. We generated stronger-than-expected cash flow, allowing us to pay down debt faster than anticipated. 
So we entered 2021 a stronger company. Our outlook keeps us on a 2-year trajectory that is right on our strategic plan. We have a strong commercial plan that builds on the increased consumer communication of 2020 and returns to broader activation and a more complete innovation launch calendar, all aimed at retaining households and continuing to improve our share across categories. We continue to invest in capacity that will enable us to catch up to demand. And because of our improved financial flexibility, we are returning to share buybacks and dividend increases earlier than anticipated. Our goal is sustained balance between top line and cash flow growth, and we are on firmer footing now more than ever. 
I'd like to really thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. And with that, we'll now open it up for your questions."

There's a lot of puts and takes when you think about 2021 guidance versus 2020, which is why we keep going back to 2019 ex divestiture and talking about that as kind of a pretty relevant base year in looking at a 2-year CAGR. 
Because when you look at areas like away from home, which will recover and on-the-go consumption, which will recover, that's going to offset some deceleration that we're seeing, because you're not going to have another surge in March and elevated demands like April and May, right? It's going to remain elevated versus 2019, but not at the same levels as 2021. 
Getting back to away-from-home, the reason we think that will recover slightly more slowly for us is because we over-index in travel leisure, areas like that, which we think will recover more slowly, right? Travel won't come back quite as quickly as perhaps people going to the office and being on the go. 
So lots of puts and takes in terms of what's going to happen by brand, by category, by geography. 
And the biggest COVID impacts that we saw were clearly North America, Europe. Very proud of what the team did in Europe in pivoting away from the Euro soccer championship and towards gaming. We do think that soccer will come -- or we're hopeful that soccer will come back in some ways in 2021. 
So there's a lot in the guidance, but what we have really done is [indiscernible] COVID impact in 2020, as we think about 2021, look at the 2019 base and put together winning plans by category, by geography, by brand that gets us exactly to where we are today when we talk about the 2021 guidance and rolls up into the net sales, operating profit, EPS that we talked about. 
So I don't know, Amit, if you want to add anything to that."

Nobody anticipated, obviously, the type of year that cereal would have. Category grew nearly 9%, slowed down a little bit in the second half, but still 5, 6 percentage growth so we worked very hard all year to keep up with demand and keep our service levels as high as we possibly could. And we ended the year with a flat share performance, slipped a little in the fourth quarter, as you noted. Almost all of that slippage was due to Frosted Flakes, where because of capacity, we had to back away from promotions. You can see that in the syndicated data, down 20% in incremental sales because we couldn't execute against the Mission Tiger program and we wanted to keep our service levels where retailers deserve them to be. So we did give up promotional slots. And nearly all of our share decline in the fourth quarter was due to Frosted Flakes. 
Now as we enter 2021, we continue to build against capacity. We continue to make good improvements, and we continue to be very optimistic. As we go through the first half of this year, we're going to get better and better in terms of that capacity. And therefore, we'll get better and better in terms of our share performance."

I think we closed out 2020 with input cost inflation in the mid-single digits, and this was mostly offset by the productivity right all the way through quarter 4. 
I think we have seen grain and energy markets rebound sharply in recent months just on near-term supply, demand and other factors. I think from an exchange-traded commodity standpoint, we are well hedged through the first half of 2021 and roughly around the 70% level of hedging coverage for the year. 
So I think in terms of total inflation for 2021, we expect that to be higher than what we've experienced in 2020, but still in the mid single digit rates. And I think we'll be looking to offset that with our usual productivity programs, with the revenue growth management. And overall, as we've guided, we'd expect our gross margin to be up on a 2-year basis. Obviously, in this -- in 2020, our gross margin was up 60 basis points. And on a 2-year basis, we still expect gross margins to be up. And from a '21 standpoint, we'd be aiming for our gross margins to be stable."

Have you -- I'm looking for like a high level viewpoint here, but like how much of those incremental sales or share you gained some categories do you expect to hold on to? So that was my first question. 
The second one was and related to that. As we look across a number of your categories, there were some areas where you had clear market share gains through the year. But in the fourth -- really through the year, but especially in the fourth quarter, we have seen market share losses, in particular, in the U.S., and I'm looking mostly measured channels here, some market share losses there. So I wanted to just kind of bring that back around to that concept about keeping marketing flat this year in areas. Where you've had some share pressure, do you need to increase your marketing and perhaps that's part of the plan in 2021?"

First, as we've said in the past, our goal is to always gain share. And so we finished the year globally with holding or gaining share in over 80% of our category, country combinations where there's measured data. So we feel good about that. 
In terms of the U.S., in particular, which you referenced, I did talk about the U.S. RTEC where we held share for the full year, but we lost 50 basis points of share in the fourth quarter, much of that due to capacity limitations that we had, which I already mentioned. 
And so our plan for 2021, we think in RTEC, in ready-to-eat cereal, is a winning plan. But if I look at some of the other categories for the full year and even the fourth quarter, if you look at the U.S. Snacks business in crackers, we gained share for the full year, and we gained share in the fourth quarter. So we gained 50 basis points of cracker share in the fourth quarter. In saltine, which the category was explosive in the full year, gained about 12.5 points of volume. We were up 11. So based on our size, we were down ever so slightly. But in the fourth quarter, actually, we performed nearly 15% growth against the category of 10%. So we actually did better in salty, our Pringles business. 
If I look at the portable wholesome snacks category, obviously, a lot of on-the-go, so a category that was under pressure. For the full year and the fourth quarter, we had tremendous share performances. So we gained 250 basis points of share for the full year, 390 basis points in the fourth quarter. And that was great performance by Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Treats. Nutri-Grain returned to growth in the fourth quarter. 
And then if I look at frozen, from the griddle, our Eggo business, obviously, terrific year. Again, some capacity limitations for us, but we gained 150 basis points of share in the fourth quarter, which was better than our -- is on line with our full year performance. 
And then finally, in veg/vegan, which has got a lot of attention because it's an explosive growth category. We were capacity constrained again there because nobody planned for the type of explosive growth. But we were up for the full year, 24%, which wasn't enough to gain share. We lost 1 basis point of share. But in the fourth quarter, we did better. We cut that share decline more than in half. We lost 40 basis points, and we're up 20%. So that's a pretty good performance there. 
So in the categories where we didn't gain share, we were still growing double digits is another way to look at it. So that's why we like where our brand-building is. We think it's been very, very productive. We measure every ROI by brand, by category. And we think we entered 2021 with a lot of good momentum in our brands, in our categories and a good outlook for share performance in 2021."

So Steve, a big piece of this strategic playbook has been reinvesting for growth, right? That's the theme. And you're getting there. Gross profit margins a little better, but we obviously haven't seen a lot of operating profit margin, which can obviously help your free cash flow grow over time.

So when you look back and look at the numbers and say, cash flow or overall, I think you said absolute OP dollars, there's going to be a big difference because of that divestiture. 
And if I think about where we finished the year, so organic net sales of plus 6%, right, ForEx neutral adjusted OP of 3.5%, ForEx adjusted EPS of 2.3% and a cash flow of $1.5 billion, that's a terrific year, I think, under any set of circumstances. And based on the guidance that we gave in 2021, to your question around cash, it's substantially better than the 2019 performance. And remember, there's some outflows of cash that happened whether it be incentives, whether it be other release of accruals that were accrued for in 2020, and the cash will actually outflow in 2021, which is why I think it's again useful to look at a 2-year comparison on everything, including the cash flow performance, which continues to get better. 
And so as we exit this year, that's why we're very confident that as a company, from a top line through a balanced bottom line delivery standpoint, we are a much stronger company.

And then if you adjust for the pension income that runs through our P&L, that's about a 15% adjustment. It gets us to the high 90s. 
So I think from an overall standpoint, it's balanced. We -- in 2020, we demonstrated. We delivered balanced delivery. And certainly, the guidance for 2021 calls for that, for another year of that."

Having said that, we did launch Incogmeato. We're up to about a full point share when we look at our velocities relative to some of the smaller players. We're exceeding those velocities. When we look at the velocities compared to early Morningstar Farms launches at the same stage. We're ahead of those velocities as well. 
And as I said, we've got these chicken offerings, including Disney, Royalty, chicken offerings that are coming to the 4 right now. 
So we feel very good about where the whole Morningstar Farms performance is. And we continue to innovate around Morningstar Farms, but also Incogmeato. We're bullish about this, and 25% consumption growth is pretty good."

283356,701291835,2205879,"Kellogg Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are holding up well in these turbulent times. Certainly, 2020 was an extraordinary year.

I hope you and your families are holding up well in these turbulent times. Certainly, 2020 was an extraordinary year. And I'm incredibly proud of how our organization responded to and executed during a business environment that was anything but business as usual. Keeping our employees safe remains job one, and this has required investment and changes to the way we work.
Supplying the marketplace with food required agility, contingency planning and creative ways to increase production, not to mention the courage and dedication of our front-line workers and aiding our communities, a key element of our company's culture and legacy was accelerated during the crisis. And it has been especially heartwarming to see our employees giving their time and effort to the cause. We also preserved and improved our financial flexibility. These have been our priorities during the crisis, and we have been executing well against all of them.
And even while having to execute against crisis management priorities, we also overdelivered on our financial commitments. We did our best to provide you with guidance during the year despite an uncertain environment, and I trust that transparency was helpful to you. We ended up raising that guidance twice during the year, ultimately hitting or exceeding that guidance with our quarter 4 and full year results, even after absorbing $20 million in onetime costs related to redeeming debt late in the year. This is the kind of dependability we are striving for.
We set out this year to return to balanced financial growth, meaning balance between top line growth, margin expansion and cash flow conversion. And sure enough, through all the unusual impacts, divestiture impact, COVID impacts, 53rd week, we did return to balanced financial growth in 2020. Strong organic net sales growth, even if you exclude a reasonable estimate for COVID's net benefit; an expansion in gross profit margin despite incremental COVID related costs; growth in operating profit, even despite losing about 6 percentage points from the mechanical impact of last year's divestiture; a better-than-expected increase in cash flow, featuring a significantly improved conversion of net income. Even excluding COVID net benefits, we returned to balanced financial growth in 2020, right on schedule.
We executed very well in market. The pandemic presented us with a sampling event like none other. And we saw increases in household penetration that outpaced most of our categories, giving us an excellent opportunity to communicate to and retain new and lapsed consumers. And we outgrew most of our categories, holding or gaining share of categories representing more than 80% of our net sales in those measured markets.
Our emerging markets are a key long-term growth driver for us, and they represent over 20% of our net sales. In 2020, they were severely tested by pandemic-related shutdowns, economic slowdowns, even social unrest. And yet they delivered high single-digit organic net sales growth for us in 2020, even accelerating from the prior 2 years' growth rates. This is a real testament to our portfolio, our local supply chains and our experienced management teams in these markets. In short, the business performed very well in 2020, and we will take that momentum into 2021.
Throughout the crisis, we have been working to ensure that there are lasting impacts from 2020 that should increase confidence in our ability to deliver consistent, dependable, balanced growth over time. I'll discuss just a few of them here.
One is communicating with new and lapsed households. Rather than giving up on A&P, we couldn't execute in the first half. We shifted that budgeted investment to the second half, focusing on advertising to these new and lapsed users. And we've leveraged advanced data and analytics to target those households and occasions. This gives us our best opportunity to retain an expanded consumer base. We know that online shopping for food experienced a step change in 2020. Our triple-digit growth in e-commerce sales was made possible by the brands in our portfolio and by our recent years' investment in infrastructure and capabilities. This will continue to benefit us.
We're investing in our supply chain. This includes sustaining enhanced safety protocols that carry with them higher costs. But the crisis also resulted in us increasing our supply chain's agility and reducing complexity with the exiting of certain noncore product lines and tail SKUs. And it accelerated our expansion of capacity in areas that were already tight before the pandemic hit. This, too, will benefit us in 2021 and beyond.
Enhanced financial flexibility is another lasting benefit. Improved cash flow generation and the prioritization of debt reduction resulted in deleveraging our balance sheet faster than we had anticipated. As Amit will discuss in a moment, this financial flexibility puts us in a position to resume dividend increases and share repurchases earlier than previously planned, returning more cash to share owners.
And lastly, we remain solidly on track for consistent balanced growth. Even amidst the crisis, our focus was on what is best for sustainable growth. In addition to sustaining our solid top line growth, we have organizational focus on improving gross profit margin, increasing the return on our brand-building investment and discipline on overhead.
There will be noise and uncertainty around the pandemic and its impacts. But in the spirit of transparency, we will continue to provide you guidance on our planning stance today. Our guidance for 2021 indicates balanced growth on a 2-year basis, attempting to smoothe out 2020's unusual events and to ensure that we remain on our balanced trajectory.
So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail."

In a year of unprecedented uncertainty, we consistently kept you apprised of our planning stance, raising our guidance twice during the year. And as shown on Slide #9, we ultimately achieved or exceeded that guidance",1690,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. In a year of unprecedented uncertainty, we consistently kept you apprised of our planning stance, raising our guidance twice during the year. And as shown on Slide #9, we ultimately achieved or exceeded that guidance with the results we announced today. This improving outlook across the year reflected the impact of elevated at-home consumption, of course. But it also reflected the strength of our underlying business and our return to balance growth.
Let's first review our 2020 results, which are summarized on Slide #10. As I mentioned, our results for the fourth quarter came in better than expected. Organic net sales growth moderated to 2.5% in quarter 4, slightly better than we had forecasted and finished the year with 6% growth as guided.
Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit increased slightly year-on-year in the fourth quarter, which was better than we had forecast for the quarter with double-digit brand-building investment, incremental COVID costs and higher performance-based compensation. We finished the year with currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit growth of 3.5%, which is higher than our guidance and includes roughly 6% negative impact from the absence of businesses we divested in 2019.
Currency-neutral adjusted basis earnings per share declined year-on-year in quarter 4 owing to a higher tax rate and shares outstanding as well as absorbing $20 million of nonrecurring costs related to our debt redemption we executed in December as part of our efforts to deleverage our balance sheet. For the year, our earnings per share grew 2.5%, which excludes roughly 5% negative impact from the absence of divested businesses. Finally, our cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion was much higher than projected, issuing higher earnings and a higher conversion of those net earnings. In all, a strong performance and the kind of balanced financial delivery we aim for.
Let's take a look at these metrics in more detail. We'll start with net sales growth and Slide #11. On organic basis, net sales growth decelerated as expected in quarter 4, coming in at 2.5%. A few factors to point out. At-home consumption growth rates around the world remain elevated, not decelerating as much as expected. Away-from-home declines remained in double digits, though not moderating as much as expected. We experienced adverse timing of shipments in certain categories in the U.S. relative to their sustained consumption growth, and we experienced the business-specific headwind that we had anticipated, such as school closings in Northern Africa and October's civil unrest in Nigeria. Nevertheless, we saw organic growth in all 4 regions again in quarter 4.
Outside of organic basis growth, we saw adverse currency translation moderate from earlier in the year, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar since quarter 3. And this year, our quarter 4 included an extra week, something we have every 6 fiscal years.
For the full year, our organic net sales growth was 6%, featuring growth in both volume and price/mix and with growth in all 4 regions and all 4 major category groups: snacks, cereal, frozen and noodles and others. A reasonable estimate for the net COVID impact after its various puts and takes would suggest that it contributed about half of this organic net sales growth in 2020, putting our underlying growth at a very strong rate. Rounding out net sales growth for 2020, we roughly lost 5 percentage points from the absence of businesses we had divested back in July 2019. Currency translation was offset by the impact of having the extra week in our fourth quarter.
Now let's turn our discussion to profit margins with Slide #12. As we've discussed, as we entered 2020, our goal was to stabilize gross profit margin, which would require offsetting a natural mix shift towards emerging markets, including our distributor business in Africa. We ended up doing better than that even as that mix shift continues. Specifically, our gross profit margin improved by 60 basis points year-on-year as operating leverage, revenue growth management and productivity initiatives more than offset the impacts of more than $60 million of incremental direct COVID-related costs.
In the fourth quarter, gross margin leveled out because of shipment timing in the U.S. and some incremental costs, particularly in Latin America, but we are pleased with how we performed on this metric in 2020. Our operating profit margin also improved in 2020, but its quarter-by-quarter performance was greatly affected by the timing in our investment in advertising and consumer promotion. Recall that we postponed some advertising and a significant amount of consumer promotions during the first half, when sponsored events were canceled and the industry's focus was on getting food onto shelves. As you know, we decided to put that deferred spending to work in the second half, primarily in advertising aimed at building brand equity and retaining household penetration. The result was double-digit increases year-on-year in A&P during quarter 3 and quarter 4 as increased advertising more than offset decreased consumer promotions. For total A&P, we finished 2020 right on our budget with a mid-single-digit increase year-on-year.
That brings us to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide #13. Cash flow came in higher than anticipated throughout the year, a combination of our increased operating profit and reduced restructuring outlays along with good working capital management. The result was a significant improvement in our conversion ratio of net income into cash flow. As you know, our priority for cash flow during 2019 and 2020 was to reduce our debt leverage after several years of acquisitions and restructuring outlays. This became all the more important as we entered an uncertain economic environment amidst the pandemic. Our stronger-than-expected cash flow allowed us to reduce debt faster than planned, right up to the $1.2 billion of debt we retired in December. This reduction in debt leverage gives us the financial flexibility to return more cash to share owners, as I'll discuss in just a moment.
So let's now turn our attention to 2021, starting with Slide #14. In forecasting our P&L for 2021, we ensured that we remain on track for steady, balanced growth. Obviously, though, 2020 is an unusual base year to say the least. Not only did it have an extra shipping week in quarter 4, but the pandemic created unusually high sales and operating leverage, especially in the first half. And it also resulted in investment being shifted to the second half.
Our stance was to plan for 2-year growth that keeps us on our strategic plan. Specifically, we planned around assumptions that result in 2-year growth in organic net sales growth that is more than 2%, gross profit margin expansion on a 2-year basis and 2-year growth in currency-neutral operating profit of 3% to 4%, excluding our divested businesses results from the 2019 base. Obviously, we've made planning assumptions around COVID, which are as follows: underlying at-home demand remains relatively elevated but laps unusual surges in quarter 1 and quarter 2; away-from-home demand remains depressed, though moderating over the course of the year; and emerging markets remain in growth, though restrained by challenging macro conditions.
But as you can see by the red bars on the slide, our underlying base business, excluding the divestiture, COVID and the 53rd week, is expected to post another year of net sales and operating profit growth. And on a 2-year basis, which effectively ignores the noise of 2020, we remain right on our strategic plan through 2021 and would call for similar balance performance in 2022.
Slide #15 puts our 2021 guidance all together. Organic net sales are expected to be down about 1% year-on-year, reflecting the difficult comps in the first half. On a 2-year compound annual growth, though, this translates to roughly 2.5%, in line with the strategic plan I mentioned earlier. Adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis is projected to be down roughly 2% year-on-year, reflecting difficult comps in the first half related to last year's outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment.
On a 2-year CAGR and excluding divested businesses from the 2019 base, this translates into roughly 3% to 4% growth, in line with our strategic plan. Adjusted earnings per share on a currency-neutral basis is expected to increase by approximately 1% year-on-year, aided by a decrease in interest expense caused by reduced debt and by lapping last year's debt redemption costs.
On a 2-year basis, excluding the impact of the divestiture from 2019, this implies about a 4% to 5% CAGR. Cash flow is projected to be about $1.1 billion coming off 2020's exceptional $1.5 billion, but still significantly higher than 2019's cash flow of $600 million, which really was about $900 million when excluding the net of the divested business' cash flow less the divestiture-related tax and other outlays. This 2021 forecast is based on the earnings outlook and some timing of payments such as performance-based compensation accrued in 2020 but paid in 2021.
Turning to Slide #16. We entered 2021 in very solid financial condition. We have growth momentum across our regions as evidenced by consumption and share trends. We did not pull back on brand investment in 2020, so our brands are in good health. We benefited from strengthened capabilities in digital, data and analytics and e-commerce, and we are well on our way to expanding capacity where it's tight.
We've improved our ability to convert income into cash flow, and we've deleveraged our balance sheet for increased financial flexibility. The combination of this improved business condition and enhanced financial flexibility enables us to resume share repurchases this year after having refrained from them since quarter 1 2019. In addition, we are increasing our quarterly dividend rate starting in quarter 2. This means returning more cash to share owners, and it reflects our confidence in the business.
In summary, in 2020, we returned to balanced growth between top line, margins, bottom line and cash flow. We are confident that 2021 will be a continuation of this balanced growth even if 2020's COVID impact and 53rd week creates some noise on a 1-year basis.
And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses."
283356,701291835,2205879,"Kellogg Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Amit. Let's begin with North America and Slide #18. North America's organic net sales growth decelerated as expected in quarter 4, but in a different way than we projected. Consumption growth in retail channels decelerated only modestly as another",2344,"Thanks, Amit. Let's begin with North America and Slide #18. North America's organic net sales growth decelerated as expected in quarter 4, but in a different way than we projected. Consumption growth in retail channels decelerated only modestly as another wave of the pandemic set in. However, related to this was less moderation of declines in away-from-home channels and on-the-go products. In addition, we did experience some unexpected shipment timing in quarter 4, which likely resulted in trade inventory decreases in certain categories in the U.S., notably, crackers, cereal and portable wholesome snacks. We don't think this is anything other than timing between quarters, some of which should come back in quarter 1.
From a financial standpoint, the quarter and year featured balanced growth. On an organic basis, which excludes the impact of 2019's divestiture, but also 2020's 53rd week, Kellogg North America delivered 5% net sales growth in 2020 with both volume and price/mix contributing. Meanwhile, we expanded the region's gross profit margin and grew operating profit, even while increasing brand-building investment to ensure we are retaining new households and adding to our brand's long-term equity. No question, it was a very strong year for Kellogg North America.
Importantly, we saw growth across our category groups in 2020, as shown on Slide #19. In each of these category groups, there were headwinds in the form of sharply lower away-from-home occasions and outlets as well as reduced on-the-go occasions. The good news is that elevated at-home demand and a consumer preference for brands accelerated our retail channel growth in each of these category groups. This is a tribute to the strength of our brands, but also to the agility and execution of our team.
Innovation launches were impeded, but we still launched successes like Jumbo Snax and cereal, expanded into new segments like we did with Incogmeato in meat alternatives and built on the runaway success of Cheez-It Snap'd. Marketing programs had to be postponed early in the year, so we revised our commercial plan. We shifted more of our brand-building into advertising, and we put to work in the second half the investment dollars we couldn't execute in the first half.
E-commerce growth accelerated throughout the industry in 2020, and our recent years' investments and capability building paid off in the form of triple-digit growth in 2020. The result was more than 3% organic net sales growth for our largest business, snacks, despite a lack of on-the-go occasions to go with notably strong 7% growth in cereal and 8% growth in frozen, all despite declines in away-from-home channels.
More important is our performance in market, depicted on Slide #20. As you can see, we held or gained share in 4 of our 6 primary categories in 2020, including in quarter 4. Even in the 2 categories where we didn't outpace the category, we grew consumption at a double-digit rate. And this overall performance came despite running up against capacity on certain foods and despite having a sizable business in the types of on-the-go foods and pack formats that have declined during the pandemic.
In cereal, we executed less promotional activity for frosted flakes in quarter 4 as we caught up on supply, which held us back late in the year. But we're pleased with our overall consumption growth in 2020 and particularly by the responsiveness of key brands to new messaging, such as Mini-Wheats, Raisin Bran and Special K and to resume media support, such as Apple Jacks and Corn Pops.
In snacks, our share gain in crackers came from Cheez-It's growth in both the base business and from the Snap'd innovation's impressive year 2 performance. Pringles growth accelerated as the year progressed, gaining share in quarter 4 behind the strength of its standard sized can and core 4 flavors. We grew consumption in a declining portable wholesome snacks category, led by sustained momentum in Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats as well as the resurgence of Nutri-Grain, backed by its first media campaign in several years.
In frozen, Eggo continued to well outpace its frozen from the griddle category. And in veggie foods, Morningstar Farms tested the bounds of capacity and growing consumption nearly 26%, and it narrowed its gap to the surging category in quarter 4 as we increased its production. So clearly, we are competing well across our categories.
A potentially lasting impact is the household penetration we gained, as shown on Slide #21. With the exception of portable wholesome snacks, a category affected by reduced on-the-go occasions during the pandemic, we gained penetration in all of our categories. In fact, we outperformed our categories in this area in all but the frozen veggie foods category where we faced capacity limitations and the entrance of new players. This increased penetration is promising for future growth and a big reason we elected to reinvest in our brands in the second half.
Equally important is the fact that our velocities have increased across all our categories. As shown on Slide #22, our velocities were already above those of almost all of our primary categories going into the year and they improved further in 2020. This is a very good sign regarding the health of our brands.
In summary, North America enters 2021 in very good condition, good in market fundamentals, well-invested brands, momentum in e-commerce, a proven agility amidst very uncertain conditions and better-than-expected financial performance. As we look to 2021, we will continue to relieve capacity constraints while continuing to invest in communicating to incremental households and resuming a full flight of innovation. While comparisons get a little distortive, especially between March and August, the results should be sustained in market momentum.
Now let's discuss our international businesses, starting with Europe on Slide #24. For Kellogg Europe, quarter 4 was our 13th consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth. A resurgence in COVID cases and restrictions reaccelerated cereal categories across the region, and we gained share overall by outpacing the category in 4 of our top 5 markets. This was led by a particularly impressive performance in the U.K. and by some of our biggest brands in the region like Crunchy Nut, Tresor and Extra.
Importantly, our snacks business returned to growth in quarter 4. Recall that in quarter 2 and quarter 3, we'd experienced softness in snack shipments related to COVID and difficult economic conditions in markets like Russia and that a canceled Euro Cup soccer tournament made it more difficult to lap previous year's enormously successful Pringles summer marketing programs. During quarter 4, our Pringles business rebounded nicely and we finished 2020 with a collective share gain in our top 8 markets led by each of our top 3 markets, the U.K., Germany and Russia.
From a financial perspective, it was a strong year for Kellogg Europe, even amidst disruptions and costs related to COVID. In addition to the strong 5% organic net sales growth, our gross profit margin improved allowing us to increase brand investment and still deliver strong operating profit growth, even excluding the 53rd week. So Europe enters 2021, with good momentum.
Our snacks business is on the upswing, and we have exciting innovation planned for Pringles, including a line of sizzling hot flavors and our commercial plan includes exciting activation around gaming and in the rescheduled Euro Cup soccer tournament. While cereal categories will likely decelerate as COVID passes and mobility increases, we are actively investing to retain new households gained.
We have a great commercial plan, including a multi-brand campaign around well-being, the launch of a strawberry Coco Pops and a strong digital activation around key brands like Crunchy Nut, Extra and Tresor, just to name a few. Russia and Central and Eastern Europe remain promising opportunities for expansion even amidst the challenging environment presented by COVID and economic slowdowns. We look to reaccelerate growth in this business in 2021.
Let's turn to Latin America on Slide #26. We had another strong quarter in this region. Its quarter 4 profit decline had been expected owing to some one-off costs related to Mexico labeling regulations and a significant year-on-year increase in brand-building. What was impressive was its ability to sustain very strong top line growth amidst challenging conditions and delivered double-digit operating profit growth for the year. Cereal category growth rates in the region continued to decelerate, but remained at elevated levels. We outpaced the category in key markets, including Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central America and Argentina. The result was strong net sales growth for cereal across all of our subregions.
Our snacks business saw improvement again in quarter 4, accelerating our net sales growth in Latin America even as these categories remain under pressure amidst COVID and economic softness. Pringles posted strong consumption growth and share performance led by Mexico and by Brazil, which continues to benefit from local production and a new strategic distributor. Also in Brazil, our Parati business continued to gain share in cookies and powder drinks.
So Kellogg Latin America has momentum going into 2021. Snacks growth should be led by continued momentum in Pringles, which is in a good position to build on its expansion in Brazil. And adding to our snacks offerings, we've just launched Cheez-It in that market.
In cereal, we assume continued deceleration in the pandemic-related consumption growth, and we continue to navigate through Mexico's regulatory environment. Nevertheless, we have good plans in place and aim to continue to outpace their categories.
And we'll finish with a discussion about EMEA, shown on Slide #28. As we told you a few months ago, our business in this region faced 2 primary headwinds in the form of civil unrest that disrupted all commerce in Nigeria during the last couple of weeks of October and school closings in Northern Africa, which effectively canceled a sizable biscuits business for us in quarter 4. Together, these likely clipped about 5 percentage points of EMEA's Q4 net sales growth. But behind these known disruptions, we continued positive performance.
We continue to grow our noodles and other business in Africa and the Middle East, with momentum sustained through the fourth quarter and full year net sales approaching $1 billion. This gives our portfolio a low price point staple with terrific opportunity for continued growth.
In cereal, we continue to outpace category growth in the region behind effective commercial programs, led by strong share performance in markets ranging from Australia and Korea to India and South Africa.
Pringles net sales grew on the strength of double-digit consumption growth in quarter 4, outpacing the category overall in the region, with notable share gains in markets like Australia, Korea and South Africa. It was the rest of our snacks business that felt the brunt of the net sales headwinds I mentioned earlier, resulting in the overall snacks decline you see on this slide.  
Financially, it was a quarter of good balanced growth. Net sales growth, improved gross profit margin and growth in operating profit, even with a significant year-on-year increase in brand-building investment.
The quarter finishes what was another impressive year for EMEA, especially given the environment. Like our other regions, EMEA has experienced elevated cereal consumption, giving us the opportunity to retain consumers with the right messaging and innovation, while continuing to expand penetration in emerging markets. While other parts of our snacks businesses were interrupted by various COVID impacts, Pringles continues to show good momentum heading into the new year, and we continue to grow our business in Africa and the Middle East with noodles giving us a third growth engine to go along with cereal and snacks.
Let's wrap up with a brief summary on Slide #31. In a year unlike any other, we are proud of the way our organization rallied to execute through unprecedented and challenging conditions. First, we've managed well through crisis. We've kept each other safe, supplying the marketplace with food and aiding our communities. The crisis is not over, and we will continue to focus on these areas.
Second, we improved our competitive positions in 2020. We expanded household penetration by more than our categories, grew consumption across key markets, brands and retail channels, notably in e-commerce. We held or gained share in categories that represent nearly 85% of our company's net sales in those measured markets, and we increased our brand investment for the year, even after some of it had to be delayed during the first half.
Third, we sustained strong growth in emerging markets in spite of challenging conditions. In fact, we accelerated our growth in these markets. This is a credit to our experienced management teams, our diversified geographic footprint, our local supply chains and the breadth of our portfolio.
Fourth, we delivered better-than-expected financial results. We twice raised our full year outlook and ultimately delivered on that guidance. We accelerated our organic net sales growth even without COVID. And in a nod to balanced delivery, we expanded our gross profit margin in spite of incremental COVID costs and ongoing mix shifts towards emerging markets. We delivered operating profit growth and EPS growth even despite the impact of last year's major divestiture.
And finally, we improved our financial flexibility. We generated stronger-than-expected cash flow, allowing us to pay down debt faster than anticipated.
So we entered 2021 a stronger company. Our outlook keeps us on a 2-year trajectory that is right on our strategic plan. We have a strong commercial plan that builds on the increased consumer communication of 2020 and returns to broader activation and a more complete innovation launch calendar, all aimed at retaining households and continuing to improve our share across categories. We continue to invest in capacity that will enable us to catch up to demand. And because of our improved financial flexibility, we are returning to share buybacks and dividend increases earlier than anticipated. Our goal is sustained balance between top line and cash flow growth, and we are on firmer footing now more than ever.
I'd like to really thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. And with that, we'll now open it up for your questions."

But can you give us a little more clarity on the away-from-home side and why that may or may not be stronger?"

There's a lot of puts and takes when you think about 2021 guidance versus 2020, which is why we keep going back to 2019 ex divestiture and talking about that as kind of a pretty relevant base year in looking at a 2-year CAGR.
Because when you look at areas like away-from-home, which will recover and on-the-go consumption, which will recover, that's going to offset some deceleration that we're seeing because you're not going to have another surge in March and elevated demands like April and May, right? It's going to remain elevated versus 2019, but not at the same levels as 2021.
Getting back to away-from-home, the reason we think that will recover slightly more slowly for us is because we over-index in travel, leisure, areas like that, which we think will recover more slowly, right? Travel won't come back quite as quickly as perhaps people going to the office and being on the go. So lots of puts and takes in terms of what's going to happen by brand, by category, by geography.
And the biggest COVID impacts that we saw were clearly North America, Europe. Very proud of what the team did in Europe in pivoting away from the Euro soccer championship and towards gaming. We do think that soccer will come -- or we're hopeful that soccer will come back in some ways in 2021.
So there's a lot in the guidance, but what we have really done is [Audio Gap] COVID impact in 2020, as we think about 2021, look at the 2019 base and put together winning plans by category, by geography, by brand that gets us exactly to where we are today when we talk about the 2021 guidance and rolls up into the net sales, operating profit, EPS that we talked about.

Nobody anticipated, obviously, the type of year that cereal would have. Category grew nearly 9%, slowed down a little bit in the second half, but still 5, 6 percentage growth. So we worked very hard all year to keep up with demand and keep our service levels as high as we possibly could. And we ended the year with a flat share performance, slipped a little in the fourth quarter, as you noted.
Almost all of that slippage was due to Frosted Flakes where because of capacity, we had to back away from promotions. You can see that in the syndicated data, down 20% in incremental sales because we couldn't execute against the Mission Tiger program and we wanted to keep our service levels where retailers deserve them to be. So we did give up promotional slots. And nearly all of our share decline in the fourth quarter was due to Frosted Flakes.
Now as we enter 2021, we continue to build against capacity, we continue to make good improvements and we continue to be very optimistic. As we go through the first half of this year, we're going to get better and better in terms of that capacity. And therefore, we'll get better and better in terms of our share performance."

So let me start with the first question on commodities. I think we closed out 2020 with input cost inflation in the mid-single digits, and this was mostly offset by the productivity right all the way through quarter 4.
I think we have seen grain and energy markets rebound sharply in recent months just on near-term supply, demand and other factors. I think from an exchange-traded commodity standpoint, we are well hedged through the first half of 2021 and roughly around the 70% level of hedging coverage for the year.
So I think in terms of total inflation for 2021, we expect that to be higher than what we've experienced in 2020, but still in the mid single digit rates. And I think we'll be looking to offset that with our usual productivity programs with revenue growth management. And overall, as we've guided, we'd expect our gross margin to be up on a 2-year basis. Obviously, in this -- in 2020, our gross margin was up 60 basis points. And on a 2-year basis, we still expect gross margins to be up. And from a '21 standpoint, we'd be aiming for our gross margins to be stable."

The first one just is in relation to the surge in sales that we saw and you helped define that, Amit, in terms of 2020 from COVID. Have you -- I'm looking for like a high level viewpoint here, but like how much of those incremental sales or share you've gained in some categories do you expect to hold on to? So that was my first question.
The second one was related to that. As we look across a number of your categories, there were some areas where you had clear market share gains through the year. But in the fourth -- really through the year, but especially in the fourth quarter, we have seen market share losses, in particular, in the U.S. and I'm looking mostly measured channels here, some market share losses there. So I wanted to just kind of bring that back around to that concept about keeping marketing flat this year in areas where you've had some share pressure, do you need to increase your marketing and perhaps that's part of the plan in 2021?"

And so we finished the year globally with holding or gaining share in over 80% of our category, country combinations where there's measured data. So we feel goo",513,"Yes, Chris. So I'll start. First, as we've said in the past, our goal is to always gain share. And so we finished the year globally with holding or gaining share in over 80% of our category, country combinations where there's measured data. So we feel good about that.
In terms of the U.S., in particular, which you referenced, I did talk about the U.S. RTEC where we held share for the full year, but we lost 50 basis points of share in the fourth quarter, much of that due to capacity limitations that we had, which I already mentioned. And so our plan for 2021, we think in RTEC in ready-to-eat cereal is a winning plan.
But if I look at some of the other categories for the full year and even the fourth quarter, if you look at the U.S. snacks business in crackers, we gained share for the full year and we gained share in the fourth quarter. So we gained 50 basis points of cracker share in the fourth quarter.
In salty, which the category was explosive in the full year, gained about 12.5 points of volume. We were up 11. So based on our size, we were down ever so slightly. But in the fourth quarter, actually, we performed nearly 15% growth against the category of 10%. So we actually even did better in salty, our Pringles business.
If I look at portable wholesome snacks category, obviously, a lot of on-the-go, so a category that was under pressure. For the full year and the fourth quarter, we had tremendous share performances. So we gained 250 basis points of share for the full year, 390 basis points in the fourth quarter. And that was great performance by Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Treats. Nutri-Grain returned to growth in the fourth quarter.
And then if I look at frozen, from the griddle, our Eggo business, obviously, terrific year. Again, some capacity limitations for us, but we gained 150 basis points of share in the fourth quarter, which was better than our -- it was on line with our full year performance.
And then finally, in veg/vegan, which has got a lot of attention because it's an explosive growth category, we were capacity constrained again there because nobody planned for the type of explosive growth. But we were up for the full year 24%, which wasn't enough to gain share. We lost 1 basis point of share. But in the fourth quarter, we did better. We cut that share decline more than in half. We lost 40 basis points, and we're up 20%. So that's a pretty good performance there.
So in the categories where we didn't gain share, we were still growing double digits is another way to look at it. So that's why we like where our brand-building is. We think it's been very, very productive. We measure every ROI by brand, by category. And we think we entered 2021 with a lot of good momentum in our brands, in our categories and a good outlook for share performance in 2021."

Gross profit margins are a little better, but we obviously haven't seen a lot of operating profit margin, which can obviously help your free cash flow grow over time.
So kind of if we step way back, how do you think about getting that free cash flow piece to grow, right? Like the gross margin is good. Reinvestment is good. Doing all the right things, but kind of name of the game is to get more cash in the business. So kind of how do you kind of rightsize that as you think forward a few years? And then I have a quick follow-up."

I'll start, and Amit has got definitely some things to add there. But I'd start by reminding you, obviously, the divestiture, a big divestiture. So when you look back and look at the numbers and say, cash flow or overall, I think you said abs",260,"Yes. Thanks. I'll start, and Amit has got definitely some things to add there. But I'd start by reminding you, obviously, the divestiture, a big divestiture. So when you look back and look at the numbers and say, cash flow or overall, I think you said absolute OP dollars, there's going to be a big difference because of that divestiture.
And if I think about where we finished the year, so organic net sales of plus 6%, right? ForEx neutral adjusted OP of 3.5%, ForEx adjusted EPS of 2.3% and a cash flow of $1.5 billion. That's a terrific year, I think, under any set of circumstances.
And based on the guidance that we gave in 2021, to your question around cash, it's substantially better than the 2019 performance. And remember, there's some outflows of cash that happened whether it be incentives, whether it be other release of accruals that were accrued for in 2020, and the cash will actually outflow in 2021, which is why I think it's again useful to look at a 2-year comparison on everything, including the cash flow performance, which continues to get better. And so as we exit this year, that's why we're very confident that as a company, from a top line through a balanced bottom line delivery standpoint, we are a much stronger company and we come out of this pandemic and we enter 2021 in a much stronger position from a balance sheet perspective and from a top line potential perspective as well.
Amit, do you want to build on that?"

So some of the accruals will be paid out in 2021. But our conversion, even in 2021, we're targeting in the mid-70s to 80% conversion. And then if you adjust for the pension income that runs through our P&L, that's about a 15% adjustment. It gets us to the high 90s.
So I think from an overall standpoint, it's balanced. We -- in 2020, we demonstrated. We delivered balanced delivery. And certainly, the guidance for 2021 calls for that, for another year of that."

And Morningstar Farms finished the year with 25% consumption growth. So hardly a brand that's been disrupted. But clearly, a brand that is doing very, very well despite some of the capacity constraints that I mentioned.
Having said that, we did launch Incogmeato. We're up to about a full point share. When we look at our velocities relative to some of the smaller players, we're exceeding those velocities. When we look at the velocities compared to early Morningstar Farms launches at the same stage, we're ahead of those velocities as well. And as I said, we've got these chicken offerings, including Disney, royalty, chicken offerings that are coming to the 4 right now.
So we feel very good about where the whole Morningstar Farms' performance is. And we continue to innovate around Morningstar Farms, but also Incogmeato. We're bullish about this, and 25% consumption growth is pretty good."

I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. Here at Kellogg, I'm continuously impressed by the way our organization has remained focused and engaged in executing through what are undeniably challenging circumstances, both at work and at home. 
Keeping employees safe remains job #1. And in quarter 1, we continued to execute safety protocols while following the guidance of local health authorities. Supplying the world with food continued to require agility, including temporary labor and incremental capacity. And of course, we continue to actively support our communities. 
After all, the pandemic is not behind us. In fact, in some parts of the world, we are seeing it accelerate, and our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected. 
Turning to Slide #6. Our deploy for balanced growth strategy remains as relevant and effective as ever during this pandemic. Its growth boosters continue to do their job. As much as anything else, this pandemic has prompted a shift in eating occasions. Our focus on occasions continue to be evident in the first quarter in our tailored consumer messaging and an innovation geared towards specific occasions. 
The portfolio that we've shaped toward growth has benefited from balance of convenient meals, snacking that can be done at home, plant-based foods and sustained growth in emerging markets. Our building of world-class brands has been evident in our commitment to continued equity building communication as well as leveraging our data and analytics to devise creative ways to reach new consumers and sustain momentum in the marketplace. 
And our commitment to perfect service, perfect store, tested by the sudden and sharp rise in demand has forced us to get creative around ways to increase throughput, even if it meant temporarily holding back and merchandising activity to ensure inventory and incurring incremental logistics cost to get food to our customers. 
And we continue to grow rapidly in e-commerce, leveraging our enhanced capabilities there. Environmental, social and governance is not a new area of focus for Kellogg. It's been embedded in our history and strategy for a long, long time. Our ESG oriented better days boosters always a key element of our strategy, have become more important to our communities, employees, customers and consumers. 
At CAGNY, a few months ago, we discussed our global better days purpose and strategy and on Slide #7, you can see that we continue to progress in this area, addressing the interconnected issues of health, hunger relief and climate. On nourishing with our foods, we've continued to innovate and renovate our foods, providing choices across wellness and indulgence and during the quarter, our Kashi became the first organic cereal to be authorized for the women, infants and children program in the United States. 
On feeding people in need, we've remained in an elevated level of donations making accelerated progress toward our goal of feeding 375 million families. During the first quarter, Pop-Tarts joined with the United Way to raise money for school vegetable gardens. 
On nurturing our planet, we announced during the first quarter, our commitment to achieve over 50% renewable electricity to address kellogg manufacturing globally by the end of 2022, and we celebrated women farmers as part of International Women's Day. And under living our founders' values, we launched in the first quarter our new equity, diversity and inclusion vision and strategy to all employees in all 4 regions. 
Aligned with those values, we launched a campaign called a Call for Food Justice in Black Communities in partnership with World Food Program U.S.A., tied to some of our biggest brands, including Special K, Morningstar Farms, Kashi and Eggo. 
Our strategy and execution led to another good quarter, as highlighted on Slide #8. At home demand remained elevated, more than offsetting continued softness in away-from-home channels and on the go occasions. Our biggest brands continued to show strong momentum, aided by sustained consumer communication and innovation activity. There why we gained share in most of our key markets and categories around the world. 
We continue to bring on our planned capacity increases, which will continue to relieve supply tightness and enable us to return to normal levels of merchandising activity as we get through the first half of the year. Our emerging markets businesses accelerated their growth, proving their metal in what are challenging conditions. 
From a financial perspective, we continue to seek and deliver balanced financial results. The kind we achieved in 2020, and that's what we did again in the first quarter. Strong net sales growth, even despite lapping last year's pandemic-related surge, and we delivered this organic growth across all 4 regions and all 4 global category groups for a fifth consecutive quarter. 
Positive price mix, reflecting revenue growth management actions made all the more important by the recent rise in input cost inflation. Gross profit margin improved year-on-year despite higher costs and faster growth in our emerging markets, including our distributor business in West Africa. 
Operating profit increased year-on-year despite lapping last year's strong growth ex divestiture, driven by top line momentum and despite a year-on-year increase in brand investment. Cash flow remained strong, and we were able to accelerate share buybacks into the first quarter. 
So a very good start to 2021 with the potential to put us a little ahead of where we thought we'd be through the first half and its extremely difficult comparisons. This enables us to raise the full year guidance we provided for you in February even amidst what is undeniably an uncertain business environment. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail."

Slide #10 offers an at-a-glance summary of our financial results for the first quarter. As you can see, they're quite strong. Particularly when considering the year ago growth they were lapping. Specifically, last ye",1306,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide #10 offers an at-a-glance summary of our financial results for the first quarter. As you can see, they're quite strong. Particularly when considering the year ago growth they were lapping. Specifically, last year's first quarter featured 8% organic growth on net sales and operating profit that grew roughly 8% excluding the impact of the prior year's divestiture. 
So we generated very good growth on growth. Net sales grew on a 1 year and a 2-year basis. In developed markets, it was aided by shipment timing and at home demand remaining elevated, partially offset by continued softness in away-from-home channels. 
In emerging markets, we generated sales performance that was better than expected. Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit grew on a 1 year and a 2-year basis, driven by the net sales growth and expansion in gross profit margin and good discipline on overhead, all of which more than offset a year-on-year increase in brand building. 
Clearly, we are seeing good operating leverage from our strong top line growth. Currency-neutral adjusted basis, earnings per share grew on a 1 year and a 2-year basis despite a higher effective tax rate. And in what is typically our lightest quarter for cash flow, it was stronger than I anticipated for the quarter. 
Of course, it's down from last year's unusually high first quarter cash flow but as you can see, it is ahead of the pre pandemic 2019 level. Let's look at these metrics in a little more detail. Slide #11 breaks quarter 1 net sales growth into its components. Volume declined against last year's math surge, but it was up on a 2-year basis. 
At home demand remained elevated. Emerging markets sustained momentum and we did see favorable timing of shipments in the U.S. as expected. Price/mix was again positive, which is important given the accelerated cost inflation we are seeing. During quarter 1, we saw positive pricing in all 4 regions, reflecting revenue growth management initiatives, and we also saw an overall mix shift back towards snacks. 
Currency translation was a slight positive in the quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we still expect to see a moderating top line. We faced our toughest volume comparison in quarter 2, and we are assuming continued deceleration in at home demand. 
Slide #12 offers some perspective on our profit margins which held up very well in spite of higher costs. Our gross profit margin in quarter 1 improved on a 1 year and a 2-year basis as productivity and price realization were effective at covering accelerated input cost inflation as well as incremental COVID costs against only a partial quarter of those costs in the year-earlier quarter. 
We also more than offset a mix shift towards emerging markets and particularly towards our distributor business in West Africa. The flow-through of this higher gross profit margin led to an increase in operating profit margin as well as decreased overhead balanced out a high single-digit increase in brand building. 
The brand building increase reflects the phasing of our commercial plans relative to last year's modest decrease in quarter 1 at the onset of the pandemic. Even with this year-on-year increase in brand building, we still grew operating profit at a double-digit rate this quarter. As we look to the rest of the year, we obviously faced our toughest gross profit margin comparison in quarter 2 due to last year's outsized operating leverage that produce, by far the highest gross profit margin over the past couple of years, as you can see on the slide. 
In the second half, we are working to hold our margin as close as possible to year ago levels. In spite of our mix shift towards emerging markets and accelerated cost inflation. Further down the P&L, we faced our toughest comparison on brand building in quarter 2 as well. Because last year's quarter 2 was when we delayed significant brand investment to the second half. 
That second half investment helped create the momentum we are seeing today. But we return to more typical levels of brand investment in this year's second half. Turning to the remainder of the income statement and Slide #13, we see that our below the line items were relatively neutral to earnings per share in quarter 1. As expected, interest expense decreased year-on-year on lower debt and this will continue for the remainder of the year, with quarter 4, additionally lapping the nonrecurring $20 million debt redemption expense we recorded last year. 
Other income was lower year-on-year and modestly lower than what should be its quarterly run rate for the rest of the year. Our effective tax rate of 22.7% was higher than last year's relatively low level and should still turn out to be around 22.5% for the full year. Average shares outstanding were flattish year-on-year, with the impact of quarter 1's accelerated buybacks to be more pronounced in the coming quarters, resulting in a full year average shares outstanding that is a little more than 0.5% lower than 2020. 
Turning to our cash flow on Slide #14. We had a strong start to the year and maintained good financial flexibility. As expected, our cash flow in quarter 1 was lower than quarter 1 2020's unusually high level, not because of net earnings or working capital both of which were favorable year-on-year, but because of year-on-year swings in accruals and other balance sheet items as well as lapping last year's delayed capital expenditure. 
However, as you can see on the chart, quarter 1 2021's cash flow was well above that of quarter 1 2019 in what is always our lightest cash flow quarter of the year. Net debt is lower year-on-year, even despite our resumption of share buybacks, and we like the state of our balance sheet. As we look to the rest of the year, cash flow will likely remain below last year's COVID-aided levels. But still well above 2019 levels. 
And between our share buybacks, which we were able to accelerate into the first quarter and an increased dividend, we are meaningfully increasing the cash returned to shareowners. 
I'll conclude with a discussion about full year guidance shown on Slide #15. As Steve mentioned, our strong quarter 1 performance gives us the confidence to raise our guidance this early in the year. Specifically, our guidance for full year organic net sales growth moves up to approximately flat year-on-year from our previous guidance of about negative 1%. This would equate to closer to 3% growth on our 2-year compound annual growth rate, effectively eliminating the noise of lapping last year's COVID-related surge. Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit improves a decline of about 1% to 2% year-on-year versus our previous guidance of minus 2%. 
This equates to closer to 4% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding our divested businesses from the 2019 base. Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis earnings per share increases to growth of about 1% to 2% year-on-year versus our previous guidance of up 1%. 
And this equates to something around 5% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding our thins divested businesses from the 2019 base. And our guidance for cash flow moves up to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion versus our previous guidance of approximately $1.1 billion. 
We think this guidance is prudent, given that it is early in the year and given a business environment that is somewhat uncertain in terms of pandemic impacts and cost inflation. Obviously, we are pleased with our start to the year. We're in strong financial condition. Our brands and regions are performing well. And we are solidly on track for continued balanced financial delivery on a 2-year basis. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses."
283356,704542589,2272584,"Kellogg Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Amit. I'll start with a quick review of the quarter 1 results of each of our regions, and then I'll go a little deeper into some of our key brands and categories. The region's net sales and operating profit growth rates in quarter 1 are shown on S",2780,"Thanks, Amit. I'll start with a quick review of the quarter 1 results of each of our regions, and then I'll go a little deeper into some of our key brands and categories. The region's net sales and operating profit growth rates in quarter 1 are shown on Slide #17. You can see that our growth was broad-based, particularly on the more meaningful 2-year growth rates. 
In North America, our organic net sales grew on top of last year's high-growth with elevated at home consumption and strong momentum in key brands as well as favorable timing of shipments between quarters partially offset by continued softness in away-from-home channels. Operating profit also increased year-on-year despite tough underlying comparisons. 
The 2-year trends only further confirmed that this business got off to a good start to the year. Our business in Europe had another good quarter. Its solid 1 year organic net sales growth was on top of last year's strong growth, and it was led by accelerated growth in Pringles, resulting operating leverage produced strong operating profit growth. In Latin America, our strong organic net sales growth was driven by Pringles and cereal and the result in operating leverage boosted operating profit as well. Macro conditions in this region are challenging. 
So this was a terrific way to start the year. And in EMEA, our strong organic net sales growth was led by Multipro, the distributor portion of our business in West Africa, and across the region by Pringles, cereal and noodles, leading to outstanding growth in operating profit as well. 
Now let's go a little deeper in some of our categories, markets and channels. We'll start with our global category groups, as shown on Slide #18. As you can see from the chart, we grew all 4 category groups on both a 1 year and 2-year basis during quarter 1 despite lapping last year's COVID-related surge and despite continued softness in away-from-home channels. 
Our largest global category snacks, sustained growth in the first quarter on both a 1 year and 2-year basis with growth in all 4 regions, and that's despite the on the go nature of many of its foods and pack formats. This is a testament to the strength of our snacks brands as well as to our ability to adapt messaging and pack formats to current at home occasions. 
In cereal, we also recorded growth on both a 1 year and 2-year basis. We saw notable strength in Europe with share gains led by power brands like Tresor and Crunchy Nut. We posted broad-based growth in Latin America with share gains in key markets led by corn flakes. We also recorded strong growth and share performance in EMEA, where our master brand approach is working well in Asia and innovation activity is contributing across the region. 
As expected, we had a slow start in the U.S. as we limited merchandising activity on supply-constrained brands, but this should improve in the second half as new capacity comes online. Frozen Foods also grew net sales on both a 1 year and 2-year basis. This predominantly North America business sustained momentum in both Eggo and especially Morningstar Farms, and I'll come back to each of them in a moment. 
And our noodles and other business, which is predominantly in Africa, continue to generate rapid growth both on a 1 year and 2-year basis as well, with annual net sales approaching $1 billion, this is going to be a growth contributor for some time. So both on a region basis and a category basis, our reshaped portfolio clearly offers growth and diversification. And within each of these regions and categories are world-class brands that continue to grow. 
Let's take a look at a few of these important brands. We'll start with our largest global brand, Pringles, whose consumption trends for its biggest markets in each of our 4 regions are shown on Slide #19. This is more than a $2 billion global brand that has demonstrated exceptional momentum for some time in all 4 regions. 
During quarter 1, this momentum continued with Pringle sustaining growth on top of very strong year ago growth. This was driven by effective brand building, including the incremental consumer communication we did in late 2020, plus important consumer activations in the first quarter, such as our Super Bowl campaign in the U.S. and our gaming oriented commercial activations in Europe. 
The growth was also augmented by innovation launches including our more intense flavors under the scorching and sublines in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, as well as uniquely local flavors in Asian markets. All of these innovations are off to great starts. 
It's also aided by increased local production in emerging markets, notably in Brazil, where this relatively new local capacity is enabling exceptional growth. Pringles is truly a world-class brand performing extremely well. 
Here's another really incredible brand, Cheez-It, shown on Slide #20. Its U.S. consumption and share growth has been exceptional over the last several years, and it has continued in the first quarter. The base product line continues to perform well, helped by effective advertising and sports-related activations as well as new flavors and a reformulation of the Grubes sub line. Meanwhile, the Snap sub line is providing incremental growth enough that we had to add capacity in 2020 in only its second year since launch. 
And Cheez-It is no longer solely a U.S. brand. We expanded into Canada last year. And during the first quarter, it continued to grow rapidly. And in the first quarter, we brought Cheez-It to Brazil, where it's off to a very good start. This is more than $1 billion-plus retail sales brand that continues to outpace its category in the U.S. and 1 we have begun to expand internationally. 
And before we move on from our snacks discussion, I want to point out 2 other power brands in our Snacks portfolio, shown on Slide #21. The since the outbreak of the pandemic, the portable wholesome snacks category has been declining due to fewer on the go occasions. We've continued to gain share of this category, largely because of 2 brands that have been able to grow their at home consumption. 
Pop-Tarts continued to post growth on a 2-year basis in quarter 1, lapping last year's extremely large growth and sustaining multiyear growth momentum. Rice Krispies Treats consumption and share growth has been impressive over the last several years. And this momentum has continued in quarter 1, aided by the launch of new home style treats, again, big brands, sustaining momentum. 
Let's turn to cereal markets and brands on Slide #22. Behind our 1-year and 2-year growth in global cereal net sales in the first quarter are strong performances by key brands in key markets. The chart shows our largest international markets of each region, with consumption growth on a 2-year basis to avoid distortion from lapping last year's surge in March and share performance on a 1-year basis to show how we're competing. 
In Europe, we've outpaced the category with share gains in key markets like the U.K. which was propelled by power brands like Crunchy Nut and all brand. And in other European markets, we saw particular strength in global brands like Tresor our largest cereal brand in Europe and Extra, a key wellness oriented brand internationally for us. 
In Canada, where the category got more immediate lift than we did in the year ago quarter, we outpaced the category in this year's first quarter on the strength of brands like global brand, all brand and local jewel vector. We recorded strong growth in share performance in EMEA, led by our largest cereal market in that region, Australia. The outperformance was led by global brands like our Australian version of Raisin Bran as well as local jewels like our wellness oriented Just Right. 
We saw broad-based cereal growth in Latin America, where we continued to gain share in key markets like Mexico, Brazil, Puerto Rico and Central America. In Mexico, you can see the strong share performance was driven by big brands like Corn Flakes, and Choco Krispies and across the region, our growth was aided by strong innovation. 
In short, we're seeing the impact of strong brands and strong execution in all of these markets. Let's discuss U.S. cereal for a moment, shown on Slide #23. As expected, we experienced a slow start in this market as we limited merchandising activity on supply-constrained brands. In scanner data, you can see this in our larger than category decline in percent of volumes sold on promotion. 
We will be caught up on supply and capacity around midyear, as we've mentioned previously. But in the first quarter, those supply-constrained brands, Frosted Flakes and Fruit Loops 2 of the stronger brands in the category accounted for all and more of our share decrease in the first quarter. Excluding them, our consumption kept pace with the category. So our underlying business remains in good shape. 
We're very pleased with our innovation, which not only outpaced the category's innovation in the first quarter, but is showing very strong velocities already. This includes additions to the Jumbo Snacks line we successfully launched last year as well as Mini-Wheats Cinema rolled, Little Debbie, Special K blueberries and Keto-friendly Kashi Go offerings. 
So we get back up to adequate supply and capacity and return to a normal commercial calendar particularly in the second half, we expect our U.S. cereal performance to improve and perform like our other big developed markets. Slide #24 calls out another big brand and is sustaining growth on a 2-year basis. 
Eggo's reliable growth in consumption over the past few years accelerated to nearly 17% in 2020, and gaining nearly 2 points of share, but leaving us very tight on capacity. In quarter 1, Eggo sustained strong 2-year growth of plus 5% despite capacity limiting its upside. This is 1 of the brands for which we are freeing up capacity over the course of this year. 
And when you add in Kashi, our overall from the griddle consumption outpaced the category on that 2-year CAGR basis. Eggo is in really good shape with more capacity coming on. With effective advertising and promising innovation on the way, this is a nearly $1 billion retail sales brand with an outlook for sustained growth. 
And even better growth is being generated by our leading plant-based brand, Morningstar Farms, shown on Slide #25. Our overall Morningstar Farms brand franchise is over $400 million in retail sales and is poised to sustain strong growth for years to come. This brand's consumption growth in the first quarter, even on a 1-year basis, added to its multiyear growth trend. 
And with incremental capacity in place, this brand gained share as well. There is no question that consumers are becoming more aware and interested in plant based foods. Morningstar Farms has increased its household penetration in the last year to a level that remains well above any of our competitors. And yet is still only 8%, suggesting significant room to expand. 
Morningstar Farms is also unique in the breadth of its offerings. This is evident in our share gains across a spectrum of segments in quarter 1, ranging from breakfast meats, to breakfast handhelds to sausage to poultry. Our new line is created a whole other occasion for plant based foods. 
And now we are reaching an expanded consumer base. Our recently launched Incogmeato by Morningstar Farm sub-brand is aimed at incremental flexitarian consumers. It continues to expand retail distribution, both in the refrigerated and frozen isles and it continues to add food service customers. 
It's early days, but Incogmeato is great food and is showing a lot of promise. Just this week, the National Restaurant Association awarded 2021 Fabby awards for the year's most delicious, unique and exciting food for restaurant operators and consumers. Among those awarded were 3 Incogmeato products, homestyle chicken tenders, Italian sausage and original broad worst as well as an iconic veg forward offering, Morningstar Farms Chipotle Black Bean Burger. 
Simply put, Morningstar Farms is the largest brand with the highest penetration, the broadest portfolio and the most occasions in this plant-based category. So we are realizing good underlying momentum across our major category groups and led by world Class brands. 
Let's now shift our discussion to geographic markets. Specifically, our emerging markets, highlighted on Slide #26. Emerging markets accounted for more than 20% of our net sales last year, among the highest percentages in our peer group. This is important because these markets represent outstanding long-term growth prospects for packaged food, owing to their population growth, and expanding middle classes. 
In 2020, despite COVID-related shutdowns of retailers in schools, economic disruption from depressed oil prices and even bouts of political and social unrest. Our geographically diverse emerging markets businesses actually accelerated their net sales growth. This is a credit to our product portfolios, our brand strength, our local supply chains and experienced management teams in these markets. 
And in the first quarter of this year, despite lapping an unusually strong year ago quarter, we sustained this momentum, even accelerating again. In Africa, our Multipro distributor business grew more than 20% year-on-year in quarter 1, even as it lapped strong high-teens growth in the year earlier quarter, and we also continue to grow our Kellogg's branded noodles business. 
In Asia, we sustained double-digit growth in Pringles and cereal. In Russia, we recorded double-digit organic growth in cereal and in snacks. And Latin America's strong quarter 1 growth was broad-based and led by cereal in Mexico and Pringles in Brazil. 
And let's finish up with a couple of channels to call out on Slide #27. In the first quarter, we sustained tremendous growth momentum in e-commerce. The investments we had made in this channel, everything from reorganizing around it, bringing in external talent and development capabilities paid off in a big way in 2020 when our e-commerce sales doubled year-on-year. And in the first quarter, our growth was about 75% even as it lapped the year ago quarter's acceleration. 
This is a shopper behavior that is likely to stick. Now roughly 7% of our total company sales, we know that our brands and categories play well in this channel, and we are building this business for the long term. Of course, on the other end of the spectrum, during the pandemic are away-from-home channels, which have declined sharply amidst shutdowns and restrictions. 
The slide shows that our U.S. away-from-home business continued to moderate its declines as measured on an average 2-year basis to better gauge the trend. 
Important to know is that we have not been sitting still waiting for consumer mobility to resume and away-from-home outlets to reopen. We have been actively securing future business, signing up new accounts for brands ranging from Rx to Morningstar Farms and Incogmeato. These actions today will pay off well into the future. 
Let's wrap up with a brief summary on Slide number 29. Quarter 1 2021 was yet another quarter of good performance and investment in the future. We have sustained strong momentum in most of our biggest world class brands, never having let up an innovation or communication with consumers. 
We are unlocking capacity so we can resume full commercial activity in some of the foods and brands that had reached capacity limitations after good growth in recent years and acceleration since the pandemic. 
This added capacity will continue to come on stream during the year, continuing to improve service levels and return to full merchandising activity with our retail partners. Our emerging markets have not only managed through challenging macro environments over the past year, they've actually accelerated their growth. And we continue to build scale in these long-term growth markets. 
We're leveraging capabilities that we've been enhancing over the past few years from data and analytics to e-commerce to innovation. These capabilities have only become even more important since the pandemic. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong, and we have increased cash return to share owners while maintaining financial flexibility. 
Our results for quarter 1 were particularly strong, but more importantly, they reflected high-quality balanced financial delivery. We sustained net sales growth, expanded gross profit margin, remain disciplined on overhead and invested behind our brands and still delivered growth in operating profit and earnings per share, leading to strong cash flow. All of which adds up to an early increase in our full year outlook. 
As always, I want to salute our 31,000 employees whose dedication and creativity have made this performance possible despite the most challenging business conditions. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have."

All of those are at our disposal. 
But at the end of the day, we have to earn that price in the marketplace, through investing in our brands, through innovating through putting the types of performances that we've been able to put against our brands, which puts us in a good position to have the confidence to slightly raise our guidance even despite increased cost pressures that are quite real.

From a hedging perspective, we're about 76% hedged on the exchange-traded commodities. Obviously, there are other cost pressures outside those as well. But I think we've reflected that in our guidance. And you would have seen that in our quarter 1 results, we had strong pricing and mix come through.

It just seems with this degree of outperformance in the first quarter that it would have led to a stronger performance for the year overall, unless there's some other unique factors I'm not just incorporating here."

So if you look at it from a gross margin standpoint, that was the quarter where we saw the operational -- the outsized operational leverage come through. So we're going to lap that in quarter 2. Our quarter 2 was also when we delayed our brand-building into the rest of the year. 
And just if you recall, quarter 2 operating profit last year, in 2020, was up 24%. So I think that'll just give you a sense of the lap ahead of us and just the shape of the year. I think, like I said, from a gross margin standpoint, in the second half, we target to get as close to flat as possible, recognizing that inflation continues to rise and recognizing that we are probably about 76% hedged.

We talk about building world-class brands. And we put some investment surges into our brands unapologetically in the past. And because of those things, before the pandemic, I'd remind you that we exited the year before the pandemic with 2.7% organic sales growth, right? 
And we were getting to balance. And then the surge happened and COVID happened. And here we are, we've had this unbelievable sampling opportunity, this reappraisal opportunity, which we've aimed to make the most of but when you look at the 2-year stacks and you look at our portfolio and you look at our performance, we're delivering top line growth. We're back to growth reliably and for a lot of quarters now. 
And we're delivering balanced growth as well. And it's through the strength of our brands and the strength of the execution of our strategy. So we remain eager to do better.

I'm curious if you can maybe dimensionalize a little bit how much of that capacity, broadly speaking, would be sort of internal versus, let's say, leveraging external third-party sources?

Many times, we look to external capacity when we're starting out. So if you look at like a Cheez-It Snap'd line, we might start with the first-line being external, but I got lots of conviction that second-line was internal. 
And so when we talk about cereal capacity, when we talk about Eggo capacity, we're talking about internal capacity building and expansion. So you can take from that, that there is real conviction. But what I would say is we're not building based on any kind of pandemic that's going to go away. We're building on what we really need, right? 
And so like others, we operate our capacity pretty tightly, right? And historically, when you're in categories that are growing low single digits, you'd expect that, the surge created a whole different set of circumstances but as I said, 2020 is not really going to be our high watermark, right? And so we're going to lap those things in 2021. 
And we're going to need the capacity to do that in things like certain elements of our ready-to-eat cereal in Eggo, in some of our Cheez-It lines, but we're in pretty good shape. And so it's all embedded in our guidance, and we feel like we've got a good plan."

I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. Here at Kellogg, I'm continuously impressed by the way our organization has remained focused and engaged in executing through what are undeniably challenging circumstances, both at work and at home.
Keeping employees safe remains job #1. And in quarter 1, we continued to execute safety protocols while following the guidance of local health authorities. Supplying the world with food continued to require agility, including temporary labor and incremental capacity. And of course, we continue to actively support our communities.
After all, the pandemic is not behind us. In fact, in some parts of the world, we are seeing it accelerate, and our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected.
Turning to Slide #6. Our deploy for balanced growth strategy remains as relevant and effective as ever during this pandemic. Its growth boosters continue to do their job. As much as anything else, this pandemic has prompted a shift in eating occasions. Our focus on occasions continue to be evident in the first quarter in our tailored consumer messaging and an innovation geared towards specific occasions.  
The portfolio that we've shaped toward growth has benefited from balance of convenient meals, snacking that can be done at home, plant-based foods and sustained growth in emerging markets. Our building of world-class brands has been evident in our commitment to continued equity building communication as well as leveraging our data and analytics to devise creative ways to reach new consumers and sustain momentum in the marketplace.
And our commitment to perfect service, perfect store, tested by the sudden and sharp rise in demand has forced us to get creative around ways to increase throughput, even if it meant temporarily holding back and merchandising activity to ensure inventory and incurring incremental logistics cost to get food to our customers. And we continue to grow rapidly in e-commerce, leveraging our enhanced capabilities there.
Environmental, social and governance is not a new area of focus for Kellogg. It's been embedded in our history and strategy for a long, long time. Our ESG oriented Better Days boosters, always a key element of our strategy, have become more important to our communities, employees, customers and consumers.
At CAGNY, a few months ago, we discussed our global Better Days' purpose and strategy and on Slide #7, you can see that we continue to progress in this area, addressing the interconnected issues of health, hunger relief and climate. On nourishing with our foods, we've continued to innovate and renovate our foods, providing choices across wellness and indulgence. And during the quarter, our Kashi became the first organic cereal to be authorized for the women, infants and children program in the United States.
On feeding people in need, we've remained in an elevated level of donations making accelerated progress toward our goal of feeding 375 million families. During the first quarter, Pop-Tarts joined with the United Way to raise money for school vegetable gardens.
On nurturing our planet, we announced during the first quarter, our commitment to achieve over 50% renewable electricity to address Kellogg manufacturing globally by the end of 2022, and we celebrated women farmers as part of International Women's Day. And under living our founders' values, we launched in the first quarter our new equity, diversity and inclusion vision and strategy to all employees in all 4 regions. Aligned with those values, we launched a campaign called A Call for Food Justice in Black Communities in partnership with World Food Program U.S.A., tied to some of our biggest brands, including Special K, Morningstar Farms, Kashi and Eggo.
Our strategy and execution led to another good quarter, as highlighted on Slide #8. At-home demand remained elevated, more than offsetting continued softness in away-from-home channels and on-the-go occasions. Our biggest brands continued to show strong momentum, aided by sustained consumer communication and innovation activity. There why we gained share in most of our key markets and categories around the world.
We continue to bring on our planned capacity increases, which will continue to relieve supply tightness and enable us to return to normal levels of merchandising activity as we get through the first half of the year. Our emerging markets businesses accelerated their growth, proving their metal in what are challenging conditions.
From a financial perspective, we continue to seek and deliver balanced financial results. The kind we achieved in 2020, and that's what we did again in the first quarter. Strong net sales growth, even despite lapping last year's pandemic-related surge, and we delivered this organic growth across all 4 regions and all 4 global category groups for a fifth consecutive quarter.
Positive price/mix, reflecting revenue growth management actions made all the more important by the recent rise in input cost inflation. Gross profit margin improved year-on-year despite higher costs and faster growth in our emerging markets, including our distributor business in West Africa.  
Operating profit increased year-on-year despite lapping last year's strong growth ex divestiture, driven by top line momentum and despite a year-on-year increase in brand investment. Cash flow remained strong, and we were able to accelerate share buybacks into the first quarter.  So a very good start to 2021 with the potential to put us a little ahead of where we thought we'd be through the first half and its extremely difficult comparisons. This enables us to raise the full year guidance we provided for you in February even amidst what is undeniably an uncertain business environment.
So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail."

As you can see, they're quite strong, particularly when considering the year ago growth they were lapping. Specifically, last year's first quarter featured 8% organic growth on net sales and operating profit that grew roughly 8%, excluding the impact of the prior year's divestiture. So we generated very good growth on growth. Net sales grew on a 1-year and a 2-year basis. In developed markets, it was aided by shipment timing and at-home demand remaining elevated, partially offset by continued softness in away-from-home channels.
In emerging markets, we generated sales performance that was better than expected. Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit grew on a 1-year and a 2-year basis, driven by the net sales growth and expansion in gross profit margin and good discipline on overhead, all of which more than offset a year-on-year increase in brand building.  
Clearly, we're seeing good operating leverage from our strong top line growth. Currency-neutral adjusted basis, earnings per share grew on a 1-year and a 2-year basis despite a higher effective tax rate. And in what is typically our lightest quarter for cash flow, it was stronger than I anticipated for the quarter. Of course, it's down from last year's unusually high first quarter cash flow, but as you can see, it is ahead of the pre-pandemic 2019 level.
Let's look at these metrics in a little more detail. Slide #11 breaks quarter 1 net sales growth into its components. Volume declined against last year's marked surge, but it was up on a 2-year basis. At-home demand remained elevated. Emerging markets sustained momentum and we did see favorable timing of shipments in the U.S. as expected. Price/mix was again positive, which is important given the accelerated cost inflation we are seeing. During quarter 1, we saw positive pricing in all 4 regions, reflecting revenue growth management initiatives, and we also saw an overall mix shift back towards snacks.
Currency translation was a slight positive in the quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we still expect to see a moderating top line. We faced our toughest volume comparison in quarter 2, and we are assuming continued deceleration in at-home demand.
Slide #12 offers some perspective on our profit margins, which held up very well in spite of higher costs. Our gross profit margin in quarter 1 improved on a 1-year and a 2-year basis as productivity and price realization were effective at covering accelerated input cost inflation as well as incremental COVID costs against only a partial quarter of those costs in the year-earlier quarter.
We also more than offset a mix shift towards emerging markets and particularly towards our distributor business in West Africa. The flow-through of this higher gross profit margin led to an increase in operating profit margin as well as decreased overhead balanced out a high single-digit increase in brand building.
The brand building increase reflects the phasing of our commercial plans relative to last year's modest decrease in quarter 1 at the onset of the pandemic. Even with this year-on-year increase in brand building, we still grew operating profit at a double-digit rate this quarter. As we look to the rest of the year, we obviously faced our toughest gross profit margin comparison in quarter 2 due to last year's outsized operating leverage that produced by far the highest gross profit margin over the past couple of years, as you can see on the slide. In the second half, we are working to hold our margin as close as possible to year ago levels, in spite of our mix shift towards emerging markets and accelerated cost inflation.
Further down the P&L, we faced our toughest comparison on brand building in quarter 2 as well. Because last year's quarter 2 was when we delayed significant brand investment to the second half. That second half investment helped create the momentum we are seeing today. But we'll return to more typical levels of brand investment in this year's second half.
Turning to the remainder of the income statement and Slide #13, we see that our below the line items were relatively neutral to earnings per share in quarter 1. As expected, interest expense decreased year-on-year on lower debt and this will continue for the remainder of the year, with quarter 4 additionally lapping the nonrecurring $20 million debt redemption expense we recorded last year.
Other income was lower year-on-year and modestly lower than what should be its quarterly run rate for the rest of the year. Our effective tax rate of 22.7% was higher than last year's relatively low level and should still turn out to be around 22.5% for the full year. Average shares outstanding were flattish year-on-year, with the impact of quarter 1's accelerated buybacks to be more pronounced in the coming quarters, resulting in a full year average shares outstanding that is a little more than 0.5% lower than 2020.
Turning to our cash flow on Slide #14. We had a strong start to the year and maintained good financial flexibility. As expected, our cash flow in quarter 1 was lower than quarter 1 2020's unusually high level, not because of net earnings or working capital both of which were favorable year-on-year, but because of year-on-year swings in accruals and other balance sheet items as well as lapping last year's delayed capital expenditure.
However, as you can see on the chart, quarter 1 2021's cash flow was well above that of quarter 1 2019 in what is always our lightest cash flow quarter of the year. Net debt is lower year-on-year, even despite our resumption of share buybacks, and we like the state of our balance sheet. As we look to the rest of the year, cash flow will likely remain below last year's COVID-aided levels, but still well above 2019 levels. And between our share buybacks, which we were able to accelerate into the first quarter and an increased dividend, we are meaningfully increasing the cash returned to share owners.
I'll conclude with a discussion about full year guidance shown on Slide #15. As Steve mentioned, our strong quarter 1 performance gives us the confidence to raise our guidance this early in the year. Specifically, our guidance for full year organic net sales growth moves up to approximately flat year-on-year from our previous guidance of about negative 1%. This would equate to closer to 3% growth on our 2-year compound annual growth rate, effectively eliminating the noise of lapping last year's COVID-related surge. Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit improves to a decline of about 1% to 2% year-on-year versus our previous guidance of minus 2%. This equates to closer to 4% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding our since-divested businesses from the 2019 base.
Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis earnings per share increases to growth of about 1% to 2% year-on-year versus our previous guidance of up 1%. And this equates to something around 5% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding our since-divested businesses from the 2019 base. And our guidance for cash flow moves up to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion versus our previous guidance of approximately $1.1 billion.
We think this guidance is prudent, given that it is early in the year and given a business environment that is somewhat uncertain in terms of pandemic impacts and cost inflation. Obviously, we are pleased with our start to the year. We're in strong financial condition. Our brands and regions are performing well. And we are solidly on track for continued balanced financial delivery on a 2-year basis.
And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses."
283356,704542589,2272813,"Kellogg Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Amit. I'll start with a quick review of the quarter 1 results of each of our regions, and then I'll go a little deeper into some of our key brands and categories. The region's net sales and operating profit growth rates in quarter 1 are shown on S",2759,"Thanks, Amit. I'll start with a quick review of the quarter 1 results of each of our regions, and then I'll go a little deeper into some of our key brands and categories. The region's net sales and operating profit growth rates in quarter 1 are shown on Slide #17. You can see that our growth was broad-based, particularly on the more meaningful 2-year growth rates. 
In North America, our organic net sales grew on top of last year's high-growth with elevated at-home consumption and strong momentum in key brands as well as favorable timing of shipments between quarters partially offset by continued softness in away-from-home channels. Operating profit also increased year-on-year despite tough underlying comparisons.
The 2-year trends only further confirmed that this business got off to a good start to the year. Our business in Europe had another good quarter. Its solid 1 year organic net sales growth was on top of last year's strong growth, and it was led by accelerated growth in Pringles, resulting operating leverage produced strong operating profit growth.
In Latin America, our strong organic net sales growth was driven by Pringles and cereal and the resulting operating leverage boosted operating profit as well. Macro conditions in this region are challenging. So this was a terrific way to start the year. And in EMEA, our strong organic net sales growth was led by Multipro, the distributor portion of our business in West Africa, and across the region by Pringles, cereal and noodles, leading to outstanding growth in operating profit as well.
Now let's go a little deeper in some of our categories, markets and channels. We'll start with our global category groups, as shown on Slide #18. As you can see from the chart, we grew all 4 category groups on both a 1-year and 2-year basis during quarter 1 despite lapping last year's COVID-related surge and despite continued softness in away-from-home channels.
Our largest global category snacks, sustained growth in the first quarter on both a 1-year and 2-year basis with growth in all 4 regions, and that's despite the on-the-go nature of many of its foods and pack formats. This is a testament to the strength of our snacks brands as well as to our ability to adapt messaging and pack formats to current at-home occasions.
In cereal, we also recorded growth on both a 1-year and 2-year basis. We saw notable strength in Europe with share gains led by power brands like Tresor and Crunchy Nut. We posted broad-based growth in Latin America with share gains in key markets led by Corn Flakes. We also recorded strong growth and share performance in EMEA, where our master brand approach is working well in Asia and innovation activity is contributing across the region.
As expected, we had a slow start in the U.S. as we limited merchandising activity on supply-constrained brands, but this should improve in the second half as new capacity comes online. Frozen Foods also grew net sales on both a 1-year and 2-year basis. This predominantly North America business sustained momentum in both Eggo and especially Morningstar Farms, and I'll come back to each of them in a moment.
And our noodles and other business, which is predominantly in Africa, continue to generate rapid growth both on a 1-year and 2-year basis as well, with annual net sales approaching $1 billion. This is going to be a growth contributor for some time. So both on a region basis and a category basis, our reshaped portfolio clearly offers growth and diversification. And within each of these regions and categories are world-class brands that continue to grow.
Let's take a look at a few of these important brands. We'll start with our largest global brand, Pringles, whose consumption trends for its biggest markets in each of our 4 regions are shown on Slide #19. This is more than a $2 billion global brand that has demonstrated exceptional momentum for some time in all 4 regions. During quarter 1, this momentum continued with Pringles sustaining growth on top of very strong year ago growth. This was driven by effective brand building, including the incremental consumer communication we did in late 2020, plus important consumer activations in the first quarter, such as our Super Bowl campaign in the U.S. and are gaining oriented commercial activations in Europe.
The growth was also augmented by innovation launches, including our more intense flavors under the Scorchin and Sizzl'n sublines in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, as well as uniquely local flavors in Asian markets. All of these innovations are off to great starts. It's also aided by increased local production in emerging markets, notably in Brazil, where this relatively new local capacity is enabling exceptional growth. Pringles is truly a world-class brand performing extremely well.
Here's another really incredible brand, Cheez-It, shown on Slide #20. Its U.S. consumption and share growth has been exceptional over the last several years, and it has continued in the first quarter. The base product line continues to perform well, helped by effective advertising and sports-related activations as well as new flavors and a reformulation of the grooves subline. Meanwhile, the Snap'd subline is providing incremental growth enough that we had to add capacity in 2020 in only its second year since launch.
And Cheez-It is no longer solely a U.S. brand. We expanded into Canada last year. And during the first quarter, it continued to grow rapidly. And in the first quarter, we brought Cheez-It to Brazil, where it's off to a very good start. This is more than $1 billion-plus retail sales brand that continues to outpace its category in the U.S. and one we have begun to expand internationally.
And before we move on from our snacks discussion, I want to point out 2 other power brands in our snacks portfolio, shown on Slide #21. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the portable wholesome snacks category has been declining due to fewer on-the-go occasions. We've continued to gain share of this category, largely because of 2 brands that have been able to grow their at-home consumption.
Pop-Tarts continued to post growth on a 2-year basis in quarter 1, lapping last year's extremely large growth and sustaining multiyear growth momentum. Rice Krispies Treats consumption and share growth has been impressive over the last several years. And this momentum has continued in quarter 1, aided by the launch of new homestyle treats, again, big brands, sustaining momentum.
Let's turn to cereal markets and brands on Slide #22. Behind our 1-year and 2-year growth in global cereal net sales in the first quarter are strong performances by key brands in key markets. The chart shows our largest international markets of each region, with consumption growth on a 2-year basis to avoid distortion from lapping last year's surge in March and share performance on a 1-year basis to show how we're competing.
In Europe, we've outpaced the category with share gains in key markets like the U.K., which was propelled by power brands like Crunchy Nut and All-Bran. And in other European markets, we saw particular strength in global brands like Tresor, our largest cereal brand in Europe and Extra, a key wellness oriented brand internationally for us.
In Canada, where the category got more immediate lift than we did in the year ago quarter, we outpaced the category in this year's first quarter on the strength of brands like global brand, All-Bran and local jewel vector. We recorded strong growth in share performance in EMEA, led by our largest cereal market in that region, Australia. The outperformance was led by global brands like our Australian version of Raisin Bran as well as local jewels like our wellness oriented Just Right.
We saw broad-based cereal growth in Latin America, where we continued to gain share in key markets like Mexico, Brazil, Puerto Rico and Central America. In Mexico, you can see the strong share performance was driven by big brands like Corn Flakes, and Choco Krispies and across the region, our growth was aided by strong innovation. In short, we're seeing the impact of strong brands and strong execution in all of these markets.
Let's discuss U.S. cereal for a moment, shown on Slide #23. As expected, we experienced a slow start in this market as we limited merchandising activity on supply-constrained brands. In scanner data, you can see this in our larger than category decline in percent of volumes sold on promotion. We will be caught up on supply and capacity around midyear, as we've mentioned previously. But in the first quarter, those supply-constrained brands, Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops, 2 of the stronger brands in the category, accounted for all and more of our share decrease in the first quarter. Excluding them, our consumption kept pace with the category. So our underlying business remains in good shape.  
We're very pleased with our innovation, which not only outpaced the category's innovation in the first quarter, but is showing very strong velocities already. This includes additions to the Jumbo Snax line we successfully launched last year as well as Mini-Wheats, Cinnamon Roll, Little Debbie, Special K blueberries and Keto-friendly Kashi Go offerings. So we get back up to adequate supply and capacity and return to a normal commercial calendar. Particularly in the second half, we expect our U.S. cereal performance to improve and perform like our other big developed markets.
Slide #24 calls out another big brand and is sustaining growth on a 2-year basis. Eggo's reliable growth in consumption over the past few years accelerated to nearly 17% in 2020, gaining nearly 2 points of share, but leaving us very tight on capacity. In quarter 1, Eggo sustained strong 2-year growth of plus 5% despite capacity limiting its upside. This is one of the brands for which we are freeing up capacity over the course of this year. And when you add in Kashi, our overall from the griddle consumption outpaced the category on that 2-year CAGR basis. Eggo is in really good shape with more capacity coming on. With effective advertising and promising innovation on the way, this is a nearly $1 billion retail sales brand with an outlook for sustained growth.
And even better growth is being generated by our leading plant-based brand, Morningstar Farms, shown on Slide #25. Our overall Morningstar Farms brand franchise is over $400 million in retail sales and is poised to sustain strong growth for years to come. This brand's consumption growth in the first quarter, even on a 1-year basis, added to its multiyear growth trend. And with incremental capacity in place, this brand gained share as well. There is no question that consumers are becoming more aware and interested in plant-based foods. Morningstar Farms has increased its household penetration in the last year to a level that remains well above any of our competitors and yet it's still only 8%, suggesting significant room to expand.
Morningstar Farms is also unique in the breadth of its offerings. This is evident in our share gains across a spectrum of segments in quarter 1, ranging from breakfast meats, to breakfast handhelds, to sausage, to poultry. Our new veggetizers line has created a whole other occasion for plant-based foods.
And now we are reaching an expanded consumer base. Our recently launched Incogmeato by Morningstar Farms' sub-brand is aimed at incremental flexitarian consumers. It continues to expand retail distribution, both in the refrigerated and frozen isles and it continues to add food service customers. It's early days, but Incogmeato is great food and is showing a lot of promise.
Just this week, the National Restaurant Association awarded 2021 FABI Awards for the year's most delicious, unique and exciting food for restaurant operators and consumers. Among those awarded were 3 Incogmeato products, Homestyle Chicken Tenders, Italian sausage and original broad worst as well as an iconic veg forward offering, Morningstar Farms Chipotle Black Bean Burger.
Simply put, Morningstar Farms is the largest brand with the highest penetration, with the broadest portfolio and the most occasions in this plant-based category. So we are realizing good underlying momentum across our major category groups and led by world-class brands.
Let's now shift our discussion to geographic markets, specifically our emerging markets, highlighted on Slide #26. Emerging markets accounted for more than 20% of our net sales last year, among the highest percentages in our peer group. This is important because these markets represent outstanding long-term growth prospects for packaged food, owing to their population growth and expanding middle classes.
In 2020, despite COVID-related shutdowns of retailers and schools, economic disruption from depressed oil prices and even bouts of political and social unrest, our geographically diverse emerging markets businesses actually accelerated their net sales growth. This is a credit to our product portfolios, our brand strength, our local supply chains and experienced management teams in these markets.
And in the first quarter of this year, despite lapping an unusually strong year ago quarter, we sustained this momentum, even accelerating again. In Africa, our Multipro distributor business grew more than 20% year-on-year in quarter 1, even as it lapped strong high-teens growth in the year earlier quarter, and we also continue to grow our Kellogg's branded noodles business.
In Asia, we sustained double-digit growth in Pringles and cereal. In Russia, we recorded double-digit organic growth in cereal and in snacks. And Latin America's strong quarter 1 growth was broad-based and led by cereal in Mexico and Pringles in Brazil.
And let's finish up with a couple of channels to call out on Slide #27. In the first quarter, we sustained tremendous growth momentum in e-commerce. The investments we had made in this channel, everything from reorganizing around it, bringing in external talent and developing capabilities paid off in a big way in 2020 when our e-commerce sales doubled year-on-year. And in the first quarter, our growth was about 75% even as it lapped the year ago quarter's acceleration.
This is a shopper behavior that is likely to stick. Now roughly 7% of our total company sales, we know that our brands and categories play well in this channel, and we are building this business for the long term. Of course, on the other end of the spectrum, during the pandemic are away-from-home channels, which have declined sharply amidst shutdowns and restrictions. The slide shows that our U.S. away-from-home business continued to moderate its declines as measured on an average 2-year basis to better gauge the trend.
Important to know is that we have not been sitting still waiting for consumer mobility to resume and away-from-home outlets to reopen. We have been actively securing future business, signing up new accounts for brands ranging from RX to Morningstar Farms and Incogmeato. These actions today will pay off well into the future.
Let's wrap up with a brief summary on Slide #29. Quarter 1 2021 was yet another quarter of good performance and investment in the future. We have sustained strong momentum in most of our biggest world class brands, never having let up an innovation or communication with consumers. We are unlocking capacity so we can resume full commercial activity in some of the foods and brands that had reached capacity limitations after good growth in recent years and acceleration since the pandemic.
This added capacity will continue to come on stream during the year, continuing to improve service levels and return to full merchandising activity with our retail partners. Our emerging markets have not only managed through challenging macro environments over the past year, they've actually accelerated their growth. And we continue to build scale in these long-term growth markets.
We're leveraging capabilities that we've been enhancing over the past few years from data and analytics, to e-commerce, to innovation. These capabilities have only become even more important since the pandemic. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong, and we have increased cash return to share owners while maintaining financial flexibility.
Our results for quarter 1 were particularly strong, but more importantly, they reflected high-quality balanced financial delivery. We sustained net sales growth, expanded gross profit margin, remained disciplined on overhead and invested behind our brands and still delivered growth in operating profit and earnings per share, leading to strong cash flow. All of which adds up to an early increase in our full year outlook. As always, I want to salute our 31,000 employees whose dedication and creativity have made this performance possible despite the most challenging business conditions.
And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have."

When the -- I think you'd said on the last quarter that you were targeting '21 gross margins ahead of '19 levels. Is that, I guess, first off, is that still realistic? Or has that been ratcheted down a bit you're thinking?
And then given that relatively extensive coverage from a hedge position, it would appear, just given the cost curves that we're seeing in the spot market, it implies some residual inflation carrying over into 2022. I don't know if there's a way you can kind of frame the extent of that carryover to '22. But I'm really curious about, given that, if I'm right about that outlook, does that impact your plans around the timing of pricing or other discretionary spending at all as '21 progresses?"

And so like others, we operate our capacity pretty tightly, right?

But as I said, 2020 is not really going to be our high watermark, right? And so we're going to lap those things in 2021.

In this environment, keeping employees safe remains job number one. And aiding our communities is more important than ever. We also continue to supply the world with food, though, this remains challenging as the pandemic persists. A reacceleration of COVID cases has brought on new restrictions, causing temporary shutdowns of production in some countries. Meantime, we and the vendors that supply us are having to manage through bottlenecks and shortages of materials, labor and freight, all created by demand supply and balances that are also pushing up costs.
So 2021 is shaping up to be anything but business as usual, and I'm extremely proud of how our organization continues to persevere and succeed in such challenging conditions. I'm also pleased with how well we continue to execute against our strategy, deployed for balanced growth, which is depicted on Slide #6. From a business perspective, demand and eating occasions at home remained elevated in quarter 2, but they are gradually shifting as consumer mobility returns. In the second quarter, this was reflected in an ads forecast continuation of decelerating at home demand growth, as measured by 2-year compound annual growth rates in our cereal and frozen categories around the world.
We also saw signs of gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in an on-the-go snacks and pack formats. These channels grew year-on-year and better than forecast, even if they remain below 2019 levels. Our deploy for Growth Boosters are working effectively from focusing on ever-evolving occasions to leveraging our reshaped portfolio to driving momentum in our world-class brands and to investing in our supply chain to better serve our customers. Our Better Days boosters, which further our ESG efforts continue to work effectively as well.
A few Better Days highlights are shared on Slide #7. During the second quarter, we continued to progress toward our ongoing Better Days commitments. This slide calls out a few of our actions and achievements of the quarter. The key message is that this remains a critical element of our strategy, a clear focus of management and a part of the DNA of Kellogg Company.
And we turned in another quarter of strong business performance in the second quarter, as discussed on Slide #8. Overall, at-home demand remained elevated, and we saw continued recovery in our away-from-home channels. Most encouraging has been the momentum demonstrated by key long-term growth engines for us. Our world-class snacks brands sustain their momentum with many continuing to outpace their respective categories. Our plant-based protein business is continuing to show strong growth. Our emerging markets businesses sustained their rapid growth and continue to excel even amidst challenging business conditions.
Meanwhile, we continue to manage through the global supply challenges, I referred to earlier even as we continue to bring on our planned capacity increases. From a financial standpoint, our second quarter continued the balanced delivery that we returned to in 2020. Specifically, comparing to pre-COVID 2019, we realized another quarter of strong organic top line growth and operating profit growth as well as improved cash flow generation. We are affirming our full year guidance today. Like so many others, we are currently facing increased cost inflation and supply hurdles, and that is factored into our second half assumptions. Nonetheless, the business is showing good momentum. And just as we work through these challenges in the second quarter, we're confident we can work through them in the second half as well.
Let me now turn it over to Amit, so he can take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail."
283356,704542714,2364575,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results for the second quarter are summarized on Slide #10. It was another strong quarter that's viewed on a 2-year basis, because of the unusual period we were lapping from last year. On an organ",1387,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results for the second quarter are summarized on Slide #10. It was another strong quarter that's viewed on a 2-year basis, because of the unusual period we were lapping from last year. 
On an organic basis, we nearly matched last year's unusually high net sales, generating 4.5% growth on a 2-year compound annual growth rate or CAGR basis. This came in better than expected, thanks to an impressive momentum in emerging markets and faster improvement than expected in our away-from-home channels. Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit declined against last year's exceptional quarter when it grew 27% despite losing about 8 points to divestiture impact. Excluding those divested businesses from the 2019 base, our operating profit in quarter 2 this year grew at a 2-year CAGR of about 8%. This is strong growth that indicates underlying margin expansion.
Currency-neutral adjusted basis, earnings per share declined as it lapped last year's outsized growth, but it grew about 9% on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding the divestiture impact on operating profit. And cash flow was again stronger than anticipated for the quarter. And while it lapped last year's unusually high level, this cash flow was again higher than that of quarter 2 of 2019.
So on a 2-year basis, we saw another quarter of good top line growth, margin expansion and conversion of profit into cash flow. That's the kind of balance we strive for.
Let's examine these results in a little more detail. We'll start with net sales on Slide #11. Net sales remained strong despite tough comparisons. Volume declined against last year's double-digit surge, but remained up on a 2-year basis, even despite an as-expected reversal of shipment timings from quarter 1 in North America. price/mix was again an important driver. Once again, most of this price/mix growth came from revenue growth management initiatives implemented in all 4 regions. Mix was only slightly positive as a mix shift towards Snacks was partially offset by resumed mix shift towards MultiPro, our West African distributor business. 
Our 2-year organic net sales CAGR was 4.5% in quarter 2, a very strong performance. Rounding out net sales, foreign currency translation was again positive in quarter 2. As we look to the rest of the year, we assume continued deceleration in at-home demand with moderation in away-from-home declines being more modest due to the mix of our channels. We've seen this reflected in our 2-year CAGRs from quarter 1 to quarter 2, and we expect this deceleration to continue into quarter 3 and quarter 4. And based on where ForEx rates are right now, we would expect to see a less positive impact on net sales in the second half.
Moving down the income statement. Slide #12 shows 2 important drivers of our profit margin performance. As you know, our gross profit margin in quarter 2 was lapping outsized operating leverage in quarter 2, 2020, when our plants ran flat out, producing only a limited lineup of SKUs. But importantly, our gross margin in quarter 2, as in quarter 1, increased from 2019 levels. Productivity and price realization drove this 2-year improvement, more than overcoming high cost inflation, labor and freight disruptions, COVID-related costs and a mix shift towards emerging markets. So this 2-year improvement is very encouraging.
As we'll talk about in a moment, we expect to see more pressure on gross margin in the second half than we did in the first half, reflecting the current operating and cost environment. Operating profit margin remained higher than quarter 2, 2019 as well. This reflects the gross margin performance and good discipline on our. Brand building investment, while up double digits against last year's delays, was up more modestly versus 2 years ago.
As we look to the second half, our SG&A expense may provide some offset to the gross margin pressure. SG&A expense in the second half should moderate year-on-year. Not only because of last year's back-weighted brand building, particularly in quarter 4, but also because of lapping last year's incentive compensation. This could be partially offset by a gradual resumption of travel and related activities as economies reopen.
Moving down the P&L. Let's turn to Slide #13. During quarter 2, interest expense decreased year-on-year on lower debt, and this decrease will continue for the remainder of the year, with quarter 4 additionally lapping the $20 million debt redemption cost we recorded last year. Of note, during the quarter, we issued our first ever sustainability bond, which was very well received. Other income increased modestly year-on-year, to a level that is a little higher than we would expect for the remaining quarters, owing to favorability in various non-pension items. Our effective tax rate of 22.6% was essentially in line with our full year forecast rate.
JV earnings and minority interest together were roughly in line with last year. And average shares outstanding decreased year-on-year, reflecting the impact of quarter 1's buybacks. We still expect full year average shares outstanding to be around 0.5% lower than 2020.
Let's now discuss our cash flow and balance sheet shown on Slide #14. Year-to-date, our cash flow remains below last year's unusually high level as expected, but well above that of the first half of 2019. This 2-year increase is driven by our improved operating profit and improved cash flow conversion. We finished the first half ahead of our expectations for cash flow. And as we look to the rest of the year, cash flow should remain below last year's COVID-related levels, but still well above 2019. 
Meanwhile, our balance sheet remains solid. Net debt remains roughly even with last year and lower than each of the prior 2 years, even despite our increase in cash return to shareowners in form of resumed share buybacks and increased dividend. So our financial condition is quite strong.
Slide #15 shows where our results stand after the first 6 months of 2021. Obviously, we've had a good year so far, producing strong and balanced financial results on a 2-year basis and staying modestly ahead of our own internal forecast. This strong start is all the more important when you consider just how much more challenging the business environment has gotten lately.
Now let's discuss our full year guidance shown on Slide #16. As Steve mentioned, we are affirming our overall guidance. Within that guidance, we are raising our net sales guidance. We are now calling for organic growth of flat to up to 1%, which is a bit higher than our previous guidance for flat, reflecting our business momentum, particularly in emerging markets. This equates to almost 3% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. Volume will continue to lap last year's large gains but price/mix will remain positive as we execute revenue growth management actions to cover higher input costs.
Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted operating profit is unchanged, still calling for a year-on-year decrease of about 1% to 2%, equating to almost 4% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding the divestiture impact. This reflects our stronger-than-expected quarter 2 profit and raised full year net sales outlook, balanced by increased cost pressures and operating challenges that make us a bit more cautious about the second half.
Specifically, we have the productivity and revenue growth management actions in place to continue to cover high market-driven cost for commodities and freight. However, the economy-wide supply chain challenges, that Steve mentioned, are impeding production and shipping and creating incremental operating costs as well, particularly in quarter 3. Because of this, we now expect gross profit margin to finish 2021, slightly below 2019 levels, but well above 2019 in gross profit dollars.
We are also affirming our guidance for 1% to 2% growth in currency-neutral adjusted earnings per share, which equates to almost 5% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. And we continue to look for cash flow to finish the year in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This outlook balances the momentum in our business with the challenging operating environment and balances our margin protection actions against heightened cost pressures.
To summarize, we remain in strong financial condition, and we remain solidly on track for continued balanced financial delivery on a 2-year basis.
And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses."
283356,704542714,2364575,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Amit.

This $2 billion global retail sales brand continues to perform w",2382,"Thanks, Amit. Before we get into each of the 4 regions, let me start off by highlighting the strength of some of our most important growth drivers. The first is Pringles, shown on Slide #18. This $2 billion global retail sales brand continues to perform well around the world. Here in the United States, it continued to outpace the category on consumption growth using a 2-year CAGR to eliminate uneven comparisons. It's also outperforming the category on household penetration gains since the pandemic. And around the world, we are seeing similar momentum. We're seeing growth in original and core flavors. We're seeing incremental growth from innovations like Scorchin and Sizzl'n. 
Equally impressive has been Cheez-It, another world-class brand, shown on Slide #19. This $1 billion retail sales brand continues to perform well in the U.S. its 2-year CAGRs remain well ahead of the category's growth and its household penetration has grown in contrast to the rest of the category. Meanwhile, our launches of this power brand into Canada and Brazil are off to strong starts.
Let's not overlook 2 other world-class snack Brands. On Slide #20, we can see the continued strength of Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats. Together, these 2 power brands represent $1 billion in measured channel retail sales in the U.S. alone. You can see from the slide that they are in terrific shape as well. Their consumption has continued to outpace the portable wholesome snacks category on a 2-year CAGR basis, and these brands have added households since the pandemic, whereas the overall category has not.
Plant-based protein and our leading MorningStar Farms brand is another growth driver that is performing very well. As shown on Slide #21, this $400 million retail sales brand continues to show strong consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis and has continued to add to its household penetration. A key advantage of MorningStar Farms is the breadth of its offerings across product types. And in Q2, we continued to see double-digit 2-year CAGRs across segments like chicken, appetizers, breakfast meat and sausages.  We continue to innovate against this brand, including its sub-brand Incogmeato, which continues to add distribution and share and is proving to be incremental to the MorningStar Farms franchise. 
MorningStar Farms growth has bumped up against our capacity at various times in the past year, even as it has faced numerous new entrants into the category. This is creating a lot of excitement in the category, and we are pleased with our momentum and prospects.
And of course, there's Eggo, shown on Slide #22. This $900 million retail sales brand continues to perform well in the U.S. as indicated by its strong 2-year compound annual growth in consumption and by its better-than-category performance on household penetration. Meantime, the brand continues to grow on a 2-year basis in Canada and Mexico as well. 
Our emerging markets are another key growth driver for us. And as you can see on Slide #23, they have actually accelerated their growth over the past couple of years. As we've discussed many times, this is a testament to our geographic footprint, our portfolio of foods and brands, our local supply chains, our go-to-market and our experienced management teams. As you can see from the chart, we continue to record impressive growth in these markets in Q2, even in spite of challenges related to COVID.
We grew strongly in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Russia, and we continue to grow in cereal, snacks and noodles. Emerging markets represent more than 20% of our net sales and are expected to remain an important growth driver for a long time to come. 
So some of our portfolio's most important growth drivers are very clearly showing good momentum and have only strengthened over the past year. And these aren't small businesses. Even just the ones I discussed here, collectively represent more than half of our company's net sales.
Let's now discuss each of our regions. We'll start with North America and Slide #24. We sustained net sales growth on a 2-year basis in North America, even if that growth rate was held back by the pandemic's negative impact on away-from-home channels and on-the-go pack formats. Moreover, versus last year, our volume in Q2 was not only lapping last year's double-digit surge, but also felt the impact of our previously discussed shift of shipments into Q1 and resultant trade inventory coming out as expected during Q2. Importantly, though, we realized good price/mix growth driven by revenue growth management actions. And our overall sales growth was supported by good underlying consumption trends.
We outpaced 4 of our 6 primary categories on a 2-year compound annual growth basis with our 2-year consumption growth accelerating sequentially from Q1 in 5 of our 6 categories. And as we discussed on the past few slides, this strong performance is being driven by many of our biggest brands. So the underlying fundamentals look good.
On operating profit, remember that we were lapping a year ago quarter in which operating profit grew 36%, excluding divestiture impact, an unusually strong quarter elevated by at-home demand, outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment during the height of the pandemic. On a 2-year CAGR basis, though, you can see we continued to generate good operating profit growth driven by top line growth, productivity and price/mix. These have been able to offset the impacts of extremely high cost inflation this year as well as the frequent shortages of materials, freight and labor, which are most pronounced in North America.
Let's take a closer look at our category groups in North America. Slide #25 shows that our net sales for Snacks in North America continued to grow both on a 1 year and a 2-year CAGR basis, despite declines in away-from-home channels and many on-the-go Foods and pack formats. U.S. consumption remains solid on a 2-year CAGR basis outpacing all 3 of our snacks categories and led by power brands. In Crackers, we outpaced the category on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis, led by continued strength in Cheez-IT and Club. In Salty Snacks, we outpaced the category on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis as well due to continued strength in Pringles, particularly its core 4 flavors, its new Scorchin innovation and multi packs.
And in portable wholesome snacks, we are seeing brands like Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats hold up very well on a 2-year CAGR basis, while also starting to see signs of recovery in our more on-the-go oriented brands like Special K, Nutri Grain and RX Bars. 
In North America cereal, shown on Slide #26, organic net sales were off slightly on a 2-year CAGR basis due to declines in away-from-home channels. We also saw the impact of being capacity constrained on certain brands. In the U.S., the category's consumption was flat on a 2-year CAGR basis in Q2 and after being down about 1% in Q1, we improved to flat in Q2, keeping up with the category on that basis. Frosted Flakes accounted for most of the share decline related to pulling back on brand building and merchandising since Q4 last year, as we worked to maintain service levels and add capacity planned prior to the pandemic.
Unfortunately, our capacity expansion has been slowed by current supply shortages and by our recent fire in 1 of our facilities. This will delay our return to normal commercial activity on affected brands. In the meantime, our business continues to progress well. We continue to lead the category and share of innovation, and we are seeing better performance in wellness oriented brands like Raisin Bran, Special K, Kashi and Bear Naked. 
And on Slide #27, we can see that our 2 frozen businesses, plant-based foods and frozen breakfast, also continue to grow on a 2-year CAGR basis, even despite capacity limitations and declines in away-from-home channels. We've already discussed both of our key brands in frozen, MorningStar Farms plant-based Foods and Eggo from the Griddle Foods. Both continue to generate strong consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, and both are poised to sustain growth.
And before we move on from our discussion of North America, we should touch on our U.S. Away-from-home business in Slide number 28. The slide shows rolling 2-year average growth rates in our net sales over the past few quarters in these channels. As restrictions eased and consumer mobility increased, we saw a gradual recovery get underway in these channels. It remains to be seen whether this trajectory will continue given recent pandemic developments. So our North America region continues to perform well even as we work to catch up the demand and work our way through industry-wide shortages of freight, labor and materials.
Now let's take a look at Europe, shown on Slide number 29. Kellogg Europe posted its 15th consecutive quarter of organic growth, a remarkable track record of consistency in this market. Volume had to lap a year ago surge, but we sustained good price/mix growth driven by RGM actions. And on a 2-year CAGR basis, you can see that we remain in strong net sales growth with this growth being driven by both Snacks and Cereal. Importantly, we also continue to perform well in market. Retail scanner data indicate only modest sequential deceleration of category and Kellogg consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. On that 2-year CAGR basis, we kept up with the Salty Snacks category with particular recent strength in France and Spain. Our consumer promotion around the Euro's soccer tournament was our biggest summer promo ever for Pringles.
In Cereal, our 2-year growth has outpaced the category in most markets, led by key brands like Crunchy Nut in the U.K. and Tresor and Extra in Continental Europe and Coco Pops and Coco Krispies more broadly. Europe's operating profit lapped a year ago quarter in which operating profit grew more than 35% when it was elevated by at-home demand, outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment during the height of the pandemic. Nevertheless, on a 2-year CAGR basis, we grew our profit at a double-digit rate in Q2.  So clearly, Kellogg Europe continues to perform very well.
Moving to Latin America on Slide #30. Latin America had a notably strong quarter. It grew organic net sales by 9% on top of last year's 14% gain, resulting in strong double-digit growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. Volume had to lap last year's 11% surge and this was felt primarily in Cereal, but we sustained strong price/mix growth, driven by RGM actions across the portfolio and markets. The result was a year-on-year net sales growth in all subregions and as shown on the slide, sustained momentum on a 2-year CAGR basis.
Scanner data do indicate a gradual slowing of at-home demand, which for us manifests itself in cereal. Nevertheless, our 2-year CAGRs for consumption remains strong in our key Cereal markets, with Kellogg exceeding category growth rates, particularly for big brands like Corn Flakes and Fruit Loops. Similarly, Pringles outpaced 2-year CAGRs for Salty Snacks categories in key markets and has gained share on a 1-year basis in our biggest markets, Mexico and Brazil.
Meanwhile, our Parati business in Brazil continued to post strong consumption growth and increased share in biscuits. While operating profit had to lap a near doubling in the year earlier quarter, it was still up strongly on a 2-year CAGR basis. Despite high cost they were heightened further by adverse transactional currency exchange. We clearly are performing well in this region. And while we are somewhat cautious about decelerating at-home demand and further regulatory pressure in the second half, this year is certainly shaping up to be a good one for Kellogg Latin America.
And we'll conclude our regional discussion with EMEA and slide number 31. EMEA produced another quarter of exceptional organic net sales growth, both on a 1 year and 2-year CAGR basis. Both volume and price/mix contributed to the strong year-on-year growth. Geographically, the growth was broad-based and driven by emerging markets. It was led by double-digit gains in Africa. Within Africa, we experienced notably exceptional growth in Nigeria. Our business there has been dependently in growth for a long time, and its recent acceleration and momentum has been impressive.
Meanwhile, we also generated good growth elsewhere in Africa and in the Middle East. We generated double-digit organic net sales growth in Asia as well, and the gains were broad-based across markets like India, Japan and Korea, and the growth came from both Snacks and Cereal. Even in developed market Australia, our sales were roughly flat against last year's surge. EMEA's operating profit growth was also outstanding in Q2, growing 25% year-on-year. So EMEA continues to demonstrate strong momentum, and while we would not expect it to keep up this exceptional rate of growth, it is very clearly a dependable growth driver for us.
Allow me to wrap up with a brief summary on Slide number 33. We have completed another quarter of strong execution and performance, capping a first half that featured the following: Underlying business momentum, driven by our biggest brands. Unlocking capacity so we can resume full commercial activity in certain products. Sustained growth momentum in emerging markets. Leveraging enhanced capabilities from data and analytics to innovation to ESG. Strong cash flow and balance sheet, providing financial flexibility and increased cash to shareowners. A continuation of balanced financial delivery, and an affirmation of our full year guidance as top line momentum helps offset the impact of higher cost pressures and global supply chain obstacles.
As I mentioned earlier, the current business environment is anything but business as usual. In addition to the challenges of ensuring our employee's safety, we and the entire economy are wrestling with tight supply of materials, freight and labor as well as the related rise in their costs. We managed through this environment very effectively in the first half, and we affirm guidance today with confidence that we will continue to manage through it in the second half. We remain as convinced as ever that we are stronger today as a company. 
So before closing, I want to thank our Kellogg employees for their dedication and hard work in what have been incredibly challenging circumstances. And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have."

And so my question is, in terms of mitigating that, you've taken some actions in the second half to begin to try to mitigate. But I guess, as we go forward, how should we think about how much of this maybe leaks into the first half of next year? And are there other incremental actions, whether it's pricing or productivity that you might have to take in order to sort of stay on top of this as we move beyond this current fiscal year?"

And we always like to say that our first-line of defense against something like this is productivity. Right? So we've been working hard at productivity and looking for every area where we can be more efficient. And then RGM. Obviously, everything about RGM and the capabilities we've been building is very important right now, because the surge in inflation that we're all seeing, which is clearly industry-wide, is -- I'm not telling anybody anything they don't know, is quite significant. And on balance, probably the most we've seen in nearly a decade. And so all these things are going to be very important, but we're going to continue to invest in our brands, because as you've heard me say before, we can go to the trade and talk about rising commodity prices and all these things, which are very factual. But the more we spend against our brands in terms of innovation and making sure that they pull off the shelf, the more we earn the right to have those discussions with our retailers. 
As it moves into the future into 2022, it's hard to say how long this persists. It's very pervasive. There are certain things that are clearly going to unwind. Containers will eventually find their rightful places in the world, labor shortages should mitigate, but it's hard to predict. And we're planning for an ongoing challenging cost environment well into next year.

Obviously, we're very pleased with the emerging market performance in the first half. It was surprisingly strong. And I say that because, as Amit already mentioned and as everybody knows, COVID really is raging in many of these parts of the world. But I think our strength there really comes down to the execution of our strategy, which starts with the affordability pyramid, which we've talked about in the past. Our portfolio is much more affordable today than it has been in years. It's much more locally relevant in terms of the foods that we bring to market. And so that's allowed us to weather what is a very uncertain environment in many of these markets.
We also have a very advantaged position in some of these markets. If you think about our West African Nigerian business, our strength in route-to-market through our Multipro distributor allows us to mean to operate in this very challenging environment. The Parati acquisition in Brazil gave us strong route to market. So the focus on route to market and affordability has allowed us to weather this very challenging and, in fact, be very successful in the first half of the year.
We're cautious going forward. We wouldn't expect this type of elevated performance to continue. And we say that just because of the level of uncertainty around COVID, around potential disruptions. We have had some factory disruptions in the emerging markets in the past quarter. We can't guarantee that, that won't happen again. And so it's with some degree of just caution that we look forward relative to the performance that we had in the first half of the year."

But I think the area that's turned inflationary is packaging, on flexible scans. So that has turned inflationary since our last outlook.
And then I think the comment I made earlier around freight, we're seeing freight rates continue to rise. And more importantly, there are widespread shortages. And so just securing the supply of freight is coming at much higher rates than what we had expected. And so I think those are the areas that we're seeing higher costs come through. And then the other one, which is hard to forecast is just the labor shortages. And that's kind of through the supply chain. So those are the areas that we are seeing higher costs come through."

So if you look at our ACV distribution for our Snacks and Cereal business in the U.S., obviously very high. And then we'll look to add weighted ACV distribution as we look to launch new innovations, and we track that very closely. And so it's a clear important metric for us. 
And then with respect to -- what was the second part of the question? The -- oh, penetration. Yes. So we're looking at categories for us that are already very highly penetrated. And so if you look at the penetration gains we've had, we did see penetration gains across our portfolio in our developed markets. And we saw even more of that COVID lift coming from buy rates, though. And so increased household penetration is important.

In this environment, keeping employees safe remains job number one. And aiding our communities is more important than ever. We also continue to supply the world with food, though, this remains challenging as the pandemic persists. A reacceleration of COVID cases has brought on new restrictions, causing temporary shutdowns of production in some countries. Meantime, we and the vendors that supply us are having to manage through bottlenecks and shortages of materials, labor and freight, all created by demand-supply imbalances that are also pushing up costs.
So 2021 is shaping up to be anything but business as usual, and I'm extremely proud of how our organization continues to persevere and succeed in such challenging conditions. I'm also pleased with how well we continue to execute against our strategy, deployed for balanced growth, which is depicted on Slide #6. From a business perspective, demand and eating occasions at home remained elevated in quarter 2, but they are gradually shifting as consumer mobility returns. In the second quarter, this was reflected in an ads forecast continuation of decelerating at-home demand growth, as measured by 2-year compound annual growth rates in our cereal and frozen categories around the world.
We also saw signs of gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in an on-the-go snacks and pack formats. These channels grew year-on-year and better than forecast, even if they remain below 2019 levels. Our Deploy for Growth boosters are working effectively from focusing on ever-evolving occasions, to leveraging our reshaped portfolio, to driving momentum in our world-class brands and to investing in our supply chain to better serve our customers. Our Better Days boosters, which further our ESG efforts continue to work effectively as well.
A few Better Days highlights are shared on Slide #7. During the second quarter, we continued to progress toward our ongoing Better Days commitments. This slide calls out a few of our actions and achievements of the quarter. The key message is that this remains a critical element of our strategy, a clear focus of management and a part of the DNA of Kellogg Company. 
And we turned in another quarter of strong business performance in the second quarter, as discussed on Slide #8. Overall, at-home demand remained elevated, and we saw continued recovery in our away-from-home channels. Most encouraging has been the momentum demonstrated by key long-term growth engines for us. Our world-class snacks brands sustained their momentum with many continuing to outpace their respective categories. Our plant-based protein business is continuing to show strong growth. Our emerging markets businesses sustained their rapid growth and continue to excel even amidst challenging business conditions.
Meanwhile, we continue to manage through the global supply challenges, I referred to earlier even as we continue to bring on our planned capacity increases. From a financial standpoint, our second quarter continued the balanced delivery that we returned to in 2020. Specifically, comparing to pre-COVID 2019, we realized another quarter of strong organic top line growth and operating profit growth as well as improved cash flow generation. We are affirming our full year guidance today. Like so many others, we are currently facing increased cost inflation and supply hurdles, and that is factored into our second half assumptions. Nonetheless, the business is showing good momentum. And just as we work through these challenges in the second quarter, we're confident we can work through them in the second half as well.
Let me now turn it over to Amit, so he can take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail."

It was another strong quarter that's viewed on a 2-year basis, because of the unusual period we were lapping from last year.On an organi",1385,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results for the second quarter are summarized on Slide #10. It was another strong quarter that's viewed on a 2-year basis, because of the unusual period we were lapping from last year.
On an organic basis, we nearly matched last year's unusually high net sales, generating 4.5% growth on a 2-year compound annual growth rate or CAGR basis. This came in better than expected, thanks to an impressive momentum in emerging markets and faster improvement than expected in our away-from-home channels. Currency-neutral adjusted-basis operating profit declined against last year's exceptional quarter when it grew 27% despite losing about 8 points to divestiture impact. Excluding those divested businesses from the 2019 base, our operating profit in quarter 2 this year grew at a 2-year CAGR of about 8%. This is strong growth that indicates underlying margin expansion.
Currency-neutral adjusted-basis earnings per share declined as it lapped last year's outsized growth, but it grew about 9% on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding the divestiture impact on operating profit. And cash flow was again stronger than anticipated for the quarter. And while it lapped last year's unusually high level, this cash flow was again higher than that of quarter 2 of 2019.
So on a 2-year basis, we saw another quarter of good top line growth, margin expansion and conversion of profit into cash flow. That's the kind of balance we strive for.
Let's examine these results in a little more detail. We'll start with net sales on Slide #11. Net sales remained strong despite tough comparisons. Volume declined against last year's double-digit surge, but remained up on a 2-year basis, even despite an as-expected reversal of shipment timing from quarter 1 in North America. Price/mix was again an important driver. Once again, most of this price/mix growth came from revenue growth management initiatives implemented in all 4 regions. Mix was only slightly positive as a mix shift towards Snacks was partially offset by resumed mix shift towards Multipro, our West African distributor business.
Our 2-year organic net sales CAGR was 4.5% in quarter 2, a very strong performance. Rounding out net sales, foreign currency translation was again positive in quarter 2. As we look to the rest of the year, we assume continued deceleration in at-home demand with moderation in away-from-home declines being more modest due to the mix of our channels. We've seen this reflected in our 2-year CAGRs from quarter 1 to quarter 2, and we expect this deceleration to continue into quarter 3 and quarter 4. And based on where ForEx rates are right now, we would expect to see a less positive impact on net sales in the second half.
Moving down the income statement. Slide #12 shows 2 important drivers of our profit margin performance. As you know, our gross profit margin in quarter 2 was lapping outsized operating leverage in quarter 2, 2020, when our plants ran flat out, producing only a limited lineup of SKUs. But importantly, our gross margin in quarter 2, as in quarter 1, increased from 2019 levels. Productivity and price realization drove this 2-year improvement, more than overcoming high cost inflation, labor and freight disruptions, COVID-related costs and a mix shift towards emerging markets. So this 2-year improvement is very encouraging.
As we'll talk about in a moment, we expect to see more pressure on gross margin in the second half than we did in the first half, reflecting the current operating and cost environment. Operating profit margin remained higher than quarter 2, 2019 as well. This reflects the gross margin performance and good discipline on overhead. Brand building investment, while up double digits against last year's delays, was up more modestly versus 2 years ago.
As we look to the second half, our SG&A expense may provide some offset to the gross margin pressure. SG&A expense in the second half should moderate year-on-year. Not only because of last year's back-weighted brand building, particularly in quarter 4, but also because of lapping last year's incentive compensation. This could be partially offset by a gradual resumption of travel and related activities as economies reopen.
Moving down the P&L. Let's turn to Slide #13. During quarter 2, interest expense decreased year-on-year on lower debt, and this decrease will continue for the remainder of the year, with quarter 4 additionally lapping the $20 million debt redemption cost we recorded last year. Of note, during the quarter, we issued our first ever sustainability bond, which was very well received. Other income increased modestly year-on-year to a level that is a little higher than we would expect for the remaining quarters, owing to favorability in various nonpension items. Our effective tax rate of 22.6% was essentially in line with our full year forecast rate.
JV earnings and minority interest together were roughly in line with last year. And average shares outstanding decreased year-on-year, reflecting the impact of quarter 1's buybacks. We still expect full year average shares outstanding to be around 0.5% lower than 2020.
Let's now discuss our cash flow and balance sheet shown on Slide #14. Year-to-date, our cash flow remains below last year's unusually high level as expected, but well above that of the first half of 2019. This 2-year increase is driven by our improved operating profit and improved cash flow conversion. We finished the first half ahead of our expectations for cash flow. And as we look to the rest of the year, cash flow should remain below last year's COVID-aided levels, but still well above 2019.
Meanwhile, our balance sheet remains solid. Net debt remains roughly even with last year and lower than each of the prior 2 years, even despite our increase in cash return to shareowners in form of resumed share buybacks and increased dividend. So our financial condition is quite strong.
Slide #15 shows where our results stand after the first 6 months of 2021. Obviously, we've had a good year so far, producing strong and balanced financial results on a 2-year basis and staying modestly ahead of our own internal forecast. This strong start is all the more important when you consider just how much more challenging the business environment has gotten lately.
Now let's discuss our full year guidance shown on Slide #16. As Steve mentioned, we are affirming our overall guidance. Within that guidance, we are raising our net sales guidance. We are now calling for organic growth of flat to up to 1%, which is a bit higher than our previous guidance for flat, reflecting our business momentum, particularly in emerging markets. This equates to almost 3% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. Volume will continue to lap last year's large gains but price/mix will remain positive as we execute revenue growth management actions to cover higher input costs.
Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted operating profit is unchanged, still calling for a year-on-year decrease of about 1% to 2%, equating to almost 4% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding the divestiture impact. This reflects our stronger-than-expected quarter 2 profit and raised full year net sales outlook, balanced by increased cost pressures and operating challenges that make us a bit more cautious about the second half.
Specifically, we have the productivity and revenue growth management actions in place to continue to cover high market-driven cost for commodities and freight. However, the economy-wide supply chain challenges, that Steve mentioned, are impeding production and shipping and creating incremental operating costs as well, particularly in quarter 3. Because of this, we now expect gross profit margin to finish 2021 slightly below 2019 levels, but well above 2019 in gross profit dollars.
We are also affirming our guidance for 1% to 2% growth in currency-neutral adjusted earnings per share, which equates to almost 5% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. And we continue to look for cash flow to finish the year in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This outlook balances the momentum in our business with the challenging operating environment and balances our margin protection actions against heightened cost pressures.
To summarize, we remain in strong financial condition, and we remain solidly on track for continued balanced financial delivery on a 2-year basis.
And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses."
283356,704542714,2364779,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Amit. Before we get into each of the 4 regions, let me start off by highlighting the strength of some of our most important growth drivers. The first is Pringles, shown on Slide #18. This $2 billion global retail sales brand continues to perform w",2373,"Thanks, Amit. Before we get into each of the 4 regions, let me start off by highlighting the strength of some of our most important growth drivers. The first is Pringles, shown on Slide #18. This $2 billion global retail sales brand continues to perform well around the world. Here in the United States, it continued to outpace the category on consumption growth using a 2-year CAGR to eliminate uneven comparisons. It's also outperforming the category on household penetration gains since the pandemic. And around the world, we are seeing similar momentum. We're seeing growth in original and core flavors. We're seeing incremental growth from innovations like Scorchin and Sizzl'n.
Equally impressive has been Cheez-It, another world-class brand, shown on Slide #19. This $1 billion retail sales brand continues to perform well in the U.S. Its 2-year CAGRs remain well ahead of the category's growth and its household penetration has grown in contrast to the rest of the category. Meanwhile, our launches of this power brand into Canada and Brazil are off to strong starts.
Let's not overlook 2 other world-class snack brands. On Slide #20, we can see the continued strength of Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats. Together, these 2 power brands represent $1 billion in measured channel retail sales in the U.S. alone. You can see from the slide that they are in terrific shape as well. Their consumption has continued to outpace the portable wholesome snacks category on a 2-year CAGR basis, and these brands have added households since the pandemic, whereas the overall category has not.
Plant-based protein and our leading MorningStar Farms brand is another growth driver that is performing very well. As shown on Slide #21, this $400 million retail sales brand continues to show strong consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis and has continued to add to its household penetration. A key advantage of MorningStar Farms is the breadth of its offerings across product types. And in Q2, we continued to see double-digit 2-year CAGRs across segments like chicken, appetizers, breakfast meat and sausages. We continue to innovate against this brand, including its sub-brand Incogmeato, which continues to add distribution and share and is proving to be incremental to the MorningStar Farms franchise.
MorningStar Farms growth has bumped up against our capacity at various times in the past year, even as it has faced numerous new entrants into the category. This is creating a lot of excitement in the category, and we are pleased with our momentum and prospects.
And of course, there's Eggo, shown on Slide #22. This $900 million retail sales brand continues to perform well in the U.S. as indicated by its strong 2-year compound annual growth in consumption and by its better-than-category performance on household penetration. Meantime, the brand continues to grow on a 2-year basis in Canada and Mexico as well.
Our emerging markets are another key growth driver for us. And as you can see on Slide #23, they have actually accelerated their growth over the past couple of years. As we've discussed many times, this is a testament to our geographic footprint, our portfolio of foods and brands, our local supply chains, our go-to-market and our experienced management teams. As you can see from the chart, we continued to record impressive growth in these markets in Q2, even in spite of challenges related to COVID.
We grew strongly in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Russia, and we continue to grow in cereal, snacks and noodles. Emerging markets represent more than 20% of our net sales and are expected to remain an important growth driver for a long time to come.
So some of our portfolio's most important growth drivers are very clearly showing good momentum and have only strengthened over the past year. And these aren't small businesses. Even just the ones I discussed here, collectively represent more than half of our company's net sales.
Let's now discuss each of our regions. We'll start with North America in Slide #24. We sustained net sales growth on a 2-year basis in North America, even if that growth rate was held back by the pandemic's negative impact on away-from-home channels and on-the-go pack formats. Moreover, versus last year, our volume in Q2 was not only lapping last year's double-digit surge, but also felt the impact of our previously discussed shift of shipments into Q1 and resultant trade inventory coming out as expected during Q2. Importantly though, we realized good price mix growth driven by revenue growth management actions. And our overall sales growth was supported by good underlying consumption trends.
We outpaced 4 of our 6 primary categories on a 2-year compound annual growth basis with our 2-year consumption growth accelerating sequentially from Q1 in 5 of our 6 categories. And as we discussed on the past few slides, this strong performance is being driven by many of our biggest brands. So the underlying fundamentals look good.
On operating profit, remember that we were lapping a year ago quarter in which operating profit grew 36%, excluding divestiture impact, an unusually strong quarter elevated by at-home demand, outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment during the height of the pandemic. On a 2-year CAGR basis though, you can see we continued to generate good operating profit growth driven by top line growth, productivity and price/mix. These have been able to offset the impacts of extremely high cost inflation this year as well as the frequent shortages of materials, freight and labor, which are most pronounced in North America.
Let's take a closer look at our category groups in North America. Slide #25 shows that our net sales for snacks in North America continued to grow both on a 1-year and a 2-year CAGR basis, despite declines in away-from-home channels and many on-the-go foods and pack formats. U.S. consumption remains solid on a 2-year CAGR basis, outpacing all 3 of our snacks categories and led by power brands. In crackers, we outpaced the category on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis, led by continued strength in Cheez-IT and Club. In salty snacks, we outpaced the category on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis as well due to continued strength in Pringles, particularly its core 4 flavors, its new Scorchin innovation and multi-packs.
And in portable wholesome snacks, we are seeing brands like Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats hold up very well on a 2-year CAGR basis, while also starting to see signs of recovery in our more on-the-go oriented brands, like Special K, Nutri-Grain and RXBARs.  
In North America cereal, shown on Slide #26, organic net sales were off slightly on a 2-year CAGR basis due to declines in away-from-home channels. We also saw the impact of being capacity constrained on certain brands. In the U.S., the category's consumption was flat on a 2-year CAGR basis in Q2. And after being down about 1% in Q1, we improved to flat in Q2, keeping up with the category on that basis. Frosted Flakes accounted for most of the share decline related to pulling back on brand building and merchandising since Q4 last year, as we worked to maintain service levels and add capacity planned prior to the pandemic.
Unfortunately, our capacity expansion has been slowed by current supply shortages and by our recent fire in one of our facilities. This will delay our return to normal commercial activity on affected brands. In the meantime, our business continues to progress well. We continue to lead the category and share of innovation, and we are seeing better performance in wellness-oriented brands, like Raisin Bran, Special K, Kashi and Bear Naked.
And on Slide #27, we can see that our 2 frozen businesses, plant-based foods and frozen breakfast, also continue to grow on a 2-year CAGR basis, even despite capacity limitations and declines in away-from-home channels. We've already discussed both of our key brands in frozen, MorningStar Farms plant-based foods and Eggo from the griddle foods. Both continue to generate strong consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, and both are poised to sustain growth.
And before we move on from our discussion of North America, we should touch on our U.S. away-from-home business in Slide #28. The slide shows rolling 2-year average growth rates in our net sales over the past few quarters in these channels. As restrictions eased and consumer mobility increased, we saw a gradual recovery get underway in these channels. It remains to be seen whether this trajectory will continue given recent pandemic developments. So our North America region continues to perform well even as we work to catch up the demand and work our way through industry-wide shortages of freight, labor and materials.
Now let's take a look at Europe, shown on Slide #29. Kellogg Europe posted its 15th consecutive quarter of organic growth, a remarkable track record of consistency in this market. Volume had to lap a year ago surge, but we sustained good price/mix growth driven by RGM actions. And on a 2-year CAGR basis, you can see that we remain in strong net sales growth with this growth being driven by both snacks and cereal.
Importantly, we also continue to perform well in market. Retail scanner data indicate only modest sequential deceleration of category and Kellogg consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. On that 2-year CAGR basis, we kept up with the salty snacks category with particular recent strength in France and Spain. Our consumer promotion around the Euro's soccer tournament was our biggest summer promo ever for Pringles.
In cereal, our 2-year growth has outpaced the category in most markets, led by key brands like Crunchy Nut in the U.K. and Tresor and Extra in Continental Europe, and Coco Pops and Cocoa Krispies more broadly. Europe's operating profit lapped a year ago quarter in which operating profit grew more than 35% when it was elevated by at-home demand, outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment during the height of the pandemic. Nevertheless, on a 2-year CAGR basis, we grew our profit at a double-digit rate in Q2. So clearly, Kellogg Europe continues to perform very well.
Moving to Latin America in Slide #30. Latin America had a notably strong quarter. It grew organic net sales by 9% on top of last year's 14% gain, resulting in strong double-digit growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. Volume had to lap last year's 11% surge and this was felt primarily in cereal, but we sustained strong price/mix growth, driven by RGM actions across the portfolio and markets. The result was a year-on-year net sales growth in all subregions and as shown on the slide, sustained momentum on a 2-year CAGR basis.
Scanner data do indicate a gradual slowing of at-home demand, which for us manifests itself in cereal. Nevertheless, our 2-year CAGRs for consumption remains strong in our key cereal markets, with Kellogg exceeding category growth rates, particularly for big brands like Corn Flakes and Froot Loops. Similarly, Pringles outpaced 2-year CAGRs for salty snacks categories in key markets and has gained share on a 1-year basis in our biggest markets, Mexico and Brazil.
Meanwhile, our Parati business in Brazil continued to post strong consumption growth and increased share in biscuits. While operating profit had to lap a near doubling in the year earlier quarter, it was still up strongly on a 2-year CAGR basis. Despite high cost, they were heightened further by adverse transactional currency exchange. We clearly are performing well in this region. And while we are somewhat cautious about decelerating at-home demand and further regulatory pressure in the second half, this year is certainly shaping up to be a good one for Kellogg Latin America.
And we'll conclude our regional discussion with AMEA in Slide #31. AMEA produced another quarter of exceptional organic net sales growth, both on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis. Both volume and price/mix contributed to the strong year-on-year growth. Geographically, the growth was broad-based and driven by emerging markets. It was led by double-digit gains in Africa. Within Africa, we experienced notably exceptional growth in Nigeria. Our business there has been dependently in growth for a long time, and its recent acceleration and momentum has been impressive.
Meanwhile, we also generated good growth elsewhere in Africa and in the Middle East. We generated double-digit organic net sales growth in Asia as well, and the gains were broad-based across markets like India, Japan and Korea, and the growth came from both snacks and cereal. Even in developed market, Australia, our sales were roughly flat against last year's surge. AMEA's operating profit growth was also outstanding in Q2, growing 25% year-on-year. So AMEA continues to demonstrate strong momentum, and while we would not expect it to keep up this exceptional rate of growth, it is very clearly a dependable growth driver for us.
Allow me to wrap up with a brief summary on Slide #33. We have completed another quarter of strong execution and performance, capping a first half that featured the following: Underlying business momentum, driven by our biggest brands; unlocking capacity so we can resume full commercial activity in certain products; sustained growth momentum in emerging markets; leveraging enhanced capabilities from data and analytics, to innovation, to ESG; strong cash flow and balance sheet, providing financial flexibility and increased cash to shareowners; a continuation of balanced financial delivery; and an affirmation of our full year guidance, as top line momentum helps offset the impact of higher cost pressures and global supply chain obstacles.
As I mentioned earlier, the current business environment is anything but business as usual. In addition to the challenges of ensuring our employees' safety, we and the entire economy are wrestling with tight supply of materials, freight and labor as well as the related rise in their costs. We managed through this environment very effectively in the first half, and we affirm guidance today with confidence that we will continue to manage through it in the second half. We remain as convinced as ever that we are stronger today as a company.
So before closing, I want to thank our Kellogg employees for their dedication and hard work in what have been incredibly challenging circumstances.
And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have."

And so my question is, in terms of mitigating that, you've taken some actions in the second half to begin to try to mitigate. But I guess, as we go forward, how should we think about how much of this maybe leaks into the first half of next year? And are there other incremental actions, whether it's pricing or productivity that you might have to take in order to sort of stay on top of this as we move beyond this current fiscal year?"

And we always like to say that our first-line of defense against something like this is productivity, right? So we've been working hard at productivity and looking for every area where we can be more efficient. And then RGM. Obviously, everything about RGM and the capabilities we've been building is very important right now, because the surge in inflation that we're all seeing, which is clearly industry-wide, is -- I'm not telling anybody anything they don't know, is quite significant. And on balance, probably the most we've seen in nearly a decade. And so all these things are going to be very important, but we're going to continue to invest in our brands. Because as you've heard me say before, we can go to the trade and talk about rising commodity prices and all these things, which are very factual, but the more we spend against our brands in terms of innovation and making sure that they pull off the shelf, the more we earn the right to have those discussions with our retailers.
As it moves into the future into 2022, it's hard to say how long this persists. It's very pervasive. There are certain things that are clearly going to unwind. Containers will eventually find their rightful places in the world, labor shortages should mitigate, but it's hard to predict. And we're planning for an ongoing challenging cost environment well into next year.
Amit, I don't know if you have anything to add?"

Obviously, we're very pleased with the emerging market performance in the first half. It was surprisingly strong. And I say that because, as Amit already mentioned and as everybody knows, COVID really is raging in many of these parts of the world. But I think our strength there really comes down to the execution of our strategy, which starts with the affordability pyramid, which we've talked about in the past. Our portfolio is much more affordable today than it has been in years. It's much more locally relevant in terms of the foods that we bring to market. And so that's allowed us to weather what is a very uncertain environment in many of these markets.
We also have a very advantaged position in some of these markets. If you think about our West African Nigerian business, our strength in route-to-market through our Multipro distributor allows us to mean to operate in this very challenging environment. The Parati acquisition in Brazil gave us strong route to market. So the focus on route to market and affordability has allowed us to weather this very challenging and, in fact, be very successful in the first half of the year.
We're cautious going forward. We wouldn't expect this type of elevated performance to continue. And we say that just because of the level of uncertainty around COVID, around potential disruptions. We have had some factory disruptions in the emerging markets in the past quarter. We can't guarantee that, that won't happen again. And so it's with some degree of just caution that we look forward relative to the performance that we had in the first half of the year."

I'd say the supply disruptions that we're seeing are the same things that many in the industry are seeing, everything from a shortage of labor, which is quite challenging.

And much of that, you can point to China went into lockdown, obviously, very early in the pandemic and was the first out, recovered quite quickly and sucked up a lot of resource, and it's really created supply imbalances throughout the world that everybody has had to deal with, and we've had to deal with inside North America.
During that time, we're also adding capacity. We've successfully added capacity throughout the world. We had what we call a vertical start-up of our Pringles line in Poland, which was done very successfully. So we have been able to add capacity. In some areas in North America, it's been a little bit slowed because of some of these supply disruptions. And so we haven't been able to get the level of capacity as quickly as we would want.

And then with respect to -- what was the second part of the question? The -- oh, penetration. Yes. So we're looking at categories for us that are already very highly penetrated.

And again, underlying 2-year stacked consumption is very good. So we stand by the performance of MorningStar Farms, what the team is doing. And far from falling flat, I think it's doing quite well. Strong growth beyond burgers as well in chicken and others."

After all, we are still managing through a pandemic and still nowhere close to what any of us would call life as normal. This is certainly true from a business perspective as well. Therefore, we remain focused on keeping our employees safe and aiding our communities is more important than ever. We also continue to supply the world with food, but as we and all companies have discussed previously, this has gotten extremely challenging. 
Importantly, we remain on our strategy, Deploy for Balanced Growth, which is depicted on Slide #6. This strategy continues to keep us on our path for steady, balanced financial returns for shareowners. We also continue to make progress on Better Days, our ESG-oriented program. A few better days highlights from quarter 3 are shared on Slide #7. 
This remains a critical element of our strategy, a clear focus of management and a part of the DNA of Kellogg Company, and we have not lost sight of this during the current pandemic and business environment. And there is no question that today's business environment is as challenging as we've ever seen it. Our organization has risen to all of these challenges using creativity, skills and work ethic to manage through them. 
Slide #8 attempts to categorize these challenges into 3 basic buckets. First, we're all familiar with the surges in market prices for commodities, packaging and freight all the result of supply-demand imbalances that may take some time to work out. We're working hard to mitigate the margin impacts of these high costs from our active hedging program, which has given us strong visibility into our commodity costs, to mitigating cost pressures with productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions. 
Second, by now, we're also all aware of the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages that are not only pushing costs higher, but are also making it very difficult to supply the market. Here's where our supply chain's controlled tower approach has provided us agility in addressing shortages and gaps in materials, equipment and land and ocean freight. We've also taken actions to reduce complexity in our portfolio and operations. 
And third, we are seeing acute shortages in labor across all spectrums of the economy. This is resulting in absenteeism, high turnover, difficulty obtaining temporary labor and, for some of us, even labor strikes. To address this, we've had to recruit continuously, and we've executed contingency plans to sustain as much supply as possible in the face of open positions and work stoppages. Simply put, we are taking important actions to manage through today's unprecedented environment. 
And through it all, we're executing well in market and delivering balanced financial growth, which continued in quarter 3 and is discussed on Slide #9. Consumption growth remains elevated, as measured on a 2-year compound annual growth basis even if it continues to decelerate as expected. We're seeing particularly strong consumption growth and share performance in many of our biggest, world-class brands. And we continue to sustain strong momentum in our emerging markets. This momentum has been evident for the past few years and reflects our improved geographic footprint, the strength of our portfolio, our efforts to broaden our offerings into affordable price points and our local route to market and supply chains. 
From a financial standpoint, these factors led to continued balanced growth, strong organic net sales growth, strong operating profit growth, strong earnings per share growth and cash flow that remains well above pre-COVID 2019 levels. So in spite of all the operating challenges, we continue to deliver. And today, we are even raising our full year guidance for net sales to reflect momentum in the business. At the same time, we are also reaffirming our guidance for operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow despite a worsened cost and labor and supply environment. 
I'm sure you can appreciate that even holding guidance amidst these kinds of challenges speaks to the kind of dependability we strive for, regardless of business conditions. Let me now turn it over to Amit, so he can take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail."
283356,704542740,2425024,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results for the third quarter are summarized on Slide 11. As you can see, we delivered strong organic basis net sales growth of 5% in quarter 3 on top of similar growth in the year earlier period. T",1524,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results for the third quarter are summarized on Slide 11. As you can see, we delivered strong organic basis net sales growth of 5% in quarter 3 on top of similar growth in the year earlier period. This came in better than anticipated due to exceptional growth in Europe and AMEA. 
Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit increased by 11% year-on-year. This was driven by the strong top line growth as well as lapping  year ago quarter in which incremental brand-building investment had been shifted from earlier quarters. Currency-neutral adjusted basis earnings per share increased by 18% as strong operating profit growth was augmented by a decrease in average shares outstanding. And cash flow, while still below last year's unusual pandemic-related surge, remained well above the pre-pandemic 2019 level. In total, a very strong financial performance. 
Let's examine these results in a little more detail. We'll start with net sales on Slide #12. As you can see, the net sales growth in quarter 3 was driven by both volume and price/mix. The 1% plus organic volume growth was driven by our international regions, most notably Europe and AMEA, where our Nigeria business had an exceptional quarter. And this volume growth comes despite supply pressures and lapping good year ago growth. Our 4% organic basis price mix remained solidly positive in all 4 regions, the result of revenue growth management actions that we have been implementing since the second half of last year when input cost inflation began to accelerate. 
Finally, foreign currency translation was modestly favorable to net sales in quarter 3, decelerating from the first half as expected. So through the first 9 months, you can see that on an organic basis, our net sales were up 3%, despite lapping the pandemic-related surge, and they are up 5% on a 2-year compound annual growth basis. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect sustained price/mix growth based on the revenue growth management actions we've taken. Though we are a bit more cautious on volume, given the current labor negotiations and a prudent view towards decelerating at-home demand and emerging markets growth. 
Moving down the income statement. Slide #13 shows our gross profit performance. As we had anticipated, both our gross profit and gross profit margin declined year-on-year in quarter 3 as we lapped last year's strong operating leverage and as we face this year's unusually high cost pressures. While our productivity and revenue growth management actions continue to cover market-driven cost inflation, there was significant incremental cost and disruption stemming from the current operating environment that came on top of that. 
Our gross profit margin was further weighed down by disruption and costs related to fire at one of our plants and a more pronounced than usual mix shift towards emerging markets, most notably our distributor business in Nigeria. Importantly, though, while our gross profit percent margin decreased to below the level of pre-pandemic quarter 3 2019 and our gross profit dollars remained higher than that period. And if you look at the right-hand side of the slide, you can see that our gross profit dollars are up through the first 9 months of this year, both on a year-on-year and on a 2-year basis. In this high cost environment, we have to focus on both margins and dollar growth. 
On Slide #14, we see a driver of year-on-year profit change that is really more of a phasing dynamic. SG&A expense is comprised of advertising and promotion, R&D and overheads. Last year's quarter 3 was unusual in that it included incremental A&P investment delayed from the first half because of the pandemic. It also included a sizable increase in incentive compensation accruals. But comparing SG&A to the third quarter of 2019, we see it was lower, both on a percentage margin and dollar basis. 
This 2-year decrease is related to both the work we did to remove stranded costs after our divestiture but also to our decision this year to pull back on investment behind specific supply-constrained brands. You can also see that through the first 9 months, our SG&A dollars are roughly flat with the same period of 2019, and that's probably how we'll finish this year. 
If we look at operating profit in the same way on Slide #15, we find that in dollars our operating profit in this year's quarter 3 was not only higher than it was in last year's quarter 3, but also higher than what it was in quarter 3 2019. Again, this focus on dollar profit is important as we manage through this challenging environment. 
Now we do think that quarter 4 will be a little different. Contrary to our prior assumptions, we are seeing no moderation of the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages here in the fourth quarter. In fact, we are now experiencing incremental disruption and costs, further compounded by a labor strike. So for quarter 4, we are forecasting gross profit dollars and operating profit dollars to be below quarter 4 of 2019, even if both metrics finish the full year above 2019 levels. 
Moving down the P&L., let's turn to Slide #16. While operating profit drove most of our growth in earnings per share in quarter 3, we also benefited from modest net favorability in below-the-line items. In quarter 3, interest expense decreased on lower debt, which will continue to be a year-on-year driver in quarter 4, with quarter 4 comparison also lapping the $20 million debt redemption cost we recorded last year. This decrease in interest expense was more than offset by a decline in other income, which compared against an unusually high level last year. We expect quarter 4 other income to be similar to that of quarter 3. 
Our effective tax rate in quarter 3 came in lower than last year. We believe quarter 4 rate will come in higher than the 22% rate we are now forecasting for the full year. JV earnings and minority interest together were favorable to last year, though this mostly reflects the consolidation of a couple of our smaller investment phase joint ventures in West Africa into operating profit. And average shares outstanding decreased year-on-year, reflecting the impact of quarter 1's buybacks. We still expect full year average shares outstanding to be around 0.5% lower than 2020. 
Outside of the currency-neutral EPS that we manage and guide to, we did experience continued year-on-year favorability, though modest from foreign currency translation. Based on where exchange rates are today and what we are lapping, there would be little to no benefit from foreign currency translation in quarter 4. 
Let's now discuss our cash flow and balance sheet shown on Slide #17. Year-to-date, our cash flow remains below last year's unusually high level as expected, mostly as we lap last year's timing-related increases in various accruals during the height of the pandemic. The more relevant comparisons, therefore, are the year-to-date periods of 2019 and 2018. As you can see from the slide, this year's cash flow continues to track well above those recover time periods. This is driven by higher operating profit as well as reduced restructuring outlays and continued effective management of core working capital. 
Meanwhile, our balance sheet remains solid. Net debt remains roughly even with last year, and lower than each of the prior 2 years, even despite this year's increase in cash return to shareowners in the form of resumed share buybacks and increased dividends. So our financial condition remains quite strong. 
Slide #18 shows where our results stand after the first 9 months of 2021. Obviously, we've had a good year so far producing strong and balanced financial results on a 2-year basis and staying ahead of our own internal focus. This year-to-date performance is also more impressive when you consider just how challenging the business environment has been. 
Let's now turn to our updated guidance for the full year 2021, as shown on Slide #19. Given the better-than-expected momentum we are seeing in our international regions, we are raising our guidance for organic net sales growth to a rate of 2% to 3%. This is a solid performance, particularly given the comparisons against last year's pandemic-related surge. At the same time, we are reaffirming our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit and earnings per share as well as for cash flow. 
While net sales are coming in higher than previously expected, we are incorporating costs and disruptions related to the current supply and labor conditions. In fact, given this current environment, we will likely land towards the lower end of the guidance ranges for these metrics. 
Our guidance assumes a reasonable conclusion to the current labor stoppage at our U.S. cereal plant. However, as you can appreciate, there is always uncertainty regarding labor negotiations. In the meantime, we will continue to execute our contingency plans to mitigate disruption. Overall, despite an incredibly challenging operating environment, we remain in strong financial condition and our full year results are expected to sustain balanced financial delivery on a 2-year basis. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses."

Slide #21 shows the 2-year compound annual growth rates in net sales across our 4 regions. It's in North America, where we've had the most supply disruption and most significantly in cereal. This has restrained our overall growth in quarter 2 and quarter 3 this year. But as we'll see in a minute, our snacks continue to grow nicely year-on-year and frozen breakfast and plant-based foods have continued to post good growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
Europe sustained impressive growth in quarter 3. Pringles has driven exceptional growth for us in Snacks, and cereal sales have remained strong there as well. In our Latin America and AMEA regions, we are clearly demonstrating exceptional momentum, collectively sustaining double-digit growth on a 2-year and 1-year basis in the third quarter. 
In fact, if you turn to Slide #22, you can see that this emerging markets growth is anything but new. Collectively, our emerging markets had already been growing consistently at or above our long-term target of mid-single-digit growth for these businesses. This year, we've seen double-digit growth. Elasticities to our cost-related price increases have run lower than historical levels. 
We have continued to expand Pringles across these markets, with especially strong growth in Russia and Brazil. We have also continued to grow cereal across our emerging markets with particular strength this year in Asia. And our growth in Africa this year has been nothing short of spectacular, driven by noodles, cereal and snacks. 
Equally important to our long-term prospects is the health of our big world-class brands. And in quarter 3, their momentum was sustained as much in developed markets as in emerging markets. Slide #23 shows the 2-year CAGRs for consumption growth for Pringles in the U.S. This brand continued to gain share in the third quarter, propelled by incremental innovation, effective brand-building campaigns and strength in multipacks. 
And Slide #24 shows that Pringles momentum is truly global. Similar to the U.S., the brand's strong growth and share performance is being driven by incremental innovation like the Sizzl'n platform in Europe or local flavors like seaweed in Asia. And by very effective brand building, particularly its 360-degree campaigns around soccer and electronic gaming. On top of that, it continues to gain distribution, particularly in emerging markets. So this $2 billion global retail sales brand continues to perform well. 
Let's check in on another world-class brand, Cheez-It, shown on Slide #25. In the U.S., this brand continued to grow consumption and gained share in the third quarter, sparked by strong brand-building activity and growth in multipacks. Meantime, it continues to gain distribution and share in its newly launched markets, Canada and Brazil. This is a $1 billion plus brand that continues its long track record of consistent growth. 
Pop-Tarts is another world-class brand that is performing well. Its 2-year growth has well outpaced the portable wholesome snacks category, as shown on Slide #26. Another big brand with over $750 million sales at retail in the U.S. alone, it's showing good momentum. To give you an idea of how relevant this brand is, our latest ad has generated nearly 40 million views on YouTube. Our What Would Pop Tarts Do hashtag has shown up 5.7 billion times in TikTok and the brand has enjoyed more than 2 billion earned impressions this year. 
And big growth has continued for us on Rice Krispies Treats, shown on Slide #27. This brand even accelerated its consumption growth and share gains during the third quarter, aided by effective brand building and the success of innovation like home style treats. This brand generates close to $350 million in retail sales in the U.S., and it continues to grow. 
In cereal, the performance of key brands in the U.S. has been impacted by supply complications in North America. But internationally, we're seeing good growth. On Slide #28, our 2 world-class brands in Europe are worth highlighting. Tresor also known as Crave in some markets is a taste segment brand that has become the #1 cereal brand in Europe and has dramatically outpaced the category this year in key markets like France and Germany. 
Extra meanwhile, is geared more towards adults and it, too, has strongly outpaced the category this year in markets like Italy and Spain. Over in the frozen aisle, Eggo is clearly a world-class brand and it is performing well. Slide #29 shows that it is sustaining solid mid-single-digit consumption growth in spite of capacity constraints. Yet another big brand with close to $900 million in retail sales in the U.S. continuing to grow. 
Morningstar Farms, our leading plant-based proteins brand, is shown on Slide #30. This is another world-class brand that is sustaining strong consumption growth even as the category decelerates as expected, and even as we run up against capacity limits in some of our product segments. This is a $400 million retail sales brand with momentum and strong prospects. In fact, as you've seen, the fundamentals, momentum and growth prospects for many of our biggest world-class brands remain solid. 
Now let's review each of our regions, starting with North America in Slide #31. Net sales were flat year-on-year in the third quarter, with underlying consumption growth well exceeding our shipments due to supply constraints. Many of these constraints were economy-wide, including shortages of materials, labor and freight. But we had some internal challenges as well. As you know, we entered this year tight on capacity for growing food formats in cereal, frozen from the griddle and plant-based protein as well as certain pack formats and snacks. Add to that, the fire that interrupted production at one of our cereal plants and you can appreciate just how constrained we have been. 
The good news is that we remain in growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, and that our revenue growth management actions are resulting in good price/mix growth. This price realization, along with good execution of productivity programs, is crucial for mitigating the margin pressures of high cost inflation and incremental costs and inefficiencies related to the broader bottlenecks and shortages in the economy. 
Slide #32 breaks our North America net sales growth in the category groups. You can see the good momentum we've seen in snacks and frozen despite these supply constraints and the fact that away-from-home sales remain lower on a 2-year basis. Cereal net sales have been flattish on a 2-year CAGR basis in the first half roughly in line with the U.S. category's performance. In quarter 3, however, it faced the worst of its supply challenges and is now down about 1% year-to-date on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
Importantly, our underlying consumption trends remain solid across most of the portfolio, as shown on Slide #33. In all 3 of our snacks categories, we saw an acceleration in 2-year CAGRs in quarter 3, continuing to well outpace their individual categories. In the frozen from the griddle category, we also saw accelerated 2-year growth during the third quarter. And in frozen veg vegan, even as the category decelerates as expected, our growth remains strong. Even in cereal, which is a category has been flat on a 2-year basis this year, we are holding consumption relatively flat despite all the supply challenges we've been facing. 
And before we move on from our discussion of North America, we should touch on our U.S. Away From Home business in Slide #34. The slide shows rolling 2-year average growth rates in our net sales over the past few quarters in these channels. As restrictions eased and consumer mobility increased, we saw year-on-year growth starting in quarter 2 and continuing in quarter 3. Our sales remained below 2019 levels but you can see that a gradual recovery continues. 
The recovery has been a little quicker in channels like convenience stores and schools, and much slower in channels like vending and in travel and lodging. There is no question that our North America region is facing the toughest of the global supply challenges, and the team has risen to the occasion. We are presently working to restore full production at our fire-damaged cereal plant, while negotiating with the union regarding its strike against all of our U.S. cereal plants. Indeed, North America faces an even tougher quarter in the quarter 4. Nonetheless, we're executing well in market, and our brands are in great shape. 
Now let's turn to our international regions and Slide #35. You can see that in each of these 3 regions, we are sustaining strong momentum, both in the form of year-on-year growth and on a 2-year CAGR basis, which eliminates the impact of comparing against last year's surge, especially in Latin America. Let's look at each of these regions a little more closely. 
Slide #36 shows the results of Kellogg Europe. Europe's streak of quarterly organic net sales growth continued in impressive fashion in the third quarter. Driven by both volume and price mix, this growth was led by Russia and the U.K. but broad-based across the region. Double-digit growth in Snacks was driven not only by Pringles sustaining its momentum, but also by a rebound in portable wholesome snacks. Cereal sales grew on top of last year's growth, and we are particularly pleased with the magnitude of our share gains in the U.K. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we lap a particularly strong organic net sales growth performance. And on operating profit, we are managing through high costs and supply challenges as well as lapping a 53rd week. Nevertheless, we expect to sustain our in-market momentum in cereal and snacks, and Europe is on track for another strong year. 
Now let's talk about Latin America in Slide #37. The year ago quarter included outsized gains in sales and profit, so comparisons are masking a solid performance for us in the third quarter. Organic net sales continued to grow year-on-year despite the comparisons, with notable strength on a 2-year CAGR basis. The growth was broad-based and supported by strong in-market performance in cereal led by Mexico, as well as by Pringles across key markets. We saw particular strength in Brazil, where Pringles is showing outstanding momentum. 
Despite decelerating at-home demand trends and extremely high cost inflation, we expect Latin America to continue to grow in quarter 4, completing what has been a very strong year. 
And we'll finish our business review with AMEA and Slide #38. Once again, we saw exceptional growth in this region. We generated organic net sales growth in Australia, led by cereal, and in Asia, driven by both cereal and snacks, despite COVID-related production restrictions on Pringles for much of the quarter. The biggest start in the quarter was Africa, where we are generating double-digit growth in both volume and in price/mix. The top line growth was strong enough to overcome double-digit cost inflation, delivering operating profit growth. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued top line momentum and bottom line growth in AMEA despite cost inflation and supply challenges. 
Allow me to wrap up with a brief summary on Slide #40. Our portfolio is in good shape. Our world-class brands have great momentum and our emerging markets businesses continue to exceed even our expectations. The result is strong top line momentum. We're taking action to mitigate the profit impact of what is the highest cost inflation we've seen in a decade or more. To do that, we are executing productivity initiatives. We are being disciplined on overhead and selective on brand investment, and we are carefully executing all levers of revenue growth management. 
Bottlenecks and shortages are ramping across the economy right now, and we are experiencing our own particular labor and supply disruptions. However, we are managing well through these difficult supply conditions. Our people are demonstrating why they are competitive advantaged, going the extra mile to supply the market when everything -- procurement, manufacturing, shipping, is more challenging now than ever. 
And in the end, we expect to remain on our path of balanced financial growth. We've delivered on it so far this year, and we are reaffirming our full year guidance today even in spite of the current operating environment. I want to commend and thank our entire organization for their dedication and grit, and for finding a way to deliver on our commitments in what is obviously an unusual environment.

There is no question about that. our fill rates and our customer service levels are not where we want them to be. And we're not alone in that either, but we hold ourselves to a very high standard, and we aim to get better and better. And so let me point out a couple of things around your question. 
We have one particular area that is more challenging than others, and that's our cereal business, and that's obviously being compounded because of the strike that we're going through right now. But outside of that, which is -- that's 20% of our global business. Outside of that, we're in the same boat as everybody else. And you can see based on type of performance outside of cereal in the United States, we have posted some very, very strong gains. So we don't believe there's going to be anything structural to our disadvantage as we continue to make our way through the pandemic through the supply grid lock into a more normalized environment. 
So -- and we've got mitigation plans based on where we are with our current cereal plants in the U.S. as well. So by no means are we complacent. We've got big challenges in front of us. But we're quite confident that we're not going to be at a long term or any kind of permanent disadvantage. This is a transitory event, and we'll work our way through it."

And so out of respect for that process, I'm not going to get into a lot of detail, which I'm sure you can appreciate. But we have always treated our employees with respect and fairness, and that includes industry-leading compensation and benefits. The offer that we have in front of the union right now is increased compensation on top of that already industry-leading compensation and benefits, and we are not asking to take anything away despite what you may have heard publicly. 
So we think a fair resolution should be in the offing. We think that this type of offer is fair, reasonable and, again, increases on top of industry-leading compensation already. So this would allow our employees to get back to work. We want them back to work. I think they want to be back to work.

Overall, I would say that we're expecting inflation to be in the high single digits like it was in quarter 3, similar levels, slightly higher in quarter 4. And then, of course, compounded by the strike, right, and the disruptions as a result of that. So that's the outlook on gross margins from a quarter 4 standpoint.

We knew we've been talking for a year now because we had a year extension. We knew the contract was expiring on October 5. So we took all sorts of measures to prepare ourselves, including building inventory. 
Building inventory was a little bit challenged because of the fire in Memphis. But we also have deployed our white collar workers. We've deployed outside labor to keep the plants running, to get the plants running. They're gaining productivity each and every day. We've also leveraged our global supply chain network for cereal to also mitigate. And so we're working very, very hard on 2 fronts, to mitigate the effects of the strike on the one, and we're doing that successfully and getting better every day. But also, to get our workers back to work. We want them to get their paychecks. We want them to enjoy their health care. We truly want them back to work. And we think we've got a very, very good proposal, again, with increases on top of already industry-leading compensation.

I think as we expected and as we had previously communicated, inflation came in at high single-digit rates in quarter 3. It accelerated through the quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect it to further accelerate into quarter 4 as well. And we kind of look at it in 2 buckets. There's the market-driven costs in commodities like oil, dairy, ingredients like rise, potatoes and packaging. And actually, packaging was the one where we saw significant acceleration in quarter 3. 
So that's -- we're seeing inflation fairly broad-based, I'd say, across our commodities. And then of course, the operating environment continues to be challenged, whether it's freight markets, whether it's ocean freight, whether it's labor shortages, as well as shortages across our suppliers and our supply chain. So that's -- and I would expect a similar outlook for quarter 4 with slightly higher -- still in the high single-digit rates, but slightly higher levels of inflation into quarter 4. 
And I think from a pricing standpoint and from a revenue growth management standpoint, we're obviously taking action. And broadly, I'd say, covering our commodity-related costs and our direct costs, I think some of the disruptions are hard to predict. And so that's kind of the color on inflation."

So there's clearly some uniqueness. 
But I think one thing that we are definitely looking towards is how we continue to grow. Because despite this, we've had lots of, I wouldn't call it pockets, we've got real growth happening in most of our business that is very resilient, robust and sustainable. But the future of work is clearly going to change, and our capital plans over the next couple of years will reflect that. When I say the future of work, the obvious -- what happens in office environments, where work gets done, how work gets done.

From a U.S. shipment standpoint, I would say shipments are lagging consumption probably mid-single digits is probably a reasonable assumption there. I'd say inventory levels across the whole landscape are low. Obviously, it's been well documented, all the supply chain challenges and disruptions and so forth. 
In terms of Europe, I mean, the Europe team continues to deliver at a very high level. And if you look at the U.K. and Russia performance, we highlighted that. And if you look at it across Pringles and cereal and now wholesome snacks has bounced back, as we said as well. And so it's really just high levels of execution, lapping a very strong performance last year and continued demand creation activities that have been very, very successful. 
In terms of the disruptions, there clearly are disruptions. They're not quite as acute as they are in the United States, but they're real. There's friction also that has to do with Brexit. When you think about supply chain that is on Continental Europe as well as the U.K., we're working our way through that. You're seeing good results despite that. But the same issues around freight and truck drivers exist in the U.K. and in Continental Europe, but particularly the U.K. as they do in the U.S. as well."

It handles innovation extremely well. It carries flavor like no other snack. And so we see continued growth in the markets where we are. It's got pretty good distribution country-wide. So most of the growth is going to come from continuing to penetrate and increased buy rates and household penetration. In some of the developing markets, you've seen us enter Brazil and other emerging markets quite successfully, and we put a couple of lines in our Brazilian plant for Pringles as well. The Malaysia plant has been running strong for us, and that provides good growth opportunities across Asia. 
So we think -- I'm not going to predict how big it can get, but it keeps getting bigger, for sure, and generating very solid growth for us. The other thing I'd mention where we have a lot of opportunity from snacks and expanding distribution is Cheez-It, which doesn't have the same footprint as Pringles, not even close. And we've now launched in Canada and Brazil, and it's done extremely well.

After all, we are still managing through a pandemic and still nowhere close to what any of us would call life as normal. This is certainly true from a business perspective as well. Therefore, we remain focused on keeping our employees safe and aiding our communities is more important than ever. We also continue to supply the world with food, but as we and all companies have discussed previously, this has gotten extremely challenging. 
Importantly, we remain on our strategy, Deploy for Balanced Growth, which is depicted on Slide #6. This strategy continues to keep us on our path for steady, balanced financial returns for shareowners. We also continue to make progress on Better Days, our ESG-oriented program. A few Better Days highlights from quarter 3 are shared on Slide #7. 
This remains a critical element of our strategy, a clear focus of management and a part of the DNA of Kellogg Company, and we have not lost sight of this during the current pandemic and business environment. And there is no question that today's business environment is as challenging as we've ever seen it. Our organization has risen to all of these challenges using creativity, skills and work ethic to manage through them. 
Slide #8 attempts to categorize these challenges into 3 basic buckets. First, we're all familiar with the surges in market prices for commodities, packaging and freight, all the result of supply-demand imbalances that may take some time to work out. We're working hard to mitigate the margin impacts of these high costs, from our active hedging program, which has given us strong visibility into our commodity costs, to mitigating cost pressures with productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions. 
Second, by now, we're also all aware of the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages that are not only pushing costs higher, but are also making it very difficult to supply the market. Here's where our supply chain's control tower approach has provided us agility in addressing shortages and gaps in materials, equipment and land and ocean freight. We've also taken actions to reduce complexity in our portfolio and operations. 
And third, we are seeing acute shortages in labor across all spectrums of the economy. This is resulting in absenteeism, high turnover, difficulty maintaining temporary labor and, for some of us, even labor strikes. To address this, we've had to recruit continuously, and we've executed contingency plans to sustain as much supply as possible in the face of open positions and work stoppages. Simply put, we are taking important actions to manage through today's unprecedented environment. 
And through it all, we're executing well in market and delivering balanced financial growth, which continued in quarter 3 and is discussed on Slide #9. Consumption growth remains elevated, as measured on a 2-year compound annual growth basis even if it continues to decelerate as expected. We're seeing particularly strong consumption growth and share performance in many of our biggest, world-class brands. And we continue to sustain strong momentum in our emerging markets. This momentum has been evident for the past few years and reflects our improved geographic footprint, the strength of our portfolio, our efforts to broaden our offerings into affordable price points and our local route to market and supply chains. 
From a financial standpoint, these factors led to continued balanced growth, strong organic net sales growth, strong operating profit growth, strong earnings per share growth and cash flow that remains well above pre-COVID 2019 levels. So in spite of all the operating challenges, we continue to deliver. And today, we are even raising our full year guidance for net sales to reflect momentum in the business. At the same time, we are also reaffirming our guidance for operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow despite a worsened cost and labor and supply environment. 
I'm sure you can appreciate that even holding guidance amidst these kinds of challenges speaks to the kind of dependability we strive for, regardless of business conditions. Let me now turn it over to Amit, so he can take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail."
283356,704542740,2425267,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results for the third quarter are summarized on Slide #11. As you can see, we delivered strong organic basis net sales growth of 5% in quarter 3 on top of similar growth in the year earlier period.",1523,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results for the third quarter are summarized on Slide #11. As you can see, we delivered strong organic basis net sales growth of 5% in quarter 3 on top of similar growth in the year earlier period. This came in better than anticipated due to exceptional growth in Europe and AMEA. 
Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit increased by 11% year-on-year. This was driven by the strong top line growth as well as lapping a year-ago quarter in which incremental brand-building investment had been shifted from earlier quarters. Currency-neutral adjusted basis earnings per share increased by 18% as strong operating profit growth was augmented by a decrease in average shares outstanding. And cash flow, while still below last year's unusual pandemic-related surge, remained well above the pre-pandemic 2019 level. In total, a very strong financial performance. 
Let's examine these results in a little more detail. We'll start with net sales on Slide #12. As you can see, the net sales growth in quarter 3 was driven by both volume and price/mix. The 1% plus organic volume growth was driven by our international regions, most notably Europe and AMEA, where our Nigeria business had an exceptional quarter. And this volume growth comes despite supply pressures and lapping good year-ago growth. 
Our 4% organic basis price mix remained solidly positive in all 4 regions, the result of revenue growth management actions that we have been implementing since the second half of last year when input cost inflation began to accelerate. Finally, foreign currency translation was modestly favorable to net sales in quarter 3, decelerating from the first half as expected. So through the first 9 months, you can see that on an organic basis, our net sales were up 3%, despite lapping the pandemic-related surge, and they are up 5% on a 2-year compound annual growth basis. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect sustained price/mix growth based on the revenue growth management actions we've taken, though we are a bit more cautious on volume, given the current labor negotiations and a prudent view towards decelerating at-home demand and emerging markets' growth. 
Moving down the income statement, slide #13 shows our gross profit performance. As we had anticipated, both our gross profit and gross profit margin declined year-on-year in quarter 3 as we lapped last year's strong operating leverage and as we face this year's unusually high cost pressures. While our productivity and revenue growth management actions continue to cover market-driven cost inflation, there was significant incremental cost and disruption stemming from the current operating environment that came on top of that. 
Our gross profit margin was further weighed down by disruption and costs related to fire at one of our plants and a more pronounced than usual mix shift towards emerging markets, most notably our distributor business in Nigeria. Importantly, though, while our gross profit percent margin decreased to below the level of pre-pandemic quarter 3 2019, our gross profit dollars remained higher than that period. And if you look at the right-hand side of the slide, you can see that our gross profit dollars are up through the first 9 months of this year, both on a year-on-year and on a 2-year basis. In this high cost environment, we have to focus on both margins and dollar growth. 
On Slide #14, we see a driver of year-on-year profit change that is really more of a phasing dynamic. SG&A expense is comprised of advertising and promotion, R&D and overheads. Last year's quarter 3 was unusual in that it included incremental A&P investment delayed from the first half because of the pandemic. It also included a sizable increase in incentive compensation accruals. 
But comparing SG&A to the third quarter of 2019, we see it was lower, both on a percentage margin and dollar basis. This 2-year decrease is related to both the work we did to remove stranded costs after our divestiture but also to our decision this year to pull back on investment behind specific supply-constrained brands. You can also see that through the first 9 months, our SG&A dollars are roughly flat with the same period of 2019, and that's probably how we'll finish this year. 
If we look at operating profit in the same way on Slide #15, we find that in dollars, our operating profit in this year's quarter 3 was not only higher than it was in last year's quarter 3, but also higher than what it was in quarter 3 2019. Again, this focus on dollar profit is important as we manage through this challenging environment. 
Now we do think that quarter 4 will be a little different. Contrary to our prior assumptions, we are seeing no moderation of the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages here in the fourth quarter. In fact, we are now experiencing incremental disruption and costs, further compounded by a labor strike. So for quarter 4, we are forecasting gross profit dollars and operating profit dollars to be below quarter 4 of 2019, even if both metrics finish the full year above 2019 levels. 
Moving down the P&L, let's turn to Slide #16. While operating profit drove most of our growth in earnings per share in quarter 3, we also benefited from modest net favorability in below-the-line items. In quarter 3, interest expense decreased on lower debt, which will continue to be a year-on-year driver in quarter 4, with quarter 4 comparison also lapping the $20 million debt redemption cost we recorded last year. This decrease in interest expense was more than offset by a decline in other income, which compared against an unusually high level last year. 
We expect quarter 4 other income to be similar to that of quarter 3. Our effective tax rate in quarter 3 came in lower than last year. We believe quarter 4 rate will come in higher than the 22% rate we are now forecasting for the full year. 
JV earnings and minority interest together were favorable to last year, though this mostly reflects the consolidation of a couple of our smaller investment phase joint ventures in West Africa into operating profit. And average shares outstanding decreased year-on-year, reflecting the impact of quarter 1 buybacks. We still expect full year average shares outstanding to be around 0.5% lower than 2020. 
Outside of the currency-neutral EPS that we manage and guide to, we did experience continued year-on-year favorability, though modest from foreign currency translation. Based on where exchange rates are today and what we are lapping, there would be little to no benefit from foreign currency translation in quarter 4. 
Let's now discuss our cash flow and balance sheet shown on Slide #17. Year-to-date, our cash flow remains below last year's unusually high level as expected, mostly as we lap last year's timing-related increases in various accruals during the height of the pandemic. The more relevant comparisons, therefore, are the year-to-date periods of 2019 and 2018. As you can see from the slide, this year's cash flow continues to track well above those pre-COVID time periods. This is driven by higher operating profit as well as reduced restructuring outlays and continued effective management of core working capital. 
Meanwhile, our balance sheet remains solid. Net debt remains roughly even with last year, and lower than each of the prior 2 years, even despite this year's increase in cash returned to shareowners in the form of resumed share buybacks and increased dividends. So our financial condition remains quite strong. 
Slide #18 shows where our results stand after the first 9 months of 2021. Obviously, we've had a good year so far producing strong and balanced financial results on a 2-year basis and staying ahead of our own internal focus. This year-to-date performance is all the more impressive when you consider just how challenging the business environment has been. 
Let's now turn to our updated guidance for the full year 2021, as shown on Slide #19. Given the better-than-expected momentum we are seeing in our international regions, we are raising our guidance for organic net sales growth to a rate of 2% to 3%. This is a solid performance, particularly given the comparisons against last year's pandemic-related surge. 
At the same time, we are reaffirming our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit and earnings per share as well as for cash flow. While net sales are coming in higher than previously expected, we are incorporating costs and disruptions related to the current supply and labor conditions. In fact, given this current environment, we will likely land towards the lower end of the guidance ranges for these metrics. 
Our guidance assumes a reasonable conclusion to the current labor stoppage at our U.S. cereal plant. However, as you can appreciate, there is always uncertainty regarding labor negotiations. In the meantime, we will continue to execute our contingency plans to mitigate disruption. Overall, despite an incredibly challenging operating environment, we remain in strong financial condition and our full year results are expected to sustain balanced financial delivery on a 2-year basis. 
And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses."
283356,704542740,2425267,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Amit.

Slide #21 shows the 2-year compound annual growth rates in net sales across our 4 regions. It's in North America, where we've had the most supply disruption and most significantly in cereal. This has restrained our overall growth in quarter 2 and quarter 3 this year. But as we'll see in a minute, our snacks continue to grow nicely year-on-year, and frozen breakfast and plant-based foods have continued to post good growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
Europe sustained impressive growth in quarter 3. Pringles has driven exceptional growth for us in snacks, and cereal sales have remained strong there as well. In our Latin America and AMEA regions, we are clearly demonstrating exceptional momentum, collectively sustaining double-digit growth on a 2-year and 1-year basis in the third quarter. 
In fact, if you turn to Slide #22, you can see that this emerging markets growth is anything but new. Collectively, our emerging markets had already been growing consistently at or above our long-term target of mid-single-digit growth for these businesses. This year, we've seen double-digit growth. Elasticities to our cost-related price increases have run lower than historical levels. We have continued to expand Pringles across these markets, with especially strong growth in Russia and Brazil. We have also continued to grow cereal across our emerging markets with particular strength this year in Asia. And our growth in Africa this year has been nothing short of spectacular, driven by noodles, cereal and snacks. 
Equally important to our long-term prospects is the health of our big world-class brands. And in quarter 3, their momentum was sustained as much in developed markets as in emerging markets. Slide #23 shows the 2-year CAGRs for consumption growth for Pringles in the U.S. This brand continued to gain share in the third quarter, propelled by incremental innovation, effective brand-building campaigns and strength in multipacks. 
And Slide #24 shows that Pringles momentum is truly global. Similar to the U.S., the brand's strong growth and share performance is being driven by incremental innovation like the Sizzl'n platform in Europe or local flavors like seaweed in Asia and by very effective brand building, particularly its 360-degree campaigns around soccer and electronic gaming. On top of that, it continues to gain distribution, particularly in emerging markets. So this $2 billion global retail sales brand continues to perform well. 
Let's check in on another world-class brand, Cheez-It, shown on Slide #25. In the U.S., this brand continued to grow consumption and gained share in the third quarter, sparked by strong brand-building activity and growth in multipacks. Meantime, it continues to gain distribution and share in its newly launched markets, Canada and Brazil. This is a $1 billion plus brand that continues its long track record of consistent growth. 
Pop-Tarts is another world-class brand that is performing well. Its 2-year growth has well outpaced the portable wholesome snacks category, as shown on Slide #26. Another big brand with over $750 million sales at retail in the U.S. alone, it's showing good momentum. To give you an idea of how relevant this brand is, our latest ad has generated nearly 40 million views on YouTube. Our What Would Pop-Tarts Do hashtag has shown up 5.7 billion times in TikTok and the brand has enjoyed more than 2 billion earned impressions this year. 
And big growth has continued for us on Rice Krispies Treats, shown on Slide #27. This brand even accelerated its consumption growth and share gains during the third quarter, aided by effective brand building and the success of innovation like Homestyle treats. This brand generates close to $350 million in retail sales in the U.S., and it continues to grow. 
In cereal, the performance of key brands in the U.S. has been impacted by supply complications in North America, but internationally, we're seeing good growth. On Slide #28, our 2 world-class brands in Europe are worth highlighting. Tresor, also known as Krave in some markets is a taste segment brand that has become the #1 cereal brand in Europe and has dramatically outpaced the category this year in key markets like France and Germany. 
Extra, meanwhile, is geared more towards adults and it, too, has strongly outpaced the category this year in markets like Italy and Spain. Over in the frozen aisle, Eggo is clearly a world-class brand and it is performing well. Slide #29 shows that it is sustaining solid mid-single-digit consumption growth in spite of capacity constraints. Yet another big brand with close to $900 million in retail sales in the U.S., continuing to grow. 
Morningstar Farms, our leading plant-based proteins brand, is shown on Slide #30. This is another world-class brand that is sustaining strong consumption growth even as the category decelerates as expected and even as we run up against capacity limits in some of our product segments. This is a $400 million retail sales brand with momentum and strong prospects. In fact, as you've seen, the fundamentals, momentum and growth prospects for many of our biggest world-class brands remain solid. 
Now let's review each of our regions, starting with North America in Slide #31. Net sales were flat year-on-year in the third quarter, with underlying consumption growth well exceeding our shipments due to supply constraints. Many of these constraints were economy-wide, including shortages of materials, labor and freight. But we had some internal challenges as well. As you know, we entered this year tight on capacity for growing food formats in cereal, frozen from the griddle and plant-based protein as well as certain pack formats and snacks. Add to that, the fire that interrupted production at one of our cereal plants and you can appreciate just how constrained we have been. 
The good news is that we remain in growth on a 2-year CAGR basis and that our revenue growth management actions are resulting in good price/mix growth. This price realization, along with good execution of productivity programs is crucial for mitigating the margin pressures of high cost inflation and incremental costs and inefficiencies related to the broader bottlenecks and shortages in the economy. 
Slide #32 breaks our North America net sales growth into category groups. You can see the good momentum we've seen in snacks and frozen despite these supply constraints and the fact that away-from-home sales remain lower on a 2-year basis. Cereal net sales have been flattish on a 2-year CAGR basis in the first half, roughly in line with the U.S. category's performance. In quarter 3, however, it faced the worst of its supply challenges and is now down about 1% year-to-date on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
Importantly, our underlying consumption trends remain solid across most of the portfolio, as shown on Slide #33. In all 3 of our snacks categories, we saw an acceleration in 2-year CAGRs in quarter 3, continuing to well outpace their individual categories. 
In the frozen-from-the-griddle category, we also saw accelerated 2-year growth during the third quarter. And in frozen veg vegan, even as the category decelerates as expected, our growth remains strong. Even in cereal, which is a category that has been flat on a 2-year basis this year, we are holding consumption relatively flat despite all the supply challenges we've been facing. 
And before we move on from our discussion of North America, we should touch on our U.S. away-from-home business in Slide #34. The slide shows rolling 2-year average growth rates in our net sales over the past few quarters in these channels. As restrictions eased and consumer mobility increased, we saw year-on-year growth starting in quarter 2 and continuing in quarter 3. Our sales remained below 2019 levels but you can see that a gradual recovery continues. 
The recovery has been a little quicker in channels like convenience stores and schools, and much slower in channels like vending and in travel and lodging. There is no question that our North America region is facing the toughest of the global supply challenges, and the team has risen to the occasion. We are presently working to restore full production at our fire-damaged cereal plant, while negotiating with the union regarding its strike against all of our U.S. cereal plants. Indeed, North America faces an even tougher quarter in the quarter 4. Nonetheless, we're executing well in market, and our brands are in great shape.  
Now let's turn to our international regions in Slide #35. You can see that in each of these 3 regions, we are sustaining strong momentum, both in the form of year-on-year growth and on a 2-year CAGR basis, which eliminates the impact of comparing against last year's surge, especially in Latin America. Let's look at each of these regions a little more closely. 
Slide #36 shows the results of Kellogg Europe. Europe's streak of quarterly organic net sales growth continued in impressive fashion in the third quarter. Driven by both volume and price mix, this growth was led by Russia and the U.K. but broad-based across the region. Double-digit growth in snacks was driven not only by Pringles sustaining its momentum, but also by a rebound in portable wholesome snacks. Cereal sales grew on top of last year's growth, and we are particularly pleased with the magnitude of our share gains in the U.K. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we lap a particularly strong organic net sales growth performance. And on operating profit, we are managing through high costs and supply challenges as well as lapping a 53rd week. Nevertheless, we expect to sustain our in-market momentum in cereal and snacks, and Europe is on track for another strong year. 
Now let's talk about Latin America in Slide #37. The year ago quarter included outsized gains in sales and profit, so comparisons are masking a solid performance for us in the third quarter. Organic net sales continued to grow year-on-year despite the comparisons, with notable strength on a 2-year CAGR basis. The growth was broad-based and supported by strong in-market performance in cereal led by Mexico, as well as by Pringles across key markets. 
We saw particular strength in Brazil, where Pringles is showing outstanding momentum. Despite decelerating at-home demand trends and extremely high cost inflation, we expect Latin America to continue to grow in quarter 4, completing what has been a very strong year. 
And we'll finish our business review with AMEA and Slide #38. Once again, we saw exceptional growth in this region. We generated organic net sales growth in Australia, led by cereal, and in Asia, driven by both cereal and snacks, despite COVID-related production restrictions on Pringles for much of the quarter. The biggest start in the quarter was Africa, where we are generating double-digit growth in both volume and in price/mix. The top line growth was strong enough to overcome double-digit cost inflation, delivering operating profit growth. 
As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued top line momentum and bottom line growth in AMEA despite cost inflation and supply challenges. 
Allow me to wrap up with a brief summary on Slide #40. Our portfolio is in good shape. Our world-class brands have great momentum and our emerging markets businesses continue to exceed even our expectations. The result is strong top line momentum. We're taking action to mitigate the profit impact of what is the highest cost inflation we've seen in a decade or more. To do that, we are executing productivity initiatives. We are being disciplined on overhead and selective on brand investment, and we are carefully executing all levers of revenue growth management. 
Bottlenecks and shortages are ramping across the economy right now, and we are experiencing our own particular labor and supply disruptions. However, we are managing well through these difficult supply conditions. Our people are demonstrating why they are a competitive advantage, going the extra mile to supply the market when everything, procurement, manufacturing, shipping is more challenging now than ever. 
And in the end, we expect to remain on our path of balanced financial growth. We've delivered on it so far this year, and we are reaffirming our full year guidance today even in spite of the current operating environment. I want to commend and thank our entire organization for their dedication and grit, and for finding a way to deliver on our commitments in what is obviously an unusual environment. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have."

Our fill rates and our customer service levels are not where we want them to be. And we're not alone in that either, but we hold ourselves to a very high standard, and we aim to get better and better. And so let me point out a couple of things around your question. 
We have one particular area that is more challenging than others, and that's our cereal business, and that's obviously being compounded because of the strike that we're going through right now. But outside of that, which is -- that's 20% of our global business. Outside of that, we're in the same boat as everybody else. And you can see based on the type of performance outside of cereal in the United States, we have posted some very, very strong gains. So we don't believe there's going to be anything structural to our disadvantage as we continue to make our way through the pandemic, through the supply gridlock into a more normalized environment. 
So -- and we've got mitigation plans based on where we are with our current cereal plants in the U.S. as well. So by no means are we complacent. We've got big challenges in front of us. But we're quite confident that we're not going to be at a long term or any kind of permanent disadvantage. This is a transitory event, and we'll work our way through it."

And so out of respect for that process, I'm not going to get into a lot of detail, which I'm sure you can appreciate. But we have always treated our employees with respect and fairness, and that includes industry-leading compensation and benefits. The offer that we have in front of the union right now is increased compensation on top of that already industry-leading compensation and benefits, and we are not asking to take anything away despite what you may have heard publicly. 
So we think a fair resolution should be in the offing. We think that this type of offer is fair, reasonable and again, increases on top of industry-leading compensation already. So this would allow our employees to get back to work. We want them back to work. I think they want to be back to work.

Overall, I would say that we're expecting inflation to be in the high single digits like it was in quarter 3, similar levels, slightly higher in quarter 4. And then, of course, compounded by the strike, right, and the disruptions as a result of that. So that's the outlook on gross margins from a quarter 4 standpoint. And I think as I mentioned in our prepared -- in my prepared remarks, from an absolute dollar standpoint, we expect it to be higher for the full year versus 2019 levels.

I'm just trying to get a sense of how to parse that out as we think about the headwinds there. Any help you can give would be great."

We've taken what we think is a very reasonable view of getting to an agreement. We've also taken into account the contingency plans that we have in effect. We knew -- we've been talking for a year now because we had a year extension. We knew the contract was expiring on October 5. So we took all sorts of measures to prepare ourselves, including building inventory. 
Building inventory was a little bit challenged because of the fire in Memphis. But we also have deployed our white collar workers. We've deployed outside labor to keep the plants running, to get the plants running. They're gaining productivity each and every day. We've also leveraged our global supply chain network for cereal to also mitigate. And so we're working very, very hard on 2 fronts, to mitigate the effects of the strike on the one hand, and we're doing that successfully and getting better every day; but also, to get our workers back to work. We want them to get their paychecks. We want them to enjoy their health care. We truly want them back to work. And we think we've got a very, very good proposal, again, with increases on top of already industry-leading compensation. 
So I think reasonable heads should prevail based on all that. And that's kind of the view that we're taking. We want to get to a negotiated settlement, get back to work, and we think we've given the best guidance that we can based on all those different factors."

I think as we expected and as we had previously communicated, inflation came in at high single-digit rates in quarter 3. It accelerated through the quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect it to further accelerate into quarter 4 as well. And we kind of look at it in 2 buckets. There's the market-driven costs in commodities like oil, dairy, ingredients like rice, potatoes and packaging. And actually, packaging was the one where we saw significant acceleration in quarter 3. 
So that's -- we're seeing inflation fairly broad-based, I'd say, across our commodities. And then of course, the operating environment continues to be challenged, whether it's freight markets, whether it's ocean freight, whether it's labor shortages as well as shortages across our suppliers and our supply chain. So that's -- and I would expect a similar outlook for quarter 4 with slightly higher -- still in the high single-digit rates, but slightly higher levels of inflation into quarter 4. 
And I think from a pricing standpoint and from a revenue growth management standpoint, we're obviously taking action. And broadly, I'd say, covering our commodity-related costs and our direct costs, I think some of the disruptions are hard to predict. And so that's kind of the color on inflation."

So there's clearly some uniqueness. 
But I think one thing that we are definitely looking towards is how we continue to grow. Because despite this, we've had lots of, I wouldn't call it pockets, we've got real growth happening in most of our business that is very resilient, robust and sustainable. But the future of work is clearly going to change, and our capital plans over the next couple of years will reflect that. 
When I say the future of work, the obvious -- what happens in office environments, where work gets done, how work gets done. But then also from a capacity standpoint and how factories run and where work gets done there, where product gets made, to allow ourselves even more resiliency going forward is clearly something that is on the cards for us."

In terms of Europe, I mean, the Europe team continues to deliver at a very high level. And if you look at the U.K. and Russia performance, we highlighted that. And if you look at it across Pringles and cereal and now wholesome snacks has bounced back, as we said as well. And so it's really just high levels of execution, lapping a very strong performance last year and continued demand creation activities that have been very, very successful. 
In terms of the disruptions, there clearly are disruptions. They're not quite as acute as they are in the United States, but they're real. There's friction also that has to do with Brexit. When you think about supply chain that is on Continental Europe as well as the U.K., we're working our way through that. You're seeing good results despite that.

In some of the developing markets, you've seen us enter Brazil and other emerging markets quite successfully, and we put a couple of lines in our Brazilian plant for Pringles as well. The Malaysia plant has been running strong for us, and that provides good growth opportunities across Asia. 
So we think -- I'm not going to predict how big it can get, but it keeps getting bigger, for sure, and generating very solid growth for us. The other thing I'd mention where we have a lot of opportunity from snacks and expanding distribution is Cheez-It, which doesn't have the same footprint as Pringles, not even close.
