Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. Hoping you and your families have remained safe as we get closer to turning the corner on this horrible pandemic.
The Bio-Techne team delivered another strong quarter, accelerating our organic growth year-over-year to 19%, building on the strength we experienced last quarter. In fact, our 19% organic growth rate represents the strongest performance since I joined the company in 2013. This growth was broad-based across our segments and geographies as our penetration in biopharma continue to be red hot, and even academia returned to double-digit growth. The new normal of social distancing and staggered shifts has become an accelerant for the continued adoption of several of our technologies, namely Simple Plex and Simple Western. I will dive into the specifics of each of these platforms later, but they are all gaining traction and remain in the early innings of penetrating their large respective markets. We delivered this record organic growth with a continued focus on profitability, as our adjusted operating margin improved 530 basis points year-over-year to 38.7%. Some of this improvement reflects the timing of hiring and investments to drive future growth, but shows the leverage and profitability inherent in our business model.
The COVID pandemic continues to impact traditional ways researchers are staffing labs and conducting experiments as well as the ways we are interacting with these customers, but I'm encouraged with the innovative solutions researchers have leveraged to push science further and the innovative strategies our commercial teams have implemented to meet their evolving needs in these challenging times. Academia, in particular, is getting better at managing through the COVID-related restrictions. And we are encouraged with the sequential improvement we experienced in this end market. While we experienced robust growth with both biopharma and academia customers in Q2, both of these end markets remain largely close to outside visitors, creating challenges for our commercial team to get in front of customers. Our commercial team once again did an excellent job adjusting to this new normal, leveraging webinars to educate current and potential customers on our portfolio of reagents, cell and gene therapy solutions, tissue biopsy and spatial analysis solutions and instruments.
During the quarter, our team got even more creative, using virtual coffees and happy hours to get increased face time with our customers. These virtual meetings and webinars will remain an important and cost-effective part of our commercial strategy for the remainder of the pandemic and beyond. Our digital marketing initiatives remain an important tool to differentiating Bio-Techne, educate the scientific community on our portfolio of innovative and productivity-enabling tools, drive traffic to our website and ultimately convert this traffic to revenue. These digital efforts have become an increasingly more effective tool during the COVID pandemic, and we continue to execute this strategy at a high level in Q2.
Researchers often begin their quest for reagents and research productivity tools with an internet search, so ensuring Bio-Techne is one of the top results of these searches is critical to drive traffic to our website, convert these visits to sales of our products. Leveraging search engine optimization and targeted ad strategies remain a key component of our digital strategy and both continue to generate high returns on investment, with an outsized impact on sales within our antibody and protein portfolio. Last quarter, we announced the launch of OneWeb, a new website that unites all of Bio-Techne's brands under 1 easy-to-navigate site, enabling our customers to order products across our instrument and reagent portfolio and 1 website while leveraging algorithms to drive purchases across our portfolio and position the business to realize increased revenue synergies. We began a scaled launch of OneWeb in November, and initial customer feedback as well as traffic to our website has been positive.
OneWeb, paired with our SEO and targeted ad efforts drove double-digit growth this quarter in a number of sessions, page views, new users and repeat users on our website. Given the correlation of our revenue growth this quarter, our strategy is clearly generating results, and we will continue to pull this growth lever going forward.
Now let's discuss performance of our growth platforms, starting with Protein Sciences segment, which grew 19% organically for the quarter. Growth is strong across our core reagent portfolio, with both RUO proteins and antibodies growing low-double digits. In addition to the impact of academic labs reopening in our digital initiatives, our reagent business also experienced a favorable tailwind from custom work for biopharma customers in need of additional protein or antibody capacity. Our customer reagent development business increased over 60% in the quarter, and we are leveraging multiple strategies to capitalize on this outsourcing trend going forward.
During Q2, we continued to push our cell and gene therapy initiatives forward. One of the key components within our cell and gene therapy business is GMP proteins, with these cytokines and growth factors playing a critical role in a cell and gene therapy workflow. Revenue generated from our portfolio of GMP proteins once again increased nearly 100% in Q2. Recall that we recently opened a 61,000-square foot state of the art GMP reagent manufacturing facility to address the expected demand for GMP proteins and reagents as a growing pipeline of cell and gene therapeutics progress through the regulatory approval process. We made significant progress qualifying the facility and have begun manufacturing production lots of select GMP proteins. We also executed our second long-term GMP protein supply agreement in the quarter. We remain in various stages of discussion with several other biotech companies with pipeline cell and gene therapies for future potential long-term GMP protein supply agreements and are very pleased with the funnel of potential deals.
Sticking with cell and gene therapy, our genome engineering services business, which includes our nonviral vector-based gene transfer technology, TcBuster, continue to gain attention from the cell and gene therapy industry. I would also note that we are seeing a growing list of collaborators and positive feedback on Cloudz, our nonmagnetic feed-based cell separation technology for human T cell, natural killer cells and human regulatory T cell, Treg, activation and expansion kits. We are still in the early innings of both TcBuster and Cloudz, but both of these innovative cell and gene therapy workflow technologies remain important pieces of our cell and gene therapy workflow solutions.
Scale Ready, our JV with Fresenius Kabi and Wilson Wolf form launched at the beginning of calendar 2021, with the mission of providing the most simple, scalable and versatile cell and gene therapy manufacturing platform in the industry. As a reminder, this consortium pairs Bio-Techne's portfolio of LNG therapy workflow solutions, including our Cloudz self separation and activation technology, GMP proteins and genome engineering services with Fresenius Kabi's leukapheresis instrument and Wilson Wolf bioreactor to enable a modular cost-efficient workflow solution. The Scale Ready website is up and running, and the commercial team began its initial customer outreach campaign, including initial contact to over 600 industry participants and almost 250 genes in therapies companies.
Also during Q2, Bio-Techne made an initial strategic investment in Changzhou Eminence Biotechnology Company, a China-based life science company with best-in-class media, including CHO cells and other serum-free media products as well as custom cell line and media formulation development services. Eminence will use the financing proceeds to expand its manufacturing capacity and increase the service capabilities of its China headquarter GMP media production facility. Investing in Eminence expands Bio-Techne's foothold and providing additional products and services to support the needs of the rapidly growing Chinese biopharmaceutical industry and fits extremely well with our existing high-growth product portfolio in China. We look forward to working with the Eminence team.
Now let's discuss our proteomic analytical tools portion of the Protein Sciences segment, where the strong momentum we saw in Q1 continued with our portfolio of instruments and assays, enabling research labs to increase productivity while adhering to social distancing and staggered work shift protocols. Once again, we experienced very strong growth in our Simple Plex, Multiplex and ELISA instrument, Ella. Our revenue almost doubled year-over-year. Encouragingly, Simple Plex utilization within our customer base continues to diversify as researchers leveraged Ella to investigate inflammation, cancer, neuroscience and other disease states and biological pathways. Ella's relatively small footprint, low price point, sub-picogram level sensitivity and reproducibility is driving both instrument placements and consumable pull through. Our clinical program with micropoint in China is on track, which speaks to the incredible diversity Ella capable of. We are now taking Ella through a 510(k) process in the U.S., which will unlock new clinical opportunities for this amazing platform.
It was a similar story with our automated western instrument portfolio, where we grew almost 30% in the quarter. Our GES and West-automated western platforms turned the labor-intensive, messy, inconsistent, cumbersome, manual western blood process, which can take up the 2 days, into a fully-automated, reproducible, sample-to-answer 3-hour process. This value proposition has been resonating incredibly well with researchers as they return to the bench. And with our solutions, less than 15% penetrated in the addressable market, there is plenty of room for continued growth.
Our biologics instruments, which provide protein purity information and are used directly in bioprocessing, also had a standout quarter as we experienced broad demand from biopharma, including several companies with COVID-19 vaccines in various stages of development or commercialization as well as continued interest from companies working on cell and gene therapies.
Now I'll provide an update on our diagnostics and genomics portfolio, where organic growth revenue also increased 19% in Q2. Let's start with an update on our ACD or tissue pathology franchise, where organic revenue increased in the upper 20% range for the quarter. This growth was broad-based across geographies and product lines, including very strong performances from microRNAscope scope following its launch this past summer as well as RNAscope. Momentum we experienced in RNAscope last quarter continued in Q2 as a single cell facial resolution and high sensitivity provided by this technology continues to drive market adoption. Biopharma's need for increased productivity while working with limited or staggered shift remains a tailwind for our PAS, or pharma assay services business, within ACD. Our biopharma outsourcing the spatial genomic analysis has drove over 40% growth in this business in the first half of fiscal year '21.
Now let's discuss our Exosome Diagnostics business, starting with our prostate cancer liquid biopsy assay, the ExoDx prostate test. Encouragingly, we believe most of the urology practices across the country have reopened, and we experienced another sequential increase in our prostate test volume, but patient traffic is still down from last year as older patients are more likely to quarantine at home until they become vaccinated. We expect urology practice traffic to continue to improve as vaccines make their way into the segment of the population, which in turn should have a positive impact on our ExoDx prostate testing volumes. In the meantime, our home kit version of the test continues to be the safest solution for patients to continue to work with their radiologists. Recall that we partnered with baseball hall-of-famer, Carl Rick, Jr. to co-promote our ExoDx prostate test following its personal prostate cancer journey, including his use of the ExoDx prostate test, which ultimately influences potentially life-saving decision to get the biopsy that led the discovery of its aggressive prostate cancer. The marketing campaign continues to be successfully leveraged across all social media platforms and channels and is driving traffic to the fight like CAL page on the ExoDx website, where we saw page visits increase over 1,400% sequentially.
We also launched a physician locator function on the ExoDx website, enabling patients interested in taking a test to find physicians offering a test in their respective city. Our Exosome Diagnostics platform is not just limited to our ExoDx prostate test, there is a full pipeline of high-value diagnostic tests with our ExoTrue kidney transplant rejection assay next in line for commercialization. We expect ExoTrue to become an important tool in the management of kidney transplant patients, where it's easy to collect urine-based sampling -- sample, enabling increased adherence to testing protocols. We complete a verification of the assay and have optimized the workflow. Initial ExoTrue data has been accepted for publication in a well-respected medical journal, and we anticipate publication in the coming weeks.
Despite generally soft non-COVID-related diagnostic testing volumes, our diagnostic reagents division once again delivered a solid quarter, with organic revenue increasing in the upper single digits. This is actually the sixth quarter in a row that our diagnostic reagents division has delivered positive growth. As a development pipeline and to a lesser extent, COVID-related opportunities continue to bear fruit and smooth out the impact of what can sometimes be a lumpy bulk reagent order.
I'd like to now give an update on our COVID-19 initiatives. The products we sell are directly related to COVID Research. For example, reagents and instruments with specific viral research applications, ACD probes to detect the virus within tissue and sales of bulk diagnostic reagent used in COVID testing applications was an estimated 3% tailwind to our business in Q2. We expect that research and COVID will be around for many years, thus making this tailwind a sustaining new layer of our product portfolio going forward.
We continue to make progress with the commercialization of the COVID-19 serology assay that we co-developed with Cantaro Biosciences based on Mount Sinise technology. The Cantaro serology assay is a truly differentiated test, providing not only information on the presence of COVID-19 antibodies, but also the level of titer of those antibodies. In November, the Cantaro COVID seroclear assay received EUA approval as a semi-quantitative assay, and we have submitted additional data to the FDA supporting a full quantitative claim as we receive in Europe with a CE mark. We have commercial agreements now set up in many countries and are in discussions with many U.S.-based lab systems. To date, most of the demand for COVID-19 testing has been PCR-based, geared towards answering the question, ""Am I infected with COVID 19?"" I now that vaccines are becoming available while the virus continues to mutate, we believe demand for serology testing will increase as patients look to answer the question, ""Am I immune?"" Ultimately, following a full FDA quantitative claim, we believe the Cantaro assay will be able to answer this important question, allowing us to return to the pre-COVID lifestyle we are all looking forward to.
Our Q2 is evidence of the growth we are starting to unlock with our portfolio of proteomic analytical instruments, tissue pathology and spatial genomics products, cell and gene therapy workflow solutions and liquid biopsy diagnostics. These large high-growth end markets remain underpenetrated, and we're in the early innings of realizing the full potential of these growth technologies and platforms. A layer on to these, the content and cross-divisional synergies inherent in our core reagent portfolio, and I'm increasingly confident in our ability to deliver our long-term revenue and profitability targets. I'm extremely proud of the execution the Bio-Techne team delivered during the first half of our fiscal 2021, and we're looking forward to building on this success in the second half of 2021 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jim."

I will provide an overview of our Q2 fiscal '21 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional color on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of our fiscal 2021.Starting with",1245,"Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q2 fiscal '21 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional color on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of our fiscal 2021.
Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $1.62 versus $1.08 1 year ago, an increase of 50% over last year, representing a new company record. Foreign exchange positively impacted EPS by $0.08. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.15 compared to $3.02 in the prior year, representing a 62% decrease. Our GAAP EPS results in the second quarter of last year benefited from a favorable realized and unrealized gain on our investment in Chemocentryx. Q2 revenue was $224.3 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year on a reported basis and 19% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 2% impact on our revenue. Our strong growth in Q2 was fairly consistent across the globe, ranging from the high-teens in the U.S. to 25% organic growth in China. By end market, biopharma growth was very strong at over 20%, and it was nice to see academia continued to improve, growing the low teens during the second quarter.
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 71.5% in the quarter compared to 70.6% I the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable volume leverage. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 25.2% of revenue, a 310 basis point decrease compared to the prior year, and R&D expense in Q2 was 7.5% of revenue, 140 basis points lower than the prior year. While our adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increased sequentially and compared to the prior year, a tight labor market in the life science space did not allow us to fill all headcount additions to the team at the pace we'd originally anticipated. Given the continued improvement we are seeing in our end markets, we still plan to fill these positions and continue with investments that position the company for growth going forward. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 38.7%, an increase of 530 basis points from the prior year period and a 50 basis point sequential improvement from Q1.
Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was $3.4 million, decreasing $1.1 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt during fiscal '21 as well as lower floating interest rates. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q2 stood at $231.5 million. Other adjusted nonoperating expense was $1.3 million for the quarter compared to $2.5 million expense in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income includes unrealized gains from our investment in ChemoCentryx.
Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 20.6%, a 120 basis point improvement over the prior year, with the improvement primarily driven by geographic mix. We expect our effective tax rate going forward to be consistent with Q2, barring no changes in corporate tax law. As Chuck mentioned, during Q2, we made a strategic equity investment in China-based Eminence, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services to the Chinese biopharmaceutical market. The $130,000 noncontrolling interest line item reflects 1 month loss from a portion of Eminence we did not own. The impact to other lines of the P&L as a result of consolidating Eminence was immaterial in Q2.
Turning to cash flow and return of capital, a record $89.3 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter. In Q2, our net investment in capital expenditures was $11.4 million, primarily driven by the completion of our new GMP protein factory. And during Q2, we returned capital to shareholders with $12.4 million of dividends. We finished the quarter with 40.3 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet remains very strong, with $283 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments and a total leverage ratio of well under 1x EBITDA.
Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q2 reported sales were $172.2 million, with reported revenue increasing 22%. Organic growth increased 19%, with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 3% on revenue growth. Within the segment, the strong growth was very broad-based, with double-digit growth in nearly all reagent, assay and instrument platforms. As Chuck described in his remarks, platforms of notable mention includes Simple Plex, Simple Western, biologics and cell and gene therapy, especially pertaining to GMP proteins. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 46.6%, an increase of 360 basis points year-over-year, due primarily to favorable volume leverage and cost management.
Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q2 reported sales were $52.5 million, with reported revenue increasing 20%. Organic growth for the segment was 19%, with foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. Similar to Q1, our Genomics division led this segment in the quarter. We experienced strength across the entire ACD branded portfolio, with microRNAscope, BaseScope and our diagnostics partnership with LICA being honorable will mention. Also a driver of growth for Diagnostics and Genomics Exosome Diagnostics Q2 revenue increased over 100% from last year, with higher collections from Medicare, private payers and patient cash collect driving the year-over-year increase. As Chuck mentioned, our diagnostic reagents division continued its growth streak by executing on COVID-related opportunities, offset the headwind many of its traditional OEM diagnostic customers are facing with patients for going routine visits to the doctor.
Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 15.5%, the segment's operating margin improved from 2.2% reported in the prior year. The increase reflects favorable volume leverage in our Genomics division, less dilution from Exosome Diagnostics as well as strong cost management.
In summary, our fiscal 2021 is off to a great start. With 15% organic revenue growth during the first half of the fiscal year, our results thus far have demonstrated that our portfolio of products and solution offerings are more relevant than ever to our customers who are on the front lines of diagnosing and developing cures for disease. We believe that the current pandemic has only strengthened the resolve of our customers to accelerate their great work, and we will continue to do everything in our power to provide them the tools to help them succeed. Thus, we see the current momentum of our business continuing in the back half of our fiscal year. However, to support our customers' needs beyond the remainder of this fiscal year, we need to catch up on our investments in our product pipeline and post-sales service and support while continuing to invest in customer engagement activities, especially those of a digital nature. We started to make progress with these additional investments in Q2, but intend to accelerate back to our plan in the back half of the year. If successful, these investments may slightly lower our operating margin from its level in the first half of the fiscal year, but will position us well for our long-term strategic plan of continued double-digit growth for years to come.
That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions."

Well, we're not going to give too much real in the weeds detail on it. We've been talking about growing 100%. And we've talked in the past of being a $30 million type portfolio, with most of it being serum right now, and we're running pretty much a run rate on proteins at $10 million, and we gave you the growth rates in there. We have the ability to increase capacity -- to increase, I guess, what we make here at the headquarters by a factor of 4, if we need to. So we're good while we take the time to qualify the new site, which is going along really well. Again, we've talked in the past about this $10 million in GMP proteins growing to maybe $20 million next year and doubling in after that. And then hopefully, it really starts ramping once we start getting the production side of the therapeutics as they come out of the back end the clinicals.
The rest of the portfolio, it's kind of hard to say we had a great quarter for both acceptance for both Cloudz and for TcBuster we talked about. We're getting an awful lot of new revenue to get a look at these technologies and do preclinicals with, so we're pretty excited. The team is pretty excited. The best quarter we've already had for TcBuster. We're actually working on expanding the site already or we're making it, so it's a bit of surprise so fast. So it's kind of hard, pine to tell you what it's going to be next year, but I think probably double what is this year and probably double again next year after that. And as we've said in our 5-year outlook here in our $1.5 billion goal, we see a $300 million business is what we see. So it will be consisting of a bunch of components, $150 million or so, at least in GMP proteins, but the rest sort of between clouds TcBuster, instrumentation, ACD for technologies for spatial cell analysis, Ella testing for QC testing and the workflow, all these bits and pieces roll up to $300 million. And we're probably a year away from getting any more -- doing a real detailed guesses in just what the recipes look like. I think the safest one is the GMP protein piece right now."

And what are the other key initiatives that you have in, including the 510(k) approval that you're submitting for? And in that same context, if you could just help us understand, I mean, there's quite a bit of momentum right now in proteomics. Obviously, Bio-Techne is core to proteomics. You are one of the leaders across the board in antibodies, protein cytokines and broadly across proteomics. So maybe just help us understand where that could -- where this business could be, the Protein Sciences business overall and the proteomics business could be overall and sort of longer-term and 5-year time frame?"

Clearly, we're super well-positioned in proteomics. And as the wave of research hits and this golden era keeps growing and money has siphoned off these stimulus plans for more pandemic relief pandemic research, so it never happens again, we're going to be a big beneficiary. We're seeing -- we're really seeing a lift in every part of our business in every geography. It is just astounding. Nothing I've ever seen a more green dashboard in my career. It's hard to pin down what's COVID and what's just research. Now we've dug into what's going on with our customers, and there's certainly bigger biopharma are investing more. They're taking the cash there. The ones -- the vaccine makers are obviously doing more. Companies that are doing well off COVID are taking that cash and doing more R&D. And whether it's more R&D and more research, we're benefiting.
I've always said that Simple Plex was a sleeper, right, and I had for a few years now. And if it keeps growing at a near 100%, it's going to be really big really soon. So we've now -- we're now well over 500 instruments placed worldwide, which is a lot. This is an amazing machine, and it just does a lot for what -- for the money. It's just an amazing piece of technology from an amazing team that has worked on it for many years before we acquired the company. I think that was seen by Micropoint early on in China, and we're on track with their clinical. And this could be -- that deal alone could be $100 million of revenue in 3, 4 years if they hit their targets. This is a guy that did Mindray, so he has a lot of credibility. He is very interested in making a very standardized patient monitoring platform for large hospital systems in China, and there's a lot of them. We are taking through the 510(k) process here in the U.S. so we can try to list more interest like Micropoint in China. Micropoint is going to do all the CFDA themselves. They're experts. They're doing the panels. They're doing everything.
Here, I don't know. We were probably not so to do all that ourselves. We'll do the 510(k). We're going to do it off a standard analyte, something well-known so when we get to the system. And then we are talking to potential interested parties, but this thing has -- it's got legs. And it's got legs in neuroscience, it's got legs in oncology, it's -- anywhere that this proteomic needs needed to be testing biomarkers, this is the machine. As you know, the competition is out there in a multiplex format, starting with Luminex, we're partners with them as well. But we don't have cross-talk with our platform. And now we're increasing the channels, so we're at 8, and we maybe could go higher. But at 8, that's kind of a sweet point. And to have 8 channels of no cross-talk with the type of sudanese we have with this machine and in only 1 hour example to answer, it's kind of unheard of. Of course, there's others needs of scale.
I think we've got some work to do to crack where Meso scale really, really hit because they've got a full workflow with software, and it really is integrated into the workflows of their customers, and we've probably got more of a stand-alone box. You've got to get better at that piece of it, and we're working on that. And then of course, there's the whole clinical side. This thing really could be a point-of-care machine. We're working on 4x8 cartridge is something that you don't have to queue up a lot of tests in order to run it. And anyway, I just -- I see a strong future. And you asked what it could become, I think this is a $200 million to $300 million business in 5 years, to be honest, or more. It could be much bigger. It depends on the acceptance and how well we keep diversifying into new applications. But automated ELISA, multiple based proteomics, biomarker research, it's, as you just said, it's all the rage right now. It's accelerating, not leveling out, so we see a strong future in this platform. We're not surprised by the 100% growth, even though this thing is already a big platform. It's as big as anything we also had in the original ProteinSimple segment, including Simple Western now. It's getting there. It keeps growing where it is, it will be the biggest very soon."

We did a big deep dive really globally and what the hell is going on and why are we doing so well? And so we really did an account-by-account, customer-by-customer breakdown, by segment of how we're doing and why. And there's really no silver bullet. We're up with vaccine makers for obvious reasons. We're up with biopharma for a lot of reasons we talked about, but there's been more OEM work as well. They're all having a pretty good year, so they're outsourcing more. So we've had more custom work given to us. Academia has been certainly the duplicity issue, and some surge come back and maybe some budget flushing on multiple fronts, to be honest, we discovered some, I think, not material. It's not like it's half our growth or 1/3 or 1/4, but there's a little there. And it's really a sum of the parts, what comes down to for us. No silver bullet. It's not all COVID, it's not all anything, but it is a rising tide, really it's just -- research is doing really well on all fronts for us.
We're perfectly positioned, as Puneet said earlier, I mean, in proteomics, it's just -- we're in the right spot right now. And whether you're buying antibodies to make COVID tests or your need overflow help because you're stacked with working capacity to develop vaccines or your academic institutions that are staggering, you're building out new labs and you've got to buy more equipment, preferably equipment that has it's productivity inclinated like ours, not so expensive, that's kind of where it's all coming from. And our reagents, too, it's broad-based. Even ELISA, I mean 1 thing we can always go back to and just look at our good old ELISA kits, just to kids, 35 years old, and they kind of ebb and flow with projects and kind of the health of projects in biopharma. This is the best year in years. So it just kind of speaks to the broad-based growth, and we're not the only company talking about it, right?

We need to get a second. We need to do an outcomes test. There's work to be done before we start going after an LDT approach or working with a Mac or get started. But we're on the path, and we think we're at a year or less here of getting into early access selling of this thing, probably a good year away from a crosswalk or anything, but we'll see. We're also looking at partnerships as well, and we're also looking at other Macs, not using the same 1 we did prostate through. So we got a lot going on here. It's just been going very well. That platform is astounding. It works so well. It's amazing.
As you know, Exosomes, we feel is the best-in-class for liquid biopsy. And the data is going to prove it here when you start seeing some of it. And there -- it's a big market. There aren't the same kind of barriers like we have with prostate neurologists. Organ centers and -- there are not so many of them, so they're not so hard to go after in terms of commercial attack. And it's a big need. I mean it's a horrible thing to have to be given a new kidney and then lose it or to damage it through biopsies or with testing that as you're worried about rejection, and half of all these are rejected within 10 years. So this is a tool that really has been needed. And it's paying a cup, and it can be sent in. It doesn't have to be done with an on-contact with full bottoms or something. So we see a lot of upside in the price at the cost first and the price second is going to be, I think, really good compared to what's out there now, so."

Well, as you know, Alex, we've had this test kind of ready to go since late last spring. And there's been, I guess, a lot of flutter and clutter with the FDA and a lot of poor EUAs that came out early on qualitative versions of serology, and there's a bit of a hill decline here for getting accepted. There won't be real demand until there's enough vaccine out there, enough people to vaccine to create that demand with they're calling their doctors to find out how do I find out if I'm immune or not, can I see my grandkids or not. People want to go back to concerts. And get on planes and get on trains and being moved again, and no one is going to feel really good until they know they feel safe. And this is without a variant, this is out a mutation.
As you know, we're tied at the hip of Moulin signing. They've got the longest range testing known here on immunity, and we're running at like 7 or 8 months, and they don't see a reduction in immunity with antibodies yet. But the powers to be there do feel that it will follow the corona family, and it will be variable with individual, but between probably 1 and 2 years of immunity, but not forever. If it doesn't mutate, that means a booster. If it mutates, then we're kind of looking at a flu every year kind of thing, right? So -- and then we're trying to hit a moving target like flu does, which is harder. All that speaks to the more of a need to serology. People are going to want to know consistently, are they immune? Do not be surprised if in a year or 2, on your app on your phone, you're carrying an immunity passport and how you're doing with COVID so you can be led on to whatever or light into whatever. All that technology is coming, and it's not coming in 1 full flush, which is a problem. Everything is slower than we want.
Vaccinations are going slow. By summer, we're not going to be probably at herd immunity yet. We're not going to be at a point where enough people are vaccine were on feel safe. There's going to be a growing and growing demand for serology. And we're hoping to get our quantitative claim, be the only 1 given by the FDA very soon. All the data is submitted. We have actually from the WHO, we have the sample that will give us the means to actually quantitate our standard curve to there so there can be an international standard that the FDA is looking for to get behind. So we're right in the thick of it, and we've got great partners with Mount Sinai, so I do expect we'll get through it. And over a year, we probably won't be the only one, but we'll be very -- we'll be the first 1 will be a very good one. But I think serology will be on the rise. I think people in PCR, I think it's not going away either. It's going to be a much slower tail than people think. You probably heard that in other calls this week. Unfortunately, we're turning the curve, but it's going to be a long tail on getting back to normality, and we're going to get a piece of this probably. Nothing to the extent of some of the companies are that are answering the question, am I sick, but we're a research company first. This is all gravy for us.

Year 5 is a bit softer, too. And we had a bid that we call it budget flush over there too because they are also changing some tax consequences there. So I think everybody had strong instrument results in China probably were seeing a little bit of pull forward from that. I haven't seen it much mentioned, but we certainly saw it, and we'll admit to it. But I think it's going to be really good, the next plan for China. I think health care is still way behind where they are in other parts of their economy and their industry, and it's a lagging industry and they -- and now more than ever with COVID, and they certainly don't want to see a pandemic hit there, their people want health care there. And life sciences is on the rise still. That's why we continue to see 25% or better growth, and we will for a long time, I think.
I think as far as our government is concerned, whether it ends up being $600 million more or $1 billion more or $1.9 billion, there's going to definitely be portions of lists that are given as grants and been done for pandemic research and which really is infectious diseases, which there really hasn't been a whole lot of. Most of the NIH, as you know, is really focused more on oncology, neuroscience and different areas like that. I mean, as I've mentioned often, when's the last time you paid more than $1 for an antibiotic? I mean there's -- we're behind in a lot of areas around infections. And I think there'll be a lot of overflow and a halo effect from stim mill. I think it's 1 reason that the unofficial NIH budget for this year now is looking at 3%. I think they're all holding off until they see what's going to really drift out around the stimulus packages into the science community, which I think there'll be some. It's hard to quantify. I think there'll be some. And if there's not, you'll see more pressure for the NIH to get more, I think."

Even there, we've improved our current site at headquarters that we can do probably up towards of about $40 million or so annually of GMP proteins here. So we've done a good job there, that's going to fill the gap while we qualify this factory and wait for the large orders because we're not going to have a large venue, a large catalog here. We're going to be making far less than 50 different proteins there.
We are qualifying on the major runners, and you can guess what they are. They start with an I-L. And we'll go from there. Both these first 2 customers have needs of over $10 million a year, and we are in negotiation with at least half a dozen others, and I won't tell you who, but one of them have a need for $50 million a year. What we've done with these customers, because it's hard for them to give us a forecast, what -- we've talked a contractors that we're demanding 95% of their volume. Whatever they end up needing, it's really an unknown right now how these things take off, when they come out, what the forecast is going to be, what's the ramp, how do we plan for it. And they know it, too. They know it's frustrating for us because, how do you prepare? So all we've done has turned our contracting towards -- we want to see a range what you need. We'll be there. We don't know when, but we expect 95% of your volume that's contracted. So that's kind of the gist of how we're doing business.
And these -- call them 8 customers would swap us out for years if they hit their forecast, just these. And there's another 50 to 100 after that, so we're not concerned about filling this factory eventually."

That's going to help quite a bit, I think that will be a positive story, but I think it's a grind.
I think these urologists, like a lot of different specialty doctors, they're hard to convert.

We have to we have to almost shame them into moving into this methodology because it's better for the patient, even though it's less revenue for them.

Listen, the way we're thinking about the forecast is more about the current momentum we have in the business and the sequential momentum going forward as opposed to year-over-year growth rates because it gets wonky, especially in Q4 for us with what happened in Q4 last year. So the way we're thinking about it is that the momentum from an absolute revenue perspective, continuing, if history is any guide, usually, our Q3 and Q4, our fiscal Q3 and Q4, are slightly higher than our second quarter if nothing else because there's less holidays within those quarters as there are in the November and December time frame. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. We think the momentum that we saw -- the step-up in momentum that we saw in absolute terms in Q2 is with us, at least for the rest of this fiscal year, and so that's kind of how we're thinking about the forecast going forward."

The gene editing portion of the workflow is not the most expensive -- not the most valuable part of the workflow. It's a critical part, obviously, and we'll see. The domain of customers is a little over 100, as you know, and we are certainly working with a couple of dozen. And we are certainly sold to more than half a dozen, quite a few. And they come -- they're coming in bigger chunks, so they get access and do a 2 trial, it's hundreds of thousands of dollars. So we're in the millions now for revenue with TcBuster, so it's starting to get there. This thing is going to happen. Fortunately, it's a critical part of a brand-new workflow for a cell and gene therapy that's radically different than using viral approaches, so it's kind of next generation.
So we've got to kind of grind through getting a half a dozen, dozen, 2 dozen of these guys lined up and get them into their clinicals and then get going on it. I think this 1 really is a J-curve for 5 years from now to the 56th or whatever it ends up being. But it's going to -- it's also going to probably growth rates of 50% to 100% starting now for the next 2 to 3 years until it grows even faster, if it really ramps as these things go into production, so."

They're helping create an industry, right? So we're all working on creating a spatial analysis, and there's a big need for spatial analysis in the workflow for all research and proteomics for 1 as well as other areas, so it really comes down to that. If you need to do down to single cell analysis and you really care about the morphology of your tissue sample, which is precious, this is a great technology. Also, other technologies that use antibodies, sometimes you can't find the antibodies or they aren't working well or they're not producible. Looking for a gene is much more -- it's much more on or off, it's there or not. And so this technology with the 0 trees that could detect and get the signal is it's full proof, so that's why we're seeing a lift. I think a lot of our softness a couple of years ago, we had to reorganize Europe. Europe is just on fire now. The plans really are definitely working in Europe. Europe is doing great. We had over 20% growth in Europe this quarter, so it's a nice thing to see, and our Genomics division had a big part of it.
We're also seeing good growth across the board in Asia as well, although smaller, starting to catch on. And we've mentioned them in our RNAscope and BaseScope, they're also growing nicely. And our High Plex, our multiplex version is starting to grow. We'll get an FFP version of the High Plex out here soon. That will really be it really needed, I think, and compete well with us out there. And then, of course, DNAscope is coming at the end of this fiscal year, we hope, and that's another platform. So it's a great pipeline. It's got a lot of legs. Again, we see our $200 million, $300 million division here with this technology in our 5-year plan. And it keeps growing at the near 30% growth, it's back to -- it won't take that long."

Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. Hoping you and your families have remained safe as we get closer to turning the corner on this horrible pandemic.
The Bio-Techne team delivered another strong quarter, accelerating our organic growth year-over-year to 19%, building on the strength we experienced last quarter. In fact, our 19% organic growth rate represents the strongest performance since I joined the company in 2013. This growth was broad-based across our segments and geographies as our penetration in biopharma continue to be red hot, and even academia returned to double-digit growth. The new normal of social distancing and staggered shifts has become an accelerant for the continued adoption of several of our technologies, namely Simple Plex and Simple Western. I will dive into the specifics of each of these platforms later, but they are all gaining traction and remain in the early innings of penetrating their large respective markets.
We delivered this record organic growth with a continued focus on profitability as our adjusted operating margin improved 530 basis points year-over-year to 38.7%. Some of this improvement reflects the timing of hiring and investments to drive future growth but shows the leverage and profitability inherent in our business model.
The COVID pandemic continues to impact traditional ways researchers are staffing labs and conducting experiments as well as the ways we are interacting with these customers, but I'm encouraged with the innovative solutions researchers have leveraged to push science further and the innovative strategies our commercial teams have implemented to meet their evolving needs in these challenging times. Academia, in particular, is getting better at managing through the COVID-related restrictions. And we are encouraged with the sequential improvement we experienced in this end market. While we experienced robust growth with both biopharma and academia customers in Q2, both of these end markets remain largely close to outside visitors, creating challenges for our commercial team to get in front of customers.
Our commercial team once again did an excellent job adjusting to this new normal, leveraging webinars to educate current and potential customers on our portfolio of reagents, cell and gene therapy solutions, tissue biopsy and spatial analysis solutions and instruments. During the quarter, our team got even more creative, using virtual coffees and happy hours to get increased face time with our customers. These virtual meetings and webinars will remain an important and cost effective part of our commercial strategy for the remainder of the pandemic and beyond.
Our digital marketing initiatives remain an important tool to differentiating Bio-Techne, educate the scientific community on our portfolio of innovative and productivity-enabling tools, drive traffic to our website and ultimately convert this traffic to revenue. These digital efforts have become an increasingly more effective tool during the COVID pandemic, and we continue to execute this strategy at a high level in Q2.
Researchers often begin their quest for reagents and research productivity tools with an Internet search, so ensuring Bio-Techne is one of the top results of these searches is critical to drive traffic to our website, convert these visits to sales of our products. Leveraging search engine optimization and targeted ad strategies remain a key component of our digital strategy and both continue to generate high returns on investment, with an outsized impact on sales within our antibody and protein portfolio. Last quarter, we announced the launch of [ OneWeb, ] a new website that unites all of Bio-Techne's brands under 1 easy-to-navigate site, enabling our customers to order products across our instrument and reagent portfolio and 1 website while leveraging algorithms to drive purchases across our portfolio and position the business to realize increased revenue synergies. We began a scaled launch of [ OneWeb ] in November, and initial customer feedback as well as traffic to our website has been positive.
[ OneWeb, ] paired with our SEO and targeted ad efforts, drove double-digit growth this quarter in the number of sessions, page views, new users and repeat users on our website. Given the correlation of our revenue growth this quarter, our strategy is clearly generating results, and we will continue to pull this growth lever going forward.
Now let's discuss performance of our growth platforms, starting with Protein Sciences segment, which grew 19% organically for the quarter. Growth is strong across our core reagent portfolio, with both RUO proteins and antibodies growing low-double digits. In addition to the impact of academic labs reopening in our digital initiatives, our reagent business also experienced a favorable tailwind from custom work for biopharma customers in need of additional protein or antibody capacity. Our customer reagent development business increased over 60% in the quarter, and we are leveraging multiple strategies to capitalize on this outsourcing trend going forward.
During Q2, we continued to push our cell and gene therapy initiatives forward. One of the key components within our cell and gene therapy business is GMP proteins, with these cytokines and growth factors playing a critical role in a cell and gene therapy workflow. Revenue generated from our portfolio of GMP proteins once again increased nearly 100% in Q2. Recall that we recently opened a 61,000-square foot state of the art GMP reagent manufacturing facility to address the expected demand for GMP proteins and reagents as a growing pipeline of cell and gene therapeutics progress through the regulatory approval process. We made significant progress qualifying the facility and have begun manufacturing production lots of select GMP proteins.
We also executed our second long-term GMP protein supply agreement in the quarter. We remain in various stages of discussion with several other biotech companies with pipeline in cell and gene therapy for potential long-term GMP protein supply agreements and are very pleased with the funnel of potential deals.
Sticking with cell and gene therapy, our genome engineering services business, which includes our nonviral vector-based gene transfer technology, TcBuster, continue to gain attention from the cell and gene therapy industry. I would also note that we are seeing a growing list of collaborators and positive feedback on Cloudz, our nonmagnetic bead-based cell separation technology for human T cell, natural killer cells and human regulatory T cell, Treg, activation and expansion kits. We are still in the early innings of both TcBuster and Cloudz, but both of these innovative cell and gene therapy workflow technologies remain important pieces of our cell and gene therapy workflow solutions.
ScaleReady, our JV with Fresenius Kabi and Wilson Wolf formally launched at the beginning of calendar 2021, with the mission of providing the most simple, scalable and versatile cell and gene therapy manufacturing platform in the industry. As a reminder, this consortium pairs Bio-Techne's portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions, including our Cloudz' self-separation and activation technology, GMP proteins and genome engineering services with Fresenius Kabi's leukapheresis instrument and Wilson Wolf's bioreactor to enable a modular, cost efficient workflow solution. The ScaleReady website is up and running, and the commercial team began its initial customer outreach campaign, including initial contact to over 600 industry participants and almost 250 gene and therapy companies.
Also during Q2, Bio-Techne made an initial strategic investment in Changzhou Eminence Biotechnology Company, a China-based life science company with best-in-class media, including CHO cells and other serum-free media products as well as custom cell line and media formulation development services. Eminence will use the financing proceeds to expand its manufacturing capacity and increase the service capabilities of its China-headquartered GMP media production facility. Investing in Eminence expands Bio-Techne's foothold in providing additional products and services to support the needs of the rapidly growing Chinese biopharmaceutical industry and fits extremely well with our existing high-growth product portfolio in China. We look forward to working with the Eminence team.
Now let's discuss our proteomic analytical tools portion of the Protein Sciences segment, where the strong momentum we saw in Q1 continued with our portfolio of instruments and assays, enabling research labs to increase productivity while adhering to social distancing and staggered work shift protocols. Once again, we experienced very strong growth in our Simple Plex, multiplex and [ ELISA spin, ] Ella. Our revenue almost doubled year-over-year. Encouragingly, Simple Plex utilization within our customer base continued to diversify as researchers leveraged Ella to investigate inflammation, cancer, neuroscience and other disease states and biological pathways. Ella's relatively small footprint, low price point, sub-picogram level sensitivity and reproducibility is driving both instrument placements and consumable pull-through. Our clinical program with Micropoint in China is on track, which speaks to the incredible diversity Ella is capable of. We are now taking Ella through a 510(k) process in the U.S., which will unlock new clinical opportunities for this amazing platform.
It was a similar story with our automated western instrument portfolio, where we grew almost 30% in the quarter. Our Jess- and Wes-automated western platforms turned the labor-intensive, messy, inconsistent, cumbersome, manual Western blot process, which can take up to 2 days, into a fully automated, reproducible, sample-to-answer 3-hour process. This value proposition has been resonating incredibly well with researchers as they return to the bench. And with our solutions less than 15% penetrated in the addressable market, there is plenty of room for continued growth.
Our biologics instruments, which provide protein purity information and are used directly in bioprocessing, also had a standout quarter as we experienced broad demand from biopharma, including several companies with COVID-19 vaccines in various stages of development or commercialization as well as continued interest from companies working on cell and gene therapy.
Now I'll provide an update on our Diagnostics and Genomics portfolio, where organic growth revenue also increased 19% in Q2. Let's start with an update on our ACD or tissue pathology franchise, where organic revenue increased in the upper 20% range for the quarter. This growth was broad-based across geographies and product lines, including very strong performances from miRNAscope following its launch this past summer as well as BaseScope. Momentum we experienced in RNAscope last quarter continued in Q2 as the single-cell, spatial resolution and high sensitivity provided by this technology continues to drive market adoption.
Biopharma's need for increased productivity while working with limited or staggered shift remains a tailwind for our PAS, or Pharma Assay Services business, within ACD. Our biopharma outsourcing spatial genomic analysis has drove over 40% growth in this business in the first half of fiscal year '21.
Now let's discuss our Exosome Diagnostics business, starting with our prostate cancer liquid biopsy assay, the ExoDx Prostate test. Encouragingly, we believe most of the urology practices across the country have reopened, and we experienced another sequential increase in our prostate test volume. But patient traffic is still down from last year as older patients are more likely to quarantine at home until they become vaccinated. We expect urology practice traffic to continue to improve as vaccines make their way into the segment of the population, which in turn should have a positive impact on our ExoDx Prostate testing volumes.
In the meantime, our home kit version of the test continues to be the safest solution for patients to continue to work with their urologists. Recall that we partnered with baseball Hall of Famer, Cal Ripken, Jr. to co-promote our ExoDx Prostate test following his personal prostate cancer journey, including his use of the ExoDx Prostate test, which ultimately influenced his potentially lifesaving decision to get the biopsy that led to the discovery of his aggressive prostate cancer. The marketing campaign continues to be successfully leveraged across all social media platforms and channels and is driving traffic to the Fight like Cal page on the ExoDx website, where we saw page visits increase over 1,400% sequentially. We also launched a physician locator function on the ExoDx website, enabling patients interested in taking the test to find physicians offering a test in their respective city.
Our Exosome Diagnostics platform is not just limited to our ExoDx Prostate test. There is a full pipeline of high-value diagnostic tests, with our [ ExoTrue ] kidney transplant rejection assay next in line for commercialization. We expect [ ExoTrue ] to become an important tool in the management of kidney transplant patients, where it's easy to collect urine-based sampling -- sample, enabling increased adherence to testing protocols. We completed verification of the assay and have optimized the workflow. Initial [ ExoTrue ] data has been accepted for publication in a well-respected medical journal, and we anticipate publication in the coming weeks.
Despite generally soft non-COVID-related diagnostic testing volumes, our Diagnostic Reagents division once again delivered a solid quarter, with organic revenue increasing in the upper single digits. This is actually the sixth quarter in a row that our Diagnostic Reagents division has delivered positive growth as the development pipeline and, to a lesser extent, COVID-related opportunities continue to bear fruit and smooth out the impact of what can sometimes be a lumpy bulk reagent order.
I'd like to now give an update on our COVID-19 initiatives. The products we sell are directly related to COVID research. For example, reagents and instruments with specific viral research applications, ACD probes to detect the virus within tissue and sales of bulk diagnostic reagents used in COVID testing applications was an estimated 3% tailwind to our business in Q2. We expect that research and COVID will be around for many years, thus making this tailwind a sustaining new layer of our product portfolio going forward.
We continue to make progress with the commercialization of the COVID-19 serology assay that we co-developed with Kantaro Biosciences based on Mount Sinai's technology. The Kantaro serology assay is a truly differentiated test, providing not only information on the presence of COVID-19 antibodies, but also the level of titer of those antibodies. In November, the Kantaro COVID-SeroKlir assay received EUA approval as a semi-quantitative assay, and we have submitted additional data to the FDA supporting a full quantitative claim as we received in Europe with a CE mark.
We have commercial agreements now set up in many countries and are in discussions with many U.S.-based lab systems. To date, most of the demand for COVID-19 testing has been PCR-based, geared towards answering the question, ""Am I infected with COVID-19?"" Now that vaccines are becoming available while the virus continues to mutate, we believe demand for serology testing will increase as patients look to answer the question, ""Am I immune?"" Ultimately, following a full FDA quantitative claim, we believe the Kantaro assay will be able to answer this important question, allowing us to return to the pre-COVID lifestyle we are all looking forward to.
Our Q2 is evidence of the growth we are starting to unlock with our portfolio of proteomic analytical instruments, tissue pathology and spatial genomics products, cell and gene therapy workflow solutions and liquid biopsy diagnostics. These large high-growth end markets remain underpenetrated, and we're in the early innings of realizing the full potential of these growth technologies and platforms. Layer on to these the content and cross-divisional synergies inherent in our core reagent portfolio, and I'm increasingly confident in our ability to deliver our long-term revenue and profitability targets. I'm extremely proud of the execution the Bio-Techne team delivered during the first half of our fiscal 2021, and we're looking forward to building on this success in the second half of 2021 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jim."

I will provide an overview of our Q2 fiscal '21 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional color on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of our fiscal 2021.
Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $1.62 versus $1.08 1 year ago, an increase of 50% over last year, representing a new company record. Foreign exchange positively impacted EPS by $0.08.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.15 compared to $3.02 in the prior year, representing a 62% decrease. Our GAAP EPS results in the second quarter of last year benefited from a favorable realized and unrealized gain on our investment in ChemoCentryx.
Q2 revenue was $224.3 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year on a reported basis and 19% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 2% impact on our revenue.
Our strong growth in Q2 was fairly consistent across the globe, ranging from the high teens in the U.S. to 25% organic growth in China. By end market, biopharma growth was very strong at over 20%, and it was nice to see academia continued to improve, growing the low teens during the second quarter.
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 71.5% in the quarter compared to 70.6% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable volume leverage.
Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 25.2% of revenue, a 310 basis point decrease compared to the prior year, and R&D expense in Q2 was 7.5% of revenue, 140 basis points lower than the prior year. While our adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increased sequentially and compared to the prior year, a tight labor market in the life science space did not allow us to fill all headcount additions to the team at the pace we'd originally anticipated. Given the continued improvement we are seeing in our end markets, we still plan to fill these positions and continue with investments that position the company for growth going forward. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 38.7%, an increase of 530 basis points from the prior year period and a 50 basis point sequential improvement from Q1.
Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q2 was $3.4 million, decreasing $1.1 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt during fiscal '21 as well as lower floating interest rates. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q2 stood at $231.5 million.
Other adjusted nonoperating expense was $1.3 million for the quarter compared to $2.5 million expense in the prior year primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income includes unrealized gains from our investment in ChemoCentryx.
Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 20.6%, 120 basis point improvement over the prior year, with the improvement primarily driven by geographic mix. We expect our effective tax rate going forward to be consistent with Q2, barring no changes in corporate tax law.
As Chuck mentioned, during Q2, we made a strategic equity investment in China-based Eminence, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services to the Chinese biopharmaceutical market. The $130,000 noncontrolling interest line item reflects 1 month loss from a portion of Eminence we do not own. The impact to other lines of the P&L as a result of consolidating Eminence was immaterial in Q2.
Turning to cash flow and return of capital. A record $89.3 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter. In Q2, our net investment in capital expenditures was $11.4 million primarily driven by the completion of our new GMP protein factory. And during Q2, we returned capital to shareholders with $12.4 million of dividends. We finished the quarter with 40.3 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet remains very strong, with $283 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments and a total leverage ratio of well under 1x EBITDA.
Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q2 reported sales were $172.2 million, with reported revenue increasing 22%. Organic growth increased 19%, with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 3% on revenue growth. Within the segment, the strong growth was very broad-based, with double-digit growth in nearly all reagent, assay and instrument platforms. As Chuck described in his remarks, platforms of notable mention include Simple Plex, Simple Western, biologics and cell and gene therapy, especially pertaining to GMP proteins. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 46.6%, an increase of 360 basis points year-over-year, due primarily to favorable volume leverage and cost management.
Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q2 reported sales were $52.5 million, with reported revenue increasing 20%. Organic growth for the segment was 19%, with foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. Similar to Q1, our Genomics division led this segment in the quarter. We experienced strength across the entire ACD-branded portfolio, with miRNAscope, BaseScope and our diagnostics partnership with Leica being honorable mention.
Also a driver of growth for Diagnostics and Genomics, Exosome Diagnostics Q2 revenue increased over 100% from last year, with higher collections from Medicare, private payers and patient cash collect driving the year-over-year increase. As Chuck mentioned, our Diagnostic Reagents division continued its growth streak by executing on COVID-related opportunities to offset the headwind many of its traditional OEM diagnostic customers are facing with patients foregoing routine visits to the doctor.
Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin. At 15.5%, the segment's operating margin improved from 2.2% reported in the prior year. The increase reflects favorable volume leverage in our Genomics division, less dilution from Exosome Diagnostics as well as strong cost management.
In summary, our fiscal 2021 is off to a great start. With 15% organic revenue growth during the first half of the fiscal year, our results thus far have demonstrated that our portfolio of products and solution offerings are more relevant than ever to our customers who are on the front lines of diagnosing and developing cures for disease. We believe that the current pandemic has only strengthened the resolve of our customers to accelerate their great work, and we will continue to do everything in our power to provide them the tools to help them succeed. Thus, we see the current momentum of our business continuing in the back half of our fiscal year.
However, to support our customers' needs beyond the remainder of this fiscal year, we need to catch up on our investments in our product pipeline and postsales service and support while continuing to invest in customer engagement activities, especially those of a digital nature. We started to make progress with these additional investments in Q2 but to -- but intend to accelerate back to our plan in the back half of the year. If successful, these investments may slightly lower our operating margin from its level in the first half of the fiscal year but will position us well for our long-term strategic plan of continued double-digit growth for years to come.
That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions."

Well, we're not going to give too much real, in the weeds detail on it. We've been talking about growing 100%.

Well, we're not going to give too much real, in the weeds detail on it. We've been talking about growing 100%. We've talked in the past of being a $30 million-type portfolio, with most of it being serum right now, and we're -- and pretty much, our run rate on proteins at $10 million, and we gave you the growth rates in there. We have the ability to increase, I guess, what we make here at the headquarters by a factor of 4, if we need to. So we're good while we take the time to qualify the new site, which is going along really well.
Again, we've talked in the past about this $10 million in GMP proteins growing to maybe $20 million next year and then doubling in after that. And then hopefully, it really starts ramping once we start getting the production side of the therapeutics as they come out of the back end of clinicals.
The rest of the portfolio, it's kind of hard to say. We had a great quarter for both acceptance for both Cloudz and for TcBuster. We talked about we're getting an awful lot of new revenue to get a look at these technologies and do preclinicals with, so we're pretty excited. The team is pretty excited. It's the best quarter we've really had for TcBuster. We're actually working on expanding the site already or we're making it, so it's a bit of surprise so fast.
So it's kind of hard, Puneet, to tell you what it's going to be next year, but I think probably double what is this year and probably double again next year after that. And as we've said in our 5-year outlook here, in our $1.5 billion goal, we see -- a $300 million business is what we see. So it will be consisting of a bunch of components, $150 million or so, at least in GMP proteins, but the rest sort of between Cloudz, TcBuster, instrumentation, ACD for technologies for spatial cell analysis, Ella testing for QC testing and the workflow, all these bits and pieces roll up to $300 million. And we're probably a year away from getting any more -- doing a real detailed guesses in just what the recipes look like. I think the safest one is the GMP protein piece right now."

And what are the other key initiatives that you have in, including the 510(k) approval that you're submitting for?
And in that same context, if you could just help us understand, I mean, there's quite a bit of momentum right now in proteomics. Obviously, Bio-Techne is core to proteomics. You are one of the leaders across the board in antibodies, protein cytokines and broadly across proteomics. So maybe just help us understand where that could -- where this business could be, the Protein Sciences business overall and the proteomics business could be overall and sort of longer-term and 5-year time frame?"

Clearly, we're super well positioned in proteomics. And as the wave of research hits and as this golden era keeps growing and money is siphoned off these stimulus plans for more pandemic relief and pandemic research so it never happens again, we're going to be a big beneficiary. We're seeing -- we're really seeing a lift in every part of our business in every geography. It was just astounding. I don't think I've ever seen a more green dashboard so -- in my career.
It's hard to pin down what's COVID and what's just research. Now we've dug into what's going on with our customers and they're certainly -- bigger biopharma are investing more. They're taking the cash there. The ones -- the vaccine makers are obviously doing more. Companies that are doing well off COVID are taking that cash and doing more R&D. And whether it's more R&D and more research, we're benefiting.
I've always said that Simple Plex was a sleeper, right, and it had for a few years now. And if it keeps growing at a near 100%, it's going to be really big really soon. So we've now -- we're now well over 500 instruments placed worldwide, which is a lot. This is an amazing machine, and it just does a lot for what -- for the money. It's just an amazing piece of technology from an amazing team that has worked on it for many years before we acquired the company.
I think that was seen by Micropoint early on in China, and we're on track with their clinical. And this could be -- that deal alone could be $100 million of revenue in 3, 4 years if they hit their targets. This is a guy that did Mindray, so he has a lot of credibility. He is very interested in making a very standardized patient monitoring platform for large hospital systems in China, and there's a lot of them. We are taking through the 510(k) process here in the U.S. so we can try to list more interest like Micropoint in China. See -- and Micropoint is going to do all the CFDA themselves. They're experts. They're doing -- they're done with the panels. They're doing everything.
Here, I don't know. We were probably not set up to do all that ourselves. We'll do the 510(k). We're going to do it off a standard analyte, something well-known, something we can get to the system. And then -- and we are talking to potential interested parties, but this thing -- it's got legs. And it's got legs in neuroscience, it's got legs in oncology, it's -- anywhere that this proteomic needs -- needed to be testing biomarkers, this is the machine.
As you know, the competition is out there in a multiplex format. Starting with Luminex, we're partners with them as well. But we don't have cross-talk with our platform. And now we're increasing the channels, so we're at 8, and we maybe could go higher. But at 8, that's kind of a sweet point. And to have 8 channels of no cross-talk with the type of [ pseudo-noise ] we have with this machine and in only 1 hour sample-to-answer, it's kind of unheard of.
Of course, there's others, Meso Scale. I think we've got some work to do to crack where Meso Scale really, really hit because they've got a full workflow with software, and it really is integrated into the workflows of their customers, and we've probably got more of a stand-alone box. We've got to get better at that piece of it, and we're working on that.
And then of course, there's the whole clinical side. This thing really could be a point-of-care machine. We're working on a 4x8 cartridge, something that you don't have to queue up a lot of tests in order to run it. And anyway, I just -- I see a strong future. And you asked what it could become, I think this is a $200 million to $300 million business in 5 years, to be honest, or more. It could be much bigger. It depends on the acceptance and how well we keep diversifying into new applications.
But automated ELISA, multiplex-based proteomics, biomarker research, it's -- as you just said, it's all the rage right now. It's accelerating, not leveling out, so we see a strong future in this platform. We're not surprised by the 100% growth, even though this thing is already a big platform. It's as big as anything we also had in the original ProteinSimple segment, including Simple Western now. It's getting there. If it keeps growing where it is, it will be the biggest very soon."

We did a big deep dive really globally, what the hell is going on and why are we doing so well? And so we did -- we really did an account-by-account, customer-by-customer breakdown, by segment of how we're doing and why. And there's really no silver bullet. We're up with vaccine makers for obvious reasons. We're up with biopharma for a lot of reasons we talked about, but there's been more OEM work as well. They're all having a pretty good year, so they're outsourcing more. So we've had more custom work given to us.
Academia has been certainly the duplicity issue, and some surge comeback and maybe some budget flushing on multiple fronts, to be honest. We discovered some, I think, not material. It's not like it's half our growth or 1/3 or 1/4, but there's a little there. And it's really a sum of the parts is what comes down to for us. No silver bullet. It's not all COVID, it's not all anything, but it is a rising tide, really it's just -- research is doing really well on all fronts for us.
We've -- we're perfectly positioned, as Puneet said earlier, I mean, in proteomics. It's just -- we're in the right spot right now. And whether you're buying antibodies to make COVID tests or you need overflow help because you're stacked with the working capacity to develop vaccines or your academic institutions that are staggering, you're building out new labs and you've got to buy more equipment, preferably equipment that has it's productivity inclinated like ours, not so expensive, that's kind of where it's all coming from.
And then our reagents, too, it's broad-based. Even ELISA, I mean, that one thing that we can always go back to and just look at our good old ELISA kits, just [ Q ] kits, 35 years old, and they kind of ebb and flow with projects and kind of the health of projects in biopharma. It was the best year in years. So it just kind of speaks to the broad-based growth. And we're not the only company talking about it, right?

We need to get a second. We need to do an outcomes test. There's work to be done before we start going after an LDT approach or working with a MAC or get started. But we're on the path, and we think we're at a year or less here of getting into early access selling of this thing. Probably a good year away from a crosswalk or anything, but we'll see.
We're also looking at partnerships as well, and we're also looking at other MACs, not using the same one we did prostate through. So we got a lot going on here. It's just been going very well. That platform is astounding. It works so well. It's amazing.
As you know, exosomes, we feel, is the best-in-class for liquid biopsy. And the data is going to prove it here when you start seeing some of it. And there -- it's a big market. There aren't the same kind of barriers like we have with prostate and urologists. Organ centers and -- there are not so many of them, so they're not so hard to go after in terms of commercial attack. And it's a big need. I mean it's a horrible thing to have to be given a new kidney and then lose it or to damage it through biopsies or with testing it as you're worried about rejection. And half of all these are rejected within 10 years. So there -- this is a tool that really has been needed. And it's paying a cup, and it can be sent in. It doesn't have to be done with an on-contact phlebotomist or something.

Well, as you know, Alex, we've had this test kind of ready to go since late last spring. And there's been, I guess, a lot of flutter and clutter with the FDA and a lot of poor EUAs that came out early on qualitative versions of serology, and there's a bit of a hill decline here for getting accepted. There won't be real demand until there's enough vaccine out there, enough people vaccinated to create that demand with -- they're calling their doctors to find out, ""How do I find out if I'm immune or not? Can I see my grandkids or not?"" People want to go back to concerts and get on planes and get on trains and be in malls again, and no one is going to feel really good until they know they feel safe. And this is without a variant. This is without a mutation.
As you know, we're tied at the hip with Mount Sinai, and they've got the longest range testing known here on immunity, and we're running at like 7 or 8 months, and they don't see a reduction in immunity with antibodies yet. But the powers to be there do feel that it will follow the corona family, and it will be variable with individual, but between probably 1 and 2 years of immunity, but not forever. If it doesn't mutate, that means a boost there. If it mutates, then we're kind of looking at a flu every year kind of thing, right? So -- and then we're trying to hit a moving target like flu does, which is harder.
All that speaks to the more of a need to serology. People are going to want to know consistently, are they immune? Do not be surprised if in a year or 2, on your app on your phone, you're carrying an immunity passport and how you're doing with COVID so you can be led on to whatever or let into whatever. All that technology is coming, and it's not coming in one full flush, which is a problem. Everything is slower than we want.
Vaccinations are going slow. By summer, we're not going to be probably at herd immunity yet. We're not going to be at a point where enough people are vaccinated, where we're going to feel safe. There's going to be a growing and growing demand for serology. And we're hoping to get our quantitative claim, be the only one given by the FDA very soon.
All the data is submitted. We have actually -- from the WHO, we have the sample that will give us the means to actually quantitate our standard curve to theirs so there can be an international standard that the FDA is looking for to get behind. So we're right in the thick of it, and we've got great partners with Mount Sinai, so I do expect we'll get through it.
And in over a year, we probably won't be the only one, but we'll be very -- we'll be the first one, and we'll be a very good one. But I think serology will be on the rise. I think people in PCR, I think it's not going away either. It's going to be a much slower tail than people think. You probably heard of that in other calls this week. Unfortunately, we're turning the curve, but it's going to be a long tail on getting back to normality, and we're going to get a piece of this probably. Nothing to the extent of some of these -- some of the companies that are out there answering the question,"" Am I sick?"" But we're a research company first. This is all gravy for us. We expect to be helping, and we're going to have a great piece of science to help with."

Year 5 is a bit softer, too. And we had a bid that we call budget flush over there too because they are also changing some tax consequences there. So I think everybody had strong instrument results in China. Probably we're seeing a little bit of pull forward from that. I haven't seen it much mentioned, but we certainly saw it, and we'll admit to it.
But I think it's going to be really good, the next plan for China. I think health care is still way behind where they are in other parts of their economy and their industry. And it's a lagging industry and they -- and now more than ever with COVID, and they certainly don't want to see a pandemic hit there. Their people want health care there. And life sciences is on the rise still. That's why we continue to see 25% or better growth, and we will for a long time, I think.
I think as far as our government is concerned, whether it ends up being $600 million more or $1 billion more or $1.9 billion, there's going to definitely be portions of this that are given as grants and been done for pandemic research and which really is infectious diseases, which there really hasn't been a whole lot of. Most of the NIH, as you know, is really focused more on oncology, neuroscience and different areas like that. I mean as I've mentioned often, when's the last time you paid more than $1 for an antibiotic? I mean there's -- we're behind in a lot of areas around infections. And I think there'll be a lot of overflow and a halo effect from -- I think it's one reason that the official NIH budget for this year now looks at -- is looking at 3%. I think they're all holding off until they see what's going to really drift out around these stimulus packages into the science community, which I think there'll be some. It's hard to quantify. I think there'll be some. And if there's not, you'll see more pressure for the NIH to get more, I think."

Do you have some of these in the pipeline or as semi-firm commitments at this point? And then when we think about what you're prepared to do in terms of supplying your initial days with the new facility, what is the plan for scaling up that portfolio? It sounds like the idea is to kind of start off with a couple of key molecules and then work from there. So I'm just curious what the portfolio expansion ramp looks like and whether that's what you really need in order to sort of drive the acceleration that you've talked about recently."

If we get into cell and gene therapies and we need proteins as part of the workflow, we need something like probably 10-or-more-million a year. Could you do that?"" And back then, we -- all we could say was no, we couldn't.
So now fast forward to here, this is more build in the factory. Even there, we've improved our current site and headquarters that we can do probably up towards of about $40 million or so annually of GMP proteins here. So we've done a lot of -- good job there, and that's going to fill the gap while we qualify this factory and wait for the large orders because we're not going to have a large venue, a large catalog here. We're going to be making far less than 50 different proteins there.
We are qualifying on the major runners, and you can guess what they are. They start with an I-L. And we'll go from there. Both these first 2 customers have needs of over $10 million a year. And we are in negotiation with at least a half a dozen others, and I won't tell you who, but one of them has a need for $50 million a year.
What we've done with these customers, because it's hard for them to give us a forecast, we've talked with new contractors that we're demanding 95% of their volume. Whatever they end up needing, it's really an unknown right now how these things take off, when they come out, what the forecast is going to be, what's the ramp, how do we plan for it. And they know it, too. They know it's frustrating for us because how do you prepare? So what we've done is turned our contracting towards, ""We want to see a range of what you need. We'll be there. We don't know when, but we expect 95% of your volume that's contracted."" So that's kind of the gist of how we're doing business.
And these, call them, 8 customers would swamp us out for years if they hit their forecast, just these. And there's another 50 to 100 after that, so we're not concerned about filling this factory eventually."

The urologists, we've sold through roughly 2,500 of them, and there's about 20,000. So we got a lot of work to do. And of that 2,500, 77% have reordered. So once they're in it, they believe it.

We have some great KOLs. We're going to get back in front of NGF here in February for reconsideration. That's going to help quite a bit. I think that will be a positive story.
But I think it's a grind. I think these urologists, like a lot of different specialty doctors, they're hard to convert. I'm certain a large portion of them enjoy their $1,500 piece biopsies and know that they're mostly negative and don't care, so it's just the state of the business. We have to grind through them. We have to almost shame them into moving into this methodology because it's better for the patient, even though it's less revenue for them.

If history is any guide, usually, our Q3 and Q4 -- our fiscal Q3 and Q4 are slightly higher than our second quarter, and it's nothing else because there's less holidays within those quarters as there are in the November and December time frame.

The domain of customers is a little over 100, as you know, and we are certainly working with a couple of dozen. And we are certainly sold to more than half a dozen, quite a few. And they come -- and they're coming in bigger chunks, so they get access and do a 2 trial, it's hundreds of thousands of dollars. So we're in the millions now for revenue with TcBuster, so it's starting to get there. This thing is going to happen.
Unfortunately, it's a critical part of a brand-new workflow for a cell and gene therapy that's radically different than using viral approaches, so it's kind of next generation. So we've got to kind of grind through getting a half a dozen, dozen, 2 dozen of these guys lined up and get them into their clinicals and then get going on it.

So it really comes down to that. If you need to do -- down to single cell analysis and you really care about the morphology of your tissue sample, which is precious, this is a great technology.
Also, other technologies that use antibodies, sometimes you can't find the antibodies or they aren't working well or they're not producible. Looking for a gene is much more -- it's much more on or off, it's there or not. And so this technology with the Z probe trees that could detect and get the signal is -- it's foolproof. So that's why we're seeing a lift.
Kind of link a lot of our softness to a couple of years ago, we had to reorganize Europe. Europe is just on fire now. The plans really are definitely working in Europe. Europe is doing great. We had over 20% growth in Europe this quarter. So it's a nice thing to see, and our Genomics division had a big part of it. We're also seeing good growth across the board in Asia as well, although smaller, starting to catch on.
And we've mentioned them, our RNAscope and BaseScope, they're also growing nicely. And our high plex -- our multiplex version is starting to grow. We'll get an FFP version of the high plex out here soon. That will really be really needed, I think, and compete well with us out there. And then, of course, DNAscope is coming at the end of this fiscal year, we hope, and that's another platform.
So it's a great pipeline. It's got a lot of legs. Again, we see $200 million, $300 million division here with this technology in our 5-year plan. And it keeps growing at the near 30% growth, it's back to -- it won't take that long."

Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. 
As you read in our press release earlier this morning, I am very pleased to announce that the Bio-Techne team delivered again another strong quarter in our fiscal Q3. Our year-over-year organic growth accelerated 22% for the quarter as we continue to build on momentum from the first half of our fiscal year. This growth was the best organic growth the company has delivered over 25 years, both year-over-year as well as on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
As it has been all year, the growth in Q3 was broad-based across our segments and geographies as penetration into biopharma remained very strong and continued improvement in academia drove the year-over-year and sequential acceleration in our business. The growth between our product categories was also broad-based with most accelerating sequentially from Q2 and continued by leadership from our Simple Plex, Simple Western, cell and gene therapy and genomics platforms. As we've been doing all year, we delivered our record organic growth with a focus on profitability, achieving 40.1% adjusted operating margin for the quarter. The timing of hiring to support growth investments, combined with COVID restricted travel, once again benefited our profitability. However, our positioning in high-growth markets with high gross margin products have strengthened the conviction in our ability to sustain 40% operating margins in the future pursuant to our strategic plan. 
Before we dive deeper into our Q3 performance, I would like to welcome the Asuragen team to Bio-Techne. As a reminder, we announced the Asuragen acquisition in early March and closed the transaction in early April. Asuragen adds a portfolio of leading genetic carrier screening, and oncology research products and diagnostic kits complements our legacy clinical controls business with molecular diagnostic controls and brings a pipeline of high-value products to accelerate its penetration and growth. The Asuragen team also brings deep diagnostic commercialization and regulatory expertise, which we will leverage to accelerate the growth of our clinical platforms across the organization. Unlike many diagnostic companies of its size, Asuragen is already profitable, and we anticipate this business to be accretive to Bio-Techne's top line growth and accretive to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin over time. I look forward to giving you all updates on Asuragen's progress in coming quarters. 
Now let's discuss the performance of our growth platform, starting with the Protein Sciences segment, where growth accelerated to 24% organically in the quarter. Our core proteomic research reagent portfolio had another strong quarter, with research use only proteins growing nearly 10% and antibodies growing in the mid-teens. Our newest proteins are more frequently being used in mRNA research and production. Given the recent success and growing interest in mRNA-based vaccines, these could be a sustainable growth driver for this product line going forward. Meanwhile, our antibody business continues to benefit from our custom antibody service business, which grew over 50% in Q3. 
The catalog of over 6,000 proteins and approximately 450,000 antibody variations, we have amassed not only enabled scientific research, but also has potential therapeutic applications. This potential is supported by the recently announced licensing agreement with Xencor, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies and cytokines for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Xencor is now evaluating a third proprietary Bio-Techne antibody for its therapeutic development pipeline. This agreement speaks to the potential value of vast protein and antibody content we have built over the last 30-plus years and represents a largely untapped potential revenue stream for the company. 
Our leadership in antibodies has also not gone unnoticed in our industry, with Bio-Techne's R&D Systems and Novus brands recently named winners of the CiteAb for COVID-19 Innovation Award. This award celebrates innovative solutions or products that help shape the life sciences sector's understanding of or resilience to COVID-19. The COVID-19 Innovation Award reflects Bio-Techne's quick and impactful response to the COVID-19 pandemic, developing and commercializing new antibodies to support research as well as COVID-19 testing initiatives. This represents the fifth consecutive year of Bio-Techne's antibody innovation efforts have been recognized with the CiteAb Award, and we are very proud of our antibody team. 
During Q3, we also continued to make significant progress advancing our cell and gene therapy initiatives, including our GMP protein business. As a reminder, GMP proteins are a key ingredient in a cell and gene therapy workflow, providing the nutrients to grow the genetically modified cells prior to being infused back into the patient. Our portfolio of GMP proteins increased over 90% in the quarter as customers leveraged our GMP cytokines to advance immune cell and regenerative medicine therapies. 
We continue to scale our state-of-the-art GMP production facility with qualifications completed and production lots of initial proteins currently underway. We have launched a digital marketing campaign to promote the new facility, our capacity and capabilities. This marketing message is resonating with the cell and gene therapy industry as our final potential GMP protein supply agreements with biopharma customers continue to grow in Q3. 
We are also building momentum in market awareness and acceptance of another key component of our cell and gene therapy workflow solution, TcBuster, our novel, nonviral transposon-based gene delivery system. During Q3, we announced the signing of a licensing agreement with Luminary Therapeutics for the use of TcBuster in their development of a BAFF CAR T therapeutic. Our genomic engineering service business, which includes the TcBuster solution, is gaining traction with customers, developing cell and gene therapies with a growing funnel of biopharma companies relying on our experience in hard-to-transfect cell lines to deliver solutions for the complex projects. 
Bio-Techne's reach into cell and gene therapy is much broader than our best-in-class GMP proteins and TcBuster technologies. Biopharma companies, CROs and CDMOs are increasingly relying on offerings across Bio-Techne's portfolio, including antibodies, media and supplements as well as our portfolio of analytical tools, including Simple Western, Simple Plex, RNAscope and our Maurice instrument to develop and scale their cell and gene therapy manufacturing capabilities. We have united our business leaders from across the company to develop strategies on how our products and technologies can be best positioned to create synergistic solutions and maximize productivity for these customers. 
Now let's discuss the proteomic and analytical tools portion of our Protein Sciences segment, where the strength we experienced in recent quarters continued into our Q3. Once again, our automated multiplex immunoassay solution, Simple Plex, had a stellar quarter, with revenue increasing 90% globally. Simple Plex' ability to deliver high-quality and reproducible data with a sub-picogram level of sensitivity in a smaller footprint, comparatively less expensive offering, continues to drive awareness, interest, placements and utilization of the platform. We are seeing increased Simple Plex adoption from cell and gene therapy customers and the broader biopharma industry as they leverage the platform for biomarker discovery, immune cell characterization and quality control processes. 
We also helped accelerate broader adoption in Q3 by expanding Simple Plex' immunoassay cartridge portfolio to include 9 new cartridge formats. These new cartridge offerings provide Simple Plex users with increased flexibility in a number of samples and biomarker assays run on each cartridge. Until now, Simple Plex assay cartridges were only available in formats delivering 1, 4 or 8 assays run simultaneously. The expanded portfolio of cartridge offerings provides users new options to better align their assay panels with the throughput requirements of their studies. 
Finally, to keep up with the high demand for our Simple Plex solution, we have added a second manufacturing shift in Q3 and are in the initial stages of expanding our physical capacity to meet the forecasted demand, and Simple Plex' value proposition continues to resonate with customers in need of a fully automated, cost-effective multiplexing solution. 
It was a similar stellar quarter for our fully automated Western platform, Simple Western, with year-over-year growth accelerating to approximately 50% in Q3. Even with the rapid adoption of Simple Western that we have seen for many quarters now, we continue to invest in the future of this platform and expand its addressable market. For example, we recently introduced the latest number of the Simple Western family, an instrument we call Abby. This lower cost platform offers picogram level sensitivity with the ability to perform a sequential chemo luminescence assays within the same capillary, a feature we introduced in our higher NGS instrument last year called RePlex. Academic customers have been increasingly adopting our automated Western platforms to alleviate COVID-induced limitations on their lab activities and maximize productivity, and we anticipate Abby's features and cost profile to increase penetration of this technology into this customer segment. 
Finally, our biologics instruments, which provide protein purity information and are used directly in bioprocessing, also as a standout quarter with over 30% growth as we continue to experience broad demand from biopharma, including several companies with COVID-19 vaccines in various stages of development or commercialization as well as continued interest from companies working on cell and gene therapies. 
Now I will provide an update on our Diagnostics and Genomics portfolio, where organic revenue increased 17% in Q3. Let's start with an update on our ACD or tissue pathology franchise, where organic revenue increased above 40% for the quarter, with RNAscope, BaseScope and our multiplexing technology, HiPlex, all having a very strong quarter. ACD is seeing significant traction with cell and gene therapy applications, with RNAscope representing the only currently available method for understanding single cell biodistribution information within the context of tissue histology. This information is critical to understanding the safety and efficacy profile of gene and RNAi therapies. And as a result, RNAscope is being used by these companies on many IND-enabling studies. ACD is also being increasingly used as a validation technology following superplexing experiments with the single cell resolution and spatial information provided by our solutions, supporting the move from discovery to translational research. We remain in the early stages of penetrating both the research and clinical potential of this exciting technology and have plenty of room for continued growth. 
As we look ahead to Q4 and FY '22, we are very excited about a new product to the ACD family that we launched recently, which leverages RNAscope technology and expand its addressable market. Bio-Techne's new chromogenic DNA in situ high renovation technology, DNAscope, employs a proven double Z probe design and signal application system of RNAscope, enabling a rapid and flexible probe development for any DNA target and enabling digitalization of targets in formalin, fixed paraffin embedded tissues. DNAscope delivers benefits over current commercial fish techniques that fall short on morphological detail due to the use of fluorescent nuclear staining that rely on a high-resolution microscopy to visualize gene rearrangement and copy number variation signals. Additionally, traditional fish uses bacterial artificial chromosome back colon-based probes that are large and tend to span multiple genes and lack single gene detection specificity. Unlike most commercially available assays, DNAscope utilizes oligo probes, coupled with proprietary signal amplification system, to enable high-resolution and precise target detection for small genomic regions and single gene locals. 
Now let's discuss our Exosome Diagnostics liquid biopsy platform, starting with our prostate cancer liquid biopsy assay, the ExoDx Prostate test. While urology practices have largely reopened at this point, the older population, that is the primary audience for the ExoDx Prostate test, has remained hesitant to visit their doctor or urologists due to COVID-related concerns. Clearly, a headwind to test volume since the pandemic began. 
During Q3, we experienced a continued recovery of ExoDx Prostate test volumes, with March representing the best month for test sample inflow since the beginning of the pandemic. We are encouraged with the volume trajectory we experienced in March and anticipate continued momentum in this business as vaccinations continue to work their way through the population and patients returned to their physicians for checkups and their urologists for our ExoDx Prostate test. 
Private payers are increasingly recognizing the patient benefits and cost savings ExoDx Prostate delivers by avoiding unnecessary biopsies as well as the strong dossier of data we have supporting the efficacy and clinical utility of the test. During Q3, this recognition led to a contracted coverage decision with Humana, the first national payer to issue a favorable coverage decision. We remain in discussions with several other national and regional payers and look forward to expanding access to this test and enabling additional men to make more informed decisions on whether to defer or proceed with prostate biopsy. 
We have also expanded our geographic reach with the ExoDx Prostate test by completing its clinical validation with self-enabled certification as a CE-IVD kit as of March 22, 2021. The [indiscernible] CE test will be performed in our Munich ISO 15 1 89 accredited clinical laboratory and be made available throughout Europe through various distribution channels beginning in Q4. 
In addition to the ExoDx Prostate test, we continue to advance our pipeline of novel Exosome-based liquid biopsy products. In Q3, we announced initial data on our next commercial test, Exo TRU, an assay designed to detect kidney transplant rejection. Initial data supporting the potential of Exo TRU was published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, with the assay capable of discriminating between any cause rejection and no rejection with a negative predictive value of 93.3% and positive predictive value of 77.8%. We view this initial data as best-in-class compared to competing kidney transplant rejection assays. 
Exo TRU is not just differentiated with best-in-class data. This test uses urine, not blood, as the sample which opens up opportunities for at-home sample collection, allowing these immuno uncompromised patients to the ability to take the test in the comfort of their home and avoid a trip to the hospital for a blood draw. We look forward to launching Exo TRU later in calendar 2021. 
The COVID-related headwinds and restrictions have not just impacted our Exosome Dx test volumes, with patients deferring routine business to physicians also impacting broader diagnostic testing volumes. Despite these ongoing challenges, our Diagnostic Reagents division increased mid-single digits during Q3. This is the seventh quarter in a row that our Diagnostic Reagents division has delivered positive growth as the development pipeline and new COVID-related opportunities continue to smooth out the impact of what can sometimes be lumpy bulk reagent orders. 
I'd like to now give an update on our COVID-19 initiative. Since the start of the pandemic, Bio-Techne's reagents and instruments have enabled insights into the virus, including ACD probes, to detect the virus in tissue, sales of bulk diagnostic reagents used in COVID testing applications as well as pathogen specific by antibodies and proteins to known variance of the COVID virus. COVID was an estimated 3% tailwind to our business in Q3, including initial revenue from sales of the Kantaro IgG antibody serology kit. We expect the COVID research and diagnostics will be around for many years, particularly as new viral strands continue to emerge, making this tailwind as sustaining new layer of our product portfolio going forward. 
Our business is clearly firing on all cylinders. Our innovative portfolio of proteomic reagents -- research reagents and analytical tools, tissue biopsy and spatial products are meeting the productivity needs of the scientific community to drive research and discoveries forward. Our emerging cell and gene therapy workflow solutions are set to enable the next class of biological therapies with increased efficiency at lower cost. And our liquid biopsy platform is expanding with the best-in-class assay for kidney transplant patients in need of a better solution for detecting allograft rejection. Layer on this, a favorable research funding environment, and I believe Bio-Techne is in the best position ever, or at least since I've been with the company, to deliver on our long-term revenue and profitability aspirations, which keeps getting bigger every year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."
189488,710460233,2272538,"Bio-Techne Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Bio-Techne Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q3 fiscal 2021 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of our fiscal year. Starting",1530,"Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q3 fiscal 2021 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of our fiscal year. 
Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $1.79 versus $1.39 1 year ago, an increase of 29% over last year, representing a new company record. Foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS by $0.04. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.12 compared to $0.92 in the prior year, representing a 22% increase year-over-year. Q3 revenue was $243.6 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year on a reported basis and 22% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 3% impact on our revenue. 
All geographies had strong growth in Q3, led by China growing nearly 50%, followed by EMEA with over 30% growth and in the Americas with growth north of 20%. The rest of the world grew in the low teens. 
You will recall that last year was the start of a pandemic, which severely hit China and, to a slightly lesser extent, Europe in our Q3 fiscal year '20. Our business in the U.S. was not materially impacted by pandemic shutdowns until April of last year. Hence, the comps in Q3 this year were easier in China and Europe than the U.S. That being said, China's revenue in Q3 of this year was still nearly [ 60% ] higher than the same quarter in fiscal year '19, and Europe's revenue was over 20% higher than Q3 of fiscal year '19, while the Americas revenue is up over 35% from the same quarter in fiscal year '19. 
By end market, biopharma continues to be very strong with year-over-year growth well over 25%, while academia continues to make big improvements, growing approximately 20% for the quarter compared to last year. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 72.9% in the quarter compared to 71.5% in the prior year. The increase is primarily driven by favorable product mix and volume leverage. 
Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 25.8% of revenue, a 100 basis point decrease compared to the prior year, and R&D expense in Q3 was 7% of revenue, 120 basis points lower than the prior year. While our adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increased sequentially and versus the prior year, a tight labor market in the life science space did not allow us to fill all planned headcount additions to the team at the pace we had anticipated, especially in the more technical scientific and engineering fields. However, our pace of hiring did increase over the course of Q3, and we still plan to fill remain open positions in Q4. This investment in critical human capital position the company for growth going forward. 
The resulting adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 40.1%, an increase of [ 360 ] basis points from the prior year and 140 basis point sequential improvement from Q2, the highest adjusted operating margin for the company in 6 years. 
Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q3 was $2.5 million, decreasing $1.7 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt during fiscal 2021 as well as lower floating rates. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q3 stood at $215.4 million. Other adjusted nonoperating expense was $4.1 million for the quarter compared to $3 million of income in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. 
For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income included unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 20.2%, a 110 basis point improvement over the prior year, with the improvement primarily driven by geographic mix. We expect our effective tax rate going forward to be consistent with Q3, barring no changes in corporate tax law. Note that the GAAP effective tax rate in Q3 was favorably impacted by the discrete timing of stock option exercises. 
As a reminder, during Q2, we made a strategic equity investment in China-based Eminence, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services to the Chinese biopharmaceutical market. The $380,000 noncontrolling interest line item on the P&L reflects the loss on the portion of Eminence we do not own. The impact to other lines of the P&L as a result of consolidating Eminence was immaterial in Q3. 
Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $74.9 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, more than a 50% increase over the prior year. In Q3, our net investment in capital expenditures was $10.6 million. And during Q3, we returned $55.6 million of capital to shareholders by a way of $12.4 million in dividends and $43.2 million in stock buyback. We finished Q3 with 40.7 million average diluted shares outstanding. 
Our balance sheet finished Q3 in a very strong position with $276.2 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments and essentially 0 net debt leverage position. 
Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q3 reported sales were $185.6 million, with reported revenue increasing 28%. Organic growth increased 24%, with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 4% on revenue growth. Within the segment, the strong growth was very broad-based with double-digit growth in nearly all reagent assay and instrument platforms. As Chuck described in his remarks, platforms of [indiscernible] mention include Simple Plex, Simple Western, biologics and cell and gene therapy, especially pertaining to GMP proteins as well as our core proteomic reagent business. 
Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 47.6%, an increase of 290 basis points year-over-year due primarily to favorable volume leverage and cost management. 
Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q3 reported sales were $58.1 million, with reported revenue increasing 18%. Organic growth of the segment was 17%, with foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. Similar to the first half of our fiscal year, our Genomics division led this segment in the quarter. We experienced strength across the entire ACD branded portfolio with RNAscope, miRNAscope, BaseScope in our diagnostic partnership with Leica all driving growth. 
Exosome Diagnostics Q3 revenue increased over 20% from last year, with strong revenue from our companion diagnostic partnerships, driving the growth as our ExoDx Prostate test continue to recover from the pandemic lows experienced in our fiscal Q4 of last year. And as Chuck mentioned, our Diagnostics Reagents division continued its growth streak by executing on COVID-related opportunities to offset the headwind and many of its traditional OEM diagnostic customers are facing with patients forgoing routine visits to the doctor. 
Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 17.9%. The segment's operating margin improved [ 360 ] basis points compared to the prior year. The increase reflects strong volume leverage in our Genomics division as well as strong cost management across the segment. 
In summary, the momentum we experienced in the first half of our fiscal 2021 accelerated during Q3. With 17% organic revenue growth year-to-date, our products remain at the forefront of science, enabling cutting-edge scientific and therapeutic discoveries, while our key growth drivers remain underpenetrated in large and growing markets. 
We believe that COVID pandemic has elevated the profile and market awareness of our tools and solution offerings, positioning Bio-Techne to exit the pandemic stronger than before the pandemic hit. This brings us to our thoughts on how we might close the year. In short, for our base business, we see Q4 looking very strong and similar to Q3, both on the top line in terms of absolute revenue and on bottom line in terms of adjusted EPS. 
With most of our customers, both in biopharma and academia, now back to work, and with the need and priority to fund medical research still high in both the private and public sector, we see the strong revenue run rate we experienced in Q3 continuing into Q4. To fuel and support further revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond, it is critical that we catch up on the growth investments that were in our strategic plan to accomplish this year. 
As I've already mentioned, we made good progress at the end of Q3 on hiring the human capital needed, and we see that continuing into Q4 as we fully expect our adjusted operating margins to finish sequentially lower than Q3 but still significantly higher than the prior year as well as higher than previous analyst consensus estimates. 
Also, we expect the acquisition of Asuragen in April to contribute 2% to 3% sequentially more revenue on top of our base business in Q4. However, as Asuragen has just recently become profitable, it will likely be dilutive to our overall adjusted operating margins in Q4 by approximately 100 basis points. 
That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Maria to open the line for questions."

And then how should we think about building out the portfolio there? And the reason I ask is because if I'm thinking about the situation right, it sounds like one of the key factors that will influence the ramp will just be the pace of expansion of the catalog. So can you just sort of touch on growing the product set there such that you feel like that will be less of a limiting factor than it might be in the near term?"

I'll start kind of from the back forward. It won't be a limitation of the catalog. We've got the most full GMP catalog already in the world.

It won't be a limitation of the catalog. We've got the most full GMP catalog already in the world. It's just a matter of qualification and getting in inventory. So the issue is all commercial, and it's all waiting for this industry to really happen. So we've had a really good quarter. We're further along with a dozen or so customers. We've talked about a couple of we've locked in already. It's hard for them to, to talk about forecasts and numbers and stuff. So we've contracted in terms of presence, and we've had issue with contracting it at 95% of their needs, whatever they needs be. And I've talked in the past about they range anywhere from $10 million a year to over $50 million of just like a single protein. So we're making progress. We're also getting help because with ScaleReady out there, we've got a dozen different people in commercial between sales and technical. They're starting to drive more interest in awareness, and that's also helping find our way to more potential business more quickly. 
It's still a J curve like we've talked about. I mean -- so you've been keeping track of the model, and we've been talking about the growth rate. So you can do the math, and you'll see that we're at a $15 million, $16 million run rate right now at GMP proteins. I've talked in the past that even on this site here, Minneapolis headquarters, we can make as much as $40 million. So we've got plenty of time here before we exhaust our capacity before we have to have this factory turned on. And we've slipped a couple of months, but we're looking at September, October to be selling out inventory, but we're qualifying and making lots right now. So we're in good place. 
It's more about what do we got to do for commercial [indiscernible] to accelerate, and they come in 2 varieties. They come in new specs for new indications coming, which you've got a pretty good pipeline of stuff and then doing a conversion of things that are in clinicals right now and going through -- talking them into equivalency studies. So if they have nothing else, at least a backup protein. So we're making progress on all those fronts, and it has really nothing to do with the catalog. We've got the best catalog and the best proteins. We can make anything you heard about that's needed out there for GMP proteins. 
And as I've mentioned also before, I think what the world thinks they need today, I think, in 5 years will be radically different. And who would you rather put your trust in, the world leader in protein design or people who focus more on instruments or other parts of the workflow? I think over time, these proteins are going to continue to differentiate themselves for different reasons and where it's going to play to our strength because we make the best protein in the world, period.

So whether you talk about for the year or take it for 2 years, it's double digit for 2 years, too, almost teens. 
So -- and then you got to talk about, well, we're hitting on all cylinders. Everything is growing amazingly well. It speaks to the industry. It speaks to the funding. It speaks to us crossing all these tipping points as a company. It speaks to our digital presence and our investments and just the awareness of our company and our platform. The quality has always been there in a lot of our brands, but we're expanding it. It speaks to us being able to entice companies to come on board like Asuragen. I don't think we could have talked them they come on board 3, 4 years ago. They see the candy in the store, and they want it. They want to help out. So we see in the Q1 and Q2 and our further next year, probably is not a 20% year, but it's going to be strong. And right now, it's too early to talk about what that could be.

Sure enough, they're talking 21% starting fiscal October. It's going to be big. And this is about [indiscernible]. This is just oncology and even neuroscience, the traditional funding from NIH. 
COVID is going to be another layer, and there's a halo effect of all of this. The vaccine mix, they're all buying. Everyone is exploding. There's a halo effect off of all that. And it all starts with proteins and antibodies and assays. What can I say? I think high single-digit growth at a minimum going forward, and we've been exceeding that, as you know. We kind of look silly because we've been double digit here for quite a few quarters. So..."

We don't have to worry about the pathologists that drive the urologists with being paid per sample off a biopsy. There's a lot of converting to do in Exosome Diagnostics. And we're doing it. We're growing and cranking. It's going to be sticky, but it's going to take some time. The Exo TRU, kidney rejection, there's only 100 centers. They're very regionally located. 85% of all the work is just in the top-tier of them. So this is why it's important to have an at home collection potential because a lot of these patients are going to actually traveling a lot every couple of months to get these -- to get their new kidney checked, and now they don't have to. Now they can send in urine. It's simple. 
So we don't have a big commercial plan. It's going to be like a key account model. There's going to be a half a dozen different reps. We'll probably hire some heavy hitters that are well-known in the industry and go to work. So -- and right now, we got some good news, right? I mean we got [indiscernible] offering up being a [ CareDx ] as a solution. There's a lot more, I guess, acceptance of the LDT just in general for this issue of kidney rejection. And if we can get our -- if we get NGS to abide by this opening, it's going to actually accelerate our process, our [indiscernible] process. So we don't know yet, but we're talking to NGS, and they've been very supportive so far and very open and they're very very interested. They like the data. They like the publication we've done already. And I'm hoping and expecting this will be a much smoother commercial transition than ExoDx was for prostate, to be honest."

As you read in our press release earlier this morning, I am very pleased to announce that the Bio-Techne team delivered again another strong quarte",2624,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. 
As you read in our press release earlier this morning, I am very pleased to announce that the Bio-Techne team delivered again another strong quarter in our fiscal Q3. Our year-over-year organic growth accelerated 22% for the quarter as we continue to build on momentum from the first half of our fiscal year. This growth was the best organic growth the company has delivered in over 25 years, both year-over-year as well as on a 2-year CAGR basis. 
As it has been all year, the growth in Q3 was broad-based across our segments and geographies as penetration into biopharma remained very strong and continued improvement in academia drove the year-over-year and sequential acceleration in our business. The growth between our product categories was also broad-based with most accelerating sequentially from Q2 and continued by leadership from our Simple Plex, Simple Western, cell and gene therapy and Genomics platforms. As we've been doing all year, we delivered our record organic growth with a focus on profitability, achieving 40.1% adjusted operating margin for the quarter. The timing of hiring to support growth investments, combined with COVID-restricted travel, once again benefited our profitability. However, our positioning in high-growth markets with high gross margin products have strengthened the conviction in our ability to sustain 40% operating margins in the future pursuant to our strategic plan. 
Before we dive deeper into our Q3 performance, I would like to welcome the Asuragen team to Bio-Techne. As a reminder, we announced the Asuragen acquisition in early March and closed the transaction in early April. Asuragen adds a portfolio of leading genetic carrier screening, and oncology research products and diagnostic kits complements our legacy Clinical Controls business with molecular diagnostic controls and brings a pipeline of high-value products to accelerate its penetration and growth. The Asuragen team also brings deep diagnostic commercialization and regulatory expertise, which we will leverage to accelerate the growth of our clinical platforms across the organization. 
Unlike many diagnostic companies of its size, Asuragen is already profitable, and we anticipate this business to be accretive to Bio-Techne's top line growth and accretive to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin over time. I look forward to giving you all updates on Asuragen's progress in coming quarters. 
Now let's discuss the performance of our growth platform, starting with the Protein Sciences segment, where growth accelerated to 24% organically in the quarter. Our core proteomic research reagent portfolio had another strong quarter, with research use only proteins growing nearly 10% and antibodies growing in the mid-teens. Our newest proteins are more frequently being used in mRNA research and production. Given the recent success and growing interest in mRNA-based vaccines, this could be a sustainable growth driver for this product line going forward. Meanwhile, our antibody business continues to benefit from our custom antibody service business, which grew over 50% in Q3. 
The catalog of over 6,000 proteins and approximately 450,000 antibody variations, we have amassed not only enabled scientific research, but also has potential therapeutic applications. This potential is supported by the recently announced licensing agreement with Xencor, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies and cytokines for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Xencor is now evaluating a third proprietary Bio-Techne antibody for its therapeutic development pipeline. This agreement speaks to the potential value of vast protein and antibody content we have built over the last 30-plus years and represents a largely untapped potential revenue stream for the company. 
Our leadership in antibodies has also not gone unnoticed in our industry, with Bio-Techne's R&D Systems and Novus brands recently named winners of the CiteAb for COVID-19 Innovation Award. This award celebrates innovative solutions or products that help shape the life sciences sector's understanding of or resilience to COVID-19. The COVID-19 Innovation Award reflects Bio-Techne's quick and impactful response to the COVID-19 pandemic, developing and commercializing new antibodies to support research as well as COVID-19 testing initiatives. This represents the fifth consecutive year of Bio-Techne's antibody innovation efforts have been recognized with the CiteAb Award, and we are very proud of our antibody team. 
During Q3, we also continued to make significant progress advancing our cell and gene therapy initiatives, including our GMP protein business. As a reminder, GMP proteins are a key ingredient in a cell and gene therapy workflow, providing the nutrients to grow the genetically modified cells prior to being infused back into the patient. Our portfolio of GMP proteins increased over 90% in the quarter as customers leveraged our GMP cytokines to advance immune cell and regenerative medicine therapies. 
We continue to scale our state-of-the-art GMP production facility with qualifications completed and production lots of initial proteins currently underway. We have launched a digital marketing campaign to promote the new facility, our capacity and capabilities. This marketing message is resonating with the cell and gene therapy industry as our final potential GMP protein supply agreements with biopharma customers continue to grow in Q3. 
We are also building momentum in market awareness and acceptance of another key component of our cell and gene therapy workflow solution, TcBuster, our novel, nonviral transposon-based gene delivery system. During Q3, we announced the signing of a licensing agreement with Luminary Therapeutics for the use of TcBuster in their development of a BAFF- CAR-T therapeutic. Our genomic engineering service business, which includes the TcBuster solution, is gaining traction with customers, developing cell and gene therapies with a growing funnel of biopharma companies, relying on our experience in hard-to-transfect cell lines to deliver solutions for the complex projects. 
Bio-Techne's reach into cell and gene therapy is much broader than our best-in-class GMP proteins and TcBuster technologies. Biopharma companies, CROs and CDMOs are increasingly relying on offerings across Bio-Techne's portfolio, including antibodies, media and supplements as well as our portfolio of analytical tools, including Simple Western, Simple Plex, RNAscope and our Maurice instrument to develop and scale their cell and gene therapy manufacturing capabilities. We have united our business leaders from across the company to develop strategies on how our products and technologies can be best positioned to create synergistic solutions and maximize productivity for these customers. 
Now let's discuss the proteomic and analytical tools portion of our Protein Sciences segment, where the strength we experienced in recent quarters continued into our Q3. Once again, our automated multiplex immunoassay solution, Simple Plex, had a stellar quarter, with revenue increasing 90% globally. Simple Plex' ability to deliver high-quality and reproducible data with a sub-picogram level of sensitivity in a smaller footprint, comparatively less expensive offering, continues to drive awareness, interest, placements and utilization of the platform. We are seeing increased Simple Plex adoption from cell and gene therapy customers and the broader biopharma industry as they leverage the platform for biomarker discovery, immune cell characterization and quality control processes. 
We also helped accelerate broader adoption in Q3 by expanding Simple Plex' immunoassay cartridge portfolio to include 9 new cartridge formats. These new cartridge offerings provide Simple Plex users with increased flexibility in a number of samples and biomarker assays run on each cartridge. Until now, Simple Plex assay cartridges were only available in formats delivering 1, 4 or 8 assays run simultaneously. The expanded portfolio of cartridge offerings provides users new options to better align their assay panels with the throughput requirements of their studies. 
Finally, to keep up with the high demand for our Simple Plex solution, we have added a second manufacturing shift in Q3 and are in the initial stages of expanding our physical capacity to meet the forecasted demand, as Simple Plex' value proposition continues to resonate with customers in need of a fully automated, cost-effective multiplexing solution. 
It was a similar stellar quarter for our fully automated Western platform, Simple Western, with year-over-year growth accelerating to approximately 50% in Q3. Even with the rapid adoption of Simple Western that we have seen for many quarters now, we continue to invest in the future of this platform and expand its addressable market. For example, we recently introduced the latest number of the Simple Western family, an instrument we call Abby. This lower-cost platform offers picogram level sensitivity with the ability to perform sequential chemiluminescent assays within the same capillary, a feature we introduced in our higher-end Jess instrument last year called RePlex. Academic customers have been increasingly adopting our automated Western platforms to alleviate COVID-induced limitations on their lab activities and maximize productivity, and we anticipate Abby's features and cost profile to increase penetration of this technology into this customer segment. 
Finally, our biologics instruments, which provide protein purity information and are used directly in bioprocessing, also had a standout quarter with over 30% growth as we continue to experience broad demand from biopharma, including several companies with COVID-19 vaccines in various stages of development or commercialization as well as continued interest from companies working on cell and gene therapies. 
Now I will provide an update on our Diagnostics and Genomics portfolio, where organic revenue increased 17% in Q3. Let's start with an update on our ACD or tissue pathology franchise, where organic revenue increased above 40% for the quarter, with RNAscope, BaseScope and our multiplexing technology, HiPlex, all having a very strong quarter. ACD is seeing significant traction with cell and gene therapy applications, with RNAscope representing the only currently available method for understanding single cell biodistribution information within the context of tissue histology. This information is critical to understanding the safety and efficacy profile of gene and RNAi therapies. And as a result, RNAscope is being used by these companies on many IND-enabling studies. 
ACD is also being increasingly used as a validation technology following superplexing experiments with the single cell resolution and spatial information provided by our solutions, supporting the move from discovery to translational research. We remain in the early stages of penetrating both the research and clinical potential of this exciting technology and have plenty of room for continued growth. 
As we look ahead to Q4 and FY '22, we are very excited about a new product to the ACD family that we launched recently, which leverages RNAscope technology and expand its addressable market. Bio-Techne's new chromogenic DNA in situ hybridization technology, DNAscope, employs a proven double-Z probe design and signal amplification system of RNAscope, enabling a rapid and flexible probe development for any DNA target and enabling visualization of targets in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. DNAscope delivers benefits over current commercial FISH techniques that fall short on morphological details due to the use of fluorescent nuclear staining that rely on a high-resolution microscopy to visualize gene rearrangement and copy number variation signals. 
Additionally, traditional, FISH uses bacterial artificial chromosome back cone-based probes that are large and tend to span multiple genes and lack single gene detection specificity. Unlike most commercially available assays, DNAscope utilizes oligo probes, coupled with proprietary signal amplification system, to enable high resolution and precise target detection for small genomic regions in single gene locus. 
Now let's discuss our Exosome Diagnostics liquid biopsy platform, starting with our prostate cancer liquid biopsy assay, the ExoDx Prostate test. While urology practices have largely reopened at this point, the older population, that is the primary audience for the ExoDx Prostate test, has remained hesitant to visit their doctor or urologists due to COVID-related concerns. Clearly, a headwind to test volume since the pandemic began. 
During Q3, we experienced a continued recovery of ExoDx Prostate test volumes, with March representing the best month for test sample inflow since the beginning of the pandemic. We are encouraged with the volume trajectory we experienced in March and anticipate continued momentum in this business as vaccinations continue to work their way through the population and patients return to their physicians for checkups and their urologists for our ExoDx Prostate test. 
Private payers are increasingly recognizing the patient benefits and cost savings ExoDx Prostate delivers by avoiding unnecessary biopsies as well as the strong dossier of data we have supporting the efficacy and clinical utility of the test. During Q3, this recognition led to a contracted coverage decision with Humana, the first national payer to issue a favorable coverage decision. We remain in discussions with several other national and regional payers and look forward to expanding access to this test and enabling additional men to make more informed decisions on whether to defer or proceed with prostate biopsy. 
We have also expanded our geographic reach with the ExoDx Prostate test by completing its clinical validation with self-enabled certification as a CE-IVD kit as of March 22, 2021. The EPI CE tests will be performed in our Munich ISO 15189-accredited clinical laboratory and be made available throughout Europe through various distribution channels beginning in Q4. 
In addition to the ExoDx Prostate test, we continue to advance our pipeline of novel exosome-based liquid biopsy products. In Q3, we announced initial data on our next commercial test, ExoTRU, an assay designed to detect kidney transplant rejection. Initial data supporting the potential of ExoTRU was published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, with the assay capable of discriminating between any cause rejection and no rejection with a negative predictive value of 93.3% and positive predictive value of 77.8%. We view this initial data as best-in-class compared to competing kidney transplant rejection assays. 
ExoTRU is not just differentiated with best-in-class data. This test uses urine, not blood, as the sample which opens up opportunities for at-home sample collection, allowing these immuno-uncompromised patients to the ability to take the test in the comfort of their home and avoid a trip to the hospital for a blood draw. We look forward to launching ExoTRU later in calendar 2021. 
The COVID-related headwinds and restrictions have not just impacted our ExosomeDx test volumes, with patients deferring routine visits to physicians also impacting broader diagnostic testing volumes. Despite these ongoing challenges, our Diagnostic Reagents division increased mid-single digits during Q3. This is the seventh quarter in a row that our Diagnostic Reagents division has delivered positive growth, as the development pipeline and new COVID-related opportunities continue to smooth out the impact of what can sometimes be lumpy bulk reagent orders. 
I'd like to now give an update on our COVID-19 initiatives. Since the start of the pandemic, Bio-Techne's reagents and instruments have enabled insights into the virus, including ACD probes to detect the virus in tissue, sales of bulk diagnostic reagents used in COVID testing applications as well as pathogen-specific by antibodies and proteins to known variants of the COVID virus. COVID was an estimated 3% tailwind to our business in Q3, including initial revenue from sales of the Kantaro IgG antibody serology kit. We expect the COVID research and diagnostics will be around for many years, particularly as new viral strains continue to emerge, making this tailwind a sustained new layer of our product portfolio going forward. 
Our business is clearly firing on all cylinders. Our innovative portfolio of proteomic reagents -- research reagents and analytical tools, tissue biopsy and spatial products are meeting the productivity needs of the scientific community to drive research and discoveries forward. Our emerging cell and gene therapy workflow solutions are set to enable the next class of biological therapies with increased efficiency at lower cost. And our liquid biopsy platform is expanding with the best-in-class assay for kidney transplant patients in need of a better solution for detecting allograft rejection. Layer on this, a favorable research funding environment, and I believe Bio-Techne is in the best position ever, or at least since I've been with the company, to deliver on our long-term revenue and profitability aspirations, which keeps getting bigger every year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

I will provide an overview of our Q3 fiscal 2021 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of our fiscal year. Starting",1519,"Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q3 fiscal 2021 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of our fiscal year. 
Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $1.79 versus $1.39 1 year ago, an increase of 29% over last year, representing a new company record. Foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS by $0.04. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.12 compared to $0.92 in the prior year, representing a 22% increase year-over-year. Q3 revenue was $243.6 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year on a reported basis and 22% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 3% impact on our revenue. 
All geographies had strong growth in Q3, led by China growing nearly 50%, followed by EMEA with over 30% growth and in the Americas with growth north of 20%. The rest of the world grew in the low teens. 
You will recall that last year was the start of a pandemic, which severely hit China and, to a slightly lesser extent, Europe in our Q3 fiscal year '20. Our business in the U.S. was not materially impacted by pandemic shutdowns until April of last year. Hence, the comps in Q3 this year were easier in China and Europe than the U.S. That being said, China's revenue in Q3 of this year was still nearly 60% higher than the same quarter in fiscal year '19, and Europe's revenue was over 20% higher than Q3 of fiscal year '19, while the Americas revenue is up over 35% from the same quarter in fiscal year '19. 
By end market, biopharma continues to be very strong with year-over-year growth well over 25%, while academia continues to make big improvements, growing approximately 20% for the quarter compared to last year. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 72.9% in the quarter compared to 71.5% in the prior year. The increase is primarily driven by favorable product mix and volume leverage. 
Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 25.8% of revenue, a 100 basis point decrease compared to the prior year, and R&D expense in Q3 was 7% of revenue, 120 basis points lower than the prior year. While our adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increased sequentially and versus the prior year, a tight labor market in the life science space did not allow us to fill all planned headcount additions to the team at the pace we had anticipated, especially in the more technical scientific and engineering fields. However, our pace of hiring did increase over the course of Q3, and we still plan to fill remaining open positions in Q4. This investment in critical human capital position the company for growth going forward. 
The resulting adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 40.1%, an increase of 360 basis points from the prior year and 140 basis point sequential improvement from Q2, the highest adjusted operating margin for the company in 6 years. 
Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q3 was $2.5 million, decreasing $1.7 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt during fiscal 2021 as well as lower floating rates. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q3 stood at $215.4 million. Other adjusted nonoperating expense was $4.1 million for the quarter compared to $3 million of income in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. 
For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income included unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 20.2%, a 110 basis point improvement over the prior year, with the improvement primarily driven by geographic mix. We expect our effective tax rate going forward to be consistent with Q3, barring no changes in corporate tax law. Note that the GAAP effective tax rate in Q3 was favorably impacted by the discrete timing of stock option exercises. 
As a reminder, during Q2, we made a strategic equity investment in China-based Eminence, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services to the Chinese biopharmaceutical market. The $380,000 noncontrolling interest line item on the P&L reflects the loss on the portion of Eminence we do not own. The impact to other lines of the P&L as a result of consolidating Eminence was immaterial in Q3. 
Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $74.9 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, more than a 50% increase over the prior year. In Q3, our net investment in capital expenditures was $10.6 million. And during Q3, we returned $55.6 million of capital to shareholders by way of $12.4 million in dividends and $43.2 million in stock buyback. We finished Q3 with 40.7 million average diluted shares outstanding. 
Our balance sheet finished Q3 in a very strong position with $276.2 million in cash and short-term available-for-sale investments and essentially 0 net debt leverage position. 
Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q3 reported sales were $185.6 million, with reported revenue increasing 28%. Organic growth increased 24%, with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 4% on revenue growth. Within the segment, the strong growth was very broad-based with double-digit growth in nearly all reagent assay and instrument platforms. As Chuck described in his remarks, platforms of notable mention include Simple Plex, Simple Western, biologics and cell and gene therapy, especially pertaining to GMP proteins as well as our core proteomic reagent business. 
Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 47.6%, an increase of 290 basis points year-over-year due primarily to favorable volume leverage and cost management. 
Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q3 reported sales were $58.1 million, with reported revenue increasing 18%. Organic growth of the segment was 17%, with foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. Similar to the first half of our fiscal year, our Genomics division led this segment in the quarter. We experienced strength across the entire ACD-branded portfolio with RNAscope, miRNAscope, BaseScope and our diagnostic partnership with Leica, all driving growth. 
Exosome Diagnostics Q3 revenue increased over 20% from last year, with strong revenue from our companion diagnostic partnerships, driving the growth as our ExoDx Prostate test continue to recover from the pandemic lows experienced in our fiscal Q4 of last year. And as Chuck mentioned, our Diagnostics Reagents division continued its growth streak by executing on COVID-related opportunities to offset the headwinds many of its traditional OEM diagnostic customers are facing with patients forgoing routine visits to the doctors. 
Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 17.9%. The segment's operating margin improved 360 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase reflects strong volume leverage in our Genomics division as well as strong cost management across the segment. 
In summary, the momentum we experienced in the first half of our fiscal 2021 accelerated during Q3. With 17% organic revenue growth year-to-date, our products remain at the forefront of science, enabling cutting-edge scientific and therapeutic discoveries, while our key growth drivers remain underpenetrated in large and growing markets. 
We believe that COVID pandemic has elevated the profile and market awareness of our tools and solution offerings, positioning Bio-Techne to exit the pandemic stronger than before the pandemic hit. This brings us to our thoughts on how we might close the year. In short, for our base business, we see Q4 looking very strong and similar to Q3, both on the top line in terms of absolute revenue and on bottom line in terms of adjusted EPS. 
With most of our customers, both in biopharma and academia, now back to work, and with the need and priority to fund medical research still high in both the private and public sector, we see the strong revenue run rate we experienced in Q3 continuing into Q4. To fuel and support further revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond, it is critical that we catch up on the growth investments that were in our strategic plan to accomplish this year. 
As I've already mentioned, we made good progress at the end of Q3 on hiring the human capital needed, and we see that continuing into Q4, as we fully expect our adjusted operating margins to finish sequentially lower than Q3 but still significantly higher than the prior year as well as higher than previous analysts' consensus estimates. 
Also, we expect the acquisition of Asuragen in April to contribute 2% to 3% sequentially more revenue on top of our base business in Q4. However, as Asuragen has just recently become profitable, it will likely be dilutive to our overall adjusted operating margins in Q4 by approximately 100 basis points. 
That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Maria to open the line for questions."

Can you just talk a bit about the early days of servicing your customers with the expanded GMP capabilities? Are you seeing the orders come in the way that you'd hoped? And then how should we think about building out the portfolio there? And the reason I ask is because if I'm thinking about the situation right, it sounds like one of the key factors that will influence the ramp will just be the pace of expansion of the catalog. So can you just sort of touch on growing the product set there such that you feel like that will be less of a limiting factor than it might be in the near term?"

I'll start kind of from the back forward. It won't be a limitation of the catalog. We've got the most full GMP catalog already in the world.

It won't be a limitation of the catalog. We've got the most full GMP catalog already in the world. It's just a matter of qualification and getting in inventory. So the issue is all commercial, and it's all waiting for this industry to really happen. So we've had a really good quarter. We're further along with a dozen or so customers. We've talked about a couple of we've locked in already. It's hard for them to, to talk about forecasts and numbers and stuff. So we've contracted in terms of percents, and we've had no issue with contracting at 95% of their needs, whatever their needs be. 
And I've talked in the past about they range anywhere from $10 million a year to over $50 million of just like a single protein. So we're making progress. We're also getting help because with ScaleReady out there, we've got a dozen different people in commercial between sales and technical. They're starting to drive more interest and awareness, and that's also helping find our way to more potential business more quickly. 
It's still a J curve like we've talked about. I mean -- so you've been keeping track of the model, and we've been talking about the growth rate. So you can do the math, and you'll see that we're at a $15 million, $16 million run rate right now at GMP proteins. I've talked in the past that even on this site here, Minneapolis headquarters, we can make as much as $40 million. So we've got plenty of time here before we exhaust our capacity before we have to have this factory turned on. And we've slipped a couple of months, but we're looking at September, October to be selling out inventory, but we're qualifying and making lots right now. So we're in good place. 
It's more about what do we got to do for commercialization to accelerate, and they come in 2 varieties. They come in new specs for new indications coming, which you've got a pretty good pipeline of stuff and then doing a conversion of things that are in clinicals right now and going through -- talking them into equivalency studies. So if they have nothing else, at least a backup protein. So we're making progress on all those fronts, and it has really nothing to do with the catalog. We've got the best catalog and the best proteins. We can make anything you heard about that's needed out there for GMP proteins. 
And as I've mentioned also before, I think what the world thinks they need today, I think, in 5 years will be radically different. And who would you rather put your trust in, the world leader in protein design or people who focus more on instruments or other parts of the workflow? I think over time, these proteins are going to continue to differentiate themselves for different reasons and where it's going to play to our strength because we make the best protein in the world, period.

We keep expanding our analyte lines, so the things that go in the cartridges for the customers. So we're giving them more flexibility. But it really comes down, like I said, it's biomarker discovery. It's QC applications. It's being looked at and being highly received by cell and gene therapy applications. 
So all these things are way beyond our expectations 4 or 5 years ago. And then there are diagnostics applications that we really are just getting started on. We're in the middle of a 510(k) per process. Of course, we've got the partner in China, and they're going through their own. So this thing is one of the big sleepers of our company, and we've got to get a new building. We've got to expand capacity. It's more than just adding shifts. We are all over this, right up there with exosome being the #1 -- #2 priorities in the company, and we expect momentum to continue. 
We are now well over 500 boxes out there. That's kind of a tipping point where things start selling themselves. People start seeing them. The word of mouth gets out.

So -- and then you got to talk about, well, we're hitting on all cylinders. Everything is growing amazingly well. It speaks to the industry. It speaks to the funding. It speaks to us crossing all these tipping points as a company. It speaks to our digital presence and our investments and just the awareness of our company and our platform. The quality has always been there in a lot of our brands, but we're expanding it. It speaks to us being able to entice companies to come on board like Asuragen. I don't think we could have talked them they come on board 3, 4 years ago. They see the candy in the store, and they want it. They want to help out. 
So we see in the Q1 and Q2 and our further next year, probably is not a 20% year, but it's going to be strong. And right now, it's too early to talk about what that could be. We've listened to all the other peers out there, and everyone is staying kind of shy about next year. Comps are going to be tough. But you got to look at the market indicators. They're crazy good. And we're going to be good."

They're very regionally located. 85% of all the work is just in the top-tier of them. 
So this is why it's important to have an at-home collection potential because a lot of these patients are going to actually traveling a lot every couple of months to get these -- to get their new kidney checked, and now they don't have to. Now they can send in urine. It's simple. 
So we don't have a big commercial plan. It's going to be like a key account model. There's going to be a half a dozen different reps. We'll probably hire some heavy hitters that are well-known in the industry and go to work. So -- and right now, we got some good news, right? I mean we got MolDX offering up via -- being CareDx as a solution. There's a lot more, I guess, acceptance of the LDT just in general for this issue of kidney rejection. And if we can get our -- if we get NGS to abide by this opening, it's going to actually accelerate our process, all this process. So we don't know yet, but we're talking to NGS, and they've been very supportive so far and very open and they're very, very interested. They like the data. They like the publication we've done already. And I'm hoping and expecting this will be a much smoother commercial transition than ExoDx was for prostate, to be honest."

Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. With 39% organic growth in the quarter, the fourth quarter closed out a record year for Bio-Techne, where we achieved 22% organic growth for the ful",2628,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. With 39% organic growth in the quarter, the fourth quarter closed out a record year for Bio-Techne, where we achieved 22% organic growth for the full 2021 fiscal year. What a difference a year makes. We ended fiscal 2020 on a much different note, as lockdowns and disruptions to our academic and biopharma customers took hold and changed the way research was being conducted. 
In the quarter following the initial COVID pandemic spread,  there has been a record level of interest in Bio-Techne's portfolio of reagents, analytical tools and services that enable researchers to make discoveries and push science forward. With robust research demand from biopharma end markets and expectations for a favorable government research funding environment, we believe a multiyear research tsunami is upon us. Bio-Techne is incredibly well positioned to ride this wave. For the second quarter in a row, the Q4 growth rate was the best organic growth the company has delivered over 25 years, both on a year-over-year and over a 2-year CAGR basis. The accelerated Q4 growth was broad-based across our end markets and geographies, although most of our customers experienced the worst of the pandemic-induced lockdowns during our fiscal Q4 last year. The growth within our product category was also broad-based and continue to be led by our analytical instrument platforms, cell and gene therapy solutions and genomics tissue spatial analysis tools. 
EMEA had a strong finish to a record year with 25% organic growth for the full fiscal year. Given that our main distribution hub for Europe is in the U.K., Brexit was quite a distraction with multiple supply chain and logistics surprises to conquer between the U.K. and Mainland Europe. The team did an excellent job navigating through this and ensuring the strong demand from our European customers was delivered. 
China is a similar story. As you may recall, China was the first to lockdown due to COVID in the first to come out. But China for us is essentially back to business by our fiscal Q4 of last year. So the year-over-year comps for China were tough this year compared to the U.S. and EMEA. Yet China delivered 30% growth for the quarter and the full fiscal year. We are very close to seeing $100 million of annual revenue in China. If not this coming fiscal year, most certainly the year after. Across the company, we delivered this record quarter with a continued focus on profitability as our operating margin expanded by over 740 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we made progress investing in the human capital necessary to position the company for its next leg of growth, although demand for talent in the life science industry remains very high. 
Encouragingly, some of the business practices we took for granted in the pre-pandemic world, including business travel, are slowly returning, but remain below normal levels. Consistent with our results throughout fiscal 2021,  the deferral of these investments accelerated our profitability. Now let's discuss the performance of our growth platform, starting with the Protein Sciences segment, where organic growth accelerated to 46% in the quarter and 24% for the full fiscal year. During the year, we made great progress with our cell and gene therapy initiatives. We opened our GMP protein facility and signed several large customers. Going forward, we will continue to broaden our GMP portfolio with the planned introduction of GMP-grade recombinant antibodies, cell and expansion media and other critical reagents. The demand for GMP proteins is likely to expand beyond T cell-based therapies to include gene-edited natural killer cells and progenitor cells that fill the regenerative medicine therapies workflow. All of these areas are gaining momentum and increasingly relying on our products. 
As evidence of this growing interest, Catamaran Bio and Bio-Techne recently broadened the scope of their collaboration to include the development of novel cell expansion technologies for use in the manufacture CAR NK cell therapy products. Additionally, Catamaran secured a broad worldwide license for TcBuster our gene editing platform and has integrated the technology into its tailwind platform for CAR NK cell therapies. Importantly, our cell and gene therapy relationships, such as this example, are having a broader impact throughout the company, driving adoption of our media, assays, instrumentation, antibodies and other offerings in our portfolio. We are leveraging our digital marketing capabilities to build awareness and the customer funnel for our expanding portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions. 
During the quarter, we made enhancements to our website, including promotional videos and additional images to more effectively showcase our complete offering. I would encourage all of you to visit the Cell and Gene Therapy section of Bio-Techne's website to view a video providing a virtual tour of our state-of-the-art GMP protein facility. Now let's discuss the analytical instruments we sell within the Protein Sciences segment. If you would have asked me in the past, if we could grow our 3 main platforms, Simple Western, Jess, SimplePlex, Ella and Biologics Maurice by 30% to 80% all year long, I would have said impossible. What happened this past year, a number of things. First, these instruments are great tools for productivity. If labs redesign themselves around working partially from home, it became more important to increase output while in the lab. Our tools are perfect for this and at a great value. Second, proteomics-based applications are on fire. Research in this area is strong, and our tools are not only the best in class, and in some cases, the only type of tool you can purchase that conducts a specific analysis. For example, Simple Western is the only fully automated Western blot solution on the market. The productivity enabled by our Simple Western instrument combined with our growing installed base has led to a significant increase in market awareness for this product. In fact, we believe this awareness has reached a critical tipping point as almost 90% of the Simple Western instruments sold in the quarter did not require a demo. 
Simple Plex continued its streak amazing results in Q4 and with our automated multiplexing platform Ella delivering over 65% growth in the quarter as demand for neurology, immunotherapy and cell and gene therapy research applications drove instruments placements and utilization within the installed base. This result is even more impressive considering the particularly challenging year-over-year comp Ella faced when high demand for the system for COVID-related applications drove an almost 100% increase in the same quarter last year. We took several steps to meet ongoing demand for this platform, including additional shifts and are in the initial stages of adding incremental manufacturing capacity to meet forecasted demand. 
During this quarter, we announced a collaboration with India-based ophthalmic health care provider, Narayana Nethralaya, for the evaluation of Ella as a diagnostic tool for to analyze lasik vision correction patients for post-surge complications. This is another example of the untapped potential of Ella as a clinical diagnostic platform. We also recently announced a collaboration with ProGen for the launch of the Simple Plex adeno-associated virus or AAV2, viral titer assay on our Ella platform. AAV2 is commonly used in gene transaction due to its ability to infect a variety of cell types. During the viral vector production process, a series of robust analytical measurements are required to determine the viral titer. Combining the efficiency and the reproducibility of the established AAV2 lives from the ProGen with the convenient workflow and robust performance of the Ella platform creates an assay with a broad dynamic range along with hands-free automation to accelerate cell and gene therapy quality control process. 
Our biologics portfolio also had a very strong showing with growth over 30% for the quarter and the year. We are excited about the recently announced collaboration with 908 Devices, where our Maurice Biologics platform provides reproducible quantitative analysis of identity, purity and heterogenity profiles for therapeutic proteins will be paired with the 908 devices that chip. For the collaboration, Maurice will enable the measurement of molecules that have a similar charge or isoform and collect tractions of these isoforms for purification and the preparation on the Zip chip prior to being introduced to a mass spectrometer creating a seamless sample prep workflow. 
Finally, our core portfolio of proteomic research reagents increased over 50% for the quarter and nearly 20% for the fiscal year. During the fiscal year, we expanded our market-leading portfolio of research reagents, including the addition of over 300 new research proteins to our expanding catalog of over 6,000 proteins. For antibodies, biopharma is increasingly recognizing our capabilities in immuno-oncology targets and immune cell labeling. 
Now let's discuss our Genomics and Diagnostics segment, where the team delivered 22% organic growth in the quarter and 18% for the full fiscal year. Our spatial genomics and tissue pathology business branded ACD, remained extremely strong with the team delivering over 60% growth in the quarter. Growth was broad-based within the portfolio and across geographies with RNA scope remaining strong. And the emerging high-plex bascope and microRNA products all gaining traction as new marketing campaigns and deeper account penetration benefit of the business. We fortified our RNA scope offering with the introduction of the latest version of our multiplexing spatial genomic technology, HiPlex v2. This latest iteration of HiPlex adds the ability to visualize at the 12 targets simultaneously in our 6 Paraffin Embedded or FFPE samples and continues to offer the flexing of up to 48 targets in fresh or freshly frozen tissue samples available on the legacy version of the assay. FFPE is an important sample type for human samples, especially for studying diseases. And we anticipate demand for HiPlex v2 as a tool for cancer and neuroscience applications as well as immuno-oncology studies. 
Next, our diagnostic reagents business faced large headwinds with past year with the pandemic dramatically reducing doctor visits and in turn, diagnostic controls to OEM customers. However, this business successfully overcame these headwinds by supplying COVID-related antibodies to COVID-related test and vaccine manufacturing, realizing 8 consecutive quarters of positive growth. With people returning to see their doctor again in a post-vaccinated world, the future is bright for our diagnostic reagents business with a strong product and OEM pipeline. Our Exosome Diagnostics business unit continues to make progress despite a very soft urology market. During COVID, patients were not leaving the home to do annual checkups or seeing their urologists. This dramatically reduced their level of PSA test. The tool used by urologists to identify a need to prescribe an ExoDx test for prostate cancer risk analysis and possible biopsy. The market is now recovering. We have staffed up our commercial sales force and our growth is accelerating. 
We also made progress on the epi reimbursement front during the quarter, following our request for reconsideration, our Medicare administrative contractor, National Government Services or NGS, issued an updated ExoDx prostate local coverage decision, or LCD. This updated LCD removed many of the ExoDx restrictions included in the original city including limitations for test utilization among certain then necessities, excluding patients with first degree relative with prostate cancer as well as removing the restrictions for patients with a persistently elevated PSA score. The reconsidered LCD became effective on August 1. Following the removal of these usage restrictions, the LCD better reflects the NCCN guidelines and position the test for improved utilization among the Medicare population. 
In addition to the ExoDx prostate test, we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative exosome-based diagnostic tests including our noninvasive kidney transplant rejection assay, ExoTRU. As a reminder, our initial ExoTRU data was published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, showing a negative predictive value of 93.3% and a positive predictive value of 86.2%, which we view as best-in-class performance versus the competition. We remain on track to launch this noninvasive urine-based assay later in calendar 2021 and have held preliminary discussions with our MAC on the pathway for Medicare reimbursement. 
Finally, I'd like to highlight the acquisition of we made this past quarter, a 15-year-old diagnostics company with strong competencies, great leadership and domain knowledge and diagnostic regulations. They also bring kitting expertise from alector oncology diagnostic kits as well as a strong portfolio of carrier screening diagnostics like Fragile X the world's best-in-class test for identifying prenatal intellectual disabilities. During the quarter, Sergen published the results of a multi-site evaluation study on as Amplidex, PCR SMA in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, validating its performance in delivering accurate, reliable information to support carrier identification for the diagnosis of spinal and muscular atrophy or SMA. The surgeon's kit simplifies existing methods for identifying relevant variance in the SMN1 and SMN2 genes by identifying all variants in a single reaction. I want to be clear on our direction for diagnostics. It is not our goal to be simply a CLIA lab service model. We prefer to sell kitted products primarily in the oncology, neuroscience and prenatal markets. These markets have strong growth due to strong needs as well as good margins of better-than-average reimbursement levels. Since closing the acquisition on April 6, we have made significant progress with the integration efforts of the and are in the initial stages of building out the commercial team to increase penetration in the largely untapped EMEA market. 
We have also begun a coordinated R&D and marketing strategy to identify synergistic projects across the company, especially with Exosome Diagnostics as we position our entire diagnostic offering to penetrate high-value markets with kidded and LDT assays. 
Lastly, I'd like to give an update on the impact of our COVID-19 initiatives. Since the start of the pandemic, Bio-Techne's reagents have facilitated studies that allow a better understanding of the virus, including ACD virus and tissue sales of bulk diagnostic reagents shoes and cobi testing applications as well as pathogen-specific antibodies and proteins to known variants of the COVID virus. COVID was an estimated 3% tailwind to our business in Q4 and and approximately 4% tailwind for the year, including revenue from sales of the Cantero IgG antibody serology kit. Encouragingly, there is growing interest in niche markets forming around our COVID serology assay offering, specifically as a tool to identify immunocompromised individuals that may not have the antibody response following vaccination to neutralize the virus. We expect the COVID research and diagnostics will be around for many years, particularly as new viral strains continue to emerge, making this tailwind a sustainable new layer of our product portfolio going forward. 
Wrapping up. We have reached the tipping point in several of our high-growth businesses, including the ACD Spatial Genomics business and our ProteinSimple branded portfolio of proteomic analytical tools. and remain in the early innings of penetrating the nascent cell and gene therapy and liquid biopsy markets that are in the front in front of the company. Later on this a strong funding environment for our market-leading catalog of research proteins and antibodies and the scientific know-how that has been built around them for over the last 40 years, and I believe we are incredibly well positioned to remain one of the most innovative, high-growth, highly profitable life science tools and diagnostic companies going forward. We are closing in on an important milestone crossing $1 billion in annual revenue. And with our existing portfolio, see a pathway to double that in the years to come. On that note, I want to remind everyone that biotech in will be hosting an Investor Day event on September 10 in New York City. At the meeting, we plan to dive deeper into all our growth drivers and provide an update on our long-term aspirations. We hope to see everyone there. With that, I'll hand over to Jim."

I'll provide an overview of our Q4 fiscal '21 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the year ahead. Given the anomaly that occurred",1722,"Thanks, Chuck. I'll provide an overview of our Q4 fiscal '21 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the year ahead. Given the anomaly that occurred in Q4 last year with the pandemic-induced customer lockdowns, I will also provide certain growth rates expressed as 2-year CAGRs as these are likely more representative of our midterm underlying growth momentum. 
Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $1.87 versus $1 a year ago, an increase of 87% over last year, representing a new company record. Foreign exchange positively impacted EPS by $0.08. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.37 compared to $1.48 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the decrease in GAAP EPS was unrealized losses on our investment in ChemoCentryx this year compared to unrealized ChemoCentryx gains in the prior year. Q4 revenue was $259 million, an increase of 47% year-over-year on a reported basis, 39% on an organic basis and an organic CAGR of approximately 13% since Q4 of '19. 
Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 4% year-over-year impact and acquisitions also had a favorable 4% impact to revenue growth. For the fiscal year '21, revenue was $931 million, an increase of 26% on a reported basis, 22% on an organic basis and an organic CAGR of approximately 13% since fiscal year '19. Foreign exchange translation and acquisitions had a favorable year-over-year impact of 3% and 1%, respectively. All geographies had strong growth in Q4 by the U.S. growing nearly 60%, which represents a 13% CAGR since Q4 fiscal year '19, followed by EMEA with over 35% growth or a 2-year CAGR of 15%, and in China with growth north of 30% for the quarter, representing a 2-year CAGR in the high 20s. 
The rest of the world grew almost 30% or at a 10% 2-year CAGR. Q4 of last year was the start of pandemic in the U.S., with shutdown severely impacting this geography, while European customers have begun to emerge in the shutdowns and China has largely reopened in Q4 for fiscal year '20. Hence, the comps in Q4 this year were easier in the U.S. compared to China and Europe. That being said, the 2-year CAGRs across the globe are impressive and illustrate that we've emerged a pandemic even stronger than before it started. 
By end market, biopharma continues to be very strong, growing nearly 50%, while academia growth was impacted by the shutdowns was most impacted by the shutdowns last year, growing nearly 60%. The 2-year CAGR, we believe illustrates the real relative strength with biopharma growth nearly 20% and academic growing approximately 5% per annum over this period. We expect academia to continue to improve as national funding budgets get approved and dispersed throughout the next year. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 72.5% in the quarter compared to 69.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by volume leverage, operational productivity and favorable product mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 26.1% of revenue, a 200 basis point decrease compared to the prior year, and R&D expense in Q4 was 8% of revenue, 150 basis points lower than last year. While adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increased sequentially and compared to the prior year, a tight life science labor market did not allow us to fill all planned headcount additions to the team at the pace we had originally anticipated, especially the more scientific and engineering fields. However, our pace of hiring did increase over the course of Q4, and we plan to make additional progress in fiscal 2022. This investment in critical human capital will position the company for growth going forward. Additionally, Q4 was the first quarter that included a surgeon's operating costs. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 38.5%, an increase of 740 basis points from the prior year and a 340 basis point improvement from Q4 of fiscal '19. 
For the full fiscal year '21, adjusted operating margin was 38.9%, an increase of 560 basis points from fiscal year '20 and a 470 basis point improvement from fiscal year '19.  Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $3 million, decreasing $1.4 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt during fiscal 2021 as well as lower floating rates. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at $341.3 million. Other adjusted nonoperating expense was $0.7 million for the quarter compared to $0.5 million of income in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash point arrangements. 
For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income includes unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 20.3%, a 110 basis point improvement over the prior year, with the improvement primarily driven by geographic mix. Note that the GAAP effective tax rate in Q4 was favorably impacted by the discrete timing of stock option exercises. As a reminder, during Q2, we made a strategic investment in China-based, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services the Chinese biopharmaceutical market. The $316,000 noncontrolling interest line item reflects a loss on a portion of MS we do not own. The impact to other lines of the P&L as a result of consolidating MS was immaterial in Q4. 
Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $122 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, more than 170% increase over the prior year. The increase was driven by strong working capital management while meeting our customer commitments on much higher demand. In Q4, our net investment in capital expenditures was $12.8 million. And during Q4, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.4 million in dividends. We finished Q4 with 41 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q4 in a very strong position with $231.6 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments and a total leverage ratio of well under 1x EBITDA. 
Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q4 reported sales were $192.3 million, with reported revenue increasing 51% compared to the prior year. Organic growth was 46% with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 5%. The organic CAGR since fourth quarter of fiscal '19 was approximately 14% per annum. Within this segment, the strong growth was very broad-based in nearly all reagent, assay and instrument platforms. Looking at 2-year CAGRs going back to fourth quarter of fiscal year '19, standouts in the group would be Simple Plex with approximately 75% annual growth, cell and gene therapy was approximately 50% annual growth, with the GMP protein component growing well over 100% annually. Biologics was approximately 25% annual growth and Simple Western was approximately 20% annual growth. 
Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 46.7%, an increase of 780 basis points year-over-year, due primarily to favorable volume leverage, operational productivity and cost management. 
Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q4 reported sales were $67.1 million, with reported revenue increasing 38%. Organic growth for this segment was 22% with acquisitions contributing 15% and foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. The organic CAGR since the fourth quarter of fiscal year '19 was approximately 11% per annum. The ACD branded spatial analysis portfolio, together with the Exosome Diagnostics, led the segment in the quarter with 2-year CAGRs of nearly 20% and 70% per annum, respectively. As Chuck mentioned earlier, our Diagnostics Reagents business did a very nice job executing on both COVID-related antibody opportunities to cover further softness in the general diagnostics market, resulting in a mid-single-digit CAGR over the last 2 years since the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. 
Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 16.7%, the segment's operating margin improved 430 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase also reflects strong volume leverage, operational productivity and strong cost management across the segment. 
In summary, we finished fiscal '21 on a very strong note. Our products are clearly addressing the current needs of the research and clinical communities we serve, providing the proteomic, genomic and diagnostic tools necessary to drive science forward. With some of the largest opportunities still in front of the company, we believe we are just getting started and are looking forward to updating everyone on our vision for the future during our upcoming Investor Day. In the more near term, with favorable life science research funding as a tailwind, we expect the organic growth momentum that we've experienced over the last 2 years to carry on into fiscal year '22. We foresee continued strength across our entire portfolio. With cell and gene therapy, our analytical instrument portfolio and spatial genomic analysis tools, leading the way once again, while 4 reagents maintained their market leadership position and the Exosome Diagnostic prostate test continues to ramp. We also anticipate to add approximately 3% growth to our top line during fiscal year '22 and begin to be accretive to our organic growth in the fourth quarter. As Chuck and I mentioned in our prior commentary, we have recently made progress in making the investments needed to support our future growth, but have further to go to catch up to our strategic plan and enable the acceleration of growth in the future. Additionally, with our biopharma and academic customers now back to work, increasingly more receptive to in-person interaction, we are expecting return of pre-pandemic activities, including corporate travel to normalize as fiscal year '22 progresses. 
Finally, Asuragen is still in the initial stages of profitability and making the investments necessary to fully realize the synergies and global potential of this business. All these considerations taken together, we expect our adjusted operating margin going forward to be sequentially lower compared to our Q4 fiscal '21 results, but returning back to this level in the back half of fiscal year '22. 
That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to open the line for questions."

Yes, we're focused on tools probably more so than diagnostics.

We're talking about less than 100 centers that we can deal with in almost like a key account model. We also don't have the wall to climb over of talking docs out of doing test like biopsies, right? So it's commercially should be somewhat simpler, especially to the great test a great number. So we've done surveys with these rejection centers or these transplant centers. And they've come back over 90% positive. They want to try out the test if they don't they don't see what they're using today is being perfect by any means, and there's a move room for improvement.

So over the coming years as they launch, yes, I would expect there'll be some accelerated growth. That's what we're hoping for. It's where we bought them, among other things."

Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. With 39% organic growth in the quarter, the fourth quarter closed out a record year for Bio-Techne, where we achieved 22% organic growth for the ful",2628,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. With 39% organic growth in the quarter, the fourth quarter closed out a record year for Bio-Techne, where we achieved 22% organic growth for the full 2021 fiscal year. What a difference a year makes. We ended fiscal 2020 on a much different note, as lockdowns and disruptions to our academic and biopharma customers took hold and changed the way research was being conducted. 
In the quarter following the initial COVID pandemic spread,  there has been a record level of interest in Bio-Techne's portfolio of reagents, analytical tools and services that enable researchers to make discoveries and push science forward. With robust research demand from biopharma end markets and expectations for a favorable government research funding environment, we believe a multiyear research tsunami is upon us. Bio-Techne is incredibly well-positioned to ride this wave. For the second quarter in a row, the Q4 growth rate was the best organic growth the company has delivered over 25 years, both on a year-over-year and over a 2-year CAGR basis. The accelerated Q4 growth was broad-based across our end markets and geographies, although most of our customers experienced the worst of the pandemic-induced lockdowns during our fiscal Q4 last year. The growth within our product category was also broad-based and continue to be led by our analytical instrument platforms, cell and gene therapy solutions and genomics tissue spatial analysis tools. 
EMEA had a strong finish to a record year with 25% organic growth for the full fiscal year. Given that our main distribution hub for Europe is in the U.K., Brexit was quite a distraction with multiple supply chain and logistics surprises to conquer between the U.K. and Mainland Europe. The team did an excellent job navigating through this and ensuring the strong demand from our European customers was delivered. 
China is a similar story. As you may recall, China was the first to lockdown due to COVID and the first to come out. But China for us is essentially back to business by our fiscal Q4 of last year. So the year-over-year comps for China were tough this year compared to the U.S. and EMEA. Yet China delivered 30% growth for the quarter and the full fiscal year. We are very close to seeing $100 million of annual revenue in China. If not this coming fiscal year, most certainly the year after. Across the company, we delivered this record quarter with a continued focus on profitability as our operating margin expanded by over 740 basis points year-over-year. And during the quarter, we made progress investing in the human capital necessary to position the company for its next leg of growth, although demand for talent in the life science industry remains very high. 
Encouragingly, some of the business practices we took for granted in the pre-pandemic world, including business travel, are slowly returning, but remain below normal levels. Consistent with our results throughout fiscal 2021, the deferral of these investments accelerated our profitability. Now let's discuss the performance of our growth platform, starting with the Protein Sciences segment, where organic growth accelerated to 46% in the quarter and 24% for the full fiscal year. During the year, we made great progress with our cell and gene therapy initiatives. We opened our GMP protein facility and signed several large customers. Going forward, we will continue to broaden our GMP portfolio with the planned introduction of GMP-grade recombinant antibodies, cell and expansion media and other critical reagents. The demand for GMP proteins is likely to expand beyond T cell-based therapies to include gene-edited natural killer cells and progenitor cells that fill the regenerative medicine therapies workflow. All of these areas are gaining momentum and increasingly relying on our products. 
As evidence of this growing interest, Catamaran Bio and Bio-Techne recently broadened the scope of their collaboration to include the development of novel cell expansion technologies for use in the manufacture CAR-NK cell therapy products. Additionally, Catamaran secured a broad worldwide license for TcBuster, our gene editing platform, and has integrated the technology into its tailwind platform for CAR-NK cell therapies. Importantly, our cell and gene therapy relationships, such as this example, are having a broader impact throughout the company, driving adoption of our media, assays, instrumentation, antibodies and other offerings in our portfolio. We are leveraging our digital marketing capabilities to build awareness and the customer funnel for our expanding portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions. 
During the quarter, we made enhancements to our website, including promotional videos and additional images to more effectively showcase our complete offering. I would encourage all of you to visit the cell and gene Therapy section of Bio-Techne's website to view a video providing a virtual tour of our state-of-the-art GMP protein facility. Now let's discuss the analytical instruments we sell within the Protein Sciences segment. If you would have asked me in the past, if we could grow our 3 main platforms, Simple Western, Jess, Simple Plex, Ella and Biologics Maurice by 30% to 80% all year long, I would have said impossible. What happened this past year, a number of things. First, these instruments are great tools for productivity. If labs redesign themselves around working partially from home, it became more important to increase output while in the lab. Our tools are perfect for this and add a great value. Second, proteomics-based applications are on fire. Research in this area is strong, and our tools are not only the best in class, and in some cases, the only type of tool you can purchase that conducts a specific analysis. For example, Simple Western is the only fully automated Western blot solution on the market. The productivity enabled by our Simple Western instrument combined with our growing installed base has led to a significant increase in market awareness for this product. In fact, we believe this awareness has reached a critical tipping point as almost 90% of the Simple Western instruments sold in the quarter did not require a demo. 
Simple Plex continued its streak amazing results in Q4 and with our automated multiplexing platform, Ella, delivering over 65% growth in the quarter as demand for neurology, immunotherapy and cell and gene therapy research applications drove instruments placements and utilization within the installed base. This result is even more impressive considering the particularly challenging year-over-year comp Ella faced when high demand for the system for COVID-related applications drove an almost 100% increase in the same quarter last year. We took several steps to meet ongoing demand for this platform, including additional shifts and are in the initial stages of adding incremental manufacturing capacity to meet forecasted demand. 
During this quarter, we announced a collaboration with India-based ophthalmic health care provider, Narayana Nethralaya, for the evaluation of Ella as a diagnostic tool for to analyze LASIK vision correction patients for post surgery complications. This is another example of the untapped potential of Ella as a clinical diagnostic platform. We also recently announced a collaboration with ProGen for the launch of the Simple Plex adeno-associated virus or AAV2, viral titer assay on our Ella platform. AAV2 is commonly used in gene transaction due to its ability to infect a variety of cell types. During the viral vector production process, a series of robust analytical measurements are required to determine the viral titer. Combining the efficiency and the reproducibility of the established AAV2 [indiscernible] from the ProGen with the convenient workflow and robust performance of the Ella platform creates an assay with a broad dynamic range along with hands-free automation to accelerate cell and gene therapy quality control process. 
Our biologics portfolio also had a very strong showing with growth over 30% for the quarter and the year. We are excited about the recently announced collaboration with 908 Devices, where our Maurice Biologics platform provides reproducible quantitative analysis of identity, purity and heterogeneity profiles for therapeutic proteins will be paired with the 908 Devices ZipChip. For the collaboration, Maurice will enable the measurement of molecules that have a similar charge or isoform and collect tractions of these isoforms for purification and the preparation on the ZipChip prior to being introduced to a mass spectrometer creating a seamless sample prep workflow. 
Finally, our core portfolio of proteomic research reagents increased over 50% for the quarter and nearly 20% for the fiscal year. During the fiscal year, we expanded our market-leading portfolio of research reagents, including the addition of over 300 new research proteins to our expanding catalog of over 6,000 proteins. For antibodies, biopharma is increasingly recognizing our capabilities in immuno-oncology targets and immune cell labeling. 
Now let's discuss our Genomics and Diagnostics segment, where the team delivered 22% organic growth in the quarter and 18% for the full fiscal year. Our spatial genomics and tissue pathology business branded ACD, remained extremely strong with the team delivering over 60% growth in the quarter. Growth was broad-based within the portfolio and across geographies with RNA scope remaining strong. And the emerging high-plex BaseScope and microRNA products all gaining traction as new marketing campaigns and deeper account penetration benefited the business. We fortified our RNA scope offering with the introduction of the latest version of our multiplexing spatial genomic technology, HiPlex v2. This latest iteration of HiPlex adds the ability to visualize that the 12 targets simultaneously in our formalin-fixed paraffin embedded or FFPE samples and continues to offer the flexing of up to 48 targets in fresh or freshly frozen tissue samples available in the legacy version of the assay. FFPE is an important sample type for human samples, especially for studying diseases. And we anticipate demand for HiPlex v2 as a tool for cancer and neuroscience applications as well as immuno-oncology studies. 
Next, our diagnostic reagents business faced large headwinds this past year with the pandemic dramatically reducing doctor visits and in turn, diagnostic controls to OEM customers. However, this business successfully overcame these headwinds by supplying COVID-related antibodies to COVID-related test and vaccine manufacturing, realizing 8 consecutive quarters of positive growth. With people returning to see their doctor again in a post-vaccinated world, future is bright for our diagnostic reagents business with a strong product and OEM pipeline. Our Exosome Diagnostics business unit continues to make progress despite a very soft urology market. During COVID, patients were not leaving the home to do annual checkups or seeing their urologists. This dramatically reduced their level of PSA test. The tool used by urologists to identify a need to prescribe an ExoDx test for prostate cancer risk analysis and possible biopsy. The market is now recovering. We have staffed up our commercial sales force and our growth is accelerating. 
We also made progress on the EPI reimbursement front during the quarter, following our request for reconsideration, our Medicare administrative contractor, National Government Services or NGS, issued an updated ExoDx prostate local coverage decision, or LCD. This updated LCD removed many of the ExoDx prostate restrictions included in the original LCD including limitations for test utilization among certain necessities, excluding patients with first degree relative with prostate cancer as well as removing the restrictions for patients with a persistently elevated PSA score. The reconsidered LCD became effective on August 1st. Following the removal of these EPI usage restrictions, the LCD better reflects the NCCN guidelines and positions the test for improved utilization among the Medicare population. 
In addition to the ExoDx prostate test, we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative exosome-based diagnostic tests including our noninvasive kidney transplant rejection assay, ExoTRU. As a reminder, our initial ExoTRU data was published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, showing a negative predictive value of 93.3% and a positive predictive value of 86.2%, which we view as best-in-class performance versus the competition. We remain on track to launch this noninvasive urine-based assay later in calendar 2021 and have held preliminary discussions with our MAC on the pathway for Medicare reimbursement. 
Finally, I'd like to highlight the acquisition of Asuragen we made this past quarter, a 15-year-old diagnostics company with strong competencies, great leadership and domain knowledge and diagnostic regulations. They also bring kitting expertise, molecular oncology diagnostic kits as well as a strong portfolio of carrier screening diagnostics like Fragile X the world's best-in-class test for identifying prenatal intellectual disabilities. During the quarter, Asuragen published the results of a multi-site evaluation study known as AmplideX, PCR SMA Plus kit in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, validating its performance in delivering accurate, reliable information to support carrier identification for the diagnosis of spinal and muscular atrophy or SMA. Asuragen's kit simplifies existing methods for identifying relevant variance in the SMN1 and SMN2 genes by identifying all variants in a single reaction. I want to be clear on our direction for diagnostics. It is not our goal to be simply a CLIA lab service model. We prefer to sell kitted products, primarily in the oncology, neuroscience and prenatal markets. These markets have strong growth due to strong needs as well as good margins and better-than-average reimbursement levels. Since closing the acquisition on April 6, we have made significant progress with the integration efforts with Asuragen and are in the initial stages of building out the commercial team to increase penetration in the largely untapped EMEA market. 
We have also begun a coordinated R&D and marketing strategy to identify synergistic projects across the company, especially with Exosome Diagnostics as we position our entire diagnostic offering to penetrate high-value markets with kitted and LDT assays. 
Lastly, I'd like to give an update on the impact of our COVID-19 initiatives. Since the start of the pandemic, Bio-Techne's reagents and instruments have facilitated studies that allow a better understanding of the virus, including ACD probe's detected virus and tissue, sales of bulk diagnostic reagent [indiscernible] and COVID testing applications as well as pathogen-specific antibodies and proteins to known variants of the COVID virus. COVID was an estimated 3% tailwind to our business in Q4 and approximately 4% tailwind for the year, including revenue from sales of the Kantaro IgG antibody serology kit. Encouragingly, there is growing interest in niche markets forming around our COVID serology assay offering, specifically as a tool to identify immunocompromised individuals that may not have the antibody response following vaccination to neutralize the virus. We expect the COVID research and diagnostics will be around for many years, particularly as new viral strains continue to emerge, making this tailwind a sustainable new layer of our product portfolio going forward. 
Wrapping up. We have reached the tipping point in several of our high-growth businesses, including the ACD Spatial Genomics business and our ProteinSimple branded portfolio of proteomic analytical tools and remain in the early innings of penetrating the nascent Cell and Gene Therapy and liquid biopsy markets that are in the front of the company. Layered on to this is a strong funding environment for our market-leading catalog of research proteins and antibodies and the scientific know-how that has been built around them for over the last 40 years, and I believe we are incredibly well positioned to remain one of the most innovative, high-growth, highly profitable life science tools and diagnostic companies going forward. We are closing in on an important milestone crossing $1 billion in annual revenue. And with our existing portfolio, see a pathway to double that in the years to come. On that note, I want to remind everyone that Bio-Techne will be hosting an Investor Day event on September 10 in New York City. At the meeting, we plan to dive deeper into all our growth drivers and provide an update on our long-term aspirations. We hope to see everyone there. 
With that, I'll hand over to Jim."

I'll provide an overview of our Q4 fiscal '21 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the year ahead. Given the anomaly that occurred",1730,"Thanks, Chuck. I'll provide an overview of our Q4 fiscal '21 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the year ahead. Given the anomaly that occurred in Q4 last year with the pandemic-induced customer lockdowns, I will also provide certain growth rates expressed as 2-year CAGRs as these are likely more representative of our midterm underlying growth momentum. 
Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $1.87 versus $1 a year ago, an increase of 87% over last year, representing a new company record. Foreign exchange positively impacted EPS by $0.08. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.37 compared to $1.48 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the decrease in GAAP EPS was unrealized losses on our investment in ChemoCentryx this year compared to unrealized ChemoCentryx gains in the prior year. Q4 revenue was $259 million, an increase of 47% year-over-year on a reported basis, 39% on an organic basis and an organic CAGR of approximately 13% since Q4 of '19. 
Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 4% year-over-year impact and acquisitions also had a favorable 4% impact to revenue growth. For the fiscal year '21, revenue was $931 million, an increase of 26% on a reported basis, 22% on an organic basis and an organic CAGR of approximately 13% since fiscal year '19. Foreign exchange translation and acquisitions had a favorable year-over-year impact of 3% and 1%, respectively. All geographies had a strong growth in Q4, led by the U.S. growing nearly 60%, which represents a 13% CAGR since Q4 fiscal year '19, followed by EMEA with over 35% growth or a 2-year CAGR of 15%, and in China with growth north of 30% for the quarter, representing a 2-year CAGR in the high 20s. 
The rest of the world grew almost 30% or at a 10% 2-year CAGR. Q4 of last year was the start of pandemic in the U.S., with shutdown severely impacting this geography, while European customers have begun to emerge in the shutdowns and China was largely reopened in Q4 for fiscal year '20. Hence, the comps in Q4 this year were easier in the U.S. compared to China and Europe. That being said, the 2-year CAGRs across the globe are impressive and illustrate that we've emerged a pandemic even stronger than before it started. 
By end market, biopharma continues to be very strong, growing nearly 50%, while academia growth was impacted by the shutdowns -- was most impacted by the shutdowns last year, growing nearly 60%. The 2-year CAGR, we believe, illustrates the real relative strength with biopharma growth nearly 20% and academic growing approximately 5% per annum over this period. We expect academia to continue to improve as national funding budgets get approved and dispersed throughout the next year. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 72.5% in the quarter compared to 69.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by volume leverage, operational productivity and favorable product mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 26.1% of revenue, a 200 basis point decrease compared to the prior year, and R&D expense in Q4 was 8% of revenue, 150 basis points lower than last year. While adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increased sequentially and compared to the prior year, a tight life science labor market did not allow us to fill all planned headcount additions to the team at the pace we had originally anticipated, especially in the more scientific and engineering fields. However, our pace of hiring did increase over the course of Q4, and we plan to make additional progress in fiscal 2022. This investment in critical human capital will position the company for growth going forward. Additionally, Q4 was the first quarter that included a surgeon's operating costs. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 38.5%, an increase of 740 basis points from the prior year and a 340 basis point improvement from Q4 of fiscal '19. 
For the full fiscal year '21, adjusted operating margin was 38.9%, an increase of 560 basis points from fiscal year '20 and a 470 basis point improvement from fiscal year '19.  Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $3 million, decreasing $1.4 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt during fiscal 2021 as well as lower floating rates. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at $341.3 million. Other adjusted nonoperating expense was $0.7 million for the quarter compared to $0.5 million of income in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash point arrangements. 
For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income includes unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 20.3%, a 110 basis point improvement over the prior year, with the improvement primarily driven by geographic mix. Note that the GAAP effective tax rate in Q4 was favorably impacted by the discrete timing of stock option exercises. As a reminder, during Q2, we made a strategic investment in China-based Eminence, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services, the Chinese biopharmaceutical market. The $316,000 noncontrolling interest line item reflects a loss on a portion of Eminence we do not own. The impact to other lines of the P&L as a result of consolidating Eminence was immaterial in Q4. 
Turning to cash flow and return of capital. A $122 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, more than 170% increase over the prior year. The increase was driven by strong working capital management while meeting our customer commitments on much higher demand. In Q4, our net investment in capital expenditures was $12.8 million. And during Q4, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.4 million in dividends. We finished Q4 with 41 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q4 in a very strong position with $231.6 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments and a total leverage ratio of well under 1x EBITDA. 
Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q4 reported sales were $192.3 million, with reported revenue increasing 51% compared to the prior year. Organic growth was 46% with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 5%. The organic CAGR since fourth quarter of fiscal '19 was approximately 14% per annum. Within this segment, the strong growth was very broad-based in nearly all reagent, assay and instrument platforms. Looking at 2-year CAGRs going back to fourth quarter of fiscal year '19, standouts in the group would be Simple Plex with approximately 75% annual growth, Cell and Gene Therapy with approximately 50% annual growth, with the GMP protein component growing well over 100% annually. Biologics was approximately 25% annual growth and Simple Western with approximately 20% annual growth. 
Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 46.7%, an increase of 780 basis points year-over-year, due primarily to favorable volume leverage, operational productivity and cost management. 
Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q4 reported sales were $67.1 million, with reported revenue increasing 38%. Organic growth for this segment was 22% with acquisitions contributing 15% and foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. The organic CAGR since the fourth quarter of fiscal year '19 was approximately 11% per annum. The ACD-branded spatial analysis portfolio, together with the Exosome Diagnostics, led the segment in the quarter with 2-year CAGRs of nearly 20% and 70% per annum, respectively. As Chuck mentioned earlier, our Diagnostics Reagents business did a very nice job executing on both COVID-related antibody opportunities to cover for the softness in the general diagnostics market, resulting in a mid-single-digit CAGR over the last 2 years since the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. 
Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 16.7%, the segment's operating margin improved 430 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase also reflects strong volume leverage, operational productivity and strong cost management across the segment. 
In summary, we finished fiscal '21 on a very strong note. Our products are clearly addressing the current needs of the research and clinical communities we serve, providing the proteomic, genomic and diagnostic tools necessary to drive science forward. With some of the largest opportunities still in front of the company, we believe we are just getting started and are looking forward to updating everyone on our vision for the future during our upcoming Investor Day. In the more near term, with favorable life science research funding as a tailwind, we expect the organic growth momentum that we've experienced over the last 2 years to carry on into fiscal year '22. We foresee continued strength across our entire portfolio. With Cell and Gene Therapy, our analytical instrument portfolio and spatial genomic analysis tools, leading the way once again, while 4 reagents maintained their market leadership position and the Exosome Diagnostic prostate test continues to ramp. We also anticipate Asuragen to add approximately 3% growth to our top line during fiscal year '22 and begin to be accretive to our organic growth in the fourth quarter. As Chuck and I mentioned in our prior commentary, we have recently made progress in making the investments needed to support our future growth, but have further to go to catch up to our strategic plan and enable the acceleration of growth in the future. Additionally, with our biopharma and academic customers now back to work, increasingly more receptive to in-person interaction, we are expecting a return of pre-pandemic activities, including corporate travel to normalize as fiscal year '22 progresses. 
Finally, Asuragen is still in the initial stages of profitability and making the investments necessary to fully realize the synergies and global potential of this business. All these considerations taken together, we expect our adjusted operating margin going forward to be sequentially lower compared to our Q4 fiscal '21 results, but returning back to this level in the back half of fiscal year '22. 
That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to open the line for questions."

But CLIA is certainly important right now, we're doing the work. But over time, it will be a mix. I don't think we probably totally ever out of CLIA. I think you need to be in CLIA because that's the way a good way to start these things, these tests of an LDT. And I think we'll just see how the mix goes, but I think better scale potential. I think better faster acceleration exists with kitting if you can get it done. But as you know, it's a bit of an art to kit. And you need people who know how to do it, and there's a lot of details to get kitting successful and then channel issues, at which Asuragen team are really expert at.

We're talking about less than 100 centers that we can deal with in almost like a key account model. We also don't have the wall to climb over of talking docs out of doing test like biopsies, right? So it's commercially should be somewhat simpler, especially to the great test a great number. So we've done surveys with these rejection centers or these transplant centers. And they've come back over 90% positive. They want to try out the test, but they don't they don't see what they're using today is being perfect by any means, and there's a more room for improvement.

So for 3 out of the 4 quarters next year, it will be dilutive to overall margins to the tune of 70 to 100 basis points. So that's kind of a big headwind inherent right there. Of course, we even talked about getting back in front of customers and business travels somewhat returning. That's a pretty hefty number in itself in terms of a headwind year-over-year, assuming that, that activity ramps back up. 
With regards to your comment on Exo, I mean Exo will become less dilutive going forward but still be dilutive. But as we continue our growth trajectory, despite those headwinds in the near term, and let me back up for a second. We did hire pretty successful here in the -- towards the end of Q4. So not necessarily representative in our fiscal year '21 run rate much less even the Q4 one, to be honest with you. And that will provide some headwind that you're not currently seeing. So all those factors combined, we see in the near term the margin dipping slightly. But again, because as we continue to grow the back half of the year with the leverage we get from that growth, we see it normalizing back to Q4 level by the end of the year."

In the past, this hasn't been the kind of business model where you get as much leverage as other manufacturing models I've been involved with. But we have found incredible productivity internally, and we have found more scale leverage than I thought possible. It's been helped, in fact, by, I think, as we talked about the hiring needed and the headcount shortages. I think we're a little lean there. We're catching up fast, started last quarter and travel, of course, has helped everyone. But the fact remains, even on gross margin is really strong, and we're finding leverage. I think it will continue. We're all pretty well Six Sigma trained here and PPI from Thermo and every other flavor of this productivity therapy you want to do, and we use them all here.

So they'll be more heavily impacted by the actual investments that we need to make. You're correct in that the diagnostics genomics segment will be impacted by the Asuragen acquisition. But again, they have the lowest overall operating margin and that's where we've gotten the most expansion in the past with leverage, and we expect that to continue and, frankly, overcome the Asuragen headwinds in that segment.

I can't also tell you how good this integration has been out of 17 acquisitions. This has been the easiest. These guys, a 15-year-old company. They all came and there was a spin-off of a bigger company, as you know. And so their financials are all auditable. It's just been more or less this team. They're all keepers, and we're working hard on doing that.

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. The Bio-Techne team kicked off our fiscal 2022 on a very strong note, as we continue the momentum we experienced during our last fiscal year. Our fir",2123,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. The Bio-Techne team kicked off our fiscal 2022 on a very strong note, as we continue the momentum we experienced during our last fiscal year. Our first quarter 21% organic growth rate reflects broad strength across geographies and ongoing penetration and demand for our product research reagents, diagnostic reagents, analytical tools and services, especially within our biopharma end market. The standouts in the quarter included our instrument portfolio, namely our Biologics, Simple Western and Simple Plex offerings, broad strength across our research agents and triple-digit growth for our burgeoning GMP protein business. 
Not only were these significant growth drivers for the quarter, but these platforms as well as our spatial biology and molecular diagnostics portfolio remain at the forefront of underpenetrated high-growth markets that position the company for future growth. I'm very proud of the global team's execution and the company is off to a great start as we march forward to the longer-term targets we provided during our recent Investor Day event. 
We delivered this strong Q1 revenue performance with a continued focus on profitability with an adjusted operating margin of 37.8%. During the quarter, we made progress hiring to our growth plan, although the tight labor market remained a constraint to us building the team at our desired pace. We anticipate making continued progress with our hiring plans as fiscal 2022 unfolds, supplementing the commercial and technical teams that will enable execution of our long-term growth plan. 
From a geographic perspective, we experienced robust growth across all geographies, China especially was a standout where the team delivered record organic growth of over 50% in the quarter. The government authorities there are strongly encouraging the development of therapies in the areas of stem cells, organoids, regenerative medicine and immunology. All areas that have a strong need for our reagents and analytical solutions. 
For the first time this quarter, our business in China annualized at over $100 million in revenue. While this is an important milestone, we believe we remain in the early innings of realizing our potential in this important geography. Turning to our end markets. Demand for our unique high-quality products and solutions continues to be very strong for our biopharma end users with revenue growth increasing approximately 25%. Performance within our academic end markets also remain solid overall, delivering organic growth in the mid-single digits. 
Now let's discuss the performance of our growth platform, starting with the Protein Sciences segment, where we delivered organic growth of 26% in the quarter. We made significant progress with our cell and gene therapy initiatives as growing awareness and demand for our portfolio of workflow solutions led to over 60% organic growth in the quarter. We are nearing completion of the qualification process for initial lots of GMP-grade proteins out of our state-of-the-art GMP protein manufacturing facility in St. Paul, Minnesota, and anticipate commercial orders to be shipped from the facility in the coming weeks. 
As a reminder, GMP proteins are critical ingredients for growing both autologous and allogeneic cell therapies, and we anticipate increasing demand going forward is the rich pipeline of therapies to make their way through the regulatory approval process. our GMP protein business increased over 160% in the quarter. And with our new GMP manufacturing facility open for business, we are well positioned to meet the anticipated growing demand for these critical reagents. 
Continuing in cell and gene therapy, we added to our portfolio of specialty cell culture products with the launch of Accelerate iPSC expansion medium, a new medium for the expansion and maintenance of induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, for use in both research and translational workflows. The Accelerate iPSC expansion medium builds on Bio-Techne's portfolio of products and services and regenerative medicine and fit seamlessly into our offerings for stem cell workflows, including cell isolation, reprogramming, genome engineering, cell expansion, differentiation and characterization. 
Importantly, Accelerate iPSC expansion medium is manufactured without using components derived from animals or humans, making it ideally suited for use in translational research to produce iPSC-based cell and gene therapies. This latest offering builds on our growing portfolio of specialty cell culture products addressing customer needs across natural killer or NK T cell and B cell media. The momentum in our core research use only protein and antibody businesses also continues to be very strong with growth in the low 20s in the quarter. 
We believe the continued success in our core is a reflection of our best-in-class development of a new high-quality relevant reagents that address our customers' current research needs while making them increasingly aware of our capabilities through our strategic digital marketing efforts. 
Moving on now to our proteomic analytical tools, where we continue to see strong demand across our portfolio of cost-effective productivity solutions. In Q1, our instruments and related consumable hold-through grew over 30%, reflective of a very strong biopharma environment, our biologics instruments led the way growing nearly 50%. These analytical tools, namely our Maurice instrument enable a reproducible and quantitative analysis of therapeutic protein identity, purity, homogeneity with ease of use, fast results and reproducibility, all qualities that continue to represent a compelling proposition for new and existing CROs, CDMOs, large pharma accounts. And we are now also seeing adoption in cell and gene therapy quality control applications. 
Demand for our Simple Western instruments also continues to be strong with over 20% growth compared to the prior year. Encouragingly, we are seeing significant lead generation for Abbey and sold several of these systems during its first full quarter in the market. As a reminder, Abbey is the lower cost fully automated chemiluminescence Western platform that we introduced in April to further penetrate Simple Western technology into our academic customer base. 
Separately, we saw robust adoption, a simple Western within cell and gene therapy market and view this as a significant and largely untapped opportunity for this technology going forward. Our Simple Plex multiplexing immunoassay system, Ella, also had a strong quarter, growing over 20%. This result is especially impressive given the challenging year-over-year comparison where Simple Plex increased more than 75% in the prior year period. We are experiencing a significant uptick in Ella accounts using or evaluating the platform for neurodegenerative applications, specifically for neurofilament light chain or near NFL and neurofilament heavy chain or NFL detection in serum plasma. 
Ella continues to be the platform of choice for customers requiring excellent sensitivity and assay speed. Now let's discuss our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue increased 6% in the quarter. Our spatial biology business, branded ACD, increased mid-single digits in the quarter as continued demand from our biopharma customers, especially CROs was partially offset by lower reorder rates from our academic customers. 
I would note our ACD business, and especially in the academic market, faced a challenging comp in the prior year when the business increased over 30%. Within biopharma, the emergence of gene therapy and RNA interface or RNAi therapeutics was created -- has created a shift toward animal model-based projects, driving larger order sizes and increasing custom probe design projects, making for a little more lumpiness in our spatial biology business. 
Our menu of pros is now approaching 50,000 targets over many species and publications across over 4,500 demonstrating the continued academic interest in the platform. Next, our Diagnostics Reagents business delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of growth, with organic revenue increasing in the upper single digits. Encouragingly, the pandemic-related headwinds that impacted this business in recent quarters are starting to diminish, and we are experiencing a reacceleration in the chemistry, glucose and hematology controls product lines. 
The diminishing headwinds combined with new product launches and additional penetration within existing OEM customers, we believe are just at the beginning of accelerated growth in this business. During our Investor Day, we highlighted some organizational changes within our Diagnostics and Genomics segment designed to fully realize across developmental opportunities and synergies within our liquid biopsy and molecular products businesses. 
The new Molecular Diagnostics division is a combination of our Exosome Diagnostics business and the recent surgeon acquisition and is being led by Max McManus, the former CEO of the legacy assertion business. This new division structure includes an Exosome Center of Excellence as the Exosome-based liquid biopsy innovation engine developing lab-developed tests, companion diagnostics as well as cited Exosome-based diagnostic products. We will leverage the established detergent channel as well as our 2 CLIA labs to commercialize these products. 
Our ExoDx prostate cancer test continues to make progress despite ongoing challenges with the urology market. During COVID, patients were not leaving their homes to do annual checkups or senior urologists. This dramatically reduced the volume of PSA test, the primary tool used by urologists to identify the appropriate patients for our ExoDx test for prostate cancer risk analysis and potential biopsy. 
With patients beginning to return to their doctors for routine checkups or follow-ups. The diagnostic market is continuing to recover and encouragingly, our Q1 ExoDX volume was the highest since the onset of the pandemic and continues to show improvement early in Q2. I would also note that our sales reps are increasingly getting in-person meetings and hosting educational and awareness events with the physician community, which we expect to be a strong impetus to test fun going forward. 
We also made progress on the ExoDX reimbursement front during the quarter. We had accounts -- we added contracts with multiple regional payers, expanding both the network of private payers reimbursing for ExoDx and men with covered access to test. We are very excited about the opportunity to present at an overview of the science and publications supporting ExoDx to 600 medical directors and policy decision-makers this week during and AMCPs 2021 Live Fall Managed Care Forum. 
The confirmed audience includes representatives from the largest national and regional payers. Events like this are an excellent opportunity to drive awareness and acceptance and eventually reimbursement of this important test among the private payer community. Our recent publication of a pooled analysis of over 1,200 patients in the journal of prostate cancer in prostatic diseases demonstrated ExoDx's ability to discriminate between high-grade, low-grade and benign prostate cancer. 
Using ExoDx's validated 15.6 cutoff score would have avoided 23% of all prostate biopsies and 30% of unnecessary biopsies with a negative predictive value of 90%. We have a pipeline of additional studies and anticipate a steady cadence of publications to drive reimbursement and adoption going forward. 
In addition to the ExoDx prostate test, we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative Exosome-based diagnostic tests, including our noninvasive kidney transplant rejection assay, ExoTRU kidney As a reminder, initial ExoTRU Kidney data was published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, showing a negative predictive value of 93.3% and a positive predictive value of 86.2%, which we view as best-in-class performance versus the competition. 
We are preparing additional studies for publication on ExoTRU assay performance and remain on track to launch its noninvasive urine-based assay later in our fiscal year. With regards to the products from the legacy surgeon business, we continue to gain market traction with our leading portfolio of genetic and oncology molecular diagnostic products, including our kits for FMR1 and BCR-able. This business is largely U.S.-centric today, and we see significant potential for these products outside the U.S. and have taken initial steps to position the business to penetrate the European markets. 
In addition to the geographic expansion of this business has a fully -- a very full pipeline, including the expected launches of a cystic fibrosis or CFTR kit as well as a hard-to-do panel, which combines carrier screening assays for FMR1 and SMA 102 and CFTR in one user-friendly kit. 
To conclude my opening comments, our fiscal '22 is off to a great start. Our end markets remain strong our portfolio of differentiated proteomic tool of reagents, amylecular diagnostic products are meeting the needs of our customers in growing and underpenetrated markets. Our cell and gene therapy initiatives continue to gain acceptance from biopharma customers and the deepening relationships with these end users are driving adoption of our proteins, media, assays, instrumentation, antibodies and other offerings in our portfolio. 
During our recent Investor Day in New York City, my leadership team and I laid out the vision and strategy to bring Bio-Techne from $1 billion revenue company is today to a target of $2 billion over the next 5 years. Our first quarter in, we are off to a great start in this journey, and I'm excited to share our progress as we realize this vision over the many quarters to come. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jim."

By end market, biopharma remained very strong, growing mid-20%, while academia increased mid-single digits year-over-year. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 71.2% in the quarter, compared to 71.9% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable product mix within the Protein Sciences segment, partially offset by favorable volume leverage. 
Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 25.1% of revenue, a 70 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. While R&D expense in Q4 was 8.3% of revenue, 40 basis points higher than the prior year. While our adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increased sequentially and compared to the prior year, a tight life sciences labor market do not allow us to fill all planned headcount additions to the team at the pace we originally anticipated, expressing the more technical scientific and engineering fields. 
However, our pace of hiring continues to increase, and we plan to make additional progress in our fiscal second quarter. This investment in critical human capital will position the company for growth going forward. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 37.8%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year period. However, excluding the impact of the surgeon acquisition made last April, adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points over the prior year. 
Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q1 was $3.1 million, decreasing $1.1 million compared to the prior year period. Decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt as well as a lower blended interest rate. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q1 stood at $300.2 million. Other adjusted nonoperating income was $1.2 million for the quarter compared to $1.1 million in expense in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. 
For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income includes unrealized gains from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 21%. As a reminder, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we made a strategic equity investment in China-based imminent, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services to the Chinese biopharmaceutical market. 
The $634,000 noncontrolling interest line item reflects the loss from the portion of MS we do not own. The impact to other lines of the P&L as a result of consulting image was immaterial in Q1. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $48.4 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter compared to $66 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of cash payments for payroll, income taxes and other accounts payable. 
In Q1, our net investment in capital expenditures was $6.1 million, and during Q1, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.5 million in dividends. We finished Q1 with 41.2 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q1 in a very strong position with $235.1 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments and a total leverage ratio of well under 1x EBITDA. 
Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q1 reported sales were $197.2 million, with reported revenue increasing 28% compared to the prior year. Organic growth increased 26% with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 2% on revenue growth. Within this segment, the strong growth was very broad-based in nearly all reagent assay and instrument platforms. 
As Chuck mentioned, cell and gene therapy increased over 60%, including growth over 160% in our GMP protein products. While Biologics grew almost 50% in our Simple Western, Simple Plex, proteins and antibodies all grew at least 20%. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 45.7%, an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year due primarily to favorable volume leverage largely offset by strategic investments to support future growth. 
Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q1 reported sales were $61 million with reported revenue increasing 22%. Organic growth for the segment was 6%, with acquisitions contributing 15% and foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. The diagnostics reagents business increased upper single digits and ACD-branded spatial biology portfolio increased mid-single digits. Although spatial biology had a challenging year-over-year comparable this quarter, we review this business unit as being in a high-growth area within life science tools and are extremely well positioned to capitalize on this growth with our multi-omic product portfolio. 
For Exosome Diagnostics, revenue was lower year-over-year, but this was mostly due to cash to accrual revenue recognition accounting change in the prior year for Medicare patients. Timing of companion diagnostics projects with biopharma customers also negatively impacted growth for the quarter. Exosome Diagnostic prostate cancer test volume continues to improve with more patients now going back to see their physicians. 
Test counts increased 20% year-over-year in Q1 and are continuing to ramp as we enter Q2. Moving on to Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 12.2%, the segment's operating margin decreased 510 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects the impact of strategic investments to support future growth as well as the surgeon acquisition. 
In summary, our research-oriented end markets remain strong. And as our Q1 performance indicated, we are executing extremely well in serving these markets. The diagnostics end market is also improving, and we believe will continue to be a tailwind going forward. Our end markets have been on a upward march since the depth of the COVID crisis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2020. 
This means our comps become increasingly more challenging and our growth rates will likely be tempered proportionately in the near term. However, given our strong performance out of the gate in Q1, we have increasing confidence that we can achieve a growth rate in fiscal year 2022 that is greater than our 2-year CAGR at the end of fiscal year 2021. 
As Chuck and I mentioned in our prior commentary, despite progress executing to our hiring plan, there is more to do in order to support our long-term growth plans. We anticipate continued progress in our hiring objectives to put downward pressure on our adjusted operating margin sequentially in the near term before returning to prior year levels by the end of our fiscal Q4. 
That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the line for questions."

You saw the slides in the investor deck talked about the potential domain of customers. We're at a couple of dozen already and we're getting a lot of help from our scaled partners to dramatically increase that. So we're getting more scale from existing customers, and we're getting more customers. So therefore, the lift. We're well over a $20 million run rate, which is really just the beginning, right, Puneet. So kind of we're on track. 
We're ready to start transitioning as much as we can of our orders into the new factory. As you know, we are the largest catalog out there for GMP proteins, but we're only set up for a handful right now in the new factory and in the majority of business is really an under 10 type of product count versus the 50 or so we have in our catalog. 
We still have a lot of capacity back at headquarters. It's just in small lots. So we are ready to go on the bigger lots for a few of the more important products that are being asked for being put in the clinicals, et cetera. And I see the growth rate to be largely consistently with our guidance, and I think it will continue."

That's kind of at the best 2 in FPD. It's a hot area of spatial engine. There's a lot of movement right now. So we'll win, don't worry."

We make the cares for the customer unless it's an open cartridge, which some customers use, especially to start to figure out their assays. So that makes it lumpier by definition. 
We actually had over 50% growth in instruments this quarter. So we are well on track to instrument deployment. And with that kind of pull-through, it's all about getting boxes out there. So we're very bullish. It's just coming off a huge comp from last year is one thing. So we studied all that. We're sitting pretty good. I think -- and a lot of the use are large studies. 
And so some of the instruments -- some of the cartridge orders get very large, and that makes us somewhat lumpy. So we could have a complete turnaround cartridges next quarter and then all of a sudden, we're back to 50%, 60% growth. It didn't really help us much in the instrument front because, as you know, we've been right against the rail of trying to finish out our orders every quarter, and this quarter wasn't much different because the instrument growth was still 50%. 
We're having to build a whole new factory just down the road from head. We'll be done in a year with that. So that's off and running. We did take cartridge manufacturing up last year. And then we've got a couple of hundred a week I think this last quarter of forgiveness, which will hopefully fill back up, but it's still very strong year-on-year.

In terms of supplies, we put the word out early on, and we're not making cars here, right? So it's the supply chain issues aren't that complicated. Our instrumentation, I think we've looked into -- are we going to see a chip shortage or something like that. Well, again, we're making hundreds of a certain instrument per year. It's not thousand. So it's not too big a deal. And these are not million instruments either. 
These are great product tools that are roughly $100,000 to $50,000 in that range. So it's doable. Not to say we won't see a problem next quarter or whatever. I mean if things don't start getting better, the mundane things like labels and paint and chassis and everything else, but we're staying on it.

On the inflationary aspect of it, we're trying to manage that through a combination of productivity as well as selective price increases. So we're not necessarily forecasting any margin pressure as a result of that. You may recall last quarter when I talked about the margin view for this fiscal '22, we said initially that we expected a sequential hit to our margins. 
I think I messaged roughly a percentage point due to the acquisition of the surgeon and roughly a percentage point due to getting caught up in our hiring for strategic growth, and that was going to impact us in the first half of the year. And given that we did make some successes around hiring, we didn't go -- we didn't hire as much as we had planned. 
And therefore, actually, our margin was better than we internally thought it would be for Q1. And we think we will catch up in Q2. So I think the message that I left you with at the end of last quarter is the same in that by the time we get to the end of the first half of this fiscal year, we're expecting our year-over-year margin to be down roughly 2 percentage points. One, 1 point as a result of a surgeon and another point as a result of strategic growth investments, but then that to start to rapidly recover in the second half of the year. 
So by the time we get to the end of Q4, we think we'll be year-over-year pretty comparable."

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. The Bio-Techne team kicked off our fiscal 2022 on a very strong note, as we continue the momentum we experienced during our last fiscal year. Our first quarter 21% organic growth rate reflects broad strength across geographies and ongoing penetration and demand for our proteomic research reagents, diagnostic reagents, analytical tools, and services, especially within our biopharma end market. The standouts in the quarter included our instrument portfolio, namely our Biologics, Simple Western and Simple Plex offerings, broad strength across our research agents and triple-digit growth for our burgeoning GMP protein business.  
Not only were these significant growth drivers for the quarter, but these platforms as well as our spatial biology and molecular diagnostics portfolio remains at the forefront of underpenetrated high-growth markets that position the company for future growth. I'm very proud of the global team's execution and the company is off to a great start as we march forward to the longer-term targets we provided during our recent Investor Day event.  
We delivered this strong Q1 revenue performance with a continued focus on profitability with an adjusted operating margin of 37.8%. During the quarter, we made progress hiring to our growth plan, although the tight labor market remained a constraint to us building the team at our desired pace. We anticipate making continued progress with our hiring plans as fiscal 2022 unfolds, supplementing the commercial and technical teams that will enable execution of our long-term growth plan.  
From a geographic perspective, we experienced robust growth across all geographies, China especially was a standout where the team delivered record organic growth of over 50% in the quarter. The government authorities there are strongly encouraging the development of therapies in the areas of stem cells, organoids, regenerative medicine, and immunology. All areas that have a strong need for our reagents and analytical solutions.  
For the first time this quarter, our business in China annualized at over $100 million in revenue. While this is an important milestone, we believe we remain in the early innings of realizing our potential in this important geography. Turning to our end markets. Demand for our unique high-quality products and solutions continues to be very strong for our biopharma end users with revenue growth increasing approximately 25%. Performance within our academic end markets also remain solid overall, delivering organic growth in the mid-single digits.  
Now let's discuss the performance of our growth platform, starting with the Protein Sciences segment, where we delivered organic growth of 26% in the quarter. We made significant progress with our cell and gene therapy initiatives as growing awareness and demand for our portfolio of workflow solutions led to over 60% organic growth in the quarter. We are nearing completion of the qualification process for initial lots of GMP-grade proteins out of our state-of-the-art GMP protein manufacturing facility in St. Paul, Minnesota, and anticipate commercial orders to be shipped from the facility in the coming weeks.  
As a reminder, GMP proteins are critical ingredients for growing both autologous and allogeneic cell therapies, and we anticipate increasing demand going forward as the rich pipeline of therapies to make their way through the regulatory approval process. Our GMP protein business increased over 160% in the quarter. And with our new GMP manufacturing facility open for business, we are well positioned to meet the anticipated growing demand for these critical reagents.  
Continuing in cell and gene therapy, we added to our portfolio of specialty cell culture products with the launch of Accelerate iPSC expansion medium, a new medium for the expansion and maintenance of induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, for use in both research and translational workflows. The Accelerate iPSC expansion medium builds on Bio-Techne's portfolio of products and services and regenerative medicine and fit seamlessly into our offerings for stem cell workflows, including cell isolation, reprogramming, genome engineering, cell expansion, differentiation, and characterization.  
Importantly, Accelerate iPSC expansion medium is manufactured without using components derived from animals or humans, making it ideally suited for use in translational research to produce iPSC-based cell and gene therapies. This latest offering builds on our growing portfolio of specialty cell culture products addressing customer needs across natural killer or NK T cell and B cell media. The momentum in our core research use only protein and antibody businesses also continues to be very strong with growth in the low 20s in the quarter.  
We believe the continued success in our core is a reflection of our best-in-class development of a new high-quality relevant reagents that address our customers' current research needs while making them increasingly aware of our capabilities through our strategic digital marketing efforts.  
Moving on now to our proteomic analytical tools, where we continue to see strong demand across our portfolio of cost-effective productivity solutions. In Q1, our instruments and related consumable hold-through grew over 30%, reflective of a very strong biopharma environment, our biologics instruments led the way growing nearly 50%. These analytical tools, namely our Maurice instrument enabled a reproducible and quantitative analysis of therapeutic protein identity, purity, homogeneity with ease of use, fast results and reproducibility, all qualities that continue to represent a compelling proposition for new and existing CROs, CDMOs, large pharma accounts. And we are now also seeing adoption in cell and gene therapy quality control applications.  
Demand for our Simple Western instruments also continues to be strong with over 20% growth compared to the prior year. Encouragingly, we are seeing significant lead generation for Abby and sold several of these systems during its first full quarter in the market. As a reminder, Abby is the lower cost fully automated chemiluminescence Western platform that we introduced in April to further penetrate Simple Western technology into our academic customer base.  
Separately, we saw robust adoption, a simple Western within cell and gene therapy market and view this as a significant and largely untapped opportunity for this technology going forward. Our Simple Plex multiplexing immunoassay system, Ella, also had a strong quarter, growing over 20%. This result is especially impressive given the challenging year-over-year comparison where Simple Plex increased more than 75% in the prior year period. We are experiencing a significant uptick in Ella accounts using or evaluating the platform for neurodegenerative applications, specifically for neurofilament light chain or near NFL and neurofilament heavy chain or NFL detection in serum plasma.  
Ella continues to be the platform of choice for customers requiring excellent sensitivity and assay speed. Now let's discuss our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue increased 6% in the quarter. Our spatial biology business, branded ACD, increased mid-single digits in the quarter as continued demand from our biopharma customers, especially CROs was partially offset by lower reorder rates from our academic customers.  
I would note our ACD business, and especially in the academic market, faced a challenging comp in the prior year when the business increased over 30%. Within biopharma, the emergence of gene therapy and RNA interface or RNAi therapeutics was created -- has created a shift toward animal model-based projects, driving larger order sizes and increasing custom probe design projects, making for a little more lumpiness in our spatial biology business.  
Our menu of pros is now approaching 50,000 targets over many species and publications across over 4,500 demonstrating the continued academic interest in the platform. Next, our Diagnostics Reagents business delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of growth, with organic revenue increasing in the upper single digits. Encouragingly, the pandemic-related headwinds that impacted this business in recent quarters are starting to diminish, and we are experiencing a reacceleration in the chemistry, glucose, and hematology controlled product lines.  
The diminishing headwinds combined with new product launches and additional penetration within existing OEM customers, we believe are just at the beginning of accelerated growth in this business. During our Investor Day, we highlighted some organizational changes within our Diagnostics and Genomics segment designed to fully realize across developmental opportunities and synergies within our liquid biopsy and molecular products businesses.  
The new Molecular Diagnostics division is a combination of our Exosome Diagnostics business and the recent Asuragen acquisition and is being led by Matt McManus, the former CEO of the legacy Asuragen business. This new division structure includes an Exosome Center of Excellence as the Exosome-based liquid biopsy innovation engine developing lab-developed tests, companion diagnostics as well as kitted Exosome-based diagnostic products. We will leverage the established research channel as well as our 2 CLIA labs to commercialize these products.  
Our ExoDx prostate cancer test continues to make progress despite ongoing challenges with the urology market. During COVID, patients were not leaving their homes to do annual checkups with senior urologists. This dramatically reduced the volume of PSA test, the primary tool used by urologists to identify the appropriate patients for our ExoDx test for prostate cancer risk analysis and potential biopsy.  
With patients beginning to return to their doctors for routine checkups or follow-ups, the diagnostic market is continuing to recover and encouragingly, our Q1 ExoDx volume was the highest since the onset of the pandemic and continues to show improvement early in Q2. I would also note that our sales reps are increasingly getting in-person meetings and hosting educational and awareness events with the physician community, which we expect to be a strong impetus to test volume going forward.  
We also made progress on the ExoDx reimbursement front during the quarter. We had accounts -- we added contracts with multiple regional payers, expanding both the network of private payers reimbursing for ExoDx and men with covered access to test. We are very excited about the opportunity to present at an overview of the science and publications supporting ExoDx to 600 medical directors and policy decision-makers this week during NAMCP's 2021 Live Fall Managed Care Forum.  
The confirmed audience includes representatives from the largest national and regional payers. Events like this are an excellent opportunity to drive awareness and acceptance and eventually reimbursement of this important test among the private payer community. Our recent publication of a pooled analysis of over 1,200 patients in the journal of prostate cancer in prostatic diseases demonstrated ExoDx's ability to discriminate between high-grade, low-grade and benign prostate cancer.  
Using ExoDx's validated 15.6 cutoff score would have avoided 23% of all prostate biopsies and 30% of unnecessary biopsies with a negative predictive value of 90%. We have a pipeline of additional studies and anticipate a steady cadence of publications to drive reimbursement and adoption going forward.   
In addition to the ExoDx prostate test, we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative Exosome-based diagnostic tests, including our noninvasive kidney transplant rejection assay, ExoTRU kidney. As a reminder, initial ExoTRU Kidney data was published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, showing a negative predictive value of 93.3% and a positive predictive value of 86.2%, which we view as best-in-class performance versus the competition.  
We are preparing additional studies for publication on ExoTRU assay performance and remain on track to launch its noninvasive urine-based assay later in our fiscal year. With regards to the products from the legacy surgeon business, we continue to gain market traction with our leading portfolio of genetic and oncology molecular diagnostic products, including our kits for FMR1 and BCR-ABL. This business is largely U.S.-centric today, and we see significant potential for these products outside the U.S. and have taken initial steps to position the business to penetrate the European markets.  
In addition to the geographic expansion this business has a fully -- a very full pipeline, including the expected launches of a cystic fibrosis or CFTR kit as well as a hard-to-do panel, which combines carrier screening assays for FMR1 and SMA 102 and CFTR in one user-friendly kit.  
To conclude my opening comments, our fiscal '22 is off to a great start. Our end markets remain strong and our portfolio of differentiated proteomic tool of reagents, molecular diagnostic products are meeting the needs of our customers and growing in underpenetrated markets. Our cell and gene therapy initiatives continue to gain acceptance from biopharma customers and the deepening relationships with these end users are driving adoption of our proteins, media, assays, instrumentation, antibodies and other offerings in our portfolio.  
During our recent Investor Day in New York City, my leadership team and I laid out the vision and the strategy to bring Bio-Techne from $1 billion revenue company it is today to a target of $2 billion over the next 5 years. Our first quarter in, we are off to a great start in this journey, and I'm excited to share our progress as we realize this vision over the many quarters to come.  
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jim."
189488,1684879627,2421331,"Bio-Techne Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Bio-Techne Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chuck. I'll provide an overview of our Q1 fiscal 2022 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of the fiscal year. Starting with",1287,"Thanks, Chuck. I'll provide an overview of our Q1 fiscal 2022 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of the fiscal year. Starting with the overall first quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $1.83 versus $1.43 one year ago, an increase of 28% over last year. Foreign exchange positively impacted EPS by $0.07. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.69 compared to $0.83 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS other than from business operations, was unrealized gains on our investment in ChemoCentryx this year compared to an unrealized ChemoCentryx loss in the prior year period.  
Q1 revenue was $257.7 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year on a reported basis and 21% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 1% year-over-year impact and acquisitions had a favorable 4% impact to revenue growth. All geographies had strong growth in Q1 led by China growing over 50% filed by the U.S. and EMEA, both growing over 20% for the quarter. The rest of the world grew in the upper teens.  
By end market, biopharma remained very strong, growing mid-20%, while academia increased mid-single digits year-over-year. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 71.2% in the quarter, compared to 71.9% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable product mix within the Protein Sciences segment, partially offset by favorable volume leverage.  
Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 25.1% of revenue, a 70 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. While R&D expense in Q4 was 8.3% of revenue, 40 basis points higher than the prior year. While our adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increased sequentially and compared to the prior year, a tight life sciences labor market do not allow us to fill all planned headcount additions to the team at the pace we originally anticipated, especially in the more technical, scientific, and engineering fields.  
However, our pace of hiring continues to increase, and we plan to make additional progress in our fiscal second quarter. This investment in critical human capital will position the company for growth going forward. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 37.8%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year period. However, excluding the impact of the Asuragen acquisition made last April, adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points over the prior year.  
Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q1 was $3.1 million, decreasing $1.1 million compared to the prior year period. Decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt as well as a lower blended interest rate. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q1 stood at $300.2 million. Other adjusted nonoperating income was $1.2 million for the quarter compared to $1.1 million in expense in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements.  
For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income includes unrealized gains from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 21%. As a reminder, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we made a strategic equity investment in China-based Eminence, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services to the Chinese bio-pharmaceutical market.  
The $634,000 noncontrolling interest line item reflects the loss from the portion of Eminence we do not own. The impact to other lines of the P&L as a result of consulting image was immaterial in Q1. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $48.4 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter compared to $66 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of cash payments for payroll, income taxes and other accounts payable.  
In Q1, our net investment in capital expenditures was $6.1 million, and during Q1, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.5 million in dividends. We finished Q1 with 41.2 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q1 in a very strong position with $235.1 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments and a total leverage ratio of well under 1x EBITDA.  
Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q1 reported sales were $197.2 million, with reported revenue increasing 28% compared to the prior year. Organic growth increased 26% with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 2% on revenue growth. Within this segment, the strong growth was very broad-based in nearly all reagent assay and instrument platforms.  
As Chuck mentioned, cell and gene therapy increased over 60%, including growth over 160% in our GMP protein products. While Biologics grew almost 50% in our Simple Western, Simple Plex, proteins and antibodies all grew at least 20%. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 45.7%, an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year due primarily to favorable volume leverage largely offset by strategic investments to support future growth.  
Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q1 reported sales were $61 million with reported revenue increasing 22%. Organic growth for the segment was 6%, with acquisitions contributing 15% and foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. The diagnostics reagents business increased upper single digits and ACD-branded spatial biology portfolio increased mid-single digits. Although spatial biology had a challenging year-over-year comparable this quarter, we review this business unit as being in a high-growth area within life science tools and are extremely well positioned to capitalize on this growth with our multi-omic product portfolio.  
For Exosome Diagnostics, revenue was lower year-over-year, but this was mostly due to cash to accrual revenue recognition accounting change in the prior year for Medicare patients. Timing of companion diagnostics projects with biopharma customers also negatively impacted growth for the quarter. Exosome Diagnostic prostate cancer test volume continues to improve with more patients now going back to see their physicians.  
Test counts increased 20% year-over-year in Q1 and are continuing to ramp as we enter Q2. Moving on to Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 12.2%, the segment's operating margin decreased 510 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects the impact of strategic investments to support future growth as well as the Asuragen acquisition.  
In summary, our research-oriented end markets remain strong. And as our Q1 performance indicated, we are executing extremely well in serving these markets. The diagnostics end market is also improving, and we believe will continue to be a tailwind going forward. Our end markets have been on a upward march since the depth of the COVID crisis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2020.  
This means our comps become increasingly more challenging and our growth rates will likely be tempered proportionately in the near term. However, given our strong performance out of the gate in Q1, we have increasing confidence that we can achieve a growth rate in fiscal year 2022 that is greater than our 2-year CAGR at the end of fiscal year 2021.  
As Chuck and I mentioned in our prior commentary, despite progress executing to our hiring plan, there is more to do in order to support our long-term growth plans. We anticipate continued progress in our hiring objectives to put downward pressure on our adjusted operating margin sequentially in the near term before returning to prior year levels by the end of our fiscal Q4.  
That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the line for questions."

And we have been gaining more and more, I guess, customers. 
You saw the slides in the investor deck talk about the potential domain of customers. We got a couple of dozen already and we're getting a lot of help from our partners to dramatically increase that. So we're getting more scale from existing customers, and we're getting more customers. So therefore, the lift. We're well over at $20 million run rate, which is really just the beginning, right, Puneet. So kind of we're on track. 
We're ready to start transitioning as much as we can of our orders into the new factory. As you know, we have the largest catalog out there for GMP proteins, but we're only set up for a handful right now in the new factory and the majority of business is really under 10 type of product count versus the 50 or so we have in our catalog. 
We still have a lot of capacity back at headquarters. It's just in small lots. So we are ready to go on the bigger lots for a few of the more important products that are being asked for, being put in the clinicals, et cetera. And I see the growth rate to be largely consistent with our guidance, and I think it will continue."

So that, combined with -- as you know, we're a couple of hundred people lighting our hiring plan, just like the rest of the world. 
I mean, we added 275 people last quarter, and we lost 240. We're net 35 ahead, which is even better than average out there. So it's been really crazy, especially in the Bay Area -- to the Bay Area. So we are shorter there than most of our other business units. We are also the largest spatial business out there. So we're a target as well, especially for our reps, and we're definitely shorthanded in our reps. 
We've put additional focus on it now, and we're correcting that. But that's -- those are the kind of the 1, 2 and 3 issues of why this was mid-single-digit growth and why it wasn't 15% to 20%. It's -- there's no issue. It's all there. It actually looks better than ever. DNA scope is coming on. We have XPlex coming on. We are working forward with other partnership ideas with automation. 
We're stronger than ever with LICA. We're getting going with Ventana. It's -- the leadership change we made 1 year, 1.5 years ago have done pretty well, and it's more an issue of comps, lumpiness specially in services and probably a handful of sales reps short in some key areas that we need to get refilled, but we'll do that. That's kind of h the bees to F in FPD. It's a hot area of spatial engine. There's a lot of movement right now. So we'll win, don't worry."

Now we have $12,000 of pull-through per instrument on Simple Western, and we have roughly 15 on biologics. It's 50 on Simple Plex, it's huge. This is a closed system. We make the cartridges for the customer unless it's an open cartridge, which some customers use, especially to start to figure out their assays. So that makes it lumpier by definition. 
We actually had over 50% growth in instruments this quarter. So we are well on track to instrument deployment. And with that kind of pull-through, it's all about getting boxes out there. So we're very bullish. It's just coming off a huge comp from last year is one thing. So we studied all that. We're sitting pretty good. I think -- and a lot of the uses are large studies. 
And so some of the instruments -- some of the cartridge orders get very large, and that makes us somewhat lumpy. So we could have a complete turnaround on cartridges next quarter and then all of a sudden, we're back to 50%, 60% growth. It didn't really help us much in the instrument front because, as you know, we've been right against the rail of trying to finish out our orders every quarter, and this quarter wasn't much different because the instrument growth was still 50%. 
We're having to build a whole new factory just down the road from where we are at. We'll be done in a year with that. So that's off and running. We did take cartridge manufacturing up last year. And then we've got a couple of hundred a week I think this last quarter of forgiveness, which will hopefully fill back up, but it's still very strong year-on-year. There's -- so I think all things aside, it's still full steam ahead.

On the inflationary aspect of it, we're trying to manage that through a combination of productivity as well as selective price increases. So we're not necessarily forecasting any margin pressure as a result of that. You may recall last quarter when I talked about the margin view for this fiscal '22, we said initially that we expected a sequential hit to our margins. 
I think I messaged roughly a percentage point due to the acquisition of the Asuragen and roughly a percentage point due to getting caught up in our hiring for strategic growth, and that was going to impact us in the first half of the year. And given that we did make some successes around hiring, we didn't go -- we didn't hire as much as we had planned. 
And therefore, actually, our margin was better than we internally thought it would be for Q1. And we think we will catch up in Q2. So I think the message that I left you with at the end of last quarter is the same in that by the time we get to the end of the first half of this fiscal year, we're expecting our year-over-year margin to be down roughly 2 percentage points. One, 1 point as a result of Asuragen and another point as a result of strategic growth investments, but then that to start to rapidly recover in the second half of the year.

As an example, Wilson Wolf bioreactor is becoming a de facto standard. It's in well over couple of hundred different accounts out there in clinicals. And they're out there putting pressure and talking to their customers about, you know, if you just use the proteins from Bio-Techne, we can actually deliver them already encapsulated ready to be reconstituted in the bioreactor. 
So it takes a bunch of risk and a bunch of cost off the table for you. And their eyes are lighting up. So we're getting that process going. It will take a year or 2, but that's the kind of opportunity we have by being part of scale-ready."

So good for Maravai. They've landed a great -- they've been in the right place at the right time, and they have a great product and they've got CAP technology IP to get around. So mRNA is probably tougher for the rest that's out there than plasmids per se. 
But we're working on all of these. I think in a couple of years, we'll be in all this stuff at some level. It's not rocket science. It is right down our alley. So it's just a matter of investment in going. Now if we were to get large in mRNA to the same kind of vision that we're talking about with proteins, we would need another factory the size we have now. So it would take some investment. But first things first, it's to make sure we have the science right and we get around the IP and we have working product, and then we'll do what we need to do."
